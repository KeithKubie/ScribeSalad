00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.340
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Good afternoon.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.640
And welcome to the most
building in Washington, DC.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.840
I want to thank you for
choosing to be here today,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.550
to learn about some
incredible organizations

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.380
that are supporting
veterans as they transition

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.680
from military service.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.870
I'm Karen Lloyd, a retired Army
aviation colonel and Director

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.880
of the Veterans History Project.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.410
It is an honor to be
here today to moderate

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.360
such an amazing panel.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.390
The Veterans History
Project currently has

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.790
over 108,000 collections
that span from World War I

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.680
to the current conflicts.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.690
We are proud that the majority
of our collections span

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.170
from private to captain where
I would suggest the real

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.040
stories exist.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.580
We need all the stories,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.570
so others will understand
the sacrifice our veterans

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.320
have made.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.530
Some of the veterans in
the VHP collection served

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.830
but never were deployed
overseas.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.530
Many went to war but
never saw combat.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.870
Others saw combat from a
variety of vantage points,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.650
at the tip of the sphere,
on a PT boat, in a cockpit,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.540
or at a headquarters, and others
paid the ultimate sacrifice.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.280
But the veterans we want
to focus on today are those

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.980
who return from service

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.230
with a lasting reminder
of their sacrifice.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.010
These brave men and women gave
their sight, their hearing,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.070
their mobility, and many
other aspects of their lives

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.110
that we take for granted
and returned to a society

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.060
that was not designed
for their new normal.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.610
The VA and other government
services are unable

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.240
to provide everything they
require, so out of necessity,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.120
nonprofit organizations
have emerged

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.380
to make sure these heroes
have the support they need

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.300
to move on with their lives.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.250
Our partner in this event,
Homes for our Troops,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.900
is one of those organizations.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.470
Homes for our Troops builds

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.680
and donates specially
modified houses

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.710
for severely injured veterans

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.230
so that they can live the
lives they did before they were

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.530
injured, taking care
of their family

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.830
and their home with
undue hardship.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.300
Our expert panelists represent
not only homes for our troops

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.980
but several other
organizations dedicated

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.420
to helping injured vets adjust
to a world where accessibility

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.240
and accommodation are all
too often an afterthought,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.720
if it exists at all.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.200
The Elizabeth Dole Foundation,
Hiring Our Heroes, and the VA,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.990
all work tirelessly to ensure
our veterans have the tools

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.320
and resources they need.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.580
Today, we will speak about how
injured veterans and identify

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.670
and access these resources.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.040
Our veterans have sacrificed so
much to keep our country safe.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.210
Helping them live a more normal
life is the absolute least

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.760
that we can do for them.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.620
My goal is that this event
inspires everyone within earshot

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.410
to start thinking about what
they can do for the veterans

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.900
in their community and a call
to action to get involved

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.810
with efforts like the ones
you'll hear about today.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.000
So let's take a minute
to meet our panelists

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.170
and hear a little
bit about them.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.030
First, we have Eric Eversole,
president, Hiring Our Heroes,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.520
a program of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce Foundation.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.820
Eric.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.120
&gt;&gt; Eric Eversole: Thank you.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.740
Eric Eversole, president
of Hiring Our Heroes.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.100
I'm also a currently
serving Navy Reserve officer

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.700
in the JAG Corps.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.040
I have been doing
that for 23 years.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.660
Hiring Our Heroes was and
organization that was created

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.480
by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce back in 2011.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.340
We were seeing a nationwide
crisis of veteran unemployment.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.810
We had tens if not
hundreds of thousands

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.110
of service members coming back,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.350
post 9/11 service members
coming back to a very,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.040
very tough employment situation.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.440
In fact, by 2011, for that
post 9/11 veteran population,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.440
unemployment was over 11
percent, and so the Chamber,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.890
utilizing all of it's state
and local, state Chambers

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.530
of Commerce, starting hosting
hiring events throughout

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.830
the country.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.460
In the first three years, we
did nearly 800 hiring events,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.550
and since that time,
we've done over 1100.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.590
As we've worked to really reduce
veteran unemployment as a whole,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.080
we knew that there were
still significant populations

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.540
of service members and
their family members

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.170
that continued to struggle.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.240
So as the employment rate has
dropped, we've started to look

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.830
at those target populations
transitioning service members,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.460
military spouses,
caregivers, wounded, ill,

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.470
and injured service members to
make sure that we can continue

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.970
to help them find the meaningful
employment opportunities they

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.290
so richly deserve.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.080
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Thank
you very much.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.120
Steve Schwab is the
executive director

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.850
of the Elizabeth
Dole Foundation.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.150
Steve.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.450
&gt;&gt; Steven Schwab:
Thank you, Karen.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.800
It's an honor to be
here this afternoon.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.070
The Elizabeth Dole Foundation
was established in 2010

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.280
out of a really profound
personal experience by my boss,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.740
Senator Elizabeth Dole,
who if you know anything

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.970
about Elizabeth Dole has had an
unbelievable 40-plus-year public

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.270
service record.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.750
But something that a lot
of people don't know is

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.120
that she has tirelessly,
lovingly acted as her husband,

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.290
Bob's veteran caregiver.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.710
At 95, he's doing well
today, better than he was

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.460
at 94 actually, but he's had
his medical ups and downs,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.570
and in 2010, after serving
nearly a year at Walter Reed

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.780
at his side, she came to know
the plight, the stresses,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.940
the anxieties, and the
burdens frankly that a lot

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.650
of caregivers, military spouses,
mother's, fathers, siblings

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.560
and other loved ones
were shouldering to care

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.720
for their wounded warriors
once they leave the hospital.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.260
And so we established
the foundation in 2010.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.090
We started by doing
evidence-based research

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.700
with Rand, and that study
told us that there's five

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.340
and a half million military
and veteran caregivers

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.750
across America, and these folks
are experiencing depression,

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.930
immune deficiency
issues, cardiac issues,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.380
all because of the hours that
they're putting in in addition

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.980
to raising their families,
trying to hold down a job,

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.280
while taking care of
their loved one at home.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.380
Tomorrow is September 11,
and it's been 17 years

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.400
since the longest period of
war in U.S. history started,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.780
and we as a nation are still
learning what it means,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.380
what it truly means to take
care of those who have gone

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.780
to war since that time.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.670
And one of the biggest
phenomenons that we've realized

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.980
as a country is how many of
these veterans need to be cared

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.890
for in their home and how
it's transformed the needs

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.200
of families and caregivers
in the community frankly

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.990
and certainly the VA and how we
need to treat, train, prepare,

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.090
and care for veterans and
their loved ones at home.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.220
And so that's what we focus
on at the Dole Foundation.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.520
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Wow,
thanks Steve.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.950
Next, Brigadier General Tom
Landwermeyer, President and CEO

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.350
of Homes for Our Troops.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.650
Tom.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.950
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer:
Thanks Karen.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.590
So I had the distinct honor and
privilege to serve for 33 years

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:47.430
in our nation's army and served
with distinct pleasure with some

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.990
of the folks inside this room.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.890
And then for almost two
years now have been working

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.100
with Homes for Our Troops.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.080
Our mission, as Karen
actually said pretty well,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.560
so she could almost be
one of our ambassadors,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.070
but we build specially adapted
custom homes across the country,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.220
and then donate them to the
most severely injured post 9/11

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.750
veterans to enable them
to rebuild their lives.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.400
So, our mission, even though
we're a national 501C3,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.690
we really see our mission as the
moral obligation of our country

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.060
to pay back in very
small part a huge debt

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.280
that can never be completely
repaid to the troops

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.980
and their families that
they raise their right hand,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.800
they volunteer, and they
serve very selflessly,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:41.650
and they sacrifice
tremendously for the freedoms

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.400
that we're allowed to
enjoy every single day.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.590
We've built 261 of these
homes in 42 states so far.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.880
The homes themselves are
about, they're on about an acre

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:02.920
of ground, about 2700 square
feet, four bedroom, two bath,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.060
with 40 plus special
adaptations inside.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.250
They're really built
for a two-fold reason.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.940
One, to allow that veteran
to regain some of the freedom

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.110
and independence that they
lost when they were injured,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.460
and also, from the
spouse and caregiver side,

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.780
to reduce the stress and
the burden on our spouses

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.860
and caregivers and let them get

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.060
on with rebuilding
their lives as well.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.300
There's a few things that are
unique to our organization

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.890
when you start looking
at others in our space.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.740
One, the veterans tell us
where they'd like to live.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.730
We go out, find the land,
bounce it off our veterans

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.800
to make sure that's
what they want.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.510
Then we buy it and build them
a home from the ground up.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.110
Second is three years of
financial planning assistance

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.380
that we provide all
of our veterans

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.960
and their families pro
bono to ensure they're set

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.390
up for success as a homeowner.

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.500
And then third, a real extremely
unique one is that we stay

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.300
in touch with our veterans
after we give them the keys.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.230
So we don't just put a
number up on the chalkboard,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.800
we've got another home done.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.100
We stay in touch with them.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.740
One, we want to make
sure that the quality

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.140
of the home is as we promised.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.210
If there's something wrong
with it, we're going to fix it.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.920
Second, we need feedback on
those special adaptations

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.230
that we put into the home
to make sure they're working

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.480
for the veterans
and the families.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.760
Back in Taunton, Massachusetts,
at our headquarters,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.300
we can't tell if they're
the right adaptations,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.350
but the families living in
them day in and day out can.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.040
And then third, really
what's important

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.850
to us is the rebuilding
lives aspect.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.150
We want to know how
they're getting

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.200
on with rebuilding their lives.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.420
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: So
glad you're here today.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.650
Next, we have Sergeant Curry
and his lovely wife, Sam,

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.390
American heroes to the core.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.270
You take my breath away.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.580
I want to thank you for
coming today to be a part.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.880
&gt;&gt; Steven Curry: Thanks Karen.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.440
So I'm Army Sergeant
Steven Curry.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.910
I served five years in the
Army as an infantryman,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.350
deployed to Afghanistan
and Iraq.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.870
My last deployment I was
injured by a roadside bomb,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.260
which resulted in the amputation
of my left leg below the knee.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:18.950
The reason I'm here today is
in 2016 I was provided a home

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:25.990
by Homes for Our Troops, and
it's really helped my well-being

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:31.140
and my family's over the past
almost two and a half years,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.400
just getting back into
a normal way of life

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.460
and rebuilding our
lives and just helped me

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.530
out physically as well.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.470
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Sam,
a few words?

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.770
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: I'm Samantha.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.010
I am the caregiver
spouse of Steven.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.250
I will definitely say
that the last couple

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.530
of years has been amazing

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:56.720
because of the house
that we were given.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.830
It definitely has opened
up lots of doors for myself

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.080
and our girls and even
Steven most recently.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.380
Yeah.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.680
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Great.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.980
Thank you.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.650
And last but not least, Jason
Beardsley, who's an advisor

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.620
to the Veterans Affairs
security.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:13.920
Jason.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.220
&gt;&gt; Jason Beardsley: So
I'm Jason Beardsley.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.320
I spend about 22 years in the
military, both in the Navy

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.880
and the Army and had
the pleasure to serve

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.330
in our special operations
community and see a lot

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.640
of the work that gets done

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.750
on the forward edge
of the battlefield.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.210
I came over to the department
of veterans affairs this summer

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:35.490
to represent our veterans
service organizations and in

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.020
that role represent
them on behalf

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.720
of the secretary of the VA.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.680
And part of that is doing
exactly what I think most

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.040
of you have laid out here in
the panel, and it's humbling

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.850
to be here, one with heroes,
fellow service members.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.890
Thank you, all of you.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:58.230
But also to hear about the way
you're each really servicing the

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.080
veterans past their experience.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.680
And it's one of the
most important things,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.020
and of course that's
what we do in the VA.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.300
We're tasked with taking
that service member

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.630
and closing the loop between
their service and then the rest

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.720
of their career,
their life's career.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.310
And I think somebody
said it best here,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.060
but finding that next mission,

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.910
and sometimes that's very
difficult and very challenging

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:24.090
because of what they've
seen in the battlefield.

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:29.350
So, from hiring to building
homes to being the veteran

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.370
that actually found that
next mission and has turned

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.960
around as a caregiver
to teach others

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.950
and train others is exactly
what the VA supports.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:42.000
We can't do all the work
ourselves, and so we rely

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.500
on our community and
caregivers to help us with that.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.800
Very honored to be here.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.100
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Well, thank
you, Jason, very much,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.660
and thank you all
for being here.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.530
And so now that you've
met the panelists,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.200
let's start the discussion.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.970
So Eric, your organization
focuses

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.000
on veterans transitioning
to the civilian workforce.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.460
What should veterans know
about this transition,

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.500
and what are the resources
available to help equip veterans

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.440
with transferrable skills?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.770
&gt;&gt; Eric Eversole:
That's a great question,

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:11.370
and I think it's a question
that quite honestly has evolved

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.250
since the time we started
doing our back in 2011.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.690
You know, as I mentioned
earlier, in 2011, you know,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.950
veteran unemployment was
such a national crisis.

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.970
We were really doing
triage at that time.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.270
I mean we were just trying
to find jobs for veterans,

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:28.440
get them back into
the workforce.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.210
In many instances, it wasn't
necessarily the right job

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:32.510
or the best job.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.730
It was simply a job so that
they could start, you know,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.790
building that confidence and
finding those opportunities.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.920
But as we've really
started to shift our focus,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.540
we really started to
think about, you know,

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.090
who is that customer
set, who is that veteran

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.500
and military spouse
population that we serve.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.240
And quite honestly, why
is this transition process

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.740
so challenging.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:57.640
And what we found was
a lot of organizations,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.360
and I think for a while
we were included in that,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.570
a lot of organizations took
the field of dreams approach.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.430
You just build it,
and they would come.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.820
And all the problems
would be solved, right.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.380
And we would just them jobs,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.060
and we'd have somebody create
these 80, 90, 120,000 jobs,

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.360
and people would
just flock to them.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.860
And that didn't happen.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.020
It didn't happen because
what we forgot is that a lot

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.360
of our young men
and women who served

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.780
and their family
members are still coming

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.860
from predominantly blue collar,
low and middle income families.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.320
They're not the lowest
10 percent,

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.710
so it's not that they're,
you know, really destitute,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:39.220
but they're good, hardworking
middle class families,

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.930
predominantly coming from
the South and the Midwest,

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:43.500
predominantly, and
the Southwest.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.950
And the reality is, is
that this population,

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:50.820
including their family members,
don't know what they don't know

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.560
about real economic
opportunity in this country.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:58.360
What does the 21st
Century career look like.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.830
And oftentimes, you know,
their perception on industry

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.390
and opportunity was
what they saw on TV.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.800
So if you ask them about
transportation industry,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.080
it's like Smokey and the
bandit, that's their image,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.340
is bar fights and, you know,

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.840
outrunning the law
with bootleg liquor.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.700
You know, manufacturing was
like Laverne and Shirley,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.630
and these industries and
these opportunities don't look

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.990
anything like what they
did 30 or 40 years ago.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.670
Go visit a Toyota manufacturing
facility that is so clean

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.520
and so technologically advanced
you can eat off the floor.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.160
And you start to look at,
you know, transportation and,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.030
you know, what these
opportunities look like.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:43.540
So, one thing I would say
about what we've learned about,

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.170
you know, from the
outside is you really have

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.570
to help these young men and
women who have sacrificed

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:54.300
so much understand what
real economic opportunity,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.250
what the American
dream looks like.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.540
And if they can start to figure
that out, then they can start

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.040
to figure out what are the
skills and the certifications

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.260
that they need so that
they can really grasp ahold

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.360
of those opportunities,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.470
not a year after they
leave military service,

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.430
because that's what we found
a lot of them we're doing.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:15.290
They would, you know, I
mean we did a study on this,

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:18.290
nearly half of them would
spend four more months

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.330
after leaving the
service unemployed.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.630
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Okay, wow.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.930
&gt;&gt; Eric Eversole:
They'd take the first job

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.230
that they could find,
and they would,

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.400
half of them would leave
it within the first year.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.180
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Okay.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.950
&gt;&gt; Eric Eversole: And so we've
really started to focus on,

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.550
you know, understanding,

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.280
creating partnerships
with organizations.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.540
There's a lot of great companies
doing some incredible work,

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:45.240
providing service
members with credentials

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.270
and certifications
before they leave.

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:50.370
Microsoft has this great
software and services academy

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.310
that are providing
I think 90 percent

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.260
of their graduates
are graduating

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.270
and getting jobs paying $90,000
a year within the first year.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.090
We have a corporate
fellowship program

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.240
where we take the active duty
service members right before

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.270
they get out, pair
them with a company.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:09.960
About 90 percent of our
fellows are getting hired

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.000
for about $90,000 a year.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.430
And importantly, they're staying

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.880
in that job for more
than a year.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.080
So, I think overall, you
know, we can't just assume

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.160
that if we just create jobs that
they're going to flock to them.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.460
We have to take the time

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.050
to understand how do we help
train them and help lead them

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.890
so that they can continue
to serve our country

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.950
in a slightly different uniform.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.250
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Yeah.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.550
One of the making sures
of lessons learned.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.730
Thank you for sharing.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.030
&gt;&gt; Eric Eversole: Thanks.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.330
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Steve.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.020
You mentioned the Rand,
the 2014 Rand report,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.650
and what was significant from
my perspective that it said

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.750
that military caregivers are the
best chance a wounded warrior

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.190
has to thrive had recover.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.500
What makes caregivers
so important,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.210
and what is being
done to include them

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.210
in the entire treatment process?

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.250
&gt;&gt; Steven Schwab: Thanks
for that question, Karen.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.970
You know, I'll step
back a little bit

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.610
and suggest a big part of the
work that we've undertaken

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:17.270
as a foundation is to educate
Americans, educate clinicians

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:22.040
and leaders at the VA,
policy makers, and citizens

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.200
across the country that
this population exists,

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.560
that Sam has brothers and
sisters across America

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.890
who are struggling to care for
their wounded warriors at home.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.300
And so the study
that we did pointed

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.790
out an alarming statistic, that
there's millions of these folks

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.090
in every corner of
the country, right.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:42.290
And so we had to bridge a
cultural competency divide,

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.020
which we've been working on
for the last number of years,

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.370
to bring leaders in the VA,
all of our policy makers,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.060
and mayors across the
country up to speed

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.680
that there were another set
of needs beyond the needs

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.970
of the veteran [inaudible]
right.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.870
And so the study said
as well, the headline

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:07.120
that you just highlighted,
which is that statistically

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.500
and scientifically that the most
direct way to improve the health

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.070
of the veteran is by
strengthening training,

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.750
educating an fortifying
that caregiver.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.400
So if Sam is strong
in her beautiful home,

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.260
outfitted for the kinds
of needs that they have

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.050
as a unique family, they're
going to be a stronger family.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:31.350
Right. So, when we finished
analyzing the study,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.030
we learned that one
of the big gaps

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.230
that was happening inside
the system, the VA system,

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.490
was that caregivers were
not being integrated

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.050
into the medical team.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:47.670
And it varied center by
center how the caregivers were

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.170
being integrated.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:54.860
So we started a new program
funded by USAA to train doctors,

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.040
nurses, and social workers on
how to integrate caregivers

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.430
into the medical team.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.650
And so, it's called the
Campaign for Inclusive Care.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.400
We're working across
the VA system right now

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.230
to train clinicians and
social workers primarily how

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.130
for the first time really
to bring those caregivers

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.170
in from day one and how we
make caregivers an active part

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.640
of the care process.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.170
I mentioned earlier that
services and support

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.490
for veterans are largely
moving toward the home.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.480
The VA is moving
really, really quickly

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.720
through an initiative
called Choose Home

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.650
to really shift the paradigm
for care from those institutions

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.630
that are based in every
region across the country

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.370
to remote care in the home.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.100
And so we're working
really closely with the VA

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.960
on developing innovative ways

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.110
that families can receive
those services and support

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:48.920
without even leaving the home,
which allows folks like you guys

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.520
to get care easier without
having to travel, you know,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.810
hundreds of miles, hundreds
of miles to do that.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.110
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Wow,
that's amazing.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.680
You mentioned that your
study had identified a gap,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.220
and that gap was that the
organizations didn't understand

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.530
that across the U.S. there
were all of these caregivers.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:10.010
Are there things that the
Elizabeth Dole Foundation is

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.500
doing to cause those
caregivers to have opportunities

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.870
to learn from each other?

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.170
&gt;&gt; Steven Schwab: Absolutely.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.470
Thanks for that question.

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:19.890
There are essentially nine areas
where there are significant gaps

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.610
in support as a result
of the study

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.440
and folks have probably
heard, you know,

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.470
many of these mental health
support, care and support

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.260
at home, which I just
mentioned, employment

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.560
and workplace support,

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.580
which Eric's organization
really is leading the way

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.920
on and many others.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.730
And so what we've done, and I'd
say the most important effort

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.380
we've undertaken of late is
something called the Hidden

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.060
Heroes Communities Program.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.280
We're working with mayors
and community leaders

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.660
in 120 communities
across the country.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:52.370
We were just in Minneapolis last
week launching their initiative

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.490
to work with those local
leaders and to make assessments

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:00.410
on the ground in communities
like Minneapolis and San Diego,

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:02.580
and these are communities
large and small in every corner

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.030
of the country, to see
what kinds of services

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.670
and support exists
for caregivers.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.230
How we might integrate
caregivers

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.920
into for instance programs
that might be exclusively

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.770
for veterans and then
work with the community

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.440
to teach those organizations
and stakeholders how

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.410
to support the veteran but
also how to support the family.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.950
I think one of the
most important things

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.790
that I've learned as an
organizational leader

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.460
in the veteran space based in
DC is that there's a big divide

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.080
between what happens here inside
the beltway and what happens

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.820
out across America where
people desperately need help

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.120
and support.

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.420
So this program allows us

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.280
to translate all the progress
we're making here in DC

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.040
from a policy and impact
perspective directly

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.540
on the ground in
communities with organizations

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.500
who are making an impact on
that family so that families

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.920
like theirs can benefit
in real time.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.520
And so we're teaching
communities essentially how

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.970
to step back and assess and
care for the needs not just

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.370
of the veterans but of their
caregivers and families as well.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.600
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: I love
that holistic approach.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.090
Thank you.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.390
Tom--

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:08.690
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: Yes, ma'am.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.120
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: There are 3.8
million veterans in the U.S.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.940
with a service-connected
disability.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.050
How does Home for
Our Troops select

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.860
which veterans will
receive new adapted home

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.460
and which veterans
are eligible to apply.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.760
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: That's
an excellent question,

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:24.840
and we get it all the time.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.550
And we don't have
any doctors on staff.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:32.060
So, he has a nonprofit again
located just outside of Boston.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.030
That's not something
we can really get

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.840
into the medical evaluation.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.980
So we really depend on the
government to help us out.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:44.540
So we start, one of our initial
criterion for eligibility

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.950
for our program is actually
veteran must be eligible

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:52.040
for the veteran's administration
specially adapted housing grant.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.240
And it's a program that is
Congressionally appropriated

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.160
as well as the eligibility
requirements are established

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.530
by the Congress.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:06.080
So we're dependent on them to
actually evaluate the veterans

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.730
and determine the ones that
have the most severe injuries,

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.580
and these really fall into the
areas of loss or loss of use

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:21.020
of multiple limbs,
full partial paralysis,

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.530
and other things
along those lines

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.910
that they would then be
eligible for the SAH grant.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.060
Then once they become
eligible for that,

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.390
then they can apply
to our program.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.740
A lot of the veterans that
come to us aren't aware

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.980
of the SAH grant, and it's kind
of a daunting task to apply

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.780
and become eligible for it,

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.040
so we actually have a couple
wonderful ladies on staff

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:48.310
that know the system
extremely well,

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.330
have a wonderful working
relationship with the VA

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:56.310
and SAH program, and they will
walk them through the process

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.160
to where they can
become eligible for it.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.080
And then once the veteran is
eligible, then they come to us

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.440
and get into our
application process.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.740
We have an application.

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:08.530
We also do a couple
other vetting procedures.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:09.910
We do a criminal
background check,

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:12.330
and we also do a
financial health check

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.910
over the last several years.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.110
And because of the financial
planning and assistance

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.800
that I mentioned earlier
that's provided free of charge,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.090
we decide whether we start
that early because some

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.870
of these guys, not
so much Steven here,

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.420
but some of these guys
are extremely young,

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.340
been injured early on their
life, and I don't know

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.920
about the former
[inaudible] of the Army,

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.130
but when I was a
young pup in the Army,

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:41.530
I did not have it all
together on my financial side.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.910
So some of these
younger guys come to us,

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.510
and they've gone down range.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.810
They've been paid
a lot of money.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.360
It hasn't been taxed, and
they come back and do a lot

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.230
of different things with
it, buy a lot of toys

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.770
and different things,
and they're kind

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.070
of upside-down financial.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.810
So we take a look at the
financial health of the veteran

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:59.630
and see whether or not we need
to start this financial planning

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.140
and assistance early or
we can start it later

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.860
when they get their home.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.640
So we go through that, and
then the last thing we do is we

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.880
actually bring them up for
conference in Massachusetts.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.360
I won't say it's the home
of a certain football team

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.640
because all my guys from
the staff will get excited

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.940
about that.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.650
But we have a veterans
conference, normally two to four

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:23.080
of those every year, where
we bring in the new members

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:27.300
to our family and then start
working on finding their land

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.700
and building them a home.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.020
I would say about
the SAH program

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.630
that just last week we had
a tremendous opportunity

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.720
to partner with a couple
of VSOs and the VA as well

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.910
and testified before, it
wasn't the house committee

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.190
on veterans affairs but
one of their subcommittees

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.580
on economic opportunity, on ways
to improve the SAH program as

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.620
and what we brought forward

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.120
as our recommendations
were actually accepted

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.430
by the subcommittee and the
VA as things that work and try

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:04.000
and get better, and we're after
blind veterans being included

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.660
into the SAH grant
program and veterans

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.270
who have lost their hands.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.570
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Wow.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.770
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: Because
there's, the definitions

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:16.060
that they have for it, and the
members were actually asking the

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:18.450
VA rep is that something
that you can do

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.380
and make those changes or do
you need statutory authority,

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.080
and of course, the rep said,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.030
no we got to have Congressional
authority, and they said,

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.560
well we're going
to get it for you.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:31.050
So it was a great opportunity,
but again partnering both

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.120
with the VA and a
couple other VSOs.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.420
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: I
think it's great

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:38.670
that you're using what you're
learning from helping veterans

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.610
to make it even better,
make it a stronger program.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.980
That's great.

00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.990
Your organization has just
published some interesting

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.910
findings about how your
homes empower veterans

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.210
in their recovery.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:52.400
Can you tell us about the impact
that your adapted homes have had

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.960
on the lives of veterans
and their families?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.260
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: Absolutely.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.700
And for everybody that's in the
room, if you look to the seats

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.720
to either side, you've got
a little pamphlet that looks

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.790
like this, and everybody
watching,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.170
we can certainly get them to you

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.130
in the members offices,
just let us know.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:11.130
But I'd just like to hit a
couple things on the impact.

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:13.830
Our tag line is Building
Homes, Rebuilding Lives.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.110
So building homes is really
the one thing that we do,

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.440
but rebuilding lives is
what's really important to us.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.610
The building homes is
part of those numbers

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.360
that I was throwing out,
but those are just outputs.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.540
What we're really after
measuring are the outcomes.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.600
What's really happening to these
veterans and their families

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.410
when they go into these homes?

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.850
What are they accomplishing
afterwards?

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.870
So this document here,
when you take a look at it,

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.470
covers a bunch of those areas.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:44.360
We did a, we've always
had, from our applications,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.220
we've had the going in
information where they sit

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.400
in various areas like employment
and education and finances

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.660
and things like that,
but we didn't have the

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.430
after they've been in
the homes for a while.

00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.080
So this past winter we
devised a survey that went back

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.890
out to our veterans
and the families.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.830
We actually had a 64
percent response rate,

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:08.790
which gives us that, and we
know it's solid, and we looked

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.580
in the areas of, you know,
asked them about their freedom

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.690
and independence and rehabbing
in a safe environment.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:19.260
We asked them about, again,
education, employment, family,

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.660
finances, all those
kinds of things,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.590
and just to give you a couple
of them, over 90 percent

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.890
of our veterans responded

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:28.740
that they have now regained
the freedom and independence

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.550
in these homes that they had
lost with their injuries.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:33.560
So that was really good for us.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:37.650
On the education side,
before moving into our homes,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.360
our veterans either had a
degree, were pursuing a degree,

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.460
or a trade certification,
only 12 percent of them.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.170
After moving into our homes,
that shot up to 69 percent.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.980
On the spouse and
caregiver side,

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.230
we really thought we
were having an impact.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.680
We honestly knew in our gut
that we were having an impact

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.830
on the spouses and
caregivers because most

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.130
of them will tell you the story

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.940
that if they have
injured veterans,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.480
wherever they're living, that
they sometimes don't even want

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.820
to leave the house
because they're worried

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.120
about their veteran falling,

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.570
they got really small
young children falling

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.020
and hurting themselves, the
child, so again, that's stress

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.320
and burden on the caregiver.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.590
Well, on the education
side with the caregivers,

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:19.830
only eight percent
of them had a degree

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.390
or were pursuing
one before moving

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.700
into their homes,
afterwards 90 percent

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.000
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Wow.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.300
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: And
then, on the employment side,

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:31.880
is the only other one I'll point
out for you, and it gets back

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:33.190
to what Eric was talking about,

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:38.280
on the employment side
before moving into our homes

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.470
and then going into
them, our veterans ended

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.340
up with an employment
rate of 67 percent higher

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:45.690
after moving into the homes.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.570
And on the spouse and caregiver
side, it was three times higher

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:51.100
than before they
moved into our homes.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.630
So that's some of the
impacts, but thanks for asking.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:54.930
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: That's huge.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.230
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: It is.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:57.530
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Well now we're

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.830
at where the rubber
meets the road.

00:31:58.830 --> 00:32:01.120
Steve, Sam, the pressure
is on you.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.890
Can you, can you tell us about
how the home that you received

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:10.300
from Home for Our Troops helps
you in your day-to-day life?

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.600
&gt;&gt; Steven Curry: Definitely.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.900
So I'll kind of give
you a little bit

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.200
on background before
Homes for Our Troops.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.230
Like I said, I was
injured in 2006,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:18.250
lost my left leg below the knee.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:22.690
My physical therapy
went pretty well.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.060
My leg was amputated
December 1st.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.880
In January sometime
I started-- oh no.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.640
In March the next year I started
snowboarding, and then that kind

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.950
of became a new thing for me,

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.730
and it got to where
I could run again.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.710
Everything was pretty normal.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.330
So, when we left the hospital,

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:43.310
we moved into a two-story
townhouse,

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:44.980
never really had any
issues with that,

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.560
and after a few years we
decided to buy a house,

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.450
so we bought a two-story
house with a basement.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.780
And that first summer
we were in the house,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.220
I started having issues
with my residual limb.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.770
Just a lot of leg pain.

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.070
I would get sores.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.370
I was wearing my leg for
probably 16 hours a day.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.230
So, it pretty much turned
into every summer I'd spend

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.180
about two months in my
wheelchair in the middle

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.460
of the summer just
letting my leg recuperate.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.730
And it pretty much me out
of the action altogether

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.030
with the family.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.750
I mean I could use my
wheelchair outside of the house

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:21.250
because our house just wasn't
conducive to using a wheelchair,

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.350
so my wheelchair stayed in
the garage or in my vehicle,

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.540
and I could get around work
and the stores pretty well,

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.650
but at home I'd use crutches,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.450
and you can't really do a
whole lot with crutches.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:32.750
Your hands are pretty occupied.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.660
So I wasn't helping
out with the kids.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.020
I wasn't helping out with
laundry or cooking or cleaning.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.970
I pretty much just sat on the
couch, kind of angry with myself

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.270
for two months every year.

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:49.720
And at some point we started
looking for other options.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.790
We found, actually Sam found
Homes for Our Troops and told me

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:57.250
to apply a couple times before
I finally went through with it.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.750
And it's honestly, it's,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:03.690
I couldn't imagine how much
better, you know, it could be.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:06.790
I mean you think about
getting a free house,

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.370
that's pretty awesome
in and of itself.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:17.450
But going from a two-story house
to a one-story house changed,

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.380
it changed things a lot for
me, just not having to go up

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.590
and down those stairs multiple
times every day, I think,

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:28.640
has taken a lot of
physical stress off my leg.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.630
I don't have the issues
I used to have so often.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.910
Anytime I do feel something
popping up, I can just hop

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:38.130
in my wheelchair and get around
the house, which alleviates,

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:43.280
you know, a small issue
turning into a large issue.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:48.300
It's, it's made me also become
a more active participant

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.490
in our family, so I don't get
away with not doing laundry.

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.400
I don't get away
with not doing dishes

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.700
or helping out with the kids.

00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:58.290
I mean there's really nowhere
in the house I can't get to,

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.040
even if I'm in my wheelchair,
including outside the house.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.110
So, you know, even if I'm
stuck in my wheelchair,

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.540
I'm still taking out the trash.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.520
[laughter] So, you know, for me
mentally it's helped out a lot

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.420
because I don't have to
get stuck in a situation

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.720
where I can't participate.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.770
It helps me and Sam out, you
know, because if I'm grumpy,

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:21.220
she's grumpy, and we're,
you know, it's kind of just,

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.650
there's a lot of friction there.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.340
I'm sure our kids saw that.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.750
So that alleviated that, and
then, you know, I won't speak

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.770
for Sam, but I'm sure
it alleviated a lot

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.590
of stress on her part as well.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:33.940
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Okay.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.560
Sam, what are your thoughts?

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.860
How has it helped?

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.820
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: It's been
honestly pretty amazing.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.910
I think one of, there's
two stories that we think

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:46.060
about when we lived in the three
story house with a basement.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.750
One, I remember coming home
one day and he was hopping

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.890
down the stairs with
our infant in his arms

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.690
and should not have
been doing that.

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.710
He eventually scooted
on his bottom,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:58.060
but still, it wasn't safe.

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.760
And living at the other house,
he would always in the middle

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.990
of the night would just
hop and go straight to the,

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:05.650
like to go to the restroom
if he needed to go.

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:07.450
And at the new house,
that doesn't happen.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.310
I mean there's no stairs.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.060
I hear him in the middle of
the night putting his leg on

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:13.360
and like actually walking.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.670
We don't have little
kids anymore, so that's,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.250
he doesn't have to carry
them, even though they still

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.360
like to be carried sometimes.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.630
But if definitely has
relieved a lot of stress.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.180
I feel like we communicate
better because we're not

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.150
so stressed about
anything in regards

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.590
to doing things around
the house.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.500
I feel like he lives
a more free life.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.940
Like, he loves going outside
and working in the yard.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:42.200
We have chickens and a garden,
and he loves doing that,

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.870
so I feel like there's freedom
for him to do that now too.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.660
He'll even go jump on
the trampoline with girls

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.080
and do backflips, which
I think if we still lived

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.230
at the old house in the
summertime that wouldn't happen

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.960
because those probably
five to seven summers

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.890
that it did happen
were very stressful.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.020
He wouldn't play with the
girls just because he couldn't.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.210
It's not like he didn't want to.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.510
He just, he couldn't do it.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.040
And you could tell, like it
was devastating for them,

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.650
and they love how active he is
now even though we're definitely

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.240
not on the younger side anymore.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.510
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: It's so fun
to watch your interaction.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.810
It's so cool.

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:21.110
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: Yeah.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.410
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Steve
mentioned about caregivers,

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:23.710
and you're a caregiver.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.580
Could you expound upon
what that's been like

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.070
and how you've reached out to
other caregivers or they reached

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.650
out to you and if that's made
a difference and if so, how.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:34.950
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: Definitely.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.470
I will say he's made
my job pretty easy

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:39.570
in the caregiver aspect.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.770
Right after the injury,
he was always lighthearted

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:46.780
about the situation, which
I think helped while we were

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.760
at the hospital.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.730
Once leaving the hospital, you
know, things definitely changed,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.230
because I wasn't around, you
know, other wives or spouses

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.760
who were at the hospital
that I could talk

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.210
to on a regular basis.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:03.750
So the first couple years
it was definitely rough.

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:07.110
I didn't really speak to many
wives my age who were going

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.330
through the same thing.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:14.800
And then probably about
seven years ago, I met a lady

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.550
who was kind of a part of an
organization, Hearts of Valor,

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:24.690
for caregivers, and we
connected with a group

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.570
that was in our local area.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:29.100
So we would have like group
meetings once a month,

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.400
which was fantastic.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.500
It was nice to really talk to
others about the situation,

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.260
because they understood, they
knew kind of what I was feeling,

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.540
and they understood that even
though I loved my husband,

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.440
there were things that other
people just wouldn't understand.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:50.210
So that was really nice.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:55.130
And I've been connected with
her for the last seven years.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:57.680
We've been lucky enough
too to find friends

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.970
who were previous military,

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.600
and while their spouse
isn't injured,

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.270
they have that military
connection,

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.840
so I can definitely talk
to them about some things,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:11.720
because I think it's always
good to talk to people who kind

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.530
of understand your background.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.660
But it's also nice to have
friends who still want to learn

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:23.060
and understand the stresses that
we do have on a daily basis,

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.240
because it's not just the leg.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.790
I mean we have memory
issues, so we have, you know,

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.220
a family calendar, that
was an idea given to us

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.550
that we've been able to
use to help with that.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.850
So it's nice to have people

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:37.120
to really just talk
to on that basis.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.420
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Awesome.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.720
Great news.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:44.070
Jason, as an advisor to the
Veterans Affairs secretary,

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.330
you have no doubt observed both
the successes and limitations

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:49.250
of what VA can provide.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.110
Are there some ways outside
organizations can partner

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:55.340
with VA to improve
the care for veterans.

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.640
&gt;&gt; Jason Beardsley: Absolutely.

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.620
Such a good question and
what a humbling answer

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:00.920
to listen to your story.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.690
And then what I'll say,
particularly to that is Steve,

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.920
you mentioned the great work the
Elizabeth Dole Foundation has

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.680
done, and the secretary last
week announced our Center

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:16.960
for Excellence, which based on
family and veteran caregivers,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.460
and this Center of Excellence is
going to allow the VA to study

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:26.560
across it's network and academic
facilities what we're doing

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.760
well, where we need
to strengthen,

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.760
where we've learned lessons
from other organizations.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.060
And so the focus

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.300
of the secretary is now
how do we do this best.

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.150
And it's all because
organizations

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:42.540
like Elizabeth Dole Foundation
have been applying energies

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.580
in that direction
for a long time.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.290
So I'm really glad
to see, number one,

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:49.650
that that's something that
we've announced as recently

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.590
as last week, I think
September 7th.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.690
So, other ways, everybody else
here on the board has kind

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.970
of weighed in, I think
the hiring of troops,

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:00.400
the building of homes.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.980
I'm the Veteran Service
Organization liaison.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:04.280
It's a huge role.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.580
It's a huge role.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.910
It's a huge community,
and what we look for,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:12.290
the VA is the second largest
department in the government,

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:16.240
something like 340 or
50 thousand employees.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.360
We service about 9
million veterans.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.750
As you can see with our
facilities, we have a gap.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.430
I call it kind of
that last mile.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:26.770
I'm a veteran myself,
and when I came home,

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.080
I didn't have any means,
I didn't know anybody,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.840
there was really not the same
need for me to approach the VA.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.710
So, one of the first things
I think people can do is what

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.840
you've done here, Sam,
which is you've got to turn

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.500
to the people you know the
ones that you trust and care

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.950
and be able to kind of kick
them in the gut a little.

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:49.090
I think most of us in the
Army or service members

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.670
that have gone through
some of those experiences,

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.690
we're probably the last
ones to raise our hand

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:54.990
and say, I need a little help.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.290
Am I right?

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.590
&gt;&gt; Steven Curry: Yes, correct.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:41:58.890
&gt;&gt; Jason Beardsley:
So for those people

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.330
who know a veteran who's had
some of these experiences,

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.630
it starts with the community.

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.900
And this is where
the VA really relies

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:10.230
on those service organizations
to know our community members,

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:12.760
our service members, and
know what they're missing

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.790
so that someone can
actually put them in touch

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:17.070
with the right type
of organization

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.140
that can actually
facilitate their benefits.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.620
I think somebody else mentioned
how daunting the task can be

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:25.580
because there are, you know,
three different administrations

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.950
from health to benefits
to national cemetery,

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.910
and they each handle a
number of different things

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:35.750
that a veteran might go
through in their life.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.040
So we have essentially a
large conglomerate of services

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.000
that are very difficult
to navigate

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.900
if you haven't had the
experience with it.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:47.590
And so, we rely on organizations
that have a particular cause

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:50.910
or an interest, such as
Elizabeth Dole Foundation

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.510
with caregivers, and when
they have that interest,

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:56.880
that passion, if you can find
them and link up with them,

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.050
they're typically
subject matter experts.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:03.490
They're hand in hand with us,
creating legislation and policy,

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:05.440
staffing working
groups to ensure

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.100
that the policies
actually are met

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.730
and then executed in the field.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.760
There are so many things
happening in the department

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.790
at any one time that it's
overwhelming to start fresh

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:17.270
and not know where to go.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.990
So you really need someone
that can help you navigate

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.410
or sherpa you through
our institution.

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.350
And that's where the veteran
service organizations couldn't

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.710
be any better.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.580
We have a tremendous
amount of them out there.

00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.450
They're very, there's
a very large population

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.590
of military service
organizations

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:37.750
and veteran service
organizations.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:41.430
We maintain a website that lists
those that we've recognized,

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:44.640
and then there are plenty
that are not yet recognized

00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:47.330
but still doing good
work on a local level.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.240
And so if you can find
those first, you're going

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.680
to find folks that are really
passionate about a cause,

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.570
and once you find those folks,
it's a lot easier for them

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.740
to help you access the
services and systems you need.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.320
Now, in our defense, we're
trying to make that easier,

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.410
but in the second
largest government agency,

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:07.570
that is not an easy thing.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:11.920
This year we've been very happy
with the work that Congress

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.970
and the previous President and
this President have engaged

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.910
in to pass some major
legislation.

00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:22.000
I think Secretary
Wilke has famously said

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.690
that we've had more change now
on the books by statute and law

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.470
than the Veterans
Administration has seen

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.360
since really it's
inception or really

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.710
under Omar Bradley
in World War II.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:38.440
So we're experiencing some very
new things, and the future is,

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.510
I think, very bright for us.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.470
We have to be cautiously
optimistic

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:48.100
because when we do well, we
get a story like you've told,

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.100
but that's a combination,
a joint partnership here,

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:54.920
and when we don't
find those gaps,

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.640
then we have the opposite story,
and we need to mitigate those

00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.940
to the extent possible.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:03.160
So, very much relying
on our partnerships.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.460
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Well,
you've mentioned briefly

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.870
that there's some
pending legislation also

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.530
that there's some
new VA services.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:13.120
Would this be a good
opportunity for you to kind

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.920
of do a quick commercial
for either of those--

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.220
&gt;&gt; Jason Beardsley: Absolutely.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.520
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: For
this audience.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.820
&gt;&gt; Jason Beardsley:
Yeah, I'll try to make it

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.120
as boring as possible.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.500
Not, very excited,
the VA Mission Act

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.020
that just got passed is one
of the most expansive acts.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.680
It's appropriated $5.2 billion.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.930
Part of that too is
expanding on caregivers.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:39.190
So we recently, or legacy
caregivers were only post 9/11,

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:41.500
so we've now rolled that back to
those who have been giving care

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.870
to veterans from the Vietnam
era and the Gulf War era.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:46.920
And it's a recognition
on the VA's part

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.680
that we did have a gap
in the environment.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.790
I think you mentioned,
Steve, that the study

00:45:51.790 --> 00:45:55.140
that Rand did told us
about what's happening

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.910
with our veterans, our
younger population,

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.370
how we're bringing them home,

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.150
and then how we can
actually care for them

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.390
in their homes rather
than facility.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.180
So part of the VA Mission
Act will help close the loop

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.480
on that.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.790
In addition, there are so
many other good parts to it,

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:13.710
but electronic health care
modernization, this is an effort

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:16.620
for the VA to do what I
think is a common sense,

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:21.310
modern technology thing, right,
by allowing the service member

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:24.150
to step into the, you
know, once you swear in,

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:27.360
you have a service record, and
that record will be electronic

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.710
and will carry with you
for the life of you,

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:33.630
including when you leave your
service and enter the arms

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:34.960
of the Department of the VA.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.720
Right now that's a legacy
system we're dealing

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.830
with that has great features
to it, but it was built 20

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.450
and 30 years ago, so we're
now at the phase where we're

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.670
about to initiate
a change in that,

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:51.010
which will hopefully
facilitate a lot more care

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.780
with a lot more speed
if you will now.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.760
The veteran who has his
record, carries it with him,

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.550
and then can share that
out whether it's internal

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.920
to our community or
as importantly now,

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.550
especially with the
VA Mission Act,

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.100
external to our community
care partners.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.540
And that's another
component of the Mission Act,

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:14.040
which is we found that
where the VA does well is

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:15.590
when you get in the door.

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.390
It's when you can't get in that
we have to service our veterans.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.020
So allowing veterans
to choose their care

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.390
in the community has been a
vital piece, and that's going

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.260
to happen with this as well.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.750
Plenty of other stuff, but
in the interest of time,

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.940
I'll leave it there for now.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:33.220
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Wow,
thank you so much.

00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:37.030
I would ask each panelist
if they would care

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.320
to share a one minute
commercial if you will

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.720
of what you want folks to
have gotten from this panel.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.020
So, Eric.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.320
&gt;&gt; Eric Eversole: Thank you.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.620
And I'll keep it at one minute.

00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:50.920
You know, I think we've talked
about this a couple of times,

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.660
and it's certainly something my
organization has really started

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.830
to realize and has been
realizing the last couple years

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:01.000
as we talked about, military
spouses and caregivers,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.330
you know, from our
organization's perspective

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.520
and as we continue to
serve those who serve,

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:11.910
we look at service a little more
expansively than just the person

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.300
who puts on the uniform.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.880
I think if there's a gap between
the civilian military divide,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.630
I think there's a chasm
between what our country knows

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.220
about military spouses and
caregivers and the service

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.920
and the sacrifice
that they made.

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:30.840
As we get into September
11th tomorrow and closer

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.860
to Veterans' Day, you know, I'd
ask those in this room and those

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.020
on the webinar to really
think about military spouses

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.320
and caregivers from the vantage
point that they served too.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.860
They've served and sacrificed
for our country, and as we think

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.510
about how we can meet their
needs, we need to think

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.050
about the entire
family that serves

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.280
around that service member.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.580
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Thank you, Eric.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.880
Steve.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.180
&gt;&gt; Steven Schwab:
I'll just say ditto.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.480
Eric put it really well.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:02.100
I guess I'd remind everybody
in the room and those watching

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.040
that less than one-half
of one percent

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.640
of our country is defending our
freedom in the armed services,

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.640
which means there's
99 percent of us

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.450
who don't really understand
what happens inside

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.960
of military families
and the challenges

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.300
that have been discussed up here

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.140
and that are happening
every day.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.330
And so I'd like to
remind everybody

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:27.350
that our job really is
only just beginning.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.440
The veterans who are
continuing to come home

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.490
from the longest period of war

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:36.880
in U.S. history are bringing
complex needs and issues

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:40.250
to the home front, and they
have a family and community

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:44.480
around them that need to
be embraced and supported.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.250
And it's up to all of us
to ask what we can do.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:53.150
So inside of our
employers and our churches,

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.540
our community organizations
and our neighborhoods,

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:00.950
seek out your military
family neighbors.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.660
They're, Sam and Steven would
probably say they're reluctant

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.410
to ask for help.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:11.690
But if you find them and you
offer, usually they'll take you

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.030
up on it, and sometimes
it's the simple things.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:18.220
We know, for instance, most of
our families just need a break.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.580
Babysitter, cut the lawn,
help with the groceries,

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.020
those sorts of things.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:26.470
But it's really up to each of
us to seek out those neighbors,

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.800
friends, family members, and
see what we can do to help them.

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.100
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: That's awesome.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.640
And that really falls in
line with what we believe

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.190
at the Veterans History Project,
which is listen, really listen

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:39.410
to the veteran in your life and
let them know you are listening.

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:40.710
Tom.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:42.010
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer:
Thanks Karen.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.660
For everybody here
and tuning in,

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.600
the first thing I'd do is
challenge every single person

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:52.000
to just reach out and touch five
people and help with awareness

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.500
on what you heard about today,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.970
the organizations
you heard about.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:58.640
Go ahead and check us all out.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:02.390
And then specifically
for us, we've got 1000

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:09.430
to 1200 more veterans like
Steven and caregivers like Sam

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.260
that still are in need

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:13.580
and really deserve
these kind of homes.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:15.820
So we've got a lot
of work to do.

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.160
The second thing I'd say
for the staffers and members

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.740
that may have tuned in or
will tune in and watch this

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:28.260
over in the coming days, is we
discussed some of those things

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:34.230
with the SEH program,
the grant program,

00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:37.490
that needs some changing
to bring some work,

00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:38.830
we're leaving some
veterans behind

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.270
in that program right now.

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:45.120
So I would ask them to go
back and support the efforts

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.350
of the subcommittee on economic
opportunity as they move forward

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:49.650
with that with the VA.

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:56.570
And then last, I would also
say for both my cohorts here

00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:00.300
in other charities, both
mentioned about, you know,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:03.290
volunteering, helping
out, and you don't have

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:06.410
to wear a uniform to be serving.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:10.000
All charities out there,
all of us need volunteers.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.910
We won't succeed
without our volunteers.

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:16.220
So get online, check us
out, and get out there

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.520
and help these veterans.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.820
Thanks.

00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:20.120
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Well said.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.420
Steve.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:23.980
&gt;&gt; Steven Curry: I'll hit on
a little bit of what Tom said.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:28.650
The road to recovery for service
members like myself really,

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:35.640
is really built on a combination
of organizations like the VA

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.470
and all of the different
veteran service organizations.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:44.520
So, if you know of a
program that the VA offers

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:51.370
or veteran service out there
that could help out a veteran

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:55.510
that you know or in
you family, it really,

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:58.860
it's a really good idea to
given them a push, you know,

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.560
give them a kick in the
rear to go and reach

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.860
out to those organizations.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:04.900
Because like I said before, I
would not have applied to Homes

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:08.220
for Our Troops or I wouldn't
have applied for the SAH grant

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.180
if Sam hadn't have kind of--

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.480
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: Pestered you?

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.500
&gt;&gt; Steven Curry: Yeah, guided
me in that direction multiple,

00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:21.120
you know, over a
long period of time.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.020
And, you know, really
I would have been,

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.610
I would have been missing out,
and I've talked to veterans

00:53:26.610 --> 00:53:31.850
who have that mindset where,
you know, I'll let the guys

00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:36.110
that need it most
access that care,

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:43.280
and while that's an admirable
thing to think and feel,

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.850
you really should leave it up
to the organizations to decide

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:48.250
who needs that care the most.

00:53:48.250 --> 00:53:53.040
And on top of that,
like Tom said, you know,

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.880
look at those veteran service
organizations, do your research,

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.920
and know, you know, who the good
ones are and donate, you know,

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:04.280
your time and your
money and your resources

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:06.900
to help these organizations
out so they can help out,

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.200
you know, guys like myself.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.840
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Thanks Steve.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.790
Sam, thank you for
all that you've done

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:14.460
and your support of Steve.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.240
It's great to hear that you're
behind making a difference.

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:19.540
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: Definitely.

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.840
Thank you.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.140
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: And
your thoughts?

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.440
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: I
would definitely just say

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:28.280
to any caregiver out there
find somebody who can be there

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.490
to support you if you need it.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:34.000
Or maybe if you know a caregiver
and maybe you're not one

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.800
but you know one, always just
ask them how they're doing,

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.100
do they need something.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:40.570
They'll probably be
like me and say no,

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.990
but I think that
they'll understand

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:45.270
that somebody is still there
and someone still cares

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:47.920
and is asking how
they're doing for sure.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.040
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: If somebody
asks you what you needed

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.770
and your tendency is to say no,

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:56.920
what's the one thing they could
do that would brighten your day?

00:54:56.920 --> 00:55:00.000
&gt;&gt; Samantha Curry: I
think really for me is,

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.100
I think just them asking,
even though I say no,

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:07.680
just that they will ask,
initiate and ask a question,

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.640
or even if it's just
asking how are you doing

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:17.260
or how's the family, I think
just asking for me is much more

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.470
than anything than not asking.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:24.190
I think that even goes with
saying like an injured veteran,

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.240
you know, don't just
stare at them.

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:29.980
Most of them will be willing to
talk about it, even if it's just

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.780
like I'm okay, but just ask.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.080
Definitely just always ask.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.270
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: That's really
good advice, thank you.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:36.570
Jason.

00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:37.870
&gt;&gt; Jason Beardsley:
Yeah, thank you.

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:39.190
These have been incredible
comments, and so, you know,

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:42.320
I have to commend the panel.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.740
I think it's been said, and
I'll emphasize it, you know,

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.120
we don't serve as
single members.

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:52.090
We serve as families and
really as communities

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:56.220
because when we put service
members in war or in conflict,

00:55:56.220 --> 00:55:58.540
we do that as a community.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.600
So knowing that, when
the service members leave

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.510
and come back to
reintegrate in society,

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.090
they can only be
reintegrated also

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:09.460
by community, family, and peers.

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:11.460
And it's been said a bunch
of times, but if you're

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.870
out there listening, again, I'll
just say, like Steve, myself,

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:19.950
and the peers that I served
with, those in harm's way,

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.630
they're mission focused and
they're mission oriented,

00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:25.970
and they're typically the
last ones to say, you know,

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.390
pay attention to me
or give me the care.

00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:32.500
So we do rely on our spouses
and those who are our peers

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.250
to kick us in the gut a
little bit and get us moving.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:36.620
So if you know folks like that,

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:40.210
just know there's an
initial resistance.

00:56:40.210 --> 00:56:42.200
But at the other end,
in the community,

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:46.120
are these tremendous
organizations, businesses,

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.710
charities, VSOs, MSOs,
that are ready to support.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:52.780
And right behind that
is your government.

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:55.500
We brought you into service,

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.610
we're going to continue
to care for you.

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.190
Sometimes it's a little
difficult figuring out the path

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:01.870
or navigating that path,

00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:03.710
but that's what we're
all up here for.

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:05.620
You're not there alone.

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.070
So if anybody hears this message
out there and feels that way,

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:11.340
it's time for them to kind
of tap out and say, hey,

00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:14.470
I need a hand, and you've
got plenty of people ready

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.490
to help you, and at the end
of that, the organizations,

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:21.210
the Veterans Affairs
Department, are all here

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:22.650
to support our veterans.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.590
So, make sure if you do know
someone, ask the question,

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.900
and then follow up and
get them into the hands

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.890
of that next level of care.

00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:31.480
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Wow, that
was so really well said.

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.030
I think what the folks that
are here today and also those

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.540
that are listening have
heard about today is

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:41.490
about rebuilding lives and
also that it really is an arc

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:44.350
of a story, and I think we've
heard that there is lots

00:57:44.350 --> 00:57:45.650
of people involved with that.

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:49.330
Everything from the government
to nonprofit organizations

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.580
to the folks that are living the
life, and I want to thank all

00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:55.530
of you for coming today
and being a part of this.

00:57:55.530 --> 00:57:59.740
Right before we end, I'd like
to bring up Patty Calatano

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:02.150
and also Tom, if you would.

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:04.160
They have been kind enough.

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.380
They are going to make a
donation of some veteran stories

00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:12.030
to the Library's
Veterans History Project.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:19.000
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: So, first
off, we got to thank Karen

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.180
and Veteran History Project
and the Library of Congress

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:22.620
for putting this on today.

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:28.090
And also, thank you for your own
personal dedication and service

00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:30.660
to our country over
time and for what you

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.750
and your outfit are doing
every day to keep veterans

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.940
and families in the
forefront of America.

00:58:36.940 --> 00:58:38.240
We really appreciate.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:42.670
So what we've got for you
today are four recordings

00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:46.910
from our [inaudible] veterans
as entries, permanent entries

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.530
into the Veteran History
Project, and we really do hope

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:53.580
in some way they help further
the cause and the mission of,

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.910
you know, educating the American
public on both their services

00:58:56.910 --> 00:59:01.620
and their sacrifice on behalf
of those freedoms that,

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.020
you know, we enjoy every day.

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:05.500
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Well, Tom, on
behalf of a grateful nation--

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.800
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: Thank you.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.100
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: I want to
thank you for that [inaudible].

00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:09.630
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer: Thank you.

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.860

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:13.430

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:14.730
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: You're welcome.

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:17.740
&gt;&gt; Tom Landwermeyer:
Thank you, Karen.

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.380
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: And I
would also like be remiss

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.190
if I didn't thank the staff of
the Veterans History Project,

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:25.360
specifically Andrew Huber
for making a difference

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.910
and the staff from
across the Library

00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:29.830
that made this all possible.

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:32.700
So thank you all so very
much and again, panelists,

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:34.080

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.510
