00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.939
So laws related to online activities

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:08.670
in particular are malicious
online activities.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.130
So, things like theft and extortion.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.500
Of course are illegal
in the physical world.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.620
We talked about data theft.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.650
Someone hacking into your computer,
walking away or siphoning off

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.680
your sensitive data, using that to take
on your identity is identity theft.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.520
Gaining access to your financial
accounts or getting credit cards and

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.810
things like that,
it could even be extortion,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.050
from locking up your computer to
doing a denial of service attack,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.190
saying your website won't
be up unless you pay up.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.805
You would think those kind of criminal
things that happen in the cyber world,

00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:46.084
we should have laws related to those.

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:50.042
And we going to see that
actually is the case in the US.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:53.732
The other set of laws have
to deal with copying and

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:56.850
distribution of digital objects.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.390
So these digital objects are
essentially, your intellectual property.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.040
It could be software.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.070
It could be other kind of content
like music, videos and so on.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.610
And if it's your intellectual property,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.350
we know that in the known distal world
we do have intellectual property.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.340
And we have ways to protect those.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.890
And the way we do that is through
copyrights or patents and trade secrets.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.710
So question is,
do these also apply when it comes to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.280
digital objects that we access and
manipulate in the online world?

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.940
And if there are,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.130
we do need to have these kind of laws,
how exactly do we apply them?

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.800
There's something different
about the online world

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.320
compared to the physical world.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.010
So how exactly, for example, copying
something could be extremely easy.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.580
That may not be the case
in the physical world.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.640
So, if you do have we allow someone
to copyright a digital object or

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.800
protect it.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.890
Well how exactly the law will be applied
is a question that you might have.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.260
The other thing that, we actually not
going to talk a great deal about it,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.840
is the idea of privacy.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.370
We do all of things online.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.240
So our activities online
what exactly we do,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.410
what websites we visit, what services
we access, what do we search for.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.740
It's very easy to collect all the kind
of information about these activities.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.050
These are my activities and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.980
somebody else can collect
information about what I do.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.770
Are there any laws that protect me, in
terms of what kind of information could

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.900
be controlled, how could it be used?

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.430
There are actually, I said we'll get
through some of these, but not all.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.900
But the idea of privacy here is that
the internet allows, it makes it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.780
possible at a scale of magnitude
that we have never seen before.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.120
So, the idea of Big Brother for example,
somebody knowing everything that you do,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.910
is there something in the laws
to protect me from that?
