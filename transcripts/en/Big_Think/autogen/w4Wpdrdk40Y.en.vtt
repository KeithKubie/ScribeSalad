in which all nuclear weapons would be
 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.830
in which all nuclear weapons would be
used and maybe everyone would have been

killed mercifully that's the likelihood

killed mercifully that's the likelihood
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.140
killed mercifully that's the likelihood
of that is declined dramatically with

Osama bin Laden and exploding in one of
our cities has increased and I'd say the

our cities has increased and I'd say the
 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.750
our cities has increased and I'd say the
likelihood of that over the past decade

likelihood of that over the past decade
