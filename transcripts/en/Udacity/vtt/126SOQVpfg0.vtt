&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This one we can see that it passes through our 2x intercepts and the rest of

00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:08.990
the points on the line satisfy the equation. We just need to pick one other

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.238
point and test it out to make sure that it works since three points is the

00:00:13.238 --> 00:00:17.076
smallest number that you need to uniquely define any parabola.
