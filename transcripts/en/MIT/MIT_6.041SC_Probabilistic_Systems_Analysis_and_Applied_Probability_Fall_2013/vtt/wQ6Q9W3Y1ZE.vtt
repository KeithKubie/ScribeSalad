00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.390
 

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.170
Hi.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.250
In this problem, we'll get some
practice working with

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.000
PDFs and also using PDFs
to calculate CDFs.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.170
So the PDF that we're given
in this problem is here.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.390
So we have a random variable,
z, which is a continuous

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:14.250
random variable.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.550
And we're told that the PDF of
this random variable, z, is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.790
given by gamma times 1 plus z
squared in the range of z

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.480
between negative 2 and 1.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.520
And outside of this
range, it's 0.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.850
All right, so first thing we
need to do and the first part

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.420
of this problem is we need to
figure out what gamma is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.250
because it's not really a
fully specified PDF yet.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490
We need to figure out exactly
what the value gamma is.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.620
And how do we do that?

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.670
Well, we've done analogous
things before for

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.360
the discrete case.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
So the tool that we use
is that the PDF must

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.130
integrate to 1.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.240
So in the discrete case, the
analogy was that the PMF had

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.140
to sum to 1.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.150
So what do we know?

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.380
We know that when you integrate
this PDF from

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.330
negative infinity to infinity,
fz of z, it has to equal 1.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.050
All right, so what
do we do now?

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.300
Well, we know what
the PDF is--

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.880
partially, except for gamma--
so let's plug that in.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.150
And the first thing that we'll
do is we'll simplify this

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.440
because we know that the PDF is
actually only non-zero in

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.580
the range negative 2 to 1.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.900
So instead of integrating from
negative infinity to infinity,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.580
we'll just integrate from
negative 2 to 1.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.190
And now let's plug in
this gamma times 1

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.380
plus z squared dc.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.610
And now the rest of the problem
is just applying

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.350
calculus and integrating this.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.480
So let's just go through
that process.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.720
So we get z plus 1/3 z cubed
from minus 2 to 1.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.340
And now we'll plug
in the limits.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.280
And we get gamma, and that's 1
plus 1/3 minus minus 2 plus

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.816
1/3 times minus 2 cubed.

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:08.470
 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.980
And then if we add this all up,
you get 4/3 plus 2 plus

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.130
8/3, which will give you 6.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.280
So what we end up with
in the end is that 1

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.690
is equal to 6 gamma.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.640
So what does that tell us?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
That tells us that, in this
case, gamma is 1/6.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.030
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.420
OK, so we've actually figured
out what this PDF really is.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.870
And let's just substitute
that in.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.610
So we know what gamma is.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.970
So it's 1/6.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.190
So from this PDF, we can
calculate anything

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.430
that we want to.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.930
This PDF, basically, fully
specifies everything that we

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.420
need to know about this
random variable, z.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.980
And one of the things that
we can calculate from

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.520
the PDF is the CDF.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.830
So the next part of the
problem asks us to

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.460
calculate the CDF.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.350
So remember the CDF, we use
capital F. And the definition

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.630
is that you integrate from
negative infinity to this z.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.650
And what do you integrate?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.120
You integrate the PDF.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.580
And all use some dummy variable,
y, here in the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.420
integration.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.510
So what is it really doing?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.130
It's basically just taking the
PDF and taking everything to

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.650
the left of it.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.920
So another way to think about
this-- this is the probability

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.290
that the random variable
is less than or equal

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.620
to some little z.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.020
It's just accumulating
probability as you go from

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.270
left to right.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.580
 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.120
So the hardest part about
calculating the CDFs, really,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.710
is actually just keeping track
of the ranges, because unless

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.340
the PDF is really simple, you'll
have cases where the

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.820
PDF cold be 0 in some ranges and
non-zero in other ranges.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.710
And then what you really have
to keep track of is where

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.800
those ranges are and where you
actually have non-zero

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.040
probability.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.120
So in this case, we actually
break things down into three

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.370
different ranges because
this PDF actually looks

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.600
something like this.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:31.060
So it's non-zero between
negative 2 and 1, and it's 0

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.250
everywhere else.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.700
So then what that means is
that our job is a little

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.070
simpler because everything to
the left of negative 2, the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.510
CDF will be 0 because there's
no probability

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.190
density to the left.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.710
And then everything to the
right of 1, well we've

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.780
accumulated all the probability
in the PDF because

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.640
we know that when you integrate
from negative 2 to

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.060
1, you capture everything.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.510
So anything to the right of
1, the CDF will be 1.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.370
So the only hard part is
calculating what the CDF is in

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.390
this intermediate range, between
negative 2 and 1.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.300
So let's do that case first--

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.910
so the case of z is between
negative 2 and 1.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.850
 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.980
So what is the CDF
in that case?

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.690
Well, the definition is to
integrate from negative

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.190
infinity to z.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.610
But we know that everything
to the left of negative 2,

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.010
there's no probably density.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.550
So we don't need to
include that.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.340
So we can actually change this
lower limit to negative 2.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.500
And the upper limit is
wherever this z is.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.410
So that becomes our integral.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.560
And the inside is
still the PDF.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.550
So let's just plug that in.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.680
We know that it's 1/6 1 plus--

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.620
we'll make this y squared--

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.130
by.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.910
And now it's just
calculus again.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.800
And in fact, it's more or less
the same integral, so what we

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:22.370
get is y plus 1/3 y cubed
from negative 2 to z.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.760
Notice the only thing that's
different here is that we're

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.180
integrating from negative 2 to
z instead of negative 2 to 1.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:37.360
And when we calculate this out,
what we get is z plus 1/3

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:48.520
z cubed minus minus 2 plus 1/3
minus 2 cubed, which gives us

00:06:48.520 --> 00:07:01.976
1/6 z plus 1/3 z cubed plus plus
2 plus 8/3 gives us 14/3.

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:06.470
 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.730
So that actually is our CDF
between the range of

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.660
negative 2 to 1.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.450
So for full completeness, let's
actually write out the

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.950
entire CDF, because there's two
other parts in the CDF.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.380
So the first part is that
it's 0 if z is less

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.530
than negative 2.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.850
And it's 1 if z is
greater than 1.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.190
And in between, it's this
thing that we've just

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:37.340
calculated.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:55.240
So it's 1/6 z plus 1/3 z cubed
plus 14/3 if z is between

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.410
minus 2 and 1.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.650
So that is our final answer.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.170
 

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:07.400
So the main point of this
problem was to drill a little

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.400
bit more the concepts
of PDFs and CDFs.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.320
So for the PDF, the important
thing to remember is that in

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.970
order to be a valid PDF, the
PDF has to integrate to 1.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.790
And you can use that fact to
help you calculate any unknown

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.450
constants in the PDF.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.980
And then to calculate the CDF,
it's just integrating the PDF

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.490
from negative infinity to
whatever point that you want

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.290
to cut off at.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.270
And the tricky part, as I said
earlier, was really just

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.230
keeping track of the ranges.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.159
In this case, we've broke it
down into three ranges.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.120
If we had a slightly more
complicated PDF, then you

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.710
would have to keep track
of even more ranged.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.429
All right, so I hope that
was helpful, and we'll

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:43.679
see you next time.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:44.579
