00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.420
When advertising began in a significant way in the [early] 19th century

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.429
It was a relatively straightforward business. It showed you a product told you what it did where you could get it and what it cost

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.799
Then in 1960s America a remarkable new way of advertising emerged

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.550
Led by Luminaries of Madison Avenue Like William Bernbach

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.849
David ogilvy and Mary Wells lawrence in their work for brands like Soa vests and life cereal

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.589
Adverts cease to be in a narrow sense about the things that they were selling

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.279
The focus of an ad might ostensibly be on a car

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.759
But our attention was also being directed at the harmonious handsome couple holding hands beside it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.639
It might unsurfaced be in adverted out soap

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.409
But the true emphasis was on the state of calm that accompanied the washing

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.229
It might be whiskey one was being invited to drink

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.590
But it was the attitude of resoluteness and resilience on display that provided the compelling focal point

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.209
Madison Avenue had made an extraordinary discovery however appealing a product might be there were many other things

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.420
That were likely to be even more appealing to customers and by in twining their products with these ingredients

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.119
Sales could be transformed

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.078
[Patek] [Phillipe] is one of the giants of the global watchmaking industry

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.650
Since 1996 they've been running a very distinctive series of adverts featuring parents and children

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.849
It's almost impossible not to have glimpse one somewhere in one example a father and son are hanging out together in scenes

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.390
Which tenderly evoke filial and paternal loyalty in love we can imagine the boy will grow up confident and independent

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.629
It also respectful and warm the advert understands our deepest hopes around our children

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.860
It's moving because what it depicts is so hard to find in real life

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.250
We're often brought to tears not so much by what we have as by what we long [for] but cannot reach

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.898
Father-son relationships are dependably problematic, but in the world of patek phillipe

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.449
We glimpse a kind of psychological?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.940
Paradise we can turn to Calvin Klein the couple seemed like they might have been together a while

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.970
They may have a couple of children, and they're in it [for] the long term [the] perfume is called eternity

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.999
But their passion is still so intense they have sex. Maybe a couple of times a day often in unusual locations

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.830
Calvin Klein knows all about what we really want in relationships

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.040
It's brilliantly latched on to our deepest and at the same time our most elusive [in] a long house

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.959
Adverts wouldn't work

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.159
If they didn't operate with a very good understanding of what [our] real needs are

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.789
What we truly require to be happy their emotional pull is based on knowingness [eerily]

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.980
Well as they recognize we are creatures who hunger for good family relationships

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.110
Connections with others a sense of freedom and joy a promise of self-development

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.840
Dignity calm and the feeling that we're respected yet armed with this knowledge

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.420
They and the Corporation's who bankroll them are unwittingly somewhat cruel to us

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.350
For while they excite us with reminders of our buried longings. They cannot do anything wholehearted about quenching them

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.739
Adverts may want to sell us things but incommensurate things in relation to the hopes they've aroused

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.999
Calvin Klein makes lovely Cologne Patek Phillipe swatches are extremely reliable in beautiful agents of timekeeping

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.358
But these items cannot by themselves help us secure. The goods are unconscious believed were on offer

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.410
the real crisis of capitalism is the product development lags so far behind the best insights of

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.839
advertising since the [1960's]

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.219
Advertising has worked out just how much we need help with the true challenges of life

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.339
Its fathomed how deeply we want to have better careers

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:00.599
stronger relationships greater confidence in most adverts the pain and the hope of our lives have been superbly

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.880
Identified but the products are almost comically at odds with the problems at hand

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.799
Advertisers are hardly to blame. They are in fact the victims of an extraordinary oblem of Modern capitalism

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.459
While we have so many complex needs we have nothing better to offer ourselves in the face of our troubles

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.250
Then perhaps a slightly more accurate chronometer or a more subtly blended perfume

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.110
business needs to get more ambitious in the creation of new kinds of

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.380
Products in their own way as [strange-sounding] today as a wristwatch would have struck observers in 1500

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.999
We need the drive of commerce to get behind filling the world in our lives with goods that really can help us to thrive

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.779
Flourish find contentment and manage our relationships well to trace the future shape of capitalism

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.790
We only have to think of all the needs we [have] that currently lie outside [of] [commerce]

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.510
We need help in forming cohesive interesting benevolent communities. We need help in bringing up children

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.270
We need help in calming down at Key moments

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.309
We require immense assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
[our] higher needs are not

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.020
Trivial or minor once

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.180
Insignificant things we could easily survive without they are in many ways central to our lives

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:28.070
We've simply accepted without adequate protest that there is nothing business could sell us to address them we don't know today quite

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.609
What the businesses of the [future] will look like just as half a century ago?

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:38.419
No one could describe the corporate essence of the current large technology companies, but [we] can know the direction

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:45.109
We need to head [to] one where the drive and inventiveness of capitalism tackles the higher deeper problems of life

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.489
Advertising has at least done as the great service at hinting at the future shape of the economy it already

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.620
Trades on all the right ingredients

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:02.630
The challenge now is to narrow the Gap between the fantasies being offered and what businesses should be able to sell us

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.950
