00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 in this capsule we will see the shape 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.859
 conjunctive normal then the form 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.740
 normal conjunctive it's the third 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:18.050
 tempting ingredient of need for finally 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.820
 to make proof by resolution so 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.400
 what we've seen so far with 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 substitutions unification this is 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 that often only manipulated 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.730
 1 predicts that the negation of a loan from 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 body we can have clauses or in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.590
 what we had was 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.750
 predica disjunctions so to help or 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.360
 but never did heroes have 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 for any institute then is the interest 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 of the normal connective form this is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.579
 to take several formulas 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.350
 in a knowledge base on the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.289
 logical form of first order and of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.079
 convert it all into a syntax that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.379
 will only involve as of this Tuesday or 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.510
 negation nougats that will have no 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.239
 existential quantification or or 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 universal and that's going to allow us 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 to use a notion that we saw up 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.260
 now 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.479
 combine all of this together to make the 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.740
 proof by resolution 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.670
 so rather than giving a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 definition of the normal form 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 situation I am going directly to you 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.159
 list the nine steps to follow 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 to take a set of formula so 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 but I realize that we are a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.320
 set of formula in the form of a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.229
 first-rate check threatened according to its 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.509
 syntax and convert it into its form 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.820
 normal when nice where are we going to have to 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.439
 end actually the bristles of liberals or 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.350
 clauses then the first step 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.840
 it's to eliminate the implication so we 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.990
 is going to say the equivalent scalf implies beta 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.869
 is equivalent the negation of alpha or 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.200
 beta to take all the arrows 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.829
 all the implications convert them 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.240
 in a form or yahoo instead it's 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.560
 there we would do that for the whole 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 all for in the knowledge base 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.659
 for all of the formulas that are 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.569
 find one would apply this equivalence 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.099
 the second step we will reduce the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.850
 scope of the negation will use this 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.460
 which we call the laws of 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.590
 game to know that if I do the negation 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:23.500
 of a formula that is the disjunction of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.180
 close to the body for example brake or f2 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.760
 but it's actually they're worth it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.790
 negation of f1 is the negation of f2 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.750
 same thing if I negate a 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:38.680
 conjunction is actually the negation of 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.280
 each one each of the predicates f1 f2 but 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:45.400
 that I combine with champion so 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.870
 of a or and allegations a double 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.880
 negation cancel each other out so that one 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.910
 gets our formula is favorite did 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:58.150
 so that's how we do it so 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.190
 that there is a negation that a negation 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.600
 always be followed by a predicted rating 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.660
 in my list of formulas then of oneself 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.980
 I'm going to standardize the variables so 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.500
 I'm going to rename the tea variables into 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.620
 so that no pair of quantifies 14 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 who use the same variable so on 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.120
 each of my lines in my base 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.400
 knowledge each of the forms I 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.500
 make sure they use all of them 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.500
 variable names that are different 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.360
 then I'll illuminate the 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.000
 quantifies existential catr so for 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.190
 make its effect we will replace the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.190
 variable associated with a quantification 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.080
 existential by a function the 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.030
 function believe as arguments the 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.790
 variables that are involved in the 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.360
 antilles made universal catr who 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.690
 the angle so if we have for all x for 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.970
 all the greeks there are aids p2 x 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.040
 yz 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:03.880
 we will replace his share for all x for 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:07.090
 all y pi2 xy f2 xy so we replaced z 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.600
 by eve 2 xy is we eliminated we have 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.770
 removed 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.320
 there are two helpers so we replaced 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.620
 z by a function f that has as 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.460
 arguments the variables that encompassed 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.419
 my quantifies existential catr 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.590
 electrified the two variables 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.320
 it was x and y 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.669
 the functions we will generate like that 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.380
 when we go to mines and 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.410
 existential caricatures we are going to 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.460
 call functions this pass m so f 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.970
 in just here it's a function of this 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.210
 we love and it's important the symbol 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.190
 of the function must be unique to this 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.470
 formula to this line in my database 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.150
 pod donwer knowledge in too much if 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.150
 I use did once for a 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.500
 when I eliminate a hymn reached 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.270
 existential but I must have been able to use it 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.620
 when I'm going to lead others quantifies 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.430
 four extensions in my database 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.690
 knowledge and finally if no 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.570
 no argument that is to say that no 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.130
 universal caricature encompassing i'm going 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.400
 just use a constant so he 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.440
 exists x such that q 2 x but I 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.360
 would replace his part outside so 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.860
 I would eliminate x and then I replaced 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.590
 raul would be a constant 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.930
 so in fact to be all there I will have to 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.660
 use capital letters if I want 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.820
 continue to use the the notation of the 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.590
 team until now the standard that 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.690
 I use and then at this would be a 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.400
 constant that would have not been defined which 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.180
 would not be used elsewhere in my 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.190
 knowledge base then from his 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.690
 fifth step get in shape we 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.490
 calls forms take ex to say that 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.830
 all quantifies universal catr I 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.349
 will put them at the top of my formulas 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:52.490
 so if I had alpha implies for all 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:55.660
 x beta so in fact I would have more 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.960
 of involvement so at the beach had 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:02.000
 negation of alpha or for all x ben 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.200
 you got I'll take the x button and then I 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.210
 would put at the beginning of my formula then 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.139
 I will make the distribution of 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.490
 disjunctions in the conjunctions so 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.060
 we want to actually put everything under a 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.950
 form of conjunction of disjunction in 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:30.229
 using the equivalence that f1 or f2 and 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:32.659
 f3 is who goes the f1 or f2 and f1 or f3 

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:35.020
 so because if we do have a 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:43.419
 form of a conjunction of 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:45.310
 of dijon ctions those of that we go 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.379
 eliminate caricature symbols 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.409
 universal so what we do is that 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:53.259
 if they for all x game just to remove the 

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:57.729
 for simply because we're going 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:58.569
 eliminate the conjunctions so the in 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.550
 do what we're going to do 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:08.979
 generate separate clots if we had 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:13.780
 paid 2 x and q2 x ben would generate two 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:14.919
 separate lines p 2 x and q2 x whose 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.080
 I will have two separate lines in my 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.909
 knowledge base and then his 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.800
 standard 10 and variables 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:22.300
 so we will rename again the 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.620
 variables of person who does not have two 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.190
 different clauses that they themselves 

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.139
 variables 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.830
 so we could have done that 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:32.020
 before but the goal we took from 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:34.270
 conjunctions and that one does not generally leave 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.090
 of that clauses separate one could 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.560
 to have as in the case here two clauses 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.270
 different with the same variable then 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.669
 there we would use long periods 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:47.919
 separate one could add one here and then 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:50.050
 1-2 here pay then that's the nine 

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:53.409
 steps to convert to normal form 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:55.960
 when nice we'll look at an example 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:58.029
 now we will apply the set of 

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.870
 these rules there we take the example of 

00:07:58.029 --> 00:08:04.180
 Rome where we had all the formulas 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:06.490
 following due form of logic first 

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:10.169
 rank and there we will convert them under the 

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.169
 normal connective form 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:17.990
 so we will start by eliminating 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:20.240
 the implication then here for the first 

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.430
 to formulate plication we have no here no 

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.910
 more here we are here what we will do 

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:28.250
 is that we will take the negation of the 

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:31.570
 left part of application and we see 

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:37.070
 the unirs with the right part with a 

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:39.950
 disjunction 1 or if we have none on our 

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:43.310
 apples here we have so we'll take the 

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:47.480
 negation of Roman or and we will take 

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:49.880
 then we go there we will unify it 

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.960
 so Pauline fillon to the combines and seen 

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.130
 that it's also a junction does not have 

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.130
 need parentheses 

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.510
 another application here so we're going 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:05.720
 take negation of people x and 

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:08.060
 Greek leaders and murdered xy and so 

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.670
 we will take the negation of his for 

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:15.460
 combine with a disjunction at the 

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:19.490
 right part to know non loyal ex y 

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:24.650
 are we doing here I notice that of 

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:27.280
 parental therefore honor the negation of 

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:31.870
 people x and Greek leaders and 

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:35.120
 murdered ex there are parenthesis or 

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.130
 disloyal denial xy because of the priority 

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:43.160
 operations mark negation 

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:44.839
 applies only to the parenthesis is 

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.220
 finally murdered 

00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:49.510
 marcus 16 hours ago there is no 

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.510
 of docu implications nothing to do 

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.320
 second step reduces the scope of the 

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.570
 negation not negation also for 

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.510
 negation also if the door is already 

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:03.260
 reduced no negation here the negation 

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:06.190
 also born here we use but its scope 

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:09.800
 already reduced to a single co-op president 

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.780
 here by cons we could incorporate 

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.080
 the negation in the parenthesis so we 

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.170
 gets the negation of people x or the 

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:21.370
 negation leaders y or negation of 

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:24.329
 assassinated ex y are key we notice the 

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:26.040
 sounds were converted to 10 or not 

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:29.939
 that we insert the negation in the part in 

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:34.679
 head then murdered so the eighth 

00:10:29.939 --> 00:10:36.569
 formula does not change my stage to 10 the 

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:38.129
 variables then whenever a 

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:41.549
 barrier used a symbol 

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:45.829
 different parties x1 for the variable the 

00:10:41.549 --> 00:10:50.670
 third formula dubbed x 2 for 

00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:52.259
 ex here then ex 3 to make it a way 

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:58.709
 simple to get variables that are 

00:10:52.259 --> 00:11:02.040
 different yes we have two ex 3 6x of 

00:10:58.709 --> 00:11:03.540
 the 6th formula will become ex 4x of the 

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.389
 seventh fortune will become excellent 

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:11.759
 then will become hexis the partnership 

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:13.379
 for the 8th then we go 

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:16.290
 eliminate the quantifies catr 

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:17.600
 existential so if we do not have one in 

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.519
 not here 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:25.259
 here we do not have any here 

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:27.179
 we have here so exists ex 3 and we will 

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:29.369
 replace x3 with a function of 

00:11:27.179 --> 00:11:31.559
 stick apply me an argument to 

00:11:29.369 --> 00:11:33.809
 the argument x2 so we introduced the 

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:35.489
 college function f1 we say a little 

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:37.350
 as the variants use f then a 

00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:38.819
 figure for a town hall all of 

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.699
 functions of lucie college we will have 

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:44.869
 only 1 anyway so extracted 

00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:47.910
 is replaced by and charges applied to x2 

00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:53.369
 and at this second we have no other 

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:55.619
 when there is so much existential we go 

00:11:53.369 --> 00:11:57.569
 would have to put the formulas under a 

00:11:55.619 --> 00:12:00.689
 false pretense but in this case too 

00:11:57.569 --> 00:12:04.829
 there is no one for all who is squeezed by 

00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:05.939
 example have one for all here and then everything 

00:12:04.829 --> 00:12:08.279
 what we would have done what we brought back 

00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:13.019
 the port at the very beginning of the form 

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:15.360
 in that if in fact we do not have one we will 

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:18.119
 distribute the e10 junction in the 

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.949
 conjunctions but again here we 

00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:22.980
 did not do that, that is to say we had 

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:26.549
 already in a form where we only have 

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:29.639
 so we are always if we actually 

00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:32.970
 conjunctions is conjunctions 

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:35.500
 of disjunction so because it's in 

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.420
 do we have 

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:42.280
 no conjunctions so we have nothing to 

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:44.170
 do step 7 eliminate the quantifies 14 

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.030
 universal it's super simple we do 

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:48.130
 just remove them for all so if we 

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.950
 there are not any here we have not removed 

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:53.980
 for all etc serene for the guard 

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.630
 just the part if right 

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.830
 so we obviously do not remove only 

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:59.200
 the for everyone in dream also 

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:02.350
 of smallpox that right next it's me 

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.200
 gives the firefighters negation x-ore blow 

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.960
 Roman exceptionally one continues 

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.390
 like that we remove the rim x26 

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.310
 honorable for all x 4 if we have the for 

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:17.560
 all etc 5 for all etc. 6 and then 

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:19.510
 occur in life we ​​would have removed the 

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:22.990
 conjunctions but in what if we have some 

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:25.150
 so we did not take anything away and we would have 

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:27.880
 then to standardize the names of 

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.040
 variables so if we had removed some 

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.840
 conjunctions would have variables that 

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.220
 would have been present in more than one line 

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.450
 but in that if it's not our case 

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.140
 since we do not have conjunctions 

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:40.420
 remove and so we get what we have 

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.180
 here did everything 

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.370
 it's our knowledge base that we 

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.320
 had originally been in the form of 

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.089
 first-order logic we transformed 

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.440
 a time in a form called 

00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:52.440
 normal form that we kind
