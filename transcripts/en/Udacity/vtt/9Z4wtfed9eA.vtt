00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When we look at the human body we see a series of sticks because that's all I can draw.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But that's not really what we see. We see a human body.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we take a magnifying glass to a part of this and really zoom in on this region what do we see?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We see cells. In fact, we see something like 10¹³ cells.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That's a 1 followed by 13 zeros. That's a massive number.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Well let's not stop there. Let's zoom in on a cell. That's a magnifying glass by the way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we zoom in on the cell, we see that it's made up of molecules

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and those molecules are made up of atoms.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And here I've drawn a single atom. This atom has three interesting parts.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Here in the center we have the nucleus. The red and the blue dots.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm using the red dot to represent the proton, and the proton has a charge of +1.6x10⁻¹⁹C.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Also in the nucleus we have the neutrons which have a charge of 0 so we call them neutral.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And orbiting around outside the nucleus we have electrons.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And electrons have a charge of -1.6x10⁻¹⁹C.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Same as the proton but negative. Each of these cells—

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Each of the 10¹³ cells in the human body has about 10¹⁵ protons,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
10¹⁵ neutrons, and 10¹⁵ electrons.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So my question is, using all of these data you have here of these numbers,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I want you to tell me what is the net or total charge and remember Q is charge

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
on the human body. Enter your answer here in Coulombs.
