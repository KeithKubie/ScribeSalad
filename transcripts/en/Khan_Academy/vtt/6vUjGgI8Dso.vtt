00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.337
- [Sal] Which of the differential
equations are separable?

00:00:02.337 --> 00:00:03.491
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:06.458
and see which of these
are actually separable.

00:00:06.458 --> 00:00:08.813
Now, the way that I approach this

00:00:08.813 --> 00:00:11.735
is I try to solve for the derivative,

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:13.956
and if when I solve for the derivative,

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:15.206
if I get dy, dx

00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:19.003
is equal to some function of y

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:22.087
times some other function of x

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:23.901
then I say okay, this is separable.

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.789
'Cause I could rewrite this as,

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.882
I could divide both sides by g of y,

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:29.430
and I get one over g of y,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.658
which is itself a function of y,

00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:33.325
times dy is equal to

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:35.912
h of x dx.

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.903
You would go from this first equation

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:42.111
to the second equation just by dividing

00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.835
both sides by g of y

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.819
and multiplying both sides by dx.

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:47.916
And then it's clear you
have a separable equation

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:49.931
you can integrate both sides.

00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:52.736
But the key is let's
solve for the derivative

00:00:52.736 --> 00:00:54.348
and see if we can put this in a form

00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:56.960
where we have the product
of a function of y

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.349
times a function of x.

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:01.568
So let's do it with this first one here.

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:04.138
So let's see, if I
subtract y from both sides,

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:05.609
I'm just trying to solve for the

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:07.071
derivative of y with respect to x.

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:09.154
I'm gonna get x times,

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:12.457
I'll write y prime

00:01:12.457 --> 00:01:15.086
is the derivative of y with respect to x,

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:17.570
is equal to 3 minus y.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.942
So I subtracted y from both sides.

00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:22.399
Let's see if I divide both sides by x,

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.840
I'm gonna get the derivative of y

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.037
with respect to x is equal to,

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:28.057
actually I'm gonna write it this way.

00:01:28.057 --> 00:01:32.138
I'm gonna write it 3
minus y times 1 over x.

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:33.416
And so it's clear I'm able to write

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.457
the derivative as a product of

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:36.734
a function of y, and a function of x.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:38.309
So this indeed is separable.

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:39.142
And I could show you,

00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:41.420
I could multiply both sides by dx

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.423
and I could divide both
sides by 3 minus y now,

00:01:44.423 --> 00:01:47.340
and I would get 1 over 3 minus y dy

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:50.893
is equal to 1 over x dx.

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:56.194
So clearly, this one right
over here is separable.

00:01:56.194 --> 00:01:57.288
Now let's do the second one.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:01:58.595
And I'm gonna just do the same technique,

00:01:58.595 --> 00:01:59.956
I'll do it in a slightly different colour

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:02.622
so we don't get all of our
math all jumbled together.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.824
So in this second one,

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:07.803
let's see, if I subtract the 2x,

00:02:07.803 --> 00:02:09.656
the 2y from both sides,

00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:11.392
so actually, lemme just do, whoops,

00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:13.569
lemme do a couple things at once.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.635
I'm gonna subtract 2x from both sides.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:20.581
I am going to subtract 2y from both sides.

00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:23.664
So I'm gonna subtract 2y from both sides.

00:02:23.664 --> 00:02:26.331
I'm gonna add one to both sides,

00:02:28.112 --> 00:02:29.779
so I'm gonna add one

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.416
to both sides.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.097
And then what am I going
to get if I do that?

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:37.998
This is gonna be zero,

00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:38.960
this is gonna be zero,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.486
this is gonna be zero.

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:44.346
I'm gonna have 2 times the derivative of y

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:47.013
with respect to x is equal to

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:49.502
negative 2x minus

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:51.267
2y plus 1.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.377
And now see I can divide
everything by two;

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:58.440
I would get the derivative of y

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.905
with respect to x is equal to,

00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:02.385
and actually, yeah I would get,

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:03.872
I'm just gonna divide by two,

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:07.111
so I'm gonna get negative x minus y

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:09.292
and then I'm going to get

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:10.959
plus 1/2.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.443
So it's not obvious to me

00:03:13.443 --> 00:03:15.182
how I can write this as a product

00:03:15.182 --> 00:03:18.682
of a function of x and a function of y.

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:21.793
So this one does not feel,

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:25.154
this one right over here is not separable.

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:26.985
I don't know how to write this

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:30.288
as a function of x times a function of y,

00:03:30.288 --> 00:03:31.551
so this one I'm not gonna,

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.792
I'm gonna say is not separable.

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:36.565
Now this one, they've
already written it for us

00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:39.031
as a function of x times a function of y.

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:42.230
So this one is clearly
separable right over here

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.015
and if you want me to do the separating

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:45.729
I can rewrite this as,

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:47.312
well this is dy dx.

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:50.944
If I multiply both sides by dx

00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:53.581
and divide both sides
by this right over here,

00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:56.914
I would get one over y squared plus y dy

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:02.483
is equal to x squared plus x dx.

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:06.698
So clearly separable.

00:04:06.698 --> 00:04:09.015
Alright now this last choice,

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:09.848
this is interesting,

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:11.878
they've essentially
distributed the derivative

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:12.987
right over here.

00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:15.638
So let's see, if we were to unfactor

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:18.767
the derivative, I'm just
gonna solve for dy dx.

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:20.849
So I'm gonna factor it out.

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:22.432
I'm gonna get dy dx

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:26.476
times x plus y,

00:04:26.476 --> 00:04:27.309
x plus y,

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:30.276
is equal to x.

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:32.953
Now if I were to divide both sides

00:04:32.953 --> 00:04:35.870
by x plus y, I'm gonna get dy dx

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.823
is equal to x over x plus y.

00:04:41.124 --> 00:04:43.624
And here my algebraic tool kit

00:04:44.564 --> 00:04:46.199
of how do I separate x and y

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.979
so I can write this as a function of x

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.577
times a function of y,

00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:50.912
not obvious to me here.

00:04:50.912 --> 00:04:53.543
So this one is not separable.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.865
So only the first one and the third one.
