00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.930
A MAN NAMED CLAYTON BIGSBY
HAS BEEN THE LEADING VOICE

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:33.699
OF THE WHITE-SUPREMACIST
MOVEMENT IN AMERICA.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:36.569

VERY FEW HAVE EVER SEEN HIM
DUE TO HIS RECLUSIVENESS.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:56.089

HIS MESSAGE TO A WIDER AUDIENCE,

00:00:56.122 --> 00:01:01.294
