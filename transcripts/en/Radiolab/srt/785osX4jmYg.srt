1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,120
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:07,830
And today today we are trying to figure
out how to make a deal with yourself

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,030
when most of you doesn't want to do
what the rest of you wants to do. Right.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,420
And we've talked about these kinds of
deals when it comes to avoiding the

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,260
sirens, quitting smoking, figuring out
what to do with the balance of your life.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,640
Now we're going to change things a bit.
Let's say instead of being an addict,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,730
let's say you're just a writer. Yeah.

8
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,580
And you want to be inspired.
You want the words to come.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,300
And this is very typical
situation. They're not coming. No,

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,480
no words to the question is
in that kind of situation,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,040
what kind of deals could you make
with yourself to get the words out?

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,360
This is a, this is fanciful.
My friend Oliver Sacks,

13
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,870
the neurologist and the writer,
he made a deal, which frankly,

14
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:52,770
I find this kind of astonishing
[inaudible] bargain with creativity.

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,980
I will tell you all the,
I probably shouldn't, uh,

16
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,430
the first book I wrote, Migraine, um,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,950
was very obstructed. And
then by obstructed he means
he just got stuck. Yes,

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,940
day after day he,

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,800
she tried to write something down and
it just didn't come and I was getting

20
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,140
desperate on the matter.

21
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,530
And finally on September the
first of 1968 I said to myself,

22
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,390
you have 10 days to write
this book. If it is not done,

23
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,090
then you commit suicide. Whoa.

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,730
And under the

25
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,200
imagined threat,

26
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,990
which seem to tell lie me in a way
because you're, you're what the,

27
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,580
the other half of you thought that
the first half of you meant it. Yes.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,580
Did the first half of you
mean it? I don't know,

29
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,880
but there was a lot of, this
was that after months of,

30
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:53,040
of stewing and not doing anything,

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,810
I started work and what started as a,

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,360
as a fearful task soon became a
joyful task with this own momentum.

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,600
And suddenly he had this feeling
that there was something inside him.

34
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:11,190
Some engine inside me, a
wonderful associative engine,

35
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,680
which we've sourced together,

36
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,800
brings unexpected things
into our position.

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,690
It had kicked into gear and I'm just
kind of pulling things out of him and

38
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,190
putting them right there under the page.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,340
I felt like who's being
dictated to me healing? Uh, I,

40
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:31,930
I was passive. I was the bridge,
I was the transmitter. Um,

41
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,110
and in fact, I finished
the book a day early.

42
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,410
That's a strange way to kick yourself
in the pants, I have to say. Yeah. Well,

43
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,150
um, for me a deadline sometimes is
felt homeless literally as such.

44
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,220
This is not an easy way to go to
work everyday. I wouldn't think.

45
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,300
I don't think corn can make bonk and
it's like that definitely not too often.

46
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:58,390
And it would have a cost. I'll
never of course did that only once,

47
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,430
but the story told got us thinking,

48
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,820
is there a bargain that you can make
with yourself, your creative self?

49
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,330
It somehow avoids this
terrible cost. Yeah.

50
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,790
That as long as this led me generally in
front too late a woman who just does it

51
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,600
differently.

52
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,600
I have this fascination with trying to
figure out how you can live a lifetime of

53
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:23,950
creativity without cutting your ear
off. You know what I mean? And who is,

54
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,890
who is that? Oh, I'm Liz Gilbert and well,

55
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:30,010
just something a little bit
not which Liz Gilbert rd.

56
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,090
I'm the Liz Gilbert who wrote
the book called the pray love.

57
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,270
I guess that's the way she described
myself because that's how my obituary will

58
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,420
read, eat, pray,

59
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:41,990
love in case you were born under a rock
or raised by wolves is one of the most

60
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:44,510
popular books ever,
ever, ever in the world.

61
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,920
It became even more popular when the
book became a movie and Guess who played

62
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:49,660
Liz?

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,370
Liz Gilbert is remarkable.
Roberts or courage in the way

64
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,340
America's sweetheart and the success
was great, but she says, you know,

65
00:03:57,341 --> 00:04:01,180
it was also kind of frightening because
there she was back at home in front of

66
00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:03,520
the same old blank page
with a new question.

67
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,890
How will you ever outdo
what you did last time?

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,800
Suddenly she's back where
Oliver was obstructive.

69
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,860
She didn't think that that success
was going to be there the last time.

70
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:16,030
So was the last time a flute, do I
even have another big book in me?

71
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,790
Dangerous Recipe for madness madness.

72
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,650
But then she thought back to a
conversation that she once had with hope.

73
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,330
Who? Tom. Wait,

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,650
Tom [inaudible].

75
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,910
Where this all began was that I was,

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,710
I was a journalist for she Q and I did
an interview with him and he spoke about

77
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:43,190
the creative process, I
think more articulately than
anybody I have ever heard.

78
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,880
Um,

79
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,880
and he was talking about how every song
has a distinctive identity that it comes

80
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:53,690
into the world with and it needs to be
taken in different ways. And he said,

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,660
you know, there are songs that,
that you have to sneak up on,

82
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,880
like you're hunting for where rare bird.

83
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,940
And there are songs that
come fully intact, like a
dream taken through a straw.

84
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,790
And there are songs that you find little
bits of like pieces of gum underneath

85
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,550
the desk and you scrape them off and
you put them together and you make

86
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,690
something out of it. And there are some,

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,380
cause he said that
needed to be bullied, um,

88
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,440
where he said he's been in the studio
working on a song and the whole album is

89
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:26,570
done and this one song won't give
itself over. And he said, you know,

90
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,170
everyone's gotten used to
seeing him do things like this.

91
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:32,510
He'll march up and down the studio talking
to the song saying the rest of their

92
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:37,430
families in the car, we're all going
on vacation. You coming along or not,

93
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,910
you got 10 minutes or else you're getting
left behind, you know, and he's like,

94
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,010
you got to shake it down. Some

95
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,280
Times lists as that interview was
maybe the first time she thought of

96
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,980
inspiration as as a, as an it.

97
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,230
And I remember feeling my own center
of gravity shift and thinking, wait,

98
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,630
you're allowed to talk to this thing

99
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,010
that the source of her ideas
was outsider than she could get

100
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,200
some distance from it,
maybe negotiate with it,

101
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,540
even fight with it instead of beating
yourself up all the time. Right. And this,

102
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,350
the story that I loved that he told me
about where his artistic anxiety ended

103
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,560
and his sort of new artistic liberation
began is when he's driving along the

104
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,840
freeway in Los Angeles and like
eight lanes of traffic one day.

105
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,840
And this little fragment of a
beautiful song comes into his head

106
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,753
[inaudible]

107
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,340
and he has no way to record
it. He's gotten no pencil,

108
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,840
he's got no tape recorder and he's
in eight lanes of stressful track.

109
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,120
So coma, it was blue,

110
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,070
and he immediately starts to feel all
the old pressure that he's felt his whole

111
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:43,760
life of, I'm not good enough. I, you
know all the artistic struggle, right?

112
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,710
I can't do it. I'm not good
enough. I'm going to lose it. I,

113
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,650
it'll haunt me forever. And
then he just backed off from it

114
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,530
and instead he established
that negotiating distance
between him and the melody.

115
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,710
And he looked up at the
sky and he said, excuse me,

116
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,010
can you not see that I'm driving if
you're serious about wanting to exist,

117
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:04,880
I spent eight hours a day in the studio.

118
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:07,970
You're welcome to come and visit
me while I'm sitting at the piano.

119
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,740
Otherwise leave me alone and
go bother Leonard Cohen. Oh,

120
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:17,180
that's very bold. It is. I
think that's what she wants.

121
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,900
She wants you to push back and she
wants you to set some terms and some

122
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:21,734
boundaries.

123
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,010
She doesn't want you to go to the
Leonard Cohen Concert two years later.

124
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,570
Very kind of you to come to this.

125
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Now this idea that somehow the
creative act comes from outside you,

126
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,100
you get a visit from a somebody, this
isn't a new idea. This is a very old idea.

127
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,050
You know the Greeks would call it the muse

128
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,270
[inaudible]

129
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,670
the Romans called it
the ingenium the genius,

130
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,050
which was an interesting idea because
it's not the way we use genius today,

131
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:54,291
right?

132
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,320
Today we say that it person is a genius
and back then they would've said a

133
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,730
person had one. Um,

134
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,380
and again it's the separation so that
the creative person has this externalized

135
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,250
collaborator. So this is a
tinker belly kind of a thing.

136
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,460
It sprinkles you has little
wings. And I think it depends.

137
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,860
I think it depends on the process.

138
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:17,840
I mean it's got a lot of names
because it takes a lot of forms,

139
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:18,700
right? And,

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,780
and we're talking about all this as though
these are actually kind of believe it

141
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,640
cause I don't think it
would work otherwise.

142
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:30,380
But I kind of do believe that the world
is being constantly circled as though by

143
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,150
Gulf stream forces ideas and creativity
that want to be made manifest and

144
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,720
they're looking for portals
to come through and people,
and if you don't do it,

145
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,340
they'll go find someone else. You know?

146
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,540
And and so you have to convince it that
you're serious and you have to show it

147
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:47,600
respect and you have to talk to it
and let it know that you're there.

148
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,700
Like for the last few years there's been
a novel that has been sort of stirring

149
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:56,580
in me and I haven't had time to give it
the attention it wants me to give it.

150
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,030
But every day I talk to it and I have a
little conversation with it and I say,

151
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:04,350
listen, I'm in April, I will be
with you. I want you to stay.

152
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,740
Don't let me wake up and read in the New
York Times that someone else wrote you

153
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,690
and stay here with me.

154
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,450
I'm calming the Golden Retrievers. I mean
you have to keep passing it. Actually,

155
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:19,230
that's probably as good a metaphor for
me as any because I would relate to that

156
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,850
being half golden retriever myself
and, and liking dogs. That's great.

157
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:26,400
And when you say you talk to it
and its golden retriever form,

158
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,840
that's our producer pat Walters.
Like do you actually talk to it? Yeah

159
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,600
I do. I talk.

160
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,600
That's why I have to work alone in a
quiet room because I talk to it all the

161
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:40,200
time and I ask a questions. I say, what
do you, what is it that you want me?

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,820
What does you want me to be doing here?

163
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,970
Because you seem to be resistant to what
I'm trying to do here. Like show me,

164
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:48,630
give me a clue. Um, like
I uh, the title of eat,

165
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,360
Pray Love was the last thing
that came of that book. And,

166
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,470
and the book was about to be published
in it had any number of ridiculous stupid

167
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,440
titles that I'm going to tell you cause
they're so embarrassing and they're so

168
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,210
not what that book was meant to be titled.

169
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,230
And I ended up writing an email to all
my friends and saying the subject heading

170
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:09,230
was title search. And I said, my book
won't tell me its name and can I,

171
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,280
can all of you help me? And a friend
of mine wrote back and said, um,

172
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,030
if you're going to talk to it like that,
it's not going to tell you anything.

173
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,040
Um, right. So I really did that night.

174
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:24,130
I said it back and sweetheart,
listen, I respect you,

175
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,750
I love you. I honor you. I have
defended you these last few years.

176
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:29,950
I want to bring you into the world,

177
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,100
but you have to tell me your
name and the next day eat,

178
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,184
pray, love.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,721
And you know it.

180
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:43,130
Because I know the difference between
something I thought of and something that

181
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:45,320
I was given. I can, I
can tell the difference.

182
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,760
She says sometimes it's the whole
scene. Sometimes it's just a word,

183
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,200
may be a phrase and then you have
the job to make it into something.

184
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,060
Wait it. But if I, if I say
to you two roads diverged,

185
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,410
well two roads diverge. Any yellow water.

186
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,600
So you can write that down. Two
roads diverged in the yellow one,

187
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,890
then you're done. Do you know
how that poem got written?

188
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,313
Two roads.

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
So he was working for, I may be
exaggerating this cause I tend to,

190
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,490
but I'm going to tell it
my way. How I heard it. Uh,

191
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,010
he was working for months
and months and months on,

192
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,770
on what was going to be the
greatest epic poem of his life.

193
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,690
It was the biggest challenge
that he was taking on.

194
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,730
He was going to be up there
with the masters with this,

195
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:30,490
I couldn't name the prison we were talking
about. Yes, this would be Mr. Frost.

196
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,200
And, um, and, and, and he worked on it
for, um, you know, forever and ever.

197
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:38,890
I mean, perspiration, perspiration,
perspiration. Right. And it was 20,

198
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:42,010
30 pages long and it was, I don't know
what the meter was, whatever it was.

199
00:11:42,011 --> 00:11:43,450
It was the most ambitious
thing he'd ever done.

200
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:48,400
And it was arduous and it probably had
sweat all over it. Um, put it down,

201
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,470
went to sleep, woke up,
sat down and wrote two,

202
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,760
two roads. And all of a sudden in
one setting, this tiny, perfect,

203
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,120
immaculate thing was created that had
nothing to do with what he had just done.

204
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,373
He earned it.

205
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,350
I think the angels reward people who
are at their desk at six o'clock in the

206
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:08,680
morning working right. And
he earned it by showing his,

207
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,530
his intent to be a great poet.
And they said, okay, cool.

208
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,050
You showed your intent. That
thing you just wrote was crap.

209
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,510
I'm going to give you this
one. Here's your reward.

210
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,860
So then what evidence do you have
for this of justice? Except for that.

211
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:21,611
It's a great story.

212
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:26,020
And I liked the idea and I feel like
I really do feel like when they see me

213
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:29,680
working, they take pity on
me and they say, you look,

214
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,150
you're showing a real commitment to this.

215
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,420
You've been up at five o'clock every
morning for the last year working on this

216
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,990
novel. I'm just going to give you
the ending, you know, um, or I'm,

217
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,530
I'm going to spare you from that really
bad idea. You just having, you know,

218
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:44,950
I always think of it as like Henry Ford's
famous line about how creativity is

219
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,190
99% perspiration and 1% inspiration,

220
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:50,140
which is a very mechanical
way to divide it up.

221
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:54,520
But it also assumes that those
two things have equal weight,

222
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,620
that they're the same quality.
Right. I agree with 99% perspiration,

223
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:03,280
1% inspiration, but
it's 99% oyster 1% Pearl

224
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:05,820
[inaudible]

225
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,480
you can't even compare the,

226
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:11,760
the matter like it's a
bargain to get 1% inspiration.

227
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,540
You know, it's, it's a miracle.

228
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,290
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

229
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,400
I could get with the muses
sort of. What do you mean?

230
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,171
Well,

231
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:40,790
I think it's interesting that you can
hear it at one point she says that she

232
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:44,210
believes actually kind of believe
in, and another point she says,

233
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,220
it just makes a good story.
That's a great story.

234
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:49,910
And I like the idea so you can hear
her negotiating with the idea. Yeah.

235
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,180
Gosh, she's a little bit between the two
thoughts, which is interesting. I mean,

236
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,800
you know, you know,

237
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,560
a serious neuroscientists would tell you
that it's all in your unconscious and

238
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,040
it's all you. All the time. But
another way to think of it is, uh,

239
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,340
is to say that you got a gift and,

240
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,310
and therefore it's not
all about you would,

241
00:14:11,311 --> 00:14:15,630
it's bad and it's still about you when
it's good, but it's not all about you.

242
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:18,330
It's just this business of all. Okay,

243
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:20,880
this is a form of well
organized and modesty.

244
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,190
It's a nice phrase. I'm just going
to, just going to go with that. Yay.

245
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,650
It's time for us in our
ferries to go to break.

246
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:29,870
No.
