00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:02.802
Now, folks, I've said it

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:05.104
during a deposition
for the National Park Service,

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:06.372
and I'll say it again:

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.974
(bleep) the Eagles.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.909
Now, sure...

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:12.879
they're noble American symbols,

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.947
but when it comes
to the NFL kind,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.916
Eagles can also be traitors.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.218
The president announcing
the Philadelphia Eagles

00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:21.621
will not be visiting
the White House tomorrow

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.423
to celebrate
their Super Bowl victory

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:26.059
due to the national anthem
controversy.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.294
The Eagles,
who won Super Bowl LII,

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.963
apparently wanted to send
a smaller group of players.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.032
A handful
did not plan to attend.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.068
Yes. And by "handful,"

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.271
she means about 76.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.440
The only members
of the Eagles organization

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.375
who did plan to attend were...

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.344
(reading):

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.650
And to be fair,

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:54.487
we don't know how many people
are in Swoop.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.389
There could be two or three

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:58.424
or the entire
2017 Golden State Warriors.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:00:59.659
We don't know.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.861
Even so, Trump had no choice

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:04.197
but to kick the flag-hating
Eagles to the curb,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.398
saying that...

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.367
(reading):

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.142
Take that, Eagles!
Even though, technically,

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.511
no Eagles players
ever took a knee

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:22.115
or stayed in the locker room
during the anthem.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:24.650
But they obviously hate America.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.752
Why else would they have
willingly

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:28.754
beat the crap out
of the Patriots?

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.657
(laughter, applause)

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.063
And... why else would we have
seen so many photos

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:40.433
of the Eagles kneeling
on Fox yesterday?

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.301
STEPHANIE RUHLE:
 I want to show you a-a clip

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:44.337
from Fox News last night
where they played

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.506
 Eagles players kneeling.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.009
 Eagles' tight end Zach Ertz
 tweeted this reaction.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.644
 "This can't be serious.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:53.613
 "Praying before games
 with my teammates

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:57.884
 "well before the anthem is
 being used for your propaganda.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.318
 "Just sad. I feel like

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:01.754
 you guys should have
 been better than this."

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:05.291
Oh, sorry, Ruhle, but, no,
we're not going to be better

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:07.727
because in Trump country,
we be best.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.862
(laughter)

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:13.866
And sure, fact-lovers whined
enough about this that Fox

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.468
technically issued an apology

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.271
for taking the kneeling out
of context by taking pictures

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.474
of players kneeling in prayer
before the game and using them

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.743
as evidence of protest
during the anthem.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.144
But come on!

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:28.114
You can't let a little thing
like context get in the way.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.882
(laughter)

00:02:29.915 --> 00:02:31.551
Because without context,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:33.953
I can clearly see people
disrespecting our flag

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:35.354
all over the place.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:37.890
Look at the pope crapping
all over old glory.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.059
And check out The Bachelor

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:43.129
insulting our troops
just like that.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.464
And then there's this
anti-American dirt bag.

00:02:45.497 --> 00:02:47.700
Boom. Ugh.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.936
Look at that cocky ginger
spitting in the face

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.171
of our great nation's military.

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:54.974
I can't think of anyone
less American.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:57.376
For more, citizen journalist
Niccole Thurman.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:58.844
-What's up?!
-(cheers and applause)

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.046
-Niccole.
-What's up?

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.747
What's up?
What is up?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.916
Niccole, let's talk football.

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.385
We know
Trump disinvited the Eagles.

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:10.189
But in an act of generosity,
he still invited Philly fans

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.725
to The White House to celebrate
the national anthem.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.093
It's a great idea, right?

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.095
Look, Jordan,
I hate to say this.

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:18.664
Donald Trump is
a master deal-maker,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.600
but this was a bad deal.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.602
He said "no" to a group

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.870
of Super Bowl-winning
millionaires in suits,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.641
and "yes" to a thousand
Philadelphia sports fans?

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.209
These guys? (scoffs)

00:03:30.242 --> 00:03:32.311
MAN: Fans pulled down
 traffic lights,

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.847
 started fires
 and tipped over cars.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.917
-(shouting) -Some climbed on
 the awning of the Ritz-Carlton.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.219
 This fan hopped on top
 of a police van.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.554
You have glass everywhere.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:42.955
 Cars that were set on fire.

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.491
MAN: Authorities rubbed
 hydraulic fluid on light poles.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.393
It didn't work,
but the Eagles are happy.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:50.763
-(man shouting)
-KLEPPER: Oh.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:53.032
(laughter, applause)

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.268
-Come on, Niccole.
-Yeah.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:58.337
These are the common man,
salt of the earth people.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.674
No, Jordan,
they're "salt the earth people."

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:04.043
Okay. Nothing survives them.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.379 line:0%
Like, remember
that cute little robot

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:10.216 line:0%
from 2015 who was hitchhiking
around the world?

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.285 line:0%
He was so excited
to explore the U.S.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.086 line:0%
Then he went to Philly.

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:17.323 line:0%
-And they beat him to death!
-(audience groans, gasps)

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.559
Philly fans are lawless,
raging maniacs,

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:23.696
and Trump invited them
into his home, The White House,

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.665
which, by the way, is a rental.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:27.700
-Okay, so...
-(laughter, groaning)

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:30.503
So you're afraid they'll burn
down The White House?

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.506
No! No, I'm afraid they're gonna
get jobs in The White House.

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.074
(laughter)

00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:37.410
Listen, Trump loves bruisers,
okay?

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.945
If he sees a guy whose résumé is
a sock full of batteries,

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:41.614
and a pocket full
of (bleep) yous,

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:43.382
that guy's gonna get a job!

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:47.053
The fan who intentionally
threw up on a little girl?

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.422
Hey, you're the director
of Health and Human Services.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.257
(laughter, groaning)

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.760
The fans who crushed the
Ritz-Carlton awning-- in charge

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:57.630
of infrastructure.
That's their job now.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.565
And how about a fan
who punched a horse,

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:02.902
and then sued the cops
whose horse he punched?

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:04.437
Hey, man, congrats.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.205
You're the new
Secretary of Punching Horses.

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.438 line:92%
-It's an EPA job.
