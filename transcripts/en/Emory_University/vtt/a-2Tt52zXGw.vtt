00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
in our society we pride ourselves on

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.020
planning and being prepared for the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.179
unexpected but a sudden crisis will

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
often throw curve balls that threaten to

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.980
unravel even the best laid plans as was

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.720
the case in the summer of 2014 who could

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.400
have known that a deadly virus wreaking

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
havoc in several African countries would

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.660
find its way to Atlanta but that's

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.460
exactly what happened in 2014 when four

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.680
patients infected with the Ebola virus

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.570
were brought to Emory University for

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.640
treatment steeped in expertise of

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.620
infectious diseases Emory's mission to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.790
create preserve teach and apply

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.309
knowledge in the service of humanity

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.440
would be put to the test between the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.120
months of August and October specialists

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.950
would apply every stitch of training

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.260
from the transport to treatment to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.300
continuing care the painstaking process

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.629
would yield new breakthroughs and Payoh

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.760
safety and bio defense today Emory

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.280
University leads the National a bola

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.010
treatment and education center it's one

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.230
facet of a multidisciplinary institution

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.750
led by someone who's devoted her life to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.430
the field of Public Health as you'll see

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.519
in today's executive profiles

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.120
when did becoming a professional

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.540
educator become part of your calling I

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.030
guess it emerged almost organically I

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.100
can tell you that because of the Second

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.560
World War both of my parents were unable

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.620
to complete their education so I'm the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.180
first one in my family to have a college

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.280
degree actually I'm the first one who

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.540
have completed high school I ended up

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.970
going to the University of Amsterdam

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.310
this is a proud moment for your family

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.440
it was an incredibly proud moment for my

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
family for my parents but it also was

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.310
one that brought insecurity because I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.010
was entering this world that really

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.290
didn't mean much for everybody and there

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.210
was some concern of how would I fit in

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.190
with the family and I had that as well

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
because all of a sudden my life was so

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.750
different all of that to say that

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.970
looking back it wasn't a problem at all

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.460
growing up in the Netherlands one of our

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.160
activities most every summer was to sit

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.979
outside and watch particularly American

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.470
students come to Amsterdam and visit

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.000
they would play hacky sack and they

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.070
would drink too much and they would

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.930
smoke too much pot or marijuana whatever

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.000
you want to call it and we would go like

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.580
they're already so wasted why are they

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.680
drinking more or smoking more putting

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.930
all that together I believe that I at a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.060
very young age devolved the curiosity

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.310
for understanding why people do what

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.010
they do how do they find themselves in

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.570
situations that are harmful so talk

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.519
about your field of study so my social

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.860
scientists who ended up in public health

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.269
I moved to Atlanta had not been living

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.370
here if it wasn't for visiting

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.709
scientists at the Centers for Disease

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.810
Control did you ever go into an

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.100
experiment or to a study and believed

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.290
one thing and it turned out to be just

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.720
the opposite yes there have been

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.540
incredible surprises because as human

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.120
beings as you know were so complex so

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.190
for example when you see that somebody

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.870
is doing harm to him or herself you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.470
would think if you explained what the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.360
harm is people will accept that and then

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.010
do something about it and it's quite

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
interesting to realize that people

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.660
understand and accept it and unable to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.790
do something about it so that got me

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.100
very interested as a social scientist

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.470
and a public health expert to think

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.480
about if if we want people to change

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
their behavior if we want people to do

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.459
something different then we first have

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.799
to

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.719
and what it means to them the Emory

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.840
University brand extends across an

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.489
entire network B from from the

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.750
healthcare organization to the univer to

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.370
the undergraduate University to all your

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.109
graduate programs what are the things

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.030
you try to accomplish in trying to tell

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.280
the Emory story to the entire community

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.560
we recently completed actually over a

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.959
year ago an economic and social impact

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.120
study and people are surprised when I

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.489
tell them that Emory has 30,000

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.189
employees and that our impact on the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.859
state annually for the fiscal year 16

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.540
was 9.1 billion so in many ways were

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.639
much more than a university and a

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.139
healthcare system also at a kind of

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:08.290
place that really prepares people to be

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.450
ready for the future and to be problem

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.280
solvers and engage in ethical leaders

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.409
for the future I have made it my mission

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.060
to really provide an integrated Emory

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.359
experience and people to think about

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.849
Emory as Emily overall and not just as

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.979
as a series of segments school colleges

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.680
centrum Institute's Emory was in the

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.870
headlines about being annexed into the

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.729
city of Atlanta what does that do for

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.159
the university how does that change the

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.930
university and and what advantages you

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.090
think that'll have for Emory going

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.699
forward we emily has had an Atlanta

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.039
advice fund the day it moved to Atlanta

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.500
in 1915 and for whatever reason people

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.000
at that point in time realized that

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.860
Emory University in Atlanta started

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.409
better than Emory University in Decatur

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.690
so there was a symbolic connection that

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.270
there was that wasn't formalized Atlanta

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.820
like many other cities the counties went

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.650
through a movement of cityhood and the

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.020
number of years ago I remember opening

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.449
the local newspaper and there was a map

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.000
that had Emory become part of one of the

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.800
city who it's been only part of Emory so

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.930
you realize we can either wait till

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.180
somebody claims all our parts of Emory

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.120
to become part of a new city to be

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.280
formed or we can join a major city which

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.590
is a thriving city we think about Emory

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.270
is a global leading research University

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.580
Atlanta is the gateway to the world so

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.199
it makes all the sense a another main

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.270
factor for all of this was the

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:31.210
opportunity to get public transportation

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.190
to the clifton corridor just talking

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.020
about emily we have so many job

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.980
opportunities employment opportunities

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.050
it's impossible very often

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.420
people to get there for all of us to

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.010
have public transportation is something

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.660
we would strive for now maybe this is

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.060
the Dutch in me coming out which has a

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.800
quite elaborate public transportation

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.720
infrastructure but I'm very excited

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.300
about that part is that our nation and

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.490
Atlanta is part of this problem is

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.710
facing a major opioid crisis is there

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.390
one thing that you think is actually

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.380
helping the opioid crisis so you think

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.020
could take us in the right direction

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.180
towards lessening what's going on in the

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.760
world and we as tackled the opioid

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.590
crisis at numerous levels we have people

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.810
in public health and medicine that are

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.150
very actively involved in nursing but

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.910
also other parts of the university

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.920
because it impacts everybody in so many

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.990
different ways that impacts society in

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.120
many different ways we also have very

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.510
focused on awareness we had a town hall

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.060
where we invited people from law

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.190
enforcement the public health medicine

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.890
field as well as a parent who started in

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.050
organizations whose daughter had died

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.660
from the opioid epidemic so creating

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.120
awareness as well so we we deal with the

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.880
opioid epidemic at home in the larger

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.460
Atlanta area and beyond I also want to

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.110
point out that whereas the opioid crisis

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.540
certainly is something we need to tackle

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.700
today there are lots of preliminary

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.590
signs that are indicating that a

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.300
methamphetamine epidemic is following

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.670
that has happened in the 60s had

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.040
happened in the 70s so I would encourage

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.020
all of us to do what we're doing in

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.390
terms of the opioid epidemic but let's

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.550
not forget that it never happens in

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.680
isolation and that we have a next wave

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.660
of a methamphetamine epidemic following

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.340
in its footsteps Emory University is

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.840
ranked number one for quality of life

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.530
that's according to the Princeton

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.120
reviews 2019 best colleges guide and US

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.980
