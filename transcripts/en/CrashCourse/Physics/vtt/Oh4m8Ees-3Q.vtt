00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.090
Sunlight, moonlight, torchlight, and flashlight.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.140
They all come from different places, but they’re
the all very same thing: light!

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.600
It’s what makes it possible for us to see the world around us, so it’s worth a close, hard look.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.480
For instance, how does light travel?

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.040
When you flip that switch in the bathroom to brush your teeth, how does light move from the light bulb, to the mirror, and into your eyes?

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.039
And if you’re one of many people who wear glasses, how do those lenses turn a blurry world into a high-definition experience?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.559
Whether it’s glasses, microscopes, or telescopes,
it’s all about bending light to our will.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.220
How do we go about this grand task of controlling
the very thing that helps us see?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.780
Well, let’s take a look!

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:50.560
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.320
No matter where light comes from, we generally talk about it in the same way, and make the same assumptions about how it travels.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.960
Say you’re lying on the beach, basking in
a ray of sunshine.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.680
One of the first assumptions we make is that the light is traveling from the sun to you, in a straight line.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.360
This way of thinking about light is called the ray model, and the core tenant of the model is that light travels in straight-line paths called rays.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.580
But each individual ray is really just a graphical
representation of actual light.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.780
A light source may be emitting an infinite number of rays, but we only draw a few to get the point across.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.380
Now, let’s say we have a flashlight that’s
emitting rays of light.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.520
If we point the flashlight at a reflective surface, like a calm pool of water, we can trace the rays as lines that leave the flashlight, reflect off the water and continue on as a straight line.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.060
Note that the rays on top of the flashlight
are now on the bottom, and vice versa.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.760
This makes sense, because if you’re viewing something in a reflection, you see its image reversed.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.880
Another important observation is that rays leave the reflected surface at the same angle at which they struck it.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.860
So if I point the flashlight at a 30 degree angle – an angle that we call the angle of incidence – it would leave at a 30 degree angle in the other direction.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.880
So, we’d say that the angle of reflection
is equal to the angle of incidence.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.260
And the fact that these two angles equal each
other is called the law of reflection.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.100
Now, the way I described the light hitting the
pool of water was oversimplified, wasn’t it?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.680
Because, in reality, some of the incident light will reflect off the water’s surface, while the rest of it will go into the water.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.840
And, an interesting phenomenon happens when light rays change from one medium to another, such as going from air into water.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.300
Have you ever looked at a straw sitting in a cup of water and noticed how the submerged part of the straw looks bent?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.420
Of course the straw itself isn’t bent, but the light is,
when it passes between the water and the air.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.360
This phenomenon, of light rays changing direction
at the interface between media, is called refraction.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.180
When a ray moves from air into water, the ray’s angle after passing into the water will be less than the incident angle.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
So, the straw looks bent because the rays coming from the straw into your eyes don't travel in a straight path.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.740
They become bent, so the bottom of the straw
appears to be in a place where it’s not.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:53.420
The angle of a light ray after it passes from one medium to another is called the angle of refraction, and it’s related to the angle of incidence by Snell’s Law.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.160
Snell’s Law says that angles of refraction are determined by the index of refraction for each medium and the angle of incidence.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.860
The index of refraction for a certain medium is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum versus the speed in that medium.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.740
And when a ray enters a medium with an increased
index of refraction, the angle of refraction decreases.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.560
In other words, the higher the index of refraction,
the smaller the angle.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.960
And refraction occurs when light leaves a
medium, too.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.500
Say you have a flat piece of glass standing on end, and a light ray enters the glass at an incident angle of theta one.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.480
The angle of refraction inside the glass would be less than theta one, since the index of refraction of glass is greater.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.260
But once the ray reaches the interface between the glass and the air on the other side, it refracts again,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.640
and now the angle of refraction is equal to
that first incident angle.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.760
So, if you look from the right side of the glass, your eyes see an object that appears to be lower than it actually is.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.260
Now, when you observe an object through refracted light like this, what you’re seeing is an image, a visually reproduced copy of an object.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.000
And not all images are the same.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.900
An image is considered to be a real image if the rays from an object converge at some location, such as your eye or on some other surface, like film.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.720
Real images can be projected onto screens, because the light rays from an object are actually traveling there.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:12.400
But the alternative is a virtual image – an image where the light rays don’t actually converge, so your eyes construct an image as if the diverging rays originated from a single point.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.420
When you look in the mirror, for example, it looks like you’re standing on the other side of the mirror.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.380
But you aren’t.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.520
You’re seeing a virtual image, because the light rays that make up your reflection aren’t actually converging to form an image of you.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.200
Now, what if we take that plate of glass and
re-form both sides so they’re no longer flat?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.080
How does that change the law of refraction?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.500
It doesn’t!
Refraction still occurs.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.040
It’s just that the normal line, which is the imaginary line that the angles are relative to, changes.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.040
Warped pieces of material that form images of objects are lenses, and they’re the most critical tool in the field of optics.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.440
Say we have a lens that has a spherical face
on both sides, known as a convex lens.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:55.580
As light rays enter the lens, they turn slightly towards the axis of the lens, the imaginary line that runs through its center, perpendicular to its face.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.380
As they leave the lens and move back through the air, the rays are angled slightly more toward that central axis, due to the lens’s curvature.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:10.920
The rays on the very top and bottom of the lens are bent at a larger angle towards the central axis than the rays near the center, which stay almost parallel.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.340
And they all eventually converge at a single
point called the focal point.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.020
Think of a magnifying glass.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.320
If you hold it just right in the sunlight, you can concentrate the sun’s rays into a single, very hot point.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.060
That works because you’ve taken a bunch of incoming parallel rays, and placed your target of choice at the focal length of the magnifying glass.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.930
That’s the distance between the lens and
its focal point.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.040
And one measure of a lens is its power, which is expressed simply as one over the focal length.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.620
But a lens that causes light rays to converge
in this way is known as a converging lens.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.940
And when you look through a converging lens, you can see real images from objects that are beyond the focal point.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.600
This is because light rays from those objects
actually converge after passing through the lens.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.080
And remember, when rays converge at a point,
that means a real image has been formed.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.560
Let’s show this using a ray diagram, which tells us about the position and size of images as seen through a lens.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.940
Let’s take a candle that's some distance from
the lens, which we’ll call the object distance.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.480
We will use the object distance and the focal
length of the lens to find the image distance,

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.190
the location where the image forms on the
other side of the lens.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:21.090
Lenses have the same focal length on both sides, so we’ll label the focal point on the side opposite of the object as F and the point on the same side as the object as F prime.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.020
Now, we know that the ray traveling parallel to the axis will pass through the focal point on the other side,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.120
so let’s draw a ray from the top of the candle, refracting through the lens, and then passing straight through the focal point F.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.380
Since the focal length is the same on both sides, we draw a second ray from the top of the candle, through the F prime focal point,

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.380
which then refracts through the lens and travels
parallel to the axis.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.520
The third ray travels straight through the
center of the lens.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:52.440
We draw this line because if we assume a thin lens, then we can draw a straight line through the center and disregard the slight offset that would occur due to refraction.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.540
With these three rays in place, we see that they intersect at a single point, representing the top of the candle in the newly formed image.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.880
You might notice that the image is upside down, which will always be the case for convex lenses.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.020
And the image is formed by light rays that actually originated from the object, so a real image is formed.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:16.380
The distance between the image and the lens is the image distance and is related to the object distance and the focal length by a very important equation.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.880
This is the thin lens equation, which is derived
from ray diagram geometry.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.830
For a single converging lens, the focal length
and the object distance will always be positive.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.810
The image distance will be positive if the image
is on the opposite side of the light source.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.550
This equation holds true for converging lenses
as well as their opposite, diverging lenses.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.660
Diverging lenses have a concave shape and do the opposite of a converging lens, causing rays of light to diverge away from the lens’s axis.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:51.380
When we’re looking at an object through a diverging lens, our eyes imagine that the diverging rays originate from a location where the rays don’t actually begin, so the lens generates a virtual image.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.540
And when we construct a ray diagram for a
diverging lens, there are a few key differences.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.940
First of all, the focal point F is on the same side as the object and F prime is on the opposite side.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:11.040
While a single ray of light still goes through the very center of the lens, the other two rays take slightly different paths, resulting in a virtual image forming on the same side as the object itself.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.420
For a diverging lens, the thin lens equation is still
true, but the focal length is now a negative value.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:22.080
Another important equation that’s true for both converging and diverging lenses is the magnification equation.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.260
Magnification is the ratio of the image height
to the height of the actual object.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:31.100
When the image is upside down, like in our converging lens, then the height is a negative value.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.860
And the ratio of the image distance to the
object distance is also negative.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:46.760
But all of these ideas, taken whole, give you a good understanding of optics – the fundamental rules that explain how we can observe particles too small to see with our eyes, as well as objects that are millions of light-years away.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.320
Today we learned about the the ray model of
light and the laws of reflection and refraction.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.760
We learned about how refraction works with
converging and diverging lenses.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:09:00.500
Finally, we built ray diagrams to discover how objects are viewed through different kinds of lenses at different points.
