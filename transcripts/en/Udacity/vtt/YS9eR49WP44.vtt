00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The correct answer is no. Let us try this out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's enter a 3.0 for the differential term, run everything,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the y error is still large.

00:00:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It converges now, 0.87, but it's still really, really large.
