*Breathes out*

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.280
I actually am pretty terrible at yoga.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.660
But I grew up watching my not-blood uncle Ranjit practicing yoga in his home every day.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.800
And let me tell you, it didn’t look like this.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.720
“The goats love this more than the people do.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.840
The goats are having a lot more fun, between you and I.”

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.940
Yoga today is a massive industry in the United States– and it’s a major part of leading a

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.500
healthy lifestyle for millions of Americans. And a fashion style for lots of others.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.100
And while we may all know that “Om” and “Namaste” and maybe even “Chakra” are words somehow related

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.320
to yoga, the actual history of how yoga came to the United States, spread across the world

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.980
and gave birth to millions wearing Lululemon isn’t as well known.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.720
Hey guys, I’m Sana. And today I’m gonna explore the history of yoga in the United States and ask your favorite question:

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.780
Are our yoga classes cultural appropriation, appreciation...

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
or just late-stage capitalism?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.720
Yoga is a massive industry in the United States.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.280
One study found that Americans spend $16 billion a year on clothing, equipment, classes and accessories.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.000
It's also reported that over 36 million, or 15%, of Americans had done their downward dog

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.400
at some point in the last six months. Over the course of their lives, that number increases to 28% of Americans.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.120
And it’s also everywhere in pop culture.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.060
“Unless you’re planning to move those hands down, get them off me.”

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.140
“Baby bend over, baby bend over - lemme see you do that yoga.”

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.560
“I’m so good at yogaaaa”

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.420
So how did a South Asian spiritual practice dating back thousands of years even get to America?

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.940
Well, say hello to Swami Vivekananda—the man credited for introducing yoga to Americans.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.740
Vivekananda came to Chicago in 1893 to speak at the first-ever Parliament of Religions conference,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.160
a meeting of faith leaders from around the world that was part of the Chicago World’s Fair.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.420
He’s credited for having introduced Hindu spirituality to Americans through a series of speeches he gave at the conference.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.180
Dr. Andrea Jain, who focuses on the popularization of yoga around the world, says that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.120
while Vivekananda made yoga better known in the United States, there were others who were already dabbling in it before him.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.860
Many Americans appropriated yoga and practiced it as a part of their spiritual traditions long before that.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.180
They appropriated, of course, modern versions of yoga, yoga that they thought were non-dogmatic

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.480
and oftentimes removed from religious institutions.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.520
And Vivekananda wasn’t even the guy who popularized the kind of yoga we do today in classes.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.380
B.K.S. Iyengar, K. Pattabhi Jois and T.K.V. Desikachar are credited for being the founding fathers of modern yoga.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.200
All three were students of perhaps the most influential yoga teacher, Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.720
Among Krishnamacharya’s most influential students was Indra Devi.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:06.060
Indra Devi was key in really teaching yoga in a way that distanced it from those stereotypes of Hinduism that many Americans deemed threatening,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.400
especially specific Hindu beliefs that might be perceived as a threat to the American religious identities.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.960
Indra Devi – whose real name was Eugenie Peterson – was a Russian actress who

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.180
brought yoga with her to Los Angeles in 1947, where it attracted the attention of actors interested in fitness and breathing techniques.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.520
I want to mention here that from the 1880s into the early 1900s, in response to fear of incoming immigrants,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.500
the U.S. government enacted a series of immigration laws that barred or limited immigration from Asia.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.900
And yoga, in particular, was treated as a “strange cult” that was “stealing” young white women.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.240
And it’s following this period that we see Indra Devi, a white woman, teach yoga.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.880
Now, while there were many Westerners traveling to India for access to knowledge of yoga and Hindu spirituality,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.460
it’s only after the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that we see yoga become a part of the American counterculture of the 1960s.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.080
Hindu spirituality, or “spirituality from the East,” was big.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.600
And there were many swamis who were able to immigrate to the United States and open up centers and develop the practice.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.700
And many young Americans in search of spiritual fulfillment continued to travel to India.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.120
Jain notes, in our conversation, that Hindu spirituality was seen as an outright rejection of the rigidity of the church.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.440
Most of them were Protestant Christians, and they were rejecting the Church and instead turning to what they considered to be radically alternative.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.340
In the ’70s and ’80s, the growth of yoga slowed down a bit–

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.020
and that lack of growth coincided with a national conservative movement and its backlash against counterculture.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.460
But then the ’90s came and there was also a boom in corporatized everything.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.720
Including yoga.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:51.060
The 90s is when you start to see yoga represented in the mainstream as just another consumer product

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.260
that one could buy. Just like an aerobics class, one could choose to go attend a yoga class.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.420
And part of that mainstreaming was yoga’s popularity among celebrities

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:07.320
like Sting, Raquel Welch, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and actress slash fitness "guru" Jane Fonda.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.760
Be conscious of how relaxed you feel.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.840
Carry this feeling with you.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.500
One of the most popular yoga books of the early 2000s, by the way, was by supermodel Christy Turlington,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.120
who was also featured on Time magazine’s cover for a story on the “Science of Yoga.”

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.940
Soon, the instructors to the stars, like Baron Baptiste and Rodney Yee, became more mainstream celebrities themselves.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.660
So, back to that pesky question:

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:38.200
Is practicing yoga, if you’re not a part of Hindu or even South Asian culture, actually a form of cultural appropriation? Or is it appreciation?

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.640
I actually got to sit down with badass Bay Area artist Chiraag Bhakta, who in 2014 put

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.000
together an exhibit at the San Francisco Asian Art Museum called #WhitePeopleDoingYoga.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.560
Bhakta’s exhibit looked at who got the face time in marketing and teaching yoga in the United States and

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.220
—spoiler—it wasn’t Indians.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:08.200
My practice revolves around, focuses on, identity politics. I started coming across grassroots-level meditation and yoga ephemera from like books,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:20.740
records, advertisements from the 50s to the 80s, and I was kind of curious on how yoga was being branded and marketed to the Western audience.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.880
I don't have the answers, and I think that's why I created the piece, to like really just explore that

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.180
and to see what conversations come out of it.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.920
Jain is also quick to point out that the appropriation conversation shouldn’t be so simplified—

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.200
that yoga’s own history in South Asia isn’t linear.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.840
We don't want to perpetuate some kind of very simple narrative that suggests that

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.960
there is this authentic, original tradition

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.820
called 'Yoga' that existed in South Asia that was then appropriated.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.840
Yoga is really culturally South Asian. It doesn't belong to this religion or that.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.720
A lot of the problem also, for Jain, comes down to how yoga is sold.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:15.660
There are many countless cases in which entrepreneurs and corporations sell yoga products and services and do so in a way that is driven towards making a profit without

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.280
benefiting the conduits of yoga in South Asia.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:26.780
That said, to just reduce the yoga industry to mere commercialization or commodification is just too

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:32.100
simple, because among many yoga practitioners, you have an interest in learning about that history.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.580
But despite how some practitioners may have the knowledge about yoga’s history and the power dynamics at play,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.640
the commercialization has nevertheless whitewashed the practice.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.140
In a two-year archival study of Yoga Journal magazine, there was never a South Asian person

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.400
on the cover and less than 1% of content contributors were South Asian.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.940
And it’s not really surprising when yoga, for the most part of its history, has been marketed to white, wealthy Americans.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.300
I think it's an extension of colonialism in a lot of ways;

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:06.800
of mining the lands and the cultures and then using those materials for your own financial benefit.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:13.980
Chiraag also pointed out how the founder of Lululemon, the leading name in Yoga apparel, actually made a comment in 2004,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.300
in an interview, about how he chose the name for the company because it was “funny” to hear the Japanese try to pronounce it.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.760
White male, like, making fun of one Asian culture, mining the sh*t out of another culture,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.600
and just sitting on billions of money. And you start seeing this pattern of like, oh yeah, that sounds familiar.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:36.960
And Jain notes that while many yoga consumers may actually be searching for something spiritual,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.720
the yoga industry functions on, well, a sort of exoticization of that spirituality.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:48.820
Even though we oftentimes think of commercial yoga as non-spiritual or non-religious or simply

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:55.980
fitness or simply commodities, it's a lot more complicated, because many of the reasons behind why consumers choose yoga

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.180
are tied to Orientalist stereotypes.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.760
So when entrepreneurs then sell these products, they are capitalizing off of those stereotypes.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.340
This whole conversation on appropriation and authenticity takes an uncomfortable turn when we look at how yoga has

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:18.700
been weaponized in India under the leadership of Narendra Modi and the Hindu nationalist BJP party.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.020
They’ve been trying to reclaim yoga as a Hindu tradition as a way to assert Hindu identity

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.680
in a multi-religious country, where Muslims have come under violent threat.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.580
So, how should we approach our yoga classes?

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:36.300
Is it time to drop the sun salutations and incredibly comfortable pants? Well, I’ll leave that to Bhakta.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.280
I guess what I want people to take away is to just really stop and think about

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.240
what they're stepping on, and, you know, what they're participating in,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.760
when going to a yoga class or buying those yoga pants.
