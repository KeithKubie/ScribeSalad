again like the angles that they get

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650
again like the angles that they get
 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.230
again like the angles that they get
again I serve connect this to the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240
again I serve connect this to the
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.360
again I serve connect this to the
Japanese element of the animation

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370
Japanese element of the animation
 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.310
Japanese element of the animation
there's a scene where like Aang is

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320
there's a scene where like Aang is
 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.830
there's a scene where like Aang is
hanging off the submarine or or he's

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840
hanging off the submarine or or he's
 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.570
hanging off the submarine or or he's
almost gonna fall off and he sort of

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580
almost gonna fall off and he sort of
 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.220
almost gonna fall off and he sort of
swings like this trying to get his

swings like this trying to get his
 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.170
swings like this trying to get his
balance back and you really sort of feel

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550
you can go like that come on lean back
 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.330
you can go like that come on lean back
lean back uh something about the angles

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340
lean back uh something about the angles
 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.390
lean back uh something about the angles
that they get in the style animation

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400
that they get in the style animation
 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.380
that they get in the style animation
even though I know technically it's

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390
even though I know technically it's
 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.150
even though I know technically it's
American animation but they're borrowing

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160
American animation but they're borrowing
 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.370
American animation but they're borrowing
a lot from Japanese animation and they

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380
a lot from Japanese animation and they
 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.310
a lot from Japanese animation and they
just get really good angles a lot of the

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320
just get really good angles a lot of the
 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.870
just get really good angles a lot of the
angles inside the ship anytime they go

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880
angles inside the ship anytime they go
 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.980
angles inside the ship anytime they go
inside the ship there's always gonna be

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990
inside the ship there's always gonna be
 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.870
inside the ship there's always gonna be
great angles I don't know what I don't

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880
great angles I don't know what I don't
 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.180
great angles I don't know what I don't
know why the best angles are in that

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:31.190
know why the best angles are in that
 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.530
know why the best angles are in that
ship but they always get some really

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.540
ship but they always get some really
 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.270
ship but they always get some really
great one some great Dutch angles wide

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:34.280
great one some great Dutch angles wide
 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.370
great one some great Dutch angles wide
angles all sorts of great stuff and it

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380
angles all sorts of great stuff and it
 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.540
angles all sorts of great stuff and it
really gives you a sense like you're

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550

really there
more than just creating a world it

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510
more than just creating a world it
 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.460
more than just creating a world it
creates you know it it creates a room I
