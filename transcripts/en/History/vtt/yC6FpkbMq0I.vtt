00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:04.838
DAVE: To not be able
to feed yourself,

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:08.808
what a difficult state to be in.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.644
My body doesn't feel right.

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:16.816
I'm getting cramps every
day and every night.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:20.253
I'm depleting my body of
nutrient that's needed.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:24.958
And I got to figure it out.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.827
I got to get out of this funk,
and I'm definitely feeling it.

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:37.003
What's motivating me, it's
being alive on the land,

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:41.074
it's learning every
last bit I can,

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.111
and it's being thankful
every moment of the day.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.248
But right now, I'm just
sitting here starving.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.787
That's not why I'm here.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:01:01.461
It's tough to watch muscles
on your body just disappear.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.596
That's difficult.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.309
I don't know.
I don't know.

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.561
There's three elements
that, without one of them,

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.029
there is no life--

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.898
sun, earth, and water.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.935
And right here, I've got this
beautiful picture of the sun

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.138
just shimmering off
the water and land

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.841
right on either side of it.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:53.613
That is life,
straight and simple.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.281
Life, bam.

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:02.856
Damn, that's beautiful.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.191
I don't want to starve anymore.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:08.895
I want to live.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.835
I want to enjoy my life.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:17.103
I want to be healthy.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.742
I can't allow my body
to deteriorate again.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.252
Feels right.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:35.088
Feels very right.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:38.424
[music playing]

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.310
Look who's here.

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.815
The main reason I'm tapping out
is I'm taking care of my body,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:03.917
straight and simple.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.020
After Patagonia, my
journey was interrupted.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.988
There was like
months, three months,

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:12.892
where it was difficult
to digest food.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:17.263
That was like, oh, I
can push myself too far.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:21.200
Oh, OK, got to be aware
of my physical well-being.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.869
I don't want that
to happen here.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.071
I want to just sort of walk
right into the next step,

00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:27.774
and right now, it feels
perfect, feels good.

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:38.585
Two completely
different tap outs.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.854
This one definitely
feels better.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:45.525
It was much nicer to take
myself out of the picture,

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:50.797
much easier, much
more empowering.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.465
It's not in me to
push myself like I

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:53.800
did in Patagonia anymore.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.902
That is not in me.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.571
That is not what I want.

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:03.710
I did my best, and I'm proud
of everything I've done,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.081
and I am happy.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.216
I definitely think this
go around has changed me.

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:14.454
I think it's helped me
to look at myself in more

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:19.025
of a responsible manner
and look at my actions

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:21.260
with more understanding of--

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.962
I do have an effect
on the world.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.570
What do I need to do to
make that a positive effect?
