00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.270
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.403
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:14.535
(upbeat synth music)

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.120
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.280
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.420
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.680
Our guest today is Sylvia Earle,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.660
who is the president of the SEA Alliance,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.800
founder of Mission Blue,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.750
and Explorer-in-Residence

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350
at the National Geographic Society.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.350
She is the 2011 Hitchcock
Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.630
Ms. Earle, welcome, Dr.
Earle, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.463
- Great to be here.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.820
- Was it inevitable that you would pursue

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.820
a degree in science once you
went to college and university?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.976
- I think the pattern was set
when I was five years old.

00:01:14.976 --> 00:01:16.590
(both laugh)

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.070
Or maybe sooner.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.630
Maybe it was that wave that did it.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.200
- And what did you do
your dissertation on?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.220
- The marine algae in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.810
Mostly one big group, the brown algae.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.340
And that was preceded
by working on the green,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.220
the division of green algae

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.400
in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.340
So I was just working my
through that whole suite

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.390
of photosynthetic creatures in the sea.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.507
- And who was your greatest inspiration

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:48.870
as a graduate student?

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.703
- Well, that's easy.

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:51.360
That was Harold Humm.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.910
He taught a class in marine biology

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.600
at Florida State University
in the summer months,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.820
and I was fortunate to
be one of the students

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.450
in a class of eight during the
second class that he taught.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.370
It was 1953

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.350
at the Alligator Harbor Marine Laboratory.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.260
We lived at the laboratory.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.010
So 24 hours a day for eight
weeks we just soaked it up.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.763
That's where I first had
a chance to try scuba.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.863
OSHA would not approve, but
OSHA didn't exist at the time.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.460
So we were just free to do a lot of things

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.030
that today students are
constrained from doing

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.630
without a lot of rigmarole.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.420
But we were allowed to drive
boats, to jump in the water,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.910
to try out diving equipment that was new.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.870
We had two of the first scuba
tanks in the country, 1953.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.270
Big double-hosed regulators,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.180
and instruction was very
simple, breathe naturally,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.700
and then were dumped over the side.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.890
And it worked.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.130
We didn't die.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.663
We came back, I did, all of us did,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.683
totally hooked on ocean exploration.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.360
- If one looks at your
career, it's very interesting

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.360
how the evolution came about.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.860
You start as a research
scientist, you become an explorer,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.803
you become somebody who
runs a technology company.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.450
What is the key here?

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.310
Is it this wanting to learn

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.390
and uncovering one problem after another

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.213
which sort of leads you into
an additional career path?

00:03:35.213 --> 00:03:40.000
- Yeah, I think that's true with everyone.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.680
You start out a blank sheet

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.813
and things come into your brain,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.963
and if you really are receptive,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.020
there are no holds barred.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.140
You can, in a free country, fortunately,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.780
I happened in a free country,

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.210
where options are there for you to take,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.520
whether you're tall, short, young, old,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.973
male, female, whatever your skin color.

00:04:12.005 --> 00:04:15.740
The limits are mainly imposed

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.620
by what you think you can or can't do.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.690
I mean, yes, there's
some serious limitations

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.210
when you don't have resources,

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.350
but again, free country.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.660
You can figure out the ways
and means to solve problems.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.903
I think I took seriously
that word commencement.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.620
Eighth grade, okay, commencement.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.050
Now it begins, now the next step begins.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.780
You go to high school.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.280
There's another commencement
and you begin again.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.600
And then there's college and
there's another commencement.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.283
And so it just keeps rolling forward.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.020
I think Goethe said it:
it's not enough to know.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.473
You must also act.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.030
Knowing is critical, and when
you think you've done it all,

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.660
I got through high school, yahoo.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.900
But that really should
just be the beginning.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.080
You've got the tools to learn how to learn

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.963
and keep learning and keep doing.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.590
So that's how it is.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.223
I wish I could live a thousand years.

00:05:22.223 --> 00:05:24.840
- So in a way it's after the safe landing,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.540
it's time to take off again.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.373
- Yes.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.750
Oh yes, armed with the new stuff

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.403
that you've acquired.

00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:38.220
- If we look at your many careers,

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.480
and let's start as a research scientist,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.820
what do you see as both the skillset,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:46.740
the minimal skillset required,

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.620
and also, what qualities of character?

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.510
We've obviously discussed some

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.481
of the second part of that equation,

00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:59.481
but what can you tell us
looking back at your career?

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.623
Skillset.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.483
- I think having an open mind is critical.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.613
I think as a scientist,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.020
you're obliged to observe carefully

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.943
and report honestly what you see.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.010
I think increasingly there
should be an obligation

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.550
to communicate as widely as possible,

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.670
not just to your learned colleagues,

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.490
but to anybody you can get to listen.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.490
Part of the reason I think that
science is underappreciated

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.250
in the United States
and maybe in the world

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.220
is because scientists
have this lofty attitude,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.940
some do, not all,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.950
but it sorta comes with the territory.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.100
I experienced it

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.480
when I was involved with
the Tektite project in 1970.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.670
I really took that
opportunity on as a scientist.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.340
There was a notice on
the bulletin board saying

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.290
that there was an opportunity
to live underwater

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.930
as a scientist, to conduct
research of your own choosing.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.540
All you had to do was submit a proposal.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.090
You might be chosen to live two weeks

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.850
on a coral reef down in the Florida Keys,

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.860
all expenses paid. (laughs)

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.870
You weren't paid to do it,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.970
but you could be supported
to do this wonderful thing.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.960
- And this was in 1970, right?

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.587
- [Sylvia] It was actually 1969.

00:07:28.587 --> 00:07:29.420
- '69.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.980
- The project took place in 1970,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.840
and four researchers were chosen

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:40.610
in 1969, more or less as human guinea pigs

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.980
to prove that you could live underwater.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.050
They actually stayed for
two months underwater

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.980
and they were subjected to
all sorts of medical tests.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.730
And they did do research projects,

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.190
but that wasn't the major point.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.950
The major point was that they
were the research project,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.410
to see how they behaved, how they reacted,

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.170
physiologically,
psychologically, and otherwise.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.960
Part of this was of interest to NASA

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.630
because people had not
then lived in space.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.287
There were certainly no women astronauts,

00:08:09.287 --> 00:08:11.960
and the space Skylab and the space station

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.190
was still out there in the future.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.930
But they were very
interested in how humans

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.353
would behave in isolation.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:21.220
- And at this time, there were,

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.463
for this government-funded proposal,

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.540
there were a number of applicants

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.840
and the government didn't know what to do

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.250
with a project that had men and women,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.530
so what was their solution?

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.510
- They didn't expect women to apply.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.060
They didn't even bother to say,
women, this is for men only.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.170
There were no women astronauts.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.050
It just didn't occur to them

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:49.120
to say, only men, this is only for men.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.160
And when some women did
apply, I was one of them,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.963
and the qualifications
as scientists, as divers,

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.150
was right up there with
the men who applied.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.450
The decision came down to, well,

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:06.750
shall we allow women or not?

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.570
And the head of the
program, Dr. James Miller,

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.240
I think he had a good
relationship with his wife.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.993
I think he had a really good mom.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.803
Because when it finally
came to him to decide,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.423
he said, well, half the fish are female.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.020
I guess we could put up with a few women.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.927
He actually allegedly said that,

00:09:30.927 --> 00:09:33.913
but that's the story
that comes down anyway.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.080
So they let us participate

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.030
and then came the other question:

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.250
men and women living together?

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.120
The phrase that I heard, and
this is true, I did hear it,

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.144
they were worried about
hanky-panky on the reef.

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:52.280
(laughs) Men and women living
together in close quarters?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.660
- Getting ideas from the fish.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.780
- Yeah right, exactly.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.670
And this was 1970.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.043
So attitudes have changed a lot.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.880
Young women today

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.960
really, at least in the United States,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.830
cannot appreciate how
exceptional it was at the time.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.740
And it's because of the exceptional nature

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.550
of having not just women
participate, but a women's team,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.620
all women, that's what they decided to do,

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.530
to have five women, and I
got to be the leader of it,

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.740
to put the spotlight on it.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.830
And I think the program as a whole

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.920
really took advantage of the fact

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.653
that the press was interested.

00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:42.660
And we became the spokesmen,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.000
spokeswomen, spokespersons,
for the project in a way.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.860
So although there were 50 people involved

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:53.580
with the Tektite program, the women's team

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.130
got a disproportionate
amount of the attention.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.230
I have a book this thick of the clippings

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.910
from all over the world.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.630
We had a ticker tape
parade down State Street.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.950
We got to ride in the car

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.300
that was especially built for the pope

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.750
when he went to Chicago years before,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.620
fur-lined and with Mayor Daly.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.280
And the open ticker tape parade.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.550
I mean, imagine for
divers, for scientists.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.470
It was just extraordinary.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.730
- I have a question that comes to mind

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.730
as I traced your career,
and it is the thought,

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.400
what do you in retrospect see
women bringing to the table

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.670
in terms of insights,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.623
way of acting as you deal with the oceans,

00:11:37.674 --> 00:11:40.860
that actually draws on their strengths

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.483
and their differences?

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.640
- Well, for a while I was
annoyed at the thought

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.500
that there are differences.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.610
I wanted to be regarded as a
scientist first and foremost,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.500
pure and simple.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.190
It's my mind, you fools, that matters.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.433
It's what I can do.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.685
And I said, and Life
Magazine quoted me as saying,

00:12:07.685 --> 00:12:09.947
"The only thing that men can do down there

00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:12.059
"that women can't is grow beards."

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:13.180
(both laugh)

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.730
Well, it isn't quite like that.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.290
There's a whole spectrum, a continuum,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.480
of capacity for strength,

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.560
for the physical characteristics

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.790
that set men and women apart.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.620
But I think there are some attributes

00:12:36.989 --> 00:12:38.560
that are special to women

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.660
and attributes that are special to men.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.540
I don't think it has anything to do

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.300
with mathematical capability

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.580
or whatever some have managed to inject

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.160
into our society as men can
do this and women can't.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.910
Men are better managers than women.

00:13:01.945 --> 00:13:03.945
There is something, I think, about women

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:07.730
with families having children,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.660
the investment that women
make with their own bodies

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.423
to create the next generation.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.940
Less inclined to see young people

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.320
go off to become cannon fodder for war

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.330
because you appreciate what
it takes to make a child,

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:32.643
appreciate that special nature

00:13:34.514 --> 00:13:36.400
of family.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:41.370
They say educate a man, you educate a man.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.040
You educate a woman, you educate a family.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.300
There's something about the giving nature

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.853
that comes with being put in that role.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.230
You have to be attentive for
nine months, more or less,

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.300
plus you're the principle
caregiver at the early stages,

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.320
just because it's the
nature of nature to be that.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.940
And that probably has something to do

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.600
with shaping the way women behave,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.033
even if you aren't a mother.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.470
And it isn't unique to women.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.020
I'm totally conscious

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.600
of their really, caring
invested men as well.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.090
But there is something
about the role that women

00:14:24.277 --> 00:14:27.970
are necessarily put into
as the primary caregivers

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.733
at the earliest stages of being moms.

00:14:33.081 --> 00:14:34.603
- You're down in the water,

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.610
you're living there,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.720
and one gets the sense

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.670
in what you've written about this

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.293
that there is kind of
an awakening of insight.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.610
Talk about that.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.590
You're in a neighborhood

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:56.800
and you're watching
the fish and the plants

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.193
and you're sort of able
to identify individuality.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.880
- I had a chance to do two
programs with Fred Rogers,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.940
Mr. Rogers, diving down
in the Florida Keys.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.260
Only took a day with Fred Rogers,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.860
he was predisposed to see the
things in his special way,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.060
but after we came back from a day

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.900
of swimming around, looking at angelfish

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.360
and groupers and snappers

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.120
and little damselfish,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.200
we're having dinner, and
both Fred Rogers and I

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.630
were a little bit late coming to dinner,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.690
and all the film crew and the others

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.830
involved with this project,
from the Sanctuary program

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.550
and all the rest, were
busily having dinner

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.700
and most of them were eating fish.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:43.370
And in his Fred Rogers kind of way,

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.540
he just went around from person to person,

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.900
saying, and this was
just as nice as could be,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.247
he says, "I just can't believe
that you're having fish

00:15:53.247 --> 00:15:55.540
"after what we've been doing today."

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.710
We were in the fishes'
neighborhood, as you say,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.040
and we were looking at individuals.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.150
And I guess I did point out to him

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.130
that every angelfish was different.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.750
Every one has a different face.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.700
And I first came to really appreciate that

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.350
living underwater during
the Tektite project in 1970.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.570
I'd been diving all over the place

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.250
for years before that, starting in '53.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:25.910
I had at least a thousand
hours already acquired by 1970.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.940
So I should have seen what
finally came into focus

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.160
when day and night, I
got to see the same fish

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.690
in that same area, but every one

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.690
behaved a little bit
differently from their...

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.080
Other members of the same species.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.140
So I began to pick up on this,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.120
realizing that it's not just every fish.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.603
We see it with people.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.460
It's staggering to think that every human

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.800
who's ever been or ever will be

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.490
is different from every other one,

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.120
even identical twins or
triplets or whatever.

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.980
That every cat, every dog, every horse,

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.580
every cow, every zebra.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.730
You look at a whole herd of zebras.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.310
At first glance they all kinda look alike,

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.960
but you really line them up,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.870
no two has stripes on their
faces or their bodies,

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.150
and they don't behave the same, either.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:22.470
That's a staggering thought.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:23.980
But the equally staggering thought

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:25.970
is how much we have in common.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.970
Zebras, humans, jellyfish,
pine trees, ferns,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.880
whatever it is, the chemistry of life

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.090
that holds us together.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.503
It's remarkably similar.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.990
And that...

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.050
That to me are the two
big miracles of life.

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.790
- At one point you were
quoted as having said,

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.420
well, oh, that's the fish that lives

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.560
- There.
- at the rock, or over there.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.503
Basically.

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:59.500
And it's striking that because most of us

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.910
don't go into the ocean,

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:06.910
we can't experience
the totality and the...

00:18:12.101 --> 00:18:14.597
The qualities of these creatures.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.490
- Well, a lot of fish, curiously,

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:20.360
well, not so curiously.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.310
It's what I would expect,
knowing what I now know.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.690
A lot of crustaceans,

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:29.000
a lot of creatures on
the land and in the sea

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.253
are homebodies.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.390
They have a specific range.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.470
They may leave, but they come back.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.980
They come back to the
same place repeatedly.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.640
That's even true

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.210
of tunas that range
over thousands of miles

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:47.350
in the course of a single year.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.410
They come back to the same places.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.190
Turtles, they go away for 10 years,

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:55.510
but they come back to
the same nesting beaches,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.633
from the same places where
they hatched as little turtles.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.230
The home range that really counts

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.280
is this little blue speck in the universe.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.080
This is our home,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.830
and we range here and there

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.290
over greater or lesser distances,

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.963
but this is home for all of us.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.960
- To appreciate this in the ocean,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.297
you have to go into the ocean.

00:19:23.297 --> 00:19:25.290
- I think so.
- Most people don't do that,

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:30.290
and some would say, well,
this is really courageous.

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:35.163
Somebody like Sylvia Earle
is a real risk-taker.

00:19:36.656 --> 00:19:37.960
What's your answer to that,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.110
and if it's true that you have
to have courage to do this,

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.523
how is that nurtured?

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.330
- I don't think of it as taking risk.

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.720
I think the biggest risk is not going,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.620
and if you don't like to get wet

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.270
or if you have problems
with your ears or whatever,

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.670
actually there are other
ways than just diving.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.170
Submersibles are coming into their own.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.010
I expect there will be Hertz
Rent a Sub one of these days,

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.310
but already there are passenger submarines

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.400
that enable you to buy a ticket

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.870
and cruise down in the company of anybody

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.730
who wants to go underwater,
to go to 50 meters or so.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:18.720
In Hawaii, in the Red
Sea, in various places

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.970
around the world you can now do this.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.680
You can even go to, in a few
places, to a thousand feet,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.030
like the Cayman Islands
has had an operation

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.900
in place for years.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.910
You can buy a ticket, get
into a little submarine,

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.530
go down along a wall,

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.800
see a cross-section of life on Earth,

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.710
right there, presented for you to enjoy.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.400
Or you can go to an aquarium,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.850
another way to get acquainted
with life in the sea

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.580
without getting wet.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.420
Aquariums are getting much better,

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.920
so much better that I almost

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.430
have this vision of fish lining up outside

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.730
to get inside the Monterey
Aquarium, for example,

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.770
because they make it
so easy, so attractive,

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.050
for the creatures that they take care of.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.490
They think like fish,
they think like barnacles,

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.080
they think like, what does it
take to keep a barnacle happy?

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.830
And then they provide it.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.943
- But back when you went underwater,

00:21:17.793 --> 00:21:18.880
was it a lot riskier,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.680
or is it, you just didn't think about it?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.110
- I didn't think of it as being risky.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.410
I thought of it as being a passport

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.563
to something really
wonderful and irresistible.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.900
My mother waited until she was 81

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.270
to actually put on a mask and fins

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.290
in a beautiful place in Bonaire,

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.840
where the water's clear and warm

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.380
and you could walk in from the beach.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.880
And once she had seen what was there...

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.750
She'd been to aquariums and
she'd seen lots of photographs,

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:57.620
but that personal experience
really made her cross with me.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.010
Why didn't you get me in the water sooner?

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.000
And I thought I had tried, but I...

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.840
I guess I didn't try hard enough.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.320
But I keep trying now with people

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.460
and take her message out there.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.823
If you are 81, don't wait any longer.

00:22:10.823 --> 00:22:11.690
(both laugh)

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.900
If you aren't yet 81,
don't wait any longer.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.888
This is the time.

00:22:14.888 --> 00:22:16.495
We have the opportunity to go.

00:22:16.495 --> 00:22:20.470
- So in a way it's a curiosity,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.570
and then once you've been there

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:24.622
then the wonder of what you see--

00:22:24.622 --> 00:22:25.529
- It's addictive.

00:22:25.529 --> 00:22:26.362
- Then it's--
- It's addictive.

00:22:26.362 --> 00:22:29.493
- Yeah, just why not again.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:32.520
Do you have a measure

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:37.520
of how many underwater
expeditions you've done?

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.230
- Well, the time underwater is something

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.270
in excess of 7,000 hours.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.910
The number of expeditions,

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.860
well, lots and lots.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.250
I've been involved with
more than a hundred.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:54.420
An expedition is something
more than just going out

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.790
on a Saturday afternoon,
although that can qualify,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.550
depending on what it is.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.360
For example, I considered it an expedition

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.770
to go with James Cameron
in the Russian Mir sub

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.410
to the bottom of Lake Baikal.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:10.680
Now, it was just a day,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.280
but it is a day that
will stay with me forever

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.920
because it was this
great piece of machinery

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.710
that enabled me to go

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:24.520
with the great explorer,

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.220
filmmaker,

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.050
polymath, if you will, James Cameron,

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.980
and the designer of
the submersible itself,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.230
Anatoly Sagalevich, Russian engineer,

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.100
spokesperson for the ocean.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.470
Been to the North Pole, the
real North Pole, that is,

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.790
15,000 feet down at the
bottom of the North Pole,

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:45.623
the real North Pole.

00:23:45.623 --> 00:23:48.490
And this was just last year.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.150
So that was an expedition
that I will treasure.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.840
But other expeditions can last for a week

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.720
or two weeks or a month, whatever it is.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.670
But I've had the pleasure
of putting together

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:03.130
and participating in lots
of adventures of that sort.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.890
Not just waiting for
somebody to invite me,

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.170
although I'm always receptive
when I can to participate.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.890
But the thing about, again, being a human,

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.543
you don't have to wait to be asked.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.300
I suppose that's why I
started those companies.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.343
I started three.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:27.690
I was not happy with the equipment
that exists, so why wait?

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.870
Why not team up with
engineers to start a company?

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.940
I didn't know what I didn't know.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.490
Great education, launching
yourself as a scientist

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:41.840
into this world of being an entrepreneur

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.910
and learning law, learning accounting,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.820
learning how to make payroll,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:49.923
learning how to balance the books.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.060
I guess a good start for
me was being an ecologist,

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.170
knowing that you have
to balance the books.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.090
Nature always does,

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.180
and as an entrepreneur,
you have to do that, too,

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.430
even if it means mortgaging your house.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.198
- In looking and reflecting
back on your career,

00:25:08.198 --> 00:25:12.320
one sees that there are
several trajectories

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.153
coming together.

00:25:13.153 --> 00:25:17.290
One is curiosity, all that
you got from your family.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.760
The other is...

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.763
The opportunities opening up for women.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.110
But thirdly, it's really technology.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.420
- Oh, absolutely.
- So you've ridden

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.460
a wave of technology,
and in the beginning,

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.130
you're a beneficiary of technology,

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.150
but then you move into the realm

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.063
of actually helping to
create the technology.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.980
You were talking about that just then,

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.940
but what is navigating that like?

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.760
- Well, it's the joy of
being alive, I suppose

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.260
and being receptive to
what's going on around you.

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:00.410
Building new generations of submersibles

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.150
to have access to the sea.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.860
It is so frustrating to know

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.080
the magnitude of what we don't know

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.723
about this blue speck in the universe,

00:26:14.893 --> 00:26:17.890
and to understand that part of the reason

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.080
that people aren't just all over the place

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.050
trying to get into the ocean
is that they don't know,

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.140
they don't see it.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.450
They don't see what I see,

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.240
don't grasp the significance
of life in the sea

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.980
and the need we have to protect it.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.530
First we have to understand it.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:36.920
While I've witnessed the big inroads

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.790
that we're making into
our life support system,

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.170
altering the nature of nature,

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.504
and we're doing it in ignorance.

00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:50.040
A big frustration, watching
people really excited

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.980
about going high in the
sky, and I'm among them,

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.720
I love that, being able
to look back and see

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.260
Earth from space and to
have the ability to fly

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.720
all over the world and hone the technology

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.720
to communicate in ways, to
be able to find your place

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.750
on the planet.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.550
I lived through the time
when you couldn't get back

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.850
to the same place underwater twice

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.550
unless you were really lucky.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:21.200
Our ability to navigate,
to find places in the sea,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.200
to be able to track a course
and repeat that course

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.560
over the surface, let
alone under the ocean.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.840
These are all developments

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.890
of the latter part of the 20th century.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:36.197
Ironically driven largely by war,

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.840
by conflict.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.633
We wanna get the edge on the enemy.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.163
It's true with aviation
and aerospace as well.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:50.360
And with military needs,

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.450
the spillover into science and exploration

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.430
is coming, but it's a little slow.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.610
Much better maps of the ocean

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:02.100
in the secret places of the
military than we have available

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.900
to those of who want to know
the ocean for other reasons.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.080
- It's an interesting problem,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.440
because what drives technology

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.653
if it's a military purpose,

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.880
then that's different
from driving technology

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.540
and creating technology based
on the needs of exploration,

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.440
curiosity, knowing, and so on.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.620
And you actually, in
starting this company,

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.370
then began working with engineers

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.370
and giving to them ideas
about what you wanted to do,

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.180
if you wanted to turn in the water

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.026
or swim like a fish or whatever, that you-

00:28:52.026 --> 00:28:55.150
- To pick things up without
crushing them. (chuckles)

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.680
- And so that, hey, that's
what we really need,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.950
and what was that interface
like with engineers?

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.330
I mean, you really moved
the technology along.

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:06.980
- Well, part of it actually began

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.060
in discussions with one of
my favorite engineers ever,

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.630
and that's Ed Link,

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:16.250
who was first smitten with aviation.

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:20.470
He developed the Link Trainer that pilots

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.170
owe their lives to.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.960
This was a way to train without
actually going up in the sky

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.270
and falling out of the sky,
sometimes disastrously.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.710
But to have an on the ground replica

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:33.730
of what the cockpit was
like, to learn the motion

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.440
through a simulator.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.080
Flight simulators.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.350
And then he turns his attention to the sea

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:43.430
and developed the Johnson
Sea Link submersibles,

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:48.430
and prior to that working with John Perry

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.410
to develop a submarine
that you could swim out of,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:53.853
a lockout submarine.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:58.190
This goes back to the
1960s, this great explosion

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.210
of interest in living underwater,

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:02.250
submersibles that could take people down.

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:06.480
Anyway, I was invited
to go on the Man in Sea,

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.420
I think I was the only woman
in the Man in Sea project,

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.480
in 1968 to try locking out

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:18.060
of that little submarine
called the Deep Diver.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.810
I was actually expecting my
youngest daughter at that time,

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.680
and she attributes her love of the ocean

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.970
for saying, well, I
locked out of a submarine

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:28.910
before I was born,

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:32.073
and so of course I had to
naturally love the ocean.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.680
Anyway, so after that
Ed Link wanted to know,

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.743
okay, so I've got this wonderful machine.

00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:40.930
What can I do with it?

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:44.390
Give me some ideas about science projects

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.340
that could be conducted

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.873
from this wonderful gift to science.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.510
So he invented the tool and then said,

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.833
how can we use this tool?

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.160
So I was among those who had the great fun

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.210
of figuring out, so, we have this means

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.940
of getting down to a thousand
feet beneath the surface

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.320
and then swimming out of it,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.350
And as a diver, as a scientist,

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.670
using the ocean as a laboratory.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.130
And then when the Johnson
Sea Link, a pair of them,

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.700
were developed, I again had a chance

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.520
to be among the first to lock out

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.310
of this beautiful new piece of equipment

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.800
that has continued to operate until,

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.590
and it's still operating,
but unfortunately

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:29.780
this country gave away,

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.310
it didn't give it away, but those assets,

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.950
the two Johnson Sea Links,
were sold to Petrobras,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:38.720
a Brazilian oil company.

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.410
So we don't really have that kind of asset

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.850
in this country at this point in time.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.763
The Alvin submersible.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.570
I've tried now about 30
different kinds of submersibles,

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.600
haven't yet tried the Alvin,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.020
although lots of scientists have.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.330
It's the workhorse of access to the sea

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.470
down to the average depth of the ocean,

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.910
two and a half miles.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:04.610
The Alvin is currently out of commission,

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:07.080
but it's getting refitted to be able

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.280
to resume a new life
with a new pressure hull

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.091
and all the great assets

00:32:13.091 --> 00:32:16.620
that engineering and science together

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:21.620
have developed over the last
40 years or so, 50 years.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.070
- What we need, it seems,

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.270
is government investment

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.963
in exploring this part of the world.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.289
But that hasn't come, so--

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:38.220
- Yet.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.110
- Yet.

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.300
But it's like there's a catch-22 here,

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.070
that we can't appreciate the oceans

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.540
and realize the damage
we're doing unless we see,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.540
but we need the money to
invest in the equipment to see.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:59.370
So how do you account for the fact

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:03.690
that the government has been
willing to explore the stars,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.340
go into outer space,

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.150
but it seems constrained

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:13.150
in this greater adventure here on Earth?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.610
- Well, there are a lot of...

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.420
Possible answers to that.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:22.070
I had lunch once years ago

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:26.790
with that great
stateswoman and playwright,

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.090
ambassador, lots of
things, Clare Boothe Luce,

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.260
at her home in Hawaii.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.300
And I put the question to her:

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:38.670
why is it that we are so drawn

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.050
to aviation and aerospace

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.850
and why are we neglecting the ocean?

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:43.940
What's going on here?

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.730
And she said, "It's simple, my dear,"

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.590
looking up at these puffy white clouds

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:50.930
that were floating by.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.037
She said, "Heaven is there

00:33:53.037 --> 00:33:54.722
"and you know what's in
the other direction."

00:33:54.722 --> 00:33:55.555
(laughs)

00:33:55.555 --> 00:33:58.280
There's this mindset that good is up

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.280
and bad is down.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:04.270
And I think there may be some
psychological truth to that,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.743
but there's something more.

00:34:07.131 --> 00:34:09.330
Another really good
friend, also in Hawaii,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:13.490
John Craven, who is another polymath.

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.283
Engineer, really skilled in law,

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:21.673
he was involved with
the Navy for many years.

00:34:23.047 --> 00:34:25.910
The dark side of the Navy
that you can't talk about.

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:29.690
Chief scientist for the
Polaris missile program.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.080
He was the one working
with Admiral Rickover

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.480
about nuclear submarines

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.720
and the force behind the NR-1,

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.330
the Navy's research nuclear submarine.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.960
He has written a book

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.700
trying to kind of apologize to the...

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.640
More than that, it celebrates,

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.270
but the mostly men involved with the Navy

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.950
who dedicated their lives

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.900
to ocean exploration and the
development of technologies

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.390
that have made possible

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.060
a great knowledge base about the sea,

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.013
but they're not talking about it.

00:35:07.013 --> 00:35:09.513
It's all secret stuff.

00:35:10.876 --> 00:35:12.820
And it's sad,

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.920
but there are heroes
that we can't celebrate

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.590
the way we celebrate the astronauts

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.503
because they're behind closed doors.

00:35:23.869 --> 00:35:26.880
Some of the benefits, think
of the many technologies

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.570
we now have for navigation,

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.410
for so much surveillance,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.050
and it's a combination
of what's up in the sky

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.270
and what's under the sea.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.140
This whole network, the listening stations

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:42.420
that we didn't know about for years

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.890
that were developed to
listen for enemy submarines,

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:50.780
now they have enabled
scientists to track whales,

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.740
to understand the importance
of sound in the sea

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:57.260
that scientists would not have the budget

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.830
to put the billions of dollars
into this listening station

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.550
so we can tune into the little tweaks

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:07.610
that submarines make or
ships on the surface, too.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:09.680
But that investment has been made.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.060
Just as much of the
investment in satellites

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.620
is not for domestic benefits,

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.960
but for military purposes.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.740
But everyone has been the
beneficiary of the investment

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.060
made for security reasons.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.070
But not all of the benefits
have been made known.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.730
There's still this treasure chest

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.010
of wonderful new insight
about technologies

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:38.570
that we don't yet have access to.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.143
So what do we do?

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.510
We tap into the private
resources that are there.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.400
We've got Jim Cameron now
taking what he has earned

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.940
as a filmmaker, as an entrepreneur,

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.033
as a businessman.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.820
Richard Branson, same thing.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:02.540
Using his wealth to
invest in pushing the edge

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.080
of new technologies, pulling from things

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.700
that have come to us from
those who have invested

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.720
from the past, but pulling it all together

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:14.505
and not being afraid to commit to looking

00:37:14.505 --> 00:37:17.130
where nations, governments, taxpayers,

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:18.340
are not making the investment.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.540
Individuals are.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.083
And eventually,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.860
we will see nations catching on.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.730
In fact, they are.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:33.730
I mean, China is building a
7,000-meter Sea Dragon sub

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.660
to go deeper than anybody
else now can go in the sea.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.063
India is developing a 6,000-meter sub.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.600
Russia has three.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.230
The United States has exactly zero.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.920
We aren't making that investment.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.250
But the entrepreneurs,

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.250
the businessmen, the visionaries,

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:58.310
are using their personal
wealth to fill the gap.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.690
And that in a very small, modest sense

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:02.170
is what I tried to do

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.830
in starting Deep Ocean Engineering,

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.930
Deep Ocean Technology, and then finally,

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:09.510
the company that now still exists.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.720
It's Deep Ocean Exploration and Research,

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.370
D-O-E-R marine operations

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.670
that I no longer have anything to do with,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:21.270
but my daughter and
son-in-law own and operate

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.230
and are continuing in that same spirit,

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.270
that same mode of trying
to make a difference

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:29.763
while at the same time making a living.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.220
- It would seem, then,
that if we're concerned

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.400
about global governance of the oceans,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.330
which, because of the things
that we're doing to the ocean

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:47.330
in the way of taking out
and putting in bad stuff,

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:52.070
the key is gonna be
some sort of governance

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:53.610
that nations agree--
- Has to be.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.240
- So do you have any thoughts

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.067
about how this dynamic is gonna work?

00:38:58.067 --> 00:39:02.140
In one sense, national
security is denying us--

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.540
- And international security.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.270
- Yeah, are denying us the
opportunities of the sea,

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.220
but we have to understand the sea

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.050
for the public education

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:16.060
to really have a kinda global insights

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.840
in the way you have developed them

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.910
as an individual and as a scientist.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.680
So there's a conundrum here.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.680
- [Sylvia] There is.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.832
- You've committed yourself
to public education.

00:39:28.832 --> 00:39:29.930
- [Sylvia] Partly.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:34.070
- Yeah, to awakening people
to the set of problems

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.363
that relate to the ocean.

00:39:37.538 --> 00:39:40.350
What should we be doing in working toward

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.403
to make the kind of changes
that seem necessary?

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.110
- I personally am driven
by an awareness that...

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.850
Nature matters.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.130
That our lives depend on
maintaining the integrity

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:58.403
of the planet that works in our favor.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:02.960
All preceding history, four
and a half billion years,

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.540
Earth was not hospitable for us

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:10.090
until fairly recent times,
geologically speaking.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.150
Go back a billion years,

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.220
there's lots of water on
the planet, lots of life,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:19.203
but Earth wouldn't be
suitable to support us.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.823
It's amazing that we,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.313
in a very short period of time,

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:31.070
have kind of reversed that trend,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:35.720
this long history, a planet
that works in our favor,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.580
and now in a few decades
we're making it work

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.270
in a way that's not in our favor.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.180
What are we thinking?

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.460
This is the first time
in history, first time.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.320
Didn't know even in the
middle of the 20th century

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.600
what we now know.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.590
The capacity to hold
the world in our hands,

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:53.500
to see that nature matters,

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.210
that what we're doing to the atmosphere,

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:56.790
what we're doing to the fabric of life,

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:58.060
what we're doing to the systems

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.993
that generate the oxygen that we count on,

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:05.260
the systems that we count on
to grab the carbon dioxide

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.260
out of the atmosphere,

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.480
the systems that hold the planet steady.

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.190
The chemistry of the
planet depends in the end

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:17.490
on each and every little microbe,

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.860
every elephant, every whale,
every raccoon, every human,

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.220
whatever it is, that we
all have an influence

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.840
on the world around us.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.130
But there's one species that is just

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.130
kinda run away with things,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.630
and altering the way the world works

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.480
and happening in a very
short period of time.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.380
And it's knowing that that drives me

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:42.830
to do everything I can
in every way that I can,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:46.330
education, call that
communication, whatever it is,

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.350
to get people to see it for themselves.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:50.540
It's not a big deal.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.070
We're not making this up.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:55.720
Information is accessible now

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.660
for the first time to the world.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.860
Anywhere in the world you can,

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.190
thanks to Google and other technology

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.160
that I have embraced with my whole heart,

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.830
along with a companion technology,

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:12.400
this company called ESRI,

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.460
where you take data from
here, from here, from here.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.750
It's looking at the world as an ecologist,

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.890
with layers of information.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.020
And then you step back and you see okay,

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.490
how does the water affect
where the trees are,

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.920
where the people are.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.160
And if you want to put
a factory or a school

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.290
or a community, well, first let's look

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:36.890
at how the world works.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.170
Where does the water flow?

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:40.150
Where are other people?

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.010
Where are the transportation lines?

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:45.260
What impact does that
have on the downstream?

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.150
Anyway, now we know,

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:51.633
and now we can look at
the world with new eyes.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.690
In 2006, which wasn't that long ago,

00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.520
I attended a conference in Spain.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.090
The person who had much to do

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:05.780
with the development of Google Earth,

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.780
in fact, its predecessor,
called Keyhole, John Hanke,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.470
the company Keyhole was acquired by Google

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:16.610
and became Google Earth.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:19.130
I downloaded Keyhole to my computer

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.170
when it existed like that,
paid my 600 bucks to do it,

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.560
and then I paid my
second round of 600 bucks

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.683
when Google wasn't free, now it is,

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.883
so that I could do this wonderful thing:

00:43:32.730 --> 00:43:34.430
look at my computer screen.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.780
Now you can you look at your cell phone

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.880
and there it is: Google Earth.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:43.180
But until 2009, you couldn't
look under the ocean.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.130
It took three years.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:48.070
I met John Hanke in 2006

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.690
at this conference in Spain.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.650
I had a chance to say why the
ocean matters in 15 minutes.

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:54.330
John Hanke had a chance to talk

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.403
about Google and Google Earth.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:43:59.913
When I saw him sitting in the front row,

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.370
I just couldn't resist.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.670
I said how much I love Google Earth

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.363
and how much my kids love
it, my grandkids love it.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.647
But I just said, "I hope
someday, John, you'll finish it,

00:44:13.647 --> 00:44:15.623
"because you've done a
great job with the land,

00:44:15.623 --> 00:44:18.146
"but you should call it Google Dirt."

00:44:18.146 --> 00:44:19.640
(both laugh)

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.140
I think it's that word that I used

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.203
that really got to John.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.760
I said, "The ocean, the
blue part, it's missing."

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.167
Later we talked and he said,

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:33.247
"Well, you're right, something is missing,

00:44:33.247 --> 00:44:35.437
"like most of the world.

00:44:35.437 --> 00:44:39.307
"Can you come down to the
Googleplex, talk to the Googlers,

00:44:39.307 --> 00:44:41.452
"and see what can we do?"

00:44:41.452 --> 00:44:43.510
And what followed was three years,

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:46.080
an advisory group of scientists,

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:48.320
about 30 from around the world,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.880
conversations with the
Navy to see how much data

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:53.200
could be pried loose that
would be publicly available

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.700
to populate Google Earth with a map,

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.360
starts with a map.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.570
In National Geographic,
we put out an atlas

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:04.510
the same year that the ocean
in Google Earth was launched,

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.970
in February of 2009.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:09.970
It was a really exciting time.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:11.710
- Tell us about what you're trying to do

00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:16.490
with your TED grant and build a network

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:21.000
of reserves in the ocean.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
- Well, 2009, February, that same time

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:28.500
that the atlas, the National
Geographic ocean atlas came out

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.190
and Google launched the
ocean in Google Earth,

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:37.540
that week I was given a chance by TED,

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:40.040
Technology, Entertainment, Design,

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.623
this amazing collection,

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:47.339
sort of a brain trust of
individuals who started

00:45:47.339 --> 00:45:50.410
in Silicon Valley in Monterey.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:52.050
It's been more than 25 years now.

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.650
They hold this annual conference

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:59.620
to give individuals a chance
to give the talk of their life.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:03.130
And when I had a call from Chris Anderson,

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.283
who looks after TED,

00:46:08.207 --> 00:46:09.520
at first my thought leaped.

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.750
I'm going to be given the chance

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:12.203
to give the talk of my life.

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:16.280
And I was, but there was more,

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.120
that I was being given a wish,

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.390
a wish that had to be big
enough to change the world.

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:25.840
And my wish, after some deliberation,

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.623
not much because it's
what I've always been,

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.390
well, for a long time,
most of my life, I guess,

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.380
wanting to protect the
ocean any way we could

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.080
or the land, too, you know, nature.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.370
But most of it's underwater.

00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:41.883
Most of it is the sea.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.250
It's where 97% of the biosphere is.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:49.910
It's being seriously neglected
and seriously affected

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.730
by our actions.

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.960
So my wish was to ignite public support,

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.330
to develop new technologies,
to explore the ocean.

00:46:59.330 --> 00:47:04.140
But most importantly, to protect the ocean

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.420
with any means that we could muster,

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:10.850
resulting in networks of protected areas.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:15.570
On the land, not enough,
but about 12% of the land

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.340
is invested in national parks, reserves,

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:22.780
places that serve as an insurance
policy against the losses

00:47:22.780 --> 00:47:25.810
that we're now seeing all over the planet.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.600
But the ocean, we've only got a fraction,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.210
well, a fraction of 1%
that is truly protected,

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:36.130
about 1% that has some form of management

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.193
with an eye toward protection.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.200
But when people say, well, okay,

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.260
how much of the ocean
do we need to protect?

00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:46.993
I respond by saying,

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:52.330
think of the ocean as the
blue heart of the planet.

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.310
How much of your heart
do you wanna protect?

00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:57.990
In effect, we have to get serious

00:47:57.990 --> 00:48:00.030
about protecting all of it,

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:05.030
because the ocean governs
the way the world works.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.740
We can certainly start

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.010
by identifying the most critical areas.

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:10.990
Where do fish spawn?

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:15.320
Where are the corridors
over which these...

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.800
Migration routes?

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.110
Barbara Block at Stanford

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:20.870
has been working now for years,

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.580
trying to figure out with her students,

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.580
where are these patterns, the
routes that tuna and swordfish

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.310
and turtles and big elephant seals

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:35.050
and other creatures travel?

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:38.610
They do come back to the same
place time and time again,

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:41.570
but they travel widely,
thousands of miles.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.670
Great white sharks travel
across the entire Pacific Ocean,

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:48.773
from California to Japan and back again,

00:48:51.297 --> 00:48:52.760
to the Farallon Islands.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.840
And we know their faces,
we know their names,

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:56.010
well, we've given them names.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.510
They may have names they give themselves,

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:02.540
but certainly we come to
recognize individuals.

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.840
So how do we protect them?

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.650
It starts with knowing

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:10.720
and information such as Barbara
Block and her colleagues

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.270
have been amassing.

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.150
We know where to avoid

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.970
these highways in the ocean.

00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.710
If we know that this
is where the whales go,

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:24.130
we can avoid the central headquarters

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:26.200
for where they pass through,

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.360
or be cautious when we cross these...

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.520
Animal shipping lanes, if you will.

00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:36.330
It's really important if we care,

00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:38.000
and we should be caring,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.020
because our lives are
linked to the same processes

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.810
that matter to the creatures in the sea.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:47.090
- And is there a hope that governments

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:49.890
will accept these designations,

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:53.320
or that people will learn about them

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.700
and then lobby their governments?

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:56.533
- Both.

00:49:56.533 --> 00:49:59.690
It takes governments to protect the ocean

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:04.330
because you can own a
chunk of land, in quotes.

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:08.210
We have, as we live our
lives as individuals,

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.570
we can take title and have responsibility

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.713
for a chunk of land.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:15.713
But in the ocean, individuals,

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:19.370
at least in our country
and most countries,

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:23.000
and some countries actually,
island countries do,

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.550
communities and even individuals,

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.750
have a say, at least over some aspects

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:28.503
of the adjacent ocean.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:34.480
But most nations now have
jurisdiction out 200 miles,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.210
so it's necessary to inspire nations

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:40.730
to do what has been done for the land,

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:45.730
to accept responsibility, not
just to give away the assets,

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:48.120
fishing rights.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.550
Go strip the ocean of
the life that's out there

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.743
and take as if it's free, which it's not.

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:58.793
Extract the systems.

00:51:00.095 --> 00:51:04.520
Oil, gas, minerals, fish,
lobsters, shrimp, whatever.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.930
We have had an attitude that it's free,

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:08.930
that it's available.

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:10.080
Even without a license

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.940
we have extracted wildlife from the sea

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:15.820
to the point that we
have lowered the level

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:17.670
of many of the creatures that we do like

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.840
to market for commodities, either as food

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.170
or as goods, oil, fertilizer, whatever.

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:27.070
The way we used to with whales.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.080
Whoever thought that whales
were owned by anybody?

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.300
They're just there up for grabs.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:37.300
In the 1600s, 1700s, 1800s,
we stripped the ocean

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:41.540
of whales and other large marine mammals,

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:45.373
thinking them primarily as goods,

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:51.270
not as something of value
as living creatures.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:53.710
Right up through much of the 20th century,

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:58.210
right up to 1972 in Richmond,

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:02.620
a whaling station that
took humpback whales.

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:05.250
A lot of people today can't imagine

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.600
a time when Californians killed whales

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:12.620
as commodities, mostly for animal food.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.650
Dog food and cat food and
the like and fertilizer.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:20.740
New Zealand killed humpback whales.

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.230
I visited the last whaling station there.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:25.800
In 1978 they had just closed it,

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.910
and South Africa, too, involved.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:29.890
Australia.

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:34.410
I visited the last whaling
station in Australia in 1978.

00:52:34.410 --> 00:52:35.810
They were killing sperm whales.

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:39.650
I saw six young male sperm whales

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:43.100
brought in and leveled down

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.990
to chunks of meat and
oil in a matter of hours.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:51.190
It took maybe 20 years to get those whales

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.460
to the point where they
were just pounds of meat

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.930
to be used as commodities.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:58.030
Well, Australia's among
the fiercest defenders

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:01.560
of whales alive today,
and so is New Zealand.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.390
The United States still allows

00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:09.510
some of the native Alaskans
to take whales, bowheads,

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.530
and a few gray whales,

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:15.500
but by and large we're not killing whales

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.200
as a matter of policy,
as a matter of principle.

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.950
In part because it doesn't
make any sense financially

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.190
to do this anymore,
and maybe it never did.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.440
To send ships all the way from Nantucket

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.060
to the Southern Hemisphere?

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.950
How do you make a viable
economic model out of that?

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:36.670
To bring back a few barrels of oil,

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:39.970
and you sacrifice lives?

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:43.750
But for a while there
was demand for whale oil

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:47.730
to illuminate our societies.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.630
But we have made the transition

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:54.160
to other forms of energy,

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.510
that now we know that maybe
these aren't working either

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:58.623
for other reasons.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.840
- One last question.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.790
Reflecting on your life,
you've made this transition

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:08.733
from research scientist
now to an activist.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:15.150
Is there a lesson that one can distill

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.260
from your life experiences

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:23.260
that would be a nugget
of advice for students?

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.800
- I haven't made any
transition, not at all.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.523
I am a scientist, first and foremost.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.500
I observe carefully.

00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:38.280
I try to report honestly what I observe.

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.470
The audience has just gotten bigger.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:44.703
I used to communicate largely
with my learned colleagues.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:48.000
It was the National
Geographic who probably

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
kicked me out of my complacency in 1970.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.290
That, plus being forced to speak

00:54:55.290 --> 00:55:00.060
in a way that I was most
uncomfortable with, in 1970

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:05.060
as a straight arrow ivory
towered scientist at Harvard,

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:08.620
imbued with the attitude

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:12.920
that if you communicate to the public,

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.990
if you write an article even
for the National Geographic,

00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:17.200
you've crossed the line.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.980
You're a popularizer.

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:23.610
And never look back, because
you aren't welcome anymore

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:26.500
as part of the club,

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.893
those who are respected as scientists.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.200
It's a phenomenon that I
think is largely passing,

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:39.823
that now scientists are encouraged,

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.880
not required, but encouraged,

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.150
to communicate with the public.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:46.580
But it was the National Geographic,

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.720
it was the Tektite project.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.010
But it was also reading a
book that was on my shelf,

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:54.600
lurking there for years that
I hadn't really taken it

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.750
in the light that I did in 1970,

00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.710
when the Geographic asked if
I'd write an article for them

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:00.903
and I first said no.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.950
And then Thomas Huxley spoke to me

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:07.330
from more than a hundred years
before, in the book called

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:11.740
Discourses Biological and Geological,

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:14.800
a collection of essays based on lectures

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.320
that he had given as a scientist.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.600
And the first essay
was on a piece of chalk

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.790
that he delivered to the carpenters union

00:56:21.790 --> 00:56:23.640
in Norwich, England,

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.220
and he talked about the history
of the North Atlantic Ocean

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:28.650
written in a piece of chalk,

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:30.500
like the chalk in the back pocket

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.000
that carpenters carried
around to make a line

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.770
before they hammered nails or whatever.

00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:37.670
And in the introduction to that book,

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:42.070
he spoke to my problem of the moment.

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:45.780
He said your fellow
scientists will scorn you

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:48.780
if you speak to the
public, but you must do it

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.623
and you must tell the truth.

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:53.990
Don't embellish.

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:55.170
Don't stretch the truth

00:56:55.170 --> 00:56:56.990
because you think it makes a better story.

00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:58.820
The best story is the truth.

00:56:58.820 --> 00:56:59.911
It is.

00:56:59.911 --> 00:57:01.711
It's the most exciting story of all.

00:57:03.097 --> 00:57:05.400
I don't think of myself as an activist.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.230
I think of myself as a scientist

00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:13.230
who will convey to the best of my ability

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:15.690
the view of what I see

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.980
and to encourage others
to go see for themselves,

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.130
because we are in a race

00:57:23.130 --> 00:57:26.030
to take the knowledge
that we have acquired

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:27.940
through all preceding history,

00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.420
and this pivotal time that we now share,

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:33.940
I tell kids they're the luckiest ever

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.120
to come on the planet
because for the first time

00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.660
we know what we know,

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.250
and it's the last best
time we'll ever have

00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:44.390
to do something about using
the power of knowledge

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:47.350
to take care of the natural world, nature,

00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:49.030
that takes care of us.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:50.480
We're in trouble.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.060
We're in trouble because
of what we're doing

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.200
to the atmosphere, to the ocean,

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:56.490
to the fabric of life.

00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:58.580
It was one thing to do it in ignorance.

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:00.890
That's all preceding history.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:02.550
But now we know.

00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:05.090
So to sit on that knowledge

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:07.480
and not do what you can while you can

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:12.840
so that in the future
you will be respected

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.370
for taking action, and if
that's being an activist,

00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:20.660
then so be it, but why would
you want to be anything else?

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:22.260
If you know something,

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.100
you see the train heading over the cliff

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.890
and you're just watching it happen,

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:29.040
are you doing everything you can to say,

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.343
hey, conductor, hey, people on the train,

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.843
do something while we have a chance.

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:39.340
- On that note, Dr.
Earle, thank you very much

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:42.750
for sharing your life
experiences with us today.

00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:44.100
- It's a start.

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.720
I hope I still have some more time.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:47.250
- Good, good.

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.710
And thank you very much for joining us

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:52.243
for this conversation with history.

00:58:53.737 --> 00:58:56.820
(upbeat synth music)
