1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:04,770
Listening to radio lab radio from

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,820
W. N Y. S. E. N. D. O. N. P. R.
Okay. Let's see. Hello? Hello. Hi,

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,440
is this Errol Morris? I think it's
me. Hello. This is Chad from, uh,

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,220
from radio lab. Hi. Thank
you for your very, very nice,

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,740
somewhat disturbing email.

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,690
What disturbed you in the
email? The term truth fascist?

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,413
No,

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,310
you called Aaron. Laura. The Truth
Fascist, right? Were we thinking I was,

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,270
I was trying to,

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,910
I wrote them an email to try and get him
to come talk to us and I don't know why

11
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:49,280
I use that is a truth fascist
that was meant lovingly,

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:54,080
I should say. Aww. Wasn't exactly the
right choice of words. Fundamentalists.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,940
Oh, I like it. But really
what I meant is it like,

14
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,910
this is a guy who's always trying
to get to the bottom of things.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,080
It's made all these documentaries a thin
blue line while you got a guy off death

16
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,850
row, actually in a thin blue line, he
made the fog of war in Vernon, Florida.

17
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,510
But I contacted him because you know,

18
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:13,080
I'd recently seen him give this talk
about this one investigation of his.

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,190
The for me is like the purest
example of the thing that drives him,

20
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,283
think it's in all of his films,

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,740
desire, relentless desire
to figure things out,

22
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:23,510
to get to truth.

23
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,290
And it all starts with a photograph.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,180
One of the very, very
first photographs of war,

25
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,090
1855 which war?

26
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,890
This is the Crimean war
that involved Great Britain,

27
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,910
France, Russia, the Ottoman Empire,

28
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,160
and believe it or not, Sardinia,

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,510
the fighting took place in what
is now basically the Ukraine.

30
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:50,620
The Russians were on one side.

31
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:53,380
Everybody else on the other
half a million people died.

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,430
It was incredibly brutal.

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,640
And there's this photograph titled
The Valley of the shadow of death.

34
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,880
It's black and white.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,160
It shows a dirt road cutting
through this landscape.

36
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,383
Just one

37
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,543
Derek road

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,400
between two hills. There's nobody in
the photograph, no birds, no trees,

39
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,600
no people. There's really nothing living
in the photograph, not even grass,

40
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,463
nothing.

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,460
But as you stare at this
road a little more closely,

42
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,760
you realize why nothing is
living in this photograph.

43
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,680
Because this road is littered with Canon

44
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,210
cannonballs everywhere.

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,050
As soon as you notice them
photographs springs to life,

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,460
you imagine this fuselage,

47
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,060
artillery fire raining
down on this landscape.

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,450
This is one really fascinating thing
about photography. It's a time machine.

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,730
There's a physical connection between
that photograph and that world

50
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,170
cause you're holding this piece of film
that was literally ripped right out of

51
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,520
that world. But the context is God.
And more importantly in this case,

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,950
you don't even know if
that picture is true.

53
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,560
What do you mean?

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,410
It turns out that this
photograph is one of a pair.

55
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,880
There is a second photograph exactly
the same as the first photograph,

56
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,720
exact same camera position,
but in this other photograph,

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,460
the cannon balls that
were on the road are gone.

58
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,220
So one has cannonballs on the road and
one has cannon balls not on the road,

59
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,570
but otherwise they're completely
identical. Yes. He thought that's weird.

60
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,920
Let me look into that.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,920
And there was a passage in any ends up
reading this essay by a Susan Sontag

62
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,830
where she talks about these
photographs as though it's just obvious

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,030
what was going on. And he was
like, oh, that word. Well,

64
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,340
I don't like the word obvious.

65
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,340
Susan Sontag was basically arguing
that the guy who took the picture,

66
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:07,960
Roger Fenton, came to an empty road,
put the cannonballs on the road.

67
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,890
He staged it. Yes, it's
obvious, but that works.

68
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Nothing's so obvious that it's obvious.

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,300
And so I started investigating

70
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,040
[inaudible]

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,130
and so began a ludicrous obsessive it,

72
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,290
but kind of sublime pursuit
of this slippery little
fact that actually inspired

73
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,560
this whole hour. So today on radio lab,

74
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:36,000
we are going to wrestle with a series of
seemingly simple facts that turn out to

75
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,580
raise complicated questions
like what is truth?

76
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,500
Is it just a pile of facts and how much
does the factor that matter matter?

77
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,040
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, back to Errol Morris.

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
I tracked down Fenton's letters
from the Crimea journals,

79
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:59,440
written records of soldiers who were
in that area at that given time,

80
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,613
didn't find much.

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
I interviewed five historians who
ordered the photograph in one way

82
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,140
saying yes, it's obvious he posted the
pictures. This is a bit of a surprise.

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,260
Order the photographs in
the opposite way. Really,

84
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,690
they told them it is actually very
possible that Fenton saw the cannonballs,

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,270
took the picture, and
then soldiers came along,

86
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,620
took the cannibals off the road to recycle
them so they could fire them back at

87
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:30,330
the rushes. Exactly. Was that
kind of recycling common practice?

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,130
Yes, indeed. It was actually.

89
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,060
So you had a tie to historian saying
you faked it to saying he didn't.

90
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,980
And the fifth tie breaker
jump back and forth.

91
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,940
I like that you call it, tried
to call them the tie breaker.

92
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,770
They didn't break the
tie. Well, of course,

93
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,230
none of none of these
things is subject of a vote.

94
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,690
Truth isn't something that you vote on

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,880
at this point. He says he was feeling
a very familiar irritation. Start.

96
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,490
You know what? Forget
historical interpretations.

97
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,130
What if I could, from
the photograph itself,

98
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:06,131
the very photograph itself determine
which photograph came first from just the

99
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,860
photo. So I started a
being the photograph,

100
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,300
just sort of superimposing them on
each other and flipping back and forth.

101
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,590
A, B, B, a, B, B, a,

102
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,970
etc. Etc. Nothing in anything.
I know what I can do.

103
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:26,710
I can start studying the
shadows, which meant, yeah,

104
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:31,420
let's go to the Crimea. Are you serious?

105
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,523
Yeah.

106
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,680
His reasoning was I can't study the
shadows unless I knew the exact direction

107
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:41,681
the camera was pointing on that day in
1855 which means I need to find the exact

108
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:43,310
spot where Fenton stood

109
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,370
and I had terrible trouble finding
this place. Is it marked? No.

110
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,900
All the guides kept taking me to
the charge of the light brigade.

111
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:57,350
That site where Tennyson wrote about
the valley of death. No, no, no, no, no.

112
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,940
Not The valley of death.
The Valley of the shadow,

113
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,190
but finally a guide named
Olga. She was fabulous.

114
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:10,180
Helps them locate this spot. It's
completely desolate, undeveloped,

115
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,980
still after 150 years
with some trial and error,

116
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:19,670
he's able to figure out that Fenton was
facing north when he took those photos

117
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,150
and then he goes off to the
Crimean war museum and asks them,

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,930
could I borrow some cannon balls? Oh Man.

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,950
I take the cannon ball, take it out
to the valley of the shadow of death,

120
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,090
and I photograph it

121
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,170
at different times of the day,

122
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,470
hoping that he'd be able to see subtle
differences in the shadows cast by those

123
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,750
cannonballs that could
help them order the photos,

124
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,890
but nothing, nothing.

125
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,750
There was endless questions
about cloud cover,

126
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,010
whether you could even measure
the shadows on these photographs.

127
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,561
In fact,

128
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:55,910
he now suspects that the shadows in those
old pictures may not have been shadows

129
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:56,450
at all,

130
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,040
but just artifacts of how the
prints were made and on and on.

131
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,670
So was the trip useful at all? Not so much

132
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,160
bad. How many,

133
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,540
how many days did you spend photographing
and examining the photographs of

134
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:17,780
cannonballs on the road? I
was there for about a week

135
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,460
and then he went home with no answer
to his question, only that continuing

136
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,600
irritation, but he was like,
no, no, not done yet. Look,

137
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:30,840
when you investigate anything,
I don't care what it is,

138
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:35,841
whether it's a fen photograph or Abu
Ghraib or the murder of a Dallas police

139
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,530
officer. Yes. Complications,

140
00:08:40,531 --> 00:08:44,940
result thinking causes
complications. I'm sorry,

141
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,420
but it's part of that process that we go
through of trying to figure out what's

142
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:55,200
out there in the world.
What really happened.

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,310
Uh,

144
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,900
this is about truth, absolute truth,

145
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,143
and

146
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,260
the pursuit of truth properly considered
shouldn't stop short of [inaudible]

147
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,770
sanity. So yes,

148
00:09:12,771 --> 00:09:17,771
the Fenton photographs worried me that
I might not be able to resolve it to my

149
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,304
satisfaction,

150
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,973
but then

151
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,150
he said a party and he
bumps into a friend of his,

152
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,950
a guy by the name of Dennis Purcell,
who is very, very good with Photoshop.

153
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,050
We called them up. Hello? Turns
out, well, I'm an optical engineer,

154
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,730
so he's not just good
at Photoshop. He acts,

155
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,610
he builds high tech
cameras in any case, okay.

156
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,090
They were talking at this party
and the Fenton picture came up.

157
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,190
Ariel told him he had this problem of
wondering which came first and said,

158
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,060
could you take a look at these?
Dennis takes the pictures home,

159
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:56,440
puts them in his computer
and I immediately started
to compare them right away.

160
00:09:56,441 --> 00:10:00,100
He starts noticing differences
between the two. The light changed.

161
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,350
The weather was different shadows,

162
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,350
but he comes to pretty much the same
conclusion as Arrow that those things

163
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,800
ultimately don't help. So he just
starts flipping between the photos,

164
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,360
flipping live back and forth,

165
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:14,260
back and forth between the two photograph
on the road, flip off the road,

166
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,760
flip on the road, flip off the road,
flips doing this for hours off the road,

167
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,940
flip on the road, and then he sees it.

168
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,700
The rocks on the left hand side,

169
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,250
this little group of
pebbles up on the left bank.

170
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,330
Every time you flip back and forth, flip,
flip, those little rocks popped out.

171
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,460
They moved just a little
bit and when he zoomed in,

172
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,670
he could see that there were five
of them. Fred, George Oswald,

173
00:10:39,671 --> 00:10:41,860
Lionel and Marmaduke, we named them. Yes,

174
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,470
these five guys shifted
from one photo to the next.

175
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,110
And here's the key in the
picture where the road was empty,

176
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,320
they were a little bit higher on the
hill when the road was full of cannibals.

177
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,530
This little rock shift down maybe
eight inches or nine inches,

178
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,610
and from the direction of that movement,

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,520
you can order the photographs.
It's basically like this.

180
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:05,620
You could say some rocks
fell down the hill.

181
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,820
They went from up on the hill
to down, up goes before down.

182
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:13,270
And if the up photo is the empty road
and the down photo is the road full of

183
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,104
cannonballs.

184
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,150
Well then the one with the cannon balls
on the road was the second picture.

185
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,770
Imagine the scene, Fenton
comes upon an empty road.

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,640
He sees cannon balls on
the hill, so he [inaudible]

187
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,680
whoever was helping him would have walked
along the sides of the road and lifted

188
00:11:33,921 --> 00:11:38,480
up cannonballs move them on
to the road. In that process,

189
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,070
they would have invariably
knocked into rocks

190
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,080
and rocks don't fall up hill. They
only fall downhill. It's gravity.

191
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,820
So case closed. This is, this has been,

192
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
yeah.

193
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:03,220
Susan Sontag was right for the
wrong reasons, but she was right.

194
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:04,960
Fenton stage the photograph.

195
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,300
So in addition to being one of
the first photographs of war,

196
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:10,210
this is one of the
first photographic lies.

197
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,570
I guess he just figured it
was a better photo. Yeah.

198
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,570
Or You could say Fitton was a coward.

199
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,750
No,

200
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,150
maybe he didn't want to get too
close to the actual fighting,

201
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:26,151
so he put the cannon balls on the road
to make it look a lot more dangerous than

202
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:29,910
it would have otherwise, or maybe he
was after some kind of emotional truth.

203
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,960
That's what Dennis Purcell thinks.
It's obvious why he did it.

204
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,850
There's that word again to make it look
the way it felt to put those cannonballs

205
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,220
on the road is how you
felt when you were there.

206
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,560
Which case he would argue
that the second photo,

207
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,560
the one he posed is more
authentic than the first.

208
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:52,660
Forget all of that. Who in hell
knows what Fenton was thinking?

209
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,020
I really don't know
what his motivation was,

210
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,300
but isn't that kind of the
question at the end of the day,

211
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,670
do I really care whether he put the
cannonballs on the road or not? Well,

212
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:09,310
I hope you do. If you do, don't you?

213
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,163
Okay.

214
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:16,710
I do and I don't really, we didn't. W
why would you go through all this then?

215
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,130
I guess this is what I take from it.

216
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,083
Mm.

217
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,430
In flipping back and forth between
those two photographs. Flip, he says,

218
00:13:28,431 --> 00:13:32,360
you see the rocks move, flip, and
when you see the rocks move flip,

219
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,810
you imagine feet kicking those rocks
and when you imagine feet kicking those

220
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,100
rocks flip,

221
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:44,330
you feel flip the soldiers walking

222
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,830
like really feel it. You feel
them hitting into the rocks.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,180
You feel on some deep sense for me,

224
00:13:55,181 --> 00:14:00,070
the reality of that scene in a way
that I would not have felt otherwise.

225
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,360
[inaudible]

226
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,360
it's almost as if you've walked
through a pinhole camera into the past.

227
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,160
That world in which the photograph,

228
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,190
that strange temporal evanescent
world in which we live is gone.

229
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,130
But if you could step
between these photographs,

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,010
you're permitted, a brief trespass into
something that you thought was lost.

231
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,873
Yes.

232
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,620
My father died when I was two years old

233
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,450
and perhaps the deepest one of
the deepest mysteries of my life.

234
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,140
Who Waze air,

235
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,600
all these photographs around the house.

236
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,270
I was very, very young. I
have no memories of him.

237
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,070
There's a mystery

238
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,910
about this man who is central
to my life in so many ways,

239
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:05,140
but who I don't know

240
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,630
and who I never will know.

241
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,403
[inaudible]

242
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,990
Aaron Morris, his latest book
is called wilderness of error.

243
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,020
This story was taken from
his book believing is seeing,

244
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:43,650
and I also want to thank IRA glass
for helping us to connect with them.

245
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,630
Radio lab will continue in a moment.
