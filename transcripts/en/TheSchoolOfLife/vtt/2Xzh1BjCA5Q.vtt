00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:13.379
One of the strangest yet most intriguing aspects
of Friedrich Nietzsche’s ideas is his repeated

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:20.609
enthusiasm for a concept that he called amor
fati (translated from Latin as ‘a love of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.480
one’s fate’, or as we might put it, a
resolute, enthusiastic acceptance of everything

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.710
that has happened in one’s life). The person
of amor fati doesn’t seek to erase anything

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.250
of their past, but rather accepts what has
occurred, the good and the bad, the mistaken

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.670
and the wise, with strength and an all-embracing
gratitude that borders on a kind of enthusiastic

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.440
affection. This refusal to regret and retouch
the past is heralded as a virtue at many points

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.250
in Nietzsche’s work. In his book, The Gay
Science, written during a period of great

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.110
personal hardship for the philosopher, Nietzsche
writes: I want to learn more and more to see

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.030
as beautiful what is necessary in things;
then I shall be one of those who makes things

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.280
beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love
henceforth! I do not want to wage war against

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.000
what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do
not even want to accuse those who accuse.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.060
Looking away shall be my only negation. And
all in all and on the whole: some day I wish

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.140
to be only a Yes-sayer. And, a few years later,
in Ecce Homo Nietzsche writes: My formula

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.021
for greatness in a human being is amor fati:
that one wants nothing to be different, not

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:43.980
forward, not backward, not in all eternity.
Not merely bear what is necessary, still less

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.060
conceal it… but love it. In most areas of
life, most of the time, we do the very opposite.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.400
We spend a huge amount of time taking stock

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.630
of our errors, regretting and lamenting the
unfortunate twists of fate – and wishing

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.500
that things could have gone differently. We
are typically mighty opponents of anything

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.319
that smacks of resignation or fatalism. We
want to alter and improve things – ourselves,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.959
politics, the economy, the course of history
– and part of this means refusing to be

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:25.590
passive about the errors, injustices and ugliness
of our own and the collective past. Nietzsche

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.959
himself, in some moods, knows this defiance
full well. There is much emphasis in his work

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.721
on action, initiative and self-assertion.
His concept of the Wille zur Macht, or Will

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:43.620
to Power embodies just this attitude of vitality
and conquest over obstacles.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.180
However, he is aware that, in order to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.700
lead a good life, we need to keep in mind
plenty of opposing ideas and marshall them

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.709
as and when they become relevant. We don’t
– in Nietzsche’s eyes – need to be consistent,

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.389
we need to have the ideas to hand that can
salve our wounds. Nietzsche isn’t therefore

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:09.450
asking us to choose between glorious fatalism
on the one hand or a vigorous willing on the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.840
other. He is allowing us to have recourse
to either intellectual move depending on the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.760
occasion. He wishes our mental toolkit to
have more than one set of ideas: to have,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.310
as it were, both a hammer and a saw. Certain
occasions particularly need the wisdom of

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.639
a Will driven philosophy; others demand that
we know how to accept, embrace and stop fighting

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.680
the inevitable. In Nietzsche’s own life,
there was much that he had tried to change

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.529
and overcome. He had fled his restrictive
family in Germany and escaped to the Swiss

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:49.169
Alps; he had tried to get away from the narrowness
of academia and become a freelance writer;

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.810
he had tried to find a wife who could be both
a lover and an intellectual soulmate. But

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.670
a lot in this project of self-creation and
self-overcoming had gone terribly wrong. He

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.220
couldn’t get his parents, especially his
mother and sister out of his head.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.120
Nietzche's books sold dismally and he was

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.799
forced more or less to beg from friends and
family in order to keep going. Meanwhile his

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.820
halting, gauche attempts to seduce women were
met by ridicule and rejection. There must

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.210
have been so many lamentations and regrets
running through his mind in his walks across

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.271
the Upper Engadine and his nights in his modest
wooden chalet in Sils Maria: if only I had

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.919
stuck with an academic career; if only I’d
been more confident around certain women;

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.190
if only I’d written in a more popular style;
if only I’d been born in France… It was

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.379
because such thoughts – and every one of
us has our own distinct variety of them – can

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.919
ultimately be so destructive and soul-sapping
that the idea of ‘amor fati’ grew compelling

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.449
to Nietzsche. Amor fati was the idea that
he needed in order to regain sanity after

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.770
hours of self-recrimination and criticism.
It’s the idea we ourselves may need at 4

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.199
a.m. finally to quieten a mind that has started
gnawing into itself shortly after midnight.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:19.520
It’s an idea with which a troubled spirit
can greet the first signs of dawn. At the

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.830
height of the mood of amor fati, we recognise
that things really could not have been otherwise,

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.220
because everything we are and have done is
bound closely together in a web of consequences

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.599
that began with our birth – and which we
are powerless to alter at will. We see that

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:41.270
what went right and what went horribly wrong
are as one, and we commit ourselves to accepting

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.229
both, to no longer destructively hoping that
things could have been otherwise. We were

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.140
headed to a degree of catastrophe from the
start.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.100
We end up saying, with tears in which there mingle
grief and a sort of ecstasy, a large yes to

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.080
the whole of life, in its absolute horror
and occasional moments of awesome beauty.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.610
In a letter to a friend written in the summer
of 1882, Nietzsche tried to sum up the new

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.620
spirit of acceptance that he had learnt to
lean on to protect him from his agony: ‘I

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.210
am in a mood of fatalistic ‘surrender to
God’ ⎯ I call it amor fati, so much so,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.000
that I would be willing to rush into a lion’s
jaws’. And that is where, after too much

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.600
regret, we should learn sometimes to join
him.
