00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:22.600
[ Silence ]

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.630
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Good afternoon,
everyone, I'm Mark Dimunation,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.550
I'm chief of the Rare Book and
Special Collections Division.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.850
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.570
We're very excited about this, the
Division in the Library of Congress

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.380
at this point have
become old friends

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.930
with Saint John's University,
and especially in the making

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.530
of the Saint John's Bible.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.520
We're very lucky to have Tim
Ternes here today to talk

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.620
about the extraordinary
process and the undertaking

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.660
of making this exquisite Bible;
nine years in the making, yes?

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.960
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Fifteen.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.260
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Fifteen years in the making.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.730
But ten years ago the Library of
Congress featured selected sheets

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.890
from the Pentateuch or the first
books of the Bible, the Psalms,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.070
and the Gospels, in an
extraordinary exhibition,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.650
and I might add a very
popular exhibition.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.740
Today we're going to look
at the further progress.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.560
The Bible is now complete.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.150
We're very lucky on
this moment to have two

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.660
of what will be seven volumes of
the Apostles facsimile edition.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.730
This is an extraordinarily
sophisticated facsimile.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.200 position:56%
We're very lucky here at the Library
of Congress to be the recipient

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.340 position:56%
of this, one of the 12, obviously,
Apostles edition that had been made.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.820
And after the talk,
we'll be happy to,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.560
as I always say, show you the book.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.390
[Laughter] And after you hear this
talk, I'm sure you will understand.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.110
I will be happy to -- we'll
page through the book for you,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.680
rather than you doing that for
yourself, so we can keep this

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.070
for other generations
to look forward to.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.920
Tim knows the story of this
Bible in a very intimate way,

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.880
and you really have a lovely
talk to look forward to.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.150
So he's become a good friend.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.510
Let's welcome here -- welcome him
here to the Library of Congress.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.030
[ Applause ]

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.330
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Well,
good afternoon, everyone.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.630
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.280
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Oh, this is
not Minnesota, that's obvious.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.720
[Laughter] I said, "Good
afternoon, everyone."

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.020
Gees.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.320
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.620
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: I'm not used
to being tethered to a podium,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.040
because they've got me tied
here with all these microphones

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.890
and recordings, so I might be a
little awkward with that as well,

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.870
but I'll do my best to stay put
here, which is just killing me

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.610
because I like to be out in
front with everyone else, so.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.160
It's very nice to be here.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.390 position:56%
I've actually lectured here before,
and I've shared the project with you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.350
on many years ago in
2006 when we had it here.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.100
And I have for you just
an outstanding story;

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.450
an outstanding story,
that's been 500 years

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.370
since it's been able to be told.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.540
Because the last time a
monastery did something

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.790
like this really was 500 years ago.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.680
And I always tell people we
now know why it took 500 years

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.380 position:56%
to do it again; [laughter] because
it's an incredibly huge undertaking.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.130
And it's also a fascinating story.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.180
Now, I'm the director of the Saint
John's Bible, which simply means

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.120
that I am the keeper of the pages,
and the keeper of the story.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.130
And it really is a
good job, trust me.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.430
I love what I do.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.980
I wasn't always the director
of the Saint John's Bible.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.470
For 17 years I was an
elementary classroom teacher.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.710
So truly one day I was doing
playground duty for one day,

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.390 position:56%
and then a few months later I was
lecturing at the Library of Congress

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.280
and thought, "Life has changed."

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.000
The behavior patterns didn't
really change between the two.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
[Laughter] But trust me, life
has changed for me as well.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.400
And now I'm back again, and
it's really quite a treat.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.670
Because the story of the Saint
John's Bible, it hasn't been able

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.810
to be told for many generations,
is a fascinating story,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.520
but it's also not our story.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.350
Because many people don't realize,

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.840
this thing called "The Saint John's
Bible", which we are so famous for,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.890
and which is so famous
in its own rite,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.600
is something that Saint
John's never thought

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.850
about doing; never wanted to do.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.930
As I always say, "We
will never do it again."

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.790
Because it wasn't our idea.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.620
The Saint John's Bible is something
we didn't think about doing,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.070
it was the brainchild
of this man right here.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.160
Now, just so you realize,
that is not a picture of me.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.430
[Laughter] Many people
say I look just like him.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.940 position:56%
I have been walking -- this is true,
I've been walking down the streets

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.580
of London, and I have been asked
for Donald Jackson's autograph.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.460
The man is 75 years old.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.230
I don't know how I feel about that,
but it's the shared body trait

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.670
that we have here as well, so.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.790
Donald Jackson, world-renowned
individual.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.090
He's a calligrapher.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.390
And you think about that.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.540
He has made his fame and his
fortune with something every one

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.350
of you in this audience can do.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.650
You can all make letters.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.950
Think about that.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.260
Now, some make nicer
letters than others.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.880
I make letters.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.400
We can all do what he does.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.850
But I doubt any of us are
going to have an exhibition

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.580
of our handwriting
that travels the globe.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.000
I doubt any of us are going
to line up around the block

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.390
to look at our own handwriting.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.030
And I doubt the Queen of
England is going to hire you

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.260
to be her professional scribe.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.160
Because that's Donald's real job.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.160
Donald is by profession
the senior scribe

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.430
to Her Royal Majesty's Crown Office
in the House of Lords in London.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.730
Quite a long title.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.040
He's the -- he's often called
the Queen's calligrapher.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.660
He's not -- that's
not really his job.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.180 position:56%
He writes things that she gives out.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.310
So, for example, he
did the Royal Charter

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.950
that made Margaret
Thatcher Dame of the Realm.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.650
He did Charles and
Diana's wedding papers.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.820
He did Charles and
Diana's divorce papers,

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.120
[laughter] and all those things.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.200
He did not do William and
Kate's wedding certificate.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.250
The only one he did not do;
because he was finishing --

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.090
and we pressed him to finish the
Saint John's Bible at that time.

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.190
So we beat out the
future king of England

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.490
and his wife all the way through.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.700
But the story of the Saint
John's Bible is Donald's story,

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.250
because it was his idea.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.940
Donald talked about really
having a dream of wanting

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.800
to handwrite scripture
from a lot earlier

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.650
than anyone can ever even imagine.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.530
In fact, Donald talks about
being a child and falling

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.480
in love with calligraphy.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.310
Now, think what you used to do when
you were ten, 12, 13 years old.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.600
[ Silence ]

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.920
And I doubt you spent time
doing what Donald did.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.190
One of his favorite activities
would be to go to a local museum,

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.590
or library, go to the rare book
room, which of course you had here,

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.430
or the manuscript room and he
said, "I would look at the cases

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.540
and I would copy what I saw."

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.750
He said, "I would spend hours
sitting in places like this looking

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.130
in the cases, and recreating,"
not tracing, but recreating.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.690
And he said, "I loved it."

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.020
Now, think about that.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.300
And then look at this.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.650
That's a letter M that Donald did
when he was about 12 years old.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.420
[Murmuring] I was still
coloring inside the lines

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.720
when I was 12 years old.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.020
[Laughter] Half the
time outside the lines.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.320
That's amazing when
you look at that.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.950
Here's a piece he did a
couple of years later.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.310
And it does belong sideways.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.910 position:56%
It's called "The Reclining Madonna".

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.940
But look at the difference in
skill already that that child --

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.220
I emphasize that, that
that child has developed.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.350
And he said it was by
going in and looking

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.100
at the way the artist
bent the lines,

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.640
laid their gold, blended
their color.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.500 position:56%
He said, "By looking at the masters,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.390
that's how I became
a master myself."

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.190
What a great lesson for all of us.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.570
And it was right around this time
in his life Donald Jackson said,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.150
"You know, I'm not trying to brag,
but I remember very clearly,"

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.840
he said, "looking at
something I had done one day,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.020
and it was like a light
bulb went off."

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.690
And he said, "I realized I'm good."

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.930
And it just -- it's like, "I
can do this, and I love it."

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.460
And right around age
13, 13, 14, he saw --

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.130
he talks about sitting
down with a piece of paper

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.570
and writing two goals for his life.

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.030
Now, think about that, what
did you want to do at age 13?

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.080
[Laughs] I taught elementary
school for 17 years.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.280
I never once met a child who had
goals, number one, but [inaudible].

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.060
But he sat down and said
on this piece of paper,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.900
"When I'm old enough, I want to
work for the Queen of England."

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.760
That happened in his 20s, one

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.060
of the youngest people ever
employed as a royal scribe.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.980
And number two -- I bet you can
guess what the other thing is

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.280
on that page.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.590 position:56%
It said, "When I practice long and
hard -- " and it's a paraphrase but,

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.260
"I practice long and hard, I want

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.580
to do what calligraphers have
always done, handwrite scripture."

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.100
Think about that.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.400
What a goal.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.960
Now, the first one he got -- he
managed to make happen in his 20s.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.210
But the second one took almost
50 years to become a reality.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.560
So this was his childhood dream.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.810
And he needed a partner to make it
happen, because as you can imagine,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.090
this is a huge undertaking.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.190
Well, so we have this man over in
Wales with this childhood dream.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.180
And then we end up with a
bunch of monks in the middle

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.880
of the cornfields of
Minnesota with a vision.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.650
And we have to get the two
of them together somehow.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.040
And do you know what
the catalyst was?

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.070
[ Silence ]

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:42.570
Something you all love and use --

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.770
[ Silence ]

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.630
But it was rocking Donald's world.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.070
In the 1980s something
changed his world dramatically.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.130
[ Silence ]

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.700
The computer; [laughter] because
in the 1980s what came into vogue,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.850
everyone was now an
electronic calligrapher.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.150
You no longer needed Donald.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.360 position:56%
And as Donald always says, "Everyone
had at their fingertips the true,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.340
dirtiest four-letter F-word in
the English language, the font."

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.120 position:56%
[Laughter] Because what do you have;

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.860
you can now have 50,000
ways to do his job.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.300
So calligraphy as an
art form was waning.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.670 position:56%
And so right around that time a
group of calligraphers in the middle

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.440
of Minnesota said,
"We've got to find a way

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.740
to stop this from happening.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.690 position:56%
How can we share the passion that we
have for our art form with others?

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.650
Let's see if we can hold
a calligraphy conference

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.020 position:56%
and get maybe 30, 40, 50 people, the
top artists from around the world

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.620
to come to Minnesota and talk
about the future of our art.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.440
And to do that we're
going to need a big name."

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.770
So they contacted Donald Jackson.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.370
And they said, "Donald,
would you come to Minnesota

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.400
and teach a calligraphy
course, and help us deal

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.270
with this idea of our
waning art form?"

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.980
And one of the organizers had
a grandson that happened to go

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.930
to school at Saint John's
University in Collegeville.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.600
And they said, "I know the perfect
place where we can have this."

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.720
They hired Donald Jackson, and
in 1981 he came to the campus.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.840
And they got a few more
than 30 or 40 people.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.550
[Laughter] Five hundred
calligraphers came

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.320
from around the world, and
they turned our gymnasium

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.280
into the world's largest
scriptorium.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.600
They put Donald on the stage, he'd
make a letter A and they'd go wild.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.900
I'm serious.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.200
[Laughter] He'd make a letter
B and they'd drool and scream.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.180
It was amazing.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.190
But what was most important
is that's how Donald got

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.200
to Saint John's.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.600
And the reason the Bible
is at Saint John's is

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.580
because Donald Jackson countered
something and saw something there

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.550
that every person who comes on the
campus sees and blows them away.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.560
Now, has anyone ever been to Saint
John's in Collegeville, Minnesota?

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.860
A couple of you here, yes.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.660 position:56%
What's the first thing you encounter
when you come on the campus?

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.270
[ Silence ]

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.820
This. This is our world-famous
Abby Church.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.860
In the 1950s, this community

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.290
of monks hired Marcel
Broyer [assumed spelling],

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.220
one of the first kind of --

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.600
or one of the big names
in the Modernist Movement

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.450
to design and build their church.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.610
And the inside is even more
incredible than the outside.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.830
And this incredibly beautiful
mid-century modern church sits

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.020 position:56%
in the middle of the campus, with
this huge presence, and Donald said,

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.970
"I never knew it was there."

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:17.270
He never knew it was there.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.330
It's an amazing building and he
said, "I went in, and I stood there

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.710
in the middle of that church on my
very first visit looking around,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.270
and I said, to myself,
'Wow, these guys get it'."

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.570
And he said, "They
understand quality,

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.950
and they understand longevity.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.310
And not to be funny," he said,

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.780
"but I had concrete proof
as to how they thought."

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.080
[Laughter] Because here it is.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.480
And he said, "I realize that
they'd built this in the '50s."

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.750
It was the -- one of the world's --

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:49.420
if not the world's first
contemporary Catholic Church.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.070 position:56%
And he said, "If they understood
that then, they would get this idea,

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:56.320
this project that I have in mind."

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.420
Now, he let that idea percolate
in his mind for 14 more years

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.890
until 1985 -- excuse me, 1995.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.620
And he said, "What
have they got to lose?"

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.300
So finally he approached
the monastery,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.960
and he sold them the idea this way.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.570
He said, "What are you doing
to mark the millennium?"

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.830
We hadn't even thought about it.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.850
And he said, "I've
got an idea for you.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.970
How would you like the
handwritten Word of God,

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.390
and would you help me do it?"

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.130
Can you imagine being
asked that question?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.470
I mean, think -- how
would you respond?

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:29.770
I mean, think about that.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.070
Like any church organization,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.000
the role that took us three
years to give him an answer.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.300
[Laughter] Because
nothing works quickly

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.910
in the church world, we know that.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.100
But, you know, very soon it was
decided that we have to do this.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.560
And in 1998 then the formal
commissioning was done.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.820 position:56%
That kicked off two years of layout,
planning, labor-intensive work,

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.560
figuring out the first and last
word of every page, making --

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.040
putting together his team,
because he couldn't do it together,

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.900
fundraising, theological
development, all this had to happen

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:02.300
until finally on Ash Wednesday
in the year 2000, Donald said,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.130
"Everything is ready; let's begin."

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:08.600
And he sat down and he
wrote the very first words.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.370
And those first words were --

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.670

[Laughter] Well, let me
introduce Donald Jackson

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:17.670
to you with a short video.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.930
It will introduce his tools,
his methods, his materials.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.480
And you will get to
see his hands at work.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.070 position:56%
And they're very distracting
because he's so good with his hands.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.670
But also pay attention
to what he says,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.450
because he really explains
how he sees his role

It's well done, and it does so much
in such a short amount of time.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.910
I've seen that video
about 3,000 times.

I can narrate it word for
word if it ever goes out.

But I always tell myself every
time I've seen it, "You know,

and practice long and hard,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.390
to separate an egg the
way Donald Jackson did.

when he does that.

sure that when he puts it

in the bowl it remains perfectly
pure; because you want to go

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.440

going to last 2,000 years.

there's a good chance this book,

in my hand right now,

of this and that.

Yes; this is a stick of ink.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.000
And the inks for the Bible
are actually quite unique

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.300
and quite rare.

you'd like to, and handle them.

The inks for the Bible
are quite special.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.720
Number one, my favorite part
about the inks for the Bible is

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.660
that number one they're very old.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.930
They're made in the 1870s.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.290
And number two, Donald
Jackson bought every stick

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:10.050
of ink he would need for
the Bible over 40 years ago.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:12.750
Now, remember, he didn't come
to us with the idea until '95.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.370
But he came across these beautiful
sticks of black ink in a place

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.870
that was going out of
business in England --

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.830 position:56%
in London, and they were selling
these ink sticks for pennies apiece.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.110
And he said, "They
were just beautiful."

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:28.450
He said, "So I bought every
one they had, just in case."

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:33.870
Forty years ago, he bought 144
sticks of his beautiful black ink.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:40.290
Forty-five -- 40 some years later,
he used 142 sticks of black ink.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.590
He had two to spare.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.890

We couldn't afford them today,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.700

You mix it together, you
compress it together in your mold,

the cool colors.

you need the most perfect
tool for writing.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.700
And believe it or not, the
Saint John's Bible was written

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.330

or a goose feather.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.050
Can you imagine writing
anything with this,

But the first thing Donald will tell
you that no quill in the history

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:58.520
of the world ever looked like this.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.020
This is a TV quill, folks, exactly.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.610
[Laughter] Because
what artist or anyone,

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.410
what calligrapher would
ever write with this thing

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.710
in the way the whole time?

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.010 position:56%
I mean, plus your pen is unbalanced.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:14.020
So this, as you saw in the video,
is what a real quill looks like.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:17.270
But as Donald always says,
"This isn't sexy enough

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.050
for TV, so you always see this."

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.350
Pass this around.

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.540
But also you have to realize
that you really cannot write

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.890
with a feather, because as you
heard, this is the same substance

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.500
as what; your fingernails.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.550
It has no strength or durability.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.850
This is not going to last,

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.410
especially if you cut
it into a quill.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:40.500
So you have to do something to this
to make it worthy of being this.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.750
So here's what you do.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.520
You take this quill and you clip
off the end, clean off the viscous

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.750
on the inside, you soak it
in water for about 24 hours.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:53.610
Take it out, dry it off, and
then you bake this in hot sand

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:57.070
for about two minutes at
350 degrees, roll it around,

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.170
take it out, and when
the bottom is clear,

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:02.470
it will have been [knocking
sounds] clarified,

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.600
and that quill will
last for centuries.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.380
Donald's favorite quill pen
that he used was 135 years old.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:12.430
And he would simply re-nib it
every once in a while and do it.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.750
And so once you have this
beautifully cured, clarified,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.090
you cut into your pen, and you have
the most perfect tool for writing.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.160

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.460
So now you know the secret.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.110
If you want fingernails that
never break, you need to bake them

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.720
for two minutes [inaudible].

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.740
And Donald said, "On
average I bet we used

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.140
about 40 quills in
the entire project."

as you go all the way through.

"veal" comes from the Latin word

"velum", and this is real velum,
and so this happens to be calf skin.

on both sides of the skin.

So forgive my paper skin
here, but this is one --

of a skin on the calf.

And we fold it in half.

pages in the Saint John's Bible,

the size of our book.

This is mine.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.960
And one of the major reasons we
did the Saint John's Bible is

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.080
to remind us that, you know,
even this says, "This is mine."

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.880
But what does this say?

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.000
[Laughter] This says, "You
can't even lift me by yourself."

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.300
I mean, think about that.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.500

this says it is --

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.800

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.100
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Ours;
it's collectively ours.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.880
And one of the main
theological elements

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.340 position:56%
of the Saint John's Bible is that
we did this project to remind people

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.660
that the Bible is communal.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.360
And what says more communal
than something very large?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.910
And as you said, sir, magnificent.

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:29.170
In fact, because it's communal,
and because it's so big,

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:31.780
it cannot even possibly
be one volume.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.530
The Saint John's Bible
takes seven books this size

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.110
to make the entire
Old and New Testament.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:42.640
And so imagine what it says on
the first time the Bible is bound

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.990
and carried into the Abby Church,

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:48.140
well it takes 14 people
to carry the Bible.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.440
[Laughter] Wow.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.200
Does that ever make a
statement about the importance

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.500
of what we think about this?

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.010
And also, the importance of
it as a communal work of art.

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:01.220
And in fact that's the
primary reason we did this;

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.220
is yes to ignite the imagination,
yes to celebrate the millennium.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.150
But to remind us as a people

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:13.750
that this is a communal work
that's best experienced shared.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.990 position:56%
We could spend truly the rest of the
afternoon talking about the minutia

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.710
that went into the layout of the
pages, the design of everything.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.940
Because the detail that went

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.150
into making the original
is almost overwhelming.

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.530
There's one last thing
we should talk

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.680
about before going into the book.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.350
And that was the most difficult
decision in the entire project.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:36.650
And do you know what that is?

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.950

&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: You're close.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.150

going to be English.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.750
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Which translation
do we use; because no matter

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:49.260 position:56%
which translation we choose, it will
be the wrong one, simple as that.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.560
We know what that's like.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.210
Well, we had a lot of thought into
this, and we wanted a translation

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.440
that was literal, that was
scholarly, that was inclusive,

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.960
that was approved for use by
the Catholic Church and so on.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.330
We are Roman Catholic.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.650
But we wanted it to be a
translation that was used

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:05.300
by as many others as possible.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.910
And so with that in
mind, we chose to go

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:10.080
with the New Revised
Standard Version, or the NRSV.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.310
And that has become the
most perfect choice for us.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.610
It is literal.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:14.910
It is scholarly.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.210
It's inclusive.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.750
But many of you may or may not know
that the NRSV happens to be one

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:21.890
of the only translations
of the Bible in English

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.220
that is officially approved for use

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.020
by almost every major
Christian church worldwide.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.550
And many non-Christian
traditions when

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:33.660 position:56%
and if they ever need a translation,
will often go to the NRSV.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.430
Now, it's very seldom
that other traditions do,

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.100
but they will often use that one.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.720
And so it has become the
most perfect choice for us.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.010
Now, it is the entire
Old and New Testament,

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.430
all 73 Books of the Bible.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:49.930
Even a few that some of you
might have left out at one time.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:51.230
Just keep that in mind.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.820
It includes the apocryphal
books as well.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.440
In the Catholic tradition
we include the apocryphal,

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.440
or the [inaudible] Books
as well in the canon.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.220
Other than that, it's like every
other NRSV you've ever read,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:02.610
or ever seen.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:07.220
Ours is just a lot
prettier, all the way through.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:11.090
Now, along with these
beautifully handwritten pages,

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.660
and this whole idea
of a communal work,

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:18.140
we wanted to bring the Saint John's
Bible into a new translation,

00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.650
but not a word translation,
a visual translation.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:23.960
And so what we did
is we incorporated

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:29.990 position:56%
over 160 artworks designed to bring
the Scriptures into the modern world

00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:31.350
through the way that many people

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:34.520
in the modern world experience
almost everything nowadays,

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.200
visually.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.320
So for the remainder of our
time, we're going to look

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.620
at a few of the artworks.

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.670
Actually, we're going to get you
looking at a few of the artworks.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.540
And we don't have time to read the
passages today, so I've chosen one

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.450
that I bet almost everyone in this
room knows, even if you are --

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:53.350
even if you've never read the
Bible, or the Torah, or the Koran.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:57.270
Even if you're a strong believer,
or not a believer at all,

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:02.050
if you're a skeptic, or, you
know, a hardcore literalist,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.020
I bet you know the Creation story.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.030
Think about it.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.940 position:56%
Because I bet I could stop the first
stranger on the street, and ask him

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.870
or her by biblical
or torah tradition,

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.450
how many days are in Creation.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.920
And almost everyone's
going to answer seven.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.500
Even if they never read it.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.500
I could ask the next stranger on
the street and ask them by biblical

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.790
or torah tradition who are
the first human beings,

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.220
and almost everyone's going
to answer, "Adam and Eve."

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.480
Because those passages,
those stories that are shared

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.610
by many traditions, are as
much a part of popular culture

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.000
as they are religious culture.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.180
In fact, we have court cases taking
place right now about them as well.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.150
They're some of the most argued
about passages in the Bible.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:48.570
Bow, let's keep all that in mind,
and then pretend for a few moments

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.270
that you are the artist
for the Saint John's Bible,

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:55.360

come to you and said,

"We want you -- " we've
chosen Creation.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:02.760

more images of Creation

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.590
than there are of anything else.

so make sure it's prophetic, and
don't make anybody mad, okay?

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.060

Bible so you're going to deal

Divine and not make somebody mad?

if you remember, nothing

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.800
The Saint John's Bible
is not a picture book.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:02.800
These are not meant to be didactic
illustrations of the stories.

"Here's what it means."

We never tell you what it means,
unless we ask you if you want to.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:18.780 position:56%

fact that each of these engages you

about was the passage anyway,

We want to know what
the artist was thinking,

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:51.620
so I'll tell you a few things.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:55.440
Most people notice it begins in
chaos and disorder; darkness.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.760 position:56%
Many people talk about The Big Bang.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.750
We said, "Weave in modern
science, modern values."

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.510
But the Hebrew does read,
"[Speaks Hebrew]," so,

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.910
"Formless void, nothingness."

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.040

anybody recognize those?

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.070
[ Silence ]

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.020
Those are mathematical fractals.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.360
Scientists use fractals
and chaos theory.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:19.660
You can use fractal geometry

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.160
to mathematically calculate how
a tree branch is going to grow.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.210
So even amidst the chaos there's
an underlying sense of order.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:28.050
The second slice moves
into the creation

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.440
of the heavens and the seas.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:32.920
The third slice is correct,
ma'am, it's a satellite

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.840
of the Ganges River Delta; because
we have the formation of land

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.630
and sea -- or separation
of land and water.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.440 position:56%
Then we move into the third one --
the fourth one, the sun ruled by day

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.280
and the moon ruled by night,
and all the stars in-between.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.220
And did you notice
the planetary orbits?

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:49.520
Had Donald Jackson put those

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.010 position:56%
into a Bible a hundred years ago the
church would have locked him away

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:53.430
in prison, simple as that.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.530 position:56%
We understand that we revolve around
the earth -- the sun right now.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:00.730
Then you move into creation of
birds, and fish, and other animals,

00:45:00.730 --> 00:45:03.930
and you've got that beautiful
dark bird hovering over.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.140
I thought your description
was elegant.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.590
Then the creation of human beings.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.240
And if you look very carefully,

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:12.120
many of those human beings
you may have seen before.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.420
They are very primitive.

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.960
They come from famous
cave paintings.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:23.920
But one of them is very
important, and that is this woman.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.460
It's a huntress.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.210
It comes from a cave
painting in Nigeria.

00:45:28.210 --> 00:45:31.440
It's one of the oldest images of
a female we have on the planet.

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.370
And she graces the page
of the Saint John's Bible

00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:35.580
because in the modern world
we understand the equality

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:36.880
of men and women.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.440

Do you see that little
stinker sitting there?

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:49.800
Yes; that little snake
saying, "Look what's coming

of order, structure, and rest.

about the biggest discussion

Yes; but you're right.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.900
Well, we decided early on that
we would never make an image

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.200
of the Divine.

God looks like?

And what did you say they do;
they built, they provided order,

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.310
they provided structure, they
connected things together.

We decided early on in the
manuscript tradition of illumination

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:49.840
to use the play of light
on the precious metals

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.050
as you turn the page to
represent the Divine.

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:57.430
So whenever you see gold, it's
the representation of God.

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:02.710
And in the original we have
many times polished it,

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:06.010

He hired natural history artist,
Chris Tomlin to paint the snake,

that for anywhere between four

Take that process times
160 artworks,

pages of elegant artworks,

of elegant text.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:46.750
And here is this page, and
the first thing you'll notice,

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:50.520
and your first thing you'll learn
when you look at a page like this,

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.700
is that you never call this a font.

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:59.220
[Laughter] This is a script;
or as Mark said, "A hand."

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.440
Because a computer does a font,

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.860
or a machine does a font,
or it's a created thing.

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.560
This is a hand, a beautifully
written hand.

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:09.510
There are six calligraphers
in the Saint John's Bible,

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:11.430
each of them working to
make sure their hands looked

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.520
as much alike as possible.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.940
But you can tell the difference.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:17.370
Look at their tails.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:19.400
Look at their pressure.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.850 position:56%
And the humanity of a hand comes out
very easily, and very beautifully.

00:52:23.850 --> 00:52:26.880
You'll also see that throughout
the Saint John's Bible,

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:32.040
the very beginning we use flora
and fauna from Africa, Mesopotamia,

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:36.280
the Middle East, because of course
that's what most likely it probably

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:37.630
started there.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:40.250
But as you turn the pages
in the Saint John's Bible,

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.580
for most of the rest
of the book, the plants

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.430
and animals come from
Central Minnesota.

00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:48.250
[Laughter] And we change all
the "amens" to "Yes, sure,

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:51.000
you bet you" for the
whole Bible as well so.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.870
[Laughter] We didn't change
a word, trust me, trust me.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:57.310
But we do weave those things
just as they would centuries ago

00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.610
into the pages of the bible

00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.370
so it geographically
grounds it in our work.

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:04.340
Now, a page of script like
this takes one calligrapher

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.430
between seven to 13 hours to write.

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:08.980

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.140

the common question --

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.270
[ Silence ]

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:17.950
"What happens if you
make a mistake?"

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:19.250
You are human.

00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:22.440
And remember I said you're very
happy you're working on a cow.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.740
[Paper Sound] Because
cows are very forgiving.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.510
If you make a mistake in
the Saint John's Bible,

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.470
you go right back to your process.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:33.190
Take your knife, scrape it away,
take sandpaper and sand it off,

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.420
and you will never
know it was there.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.720
Isn't that amazing?

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.240
That's one of the very big
benefits of using the velum.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:42.960
However, let's say you make a
mistake in the same place again.

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:47.660
Or let's pretend that you
left out an entire line,

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.750
and you don't catch it until later.

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:53.050
And, remember, if I
make a mistake here,

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:54.690
I've made a mistake on four pages.

00:53:54.690 --> 00:53:56.980
So you don't throw it away.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:59.800
So sometimes you make a mistake
that's too big to cover up,

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.410
and if you do, you turn
it into something nice.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.640
Here is the very first mistake
in the Saint John's Bible.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.300
Here's our sower and the seed.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:09.830
And this page was done backwards,

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:12.740
because almost always the
calligraphy was done first,

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.320
and then the artist
did his or her work.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.440
But Sally was ready -- wasn't ready
to write, and the artist was ready

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.740
so they did the artwork first,
and then Sally wrote around it.

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.280
And when she got to the
bottom of this column,

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.310
she discovered something
pretty terrible.

00:54:25.310 --> 00:54:28.590
This column ended up one
line longer than this column.

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.780
She had left out an entire line.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.040
And they would have had to have
scraped a fourth of the page off,

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.340
and they couldn't do this.

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:39.090
And Sally said, "I was pretty
sure I was about to lose my job."

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.390
And Donald said, "Don't worry,

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:43.230
we're going to fix it the same
way they did centuries ago."

00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.530
So look at the page.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.330
As you read down the column --

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:58.030
[ Silence ]

00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:01.800
You come to a tiny red
triangle right there.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:05.380
That red triangle points
back to the bird.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:09.260
The birds feet are holding the
rope, the rope travels down,

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:12.840
and it's wrapped around the
line which is missing saying,

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.520
"Oops, it belongs up there."

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.580
So you read it, and the
crowd came together again,

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:19.930
so that they [whistles]
could not even eat.

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:23.320
When it's finally heard, they
went out to restrain him.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.620
Isn't that wonderful?

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:30.430
That is a legitimate way of
fixing a mistake in a manuscript.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:34.190
And they've done it
that way for centuries.

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:40.320 position:56%
Here's a book of ours from the
Walters Art Museum Collection that's

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.630
several centuries old.

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.260
And look at that little monk.

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:49.790
He's saying, "Oops, this
line belongs up there."

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:51.090
Isn't that wonderful?

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:52.390
I love that one.

00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:53.690
This is how they've
done it for centuries.

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:54.990
Because you can't just
toss these away.

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.350
Out of 1130 pages, we
have nine corrections.

00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:58.650
Isn't that amazing?

00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:59.950
How many mistakes on
the last email you sent?

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.250
I mean, think about that.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:02.550
[Laughter] Yes.

00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:03.850
One of my favorites is this one.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:05.150 position:56%
Look at the bumblebee at the bottom.

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:06.450 position:56%
[Laughter] He's attached to a pulley
system pulling it up into place.

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:07.750
And this is a fantastic one too.

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:09.050
[Laughter] There's a little lemur,
which does not come from Minnesota,

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:10.350
but he's doing his job as well.

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:11.650
&gt;&gt; There's a theological
art effect too.

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:12.950
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Yes.

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:14.250
&gt;&gt; There is a wideness
in that [overlapping] --

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.550
&gt;&gt; Tim Ternes: Very much so.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:16.850
In fact --

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:18.150
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.450
Yes; one of the biggest
discussions was,

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:20.750
"Should we make them
redo these pages?"

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.050
And it was one of our
oldest monks that said, "No.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.350
We have the Word of God.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.650
Let's take every chance
to admit we're human."

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:25.950
And so they have.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.510
Sally Mae Joseph was the artist
that made the very first mistake

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.170
in the Saint John's
Bible that was there.

00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:32.280
And she said, "I felt just awful.

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.580
Here I am doing this."

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.580
Until Donald Jackson
made the second mistake.

00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.980
And she said, "That was the day I
got [inaudible] there was a god,"

00:56:39.980 --> 00:56:41.280
she said.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.820
[Laughter] As you go
all the way through.

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:49.100
We could spend hours talking
about the pages of the Bible.

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:52.180
We could spend hours taking
a look at how, you know,

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:56.800
ancient stories are brought to
life weaving in beautiful context

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.680
where you have the Christ family
tree, acknowledging the fact

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.850
that we share common
roots, beginning with Jesus,

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:10.510
all the way back to Abraham, with
Sarah, and also Hagar listed.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:13.130
[ Silence ]

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.010
The Saint John's Bible
welcomes those traditions.

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:20.140 position:56%
Do you notice the structure of the
family tree is written on a menorah.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:23.740
And that menorah is lit
with Islamic Arabesques.

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.340
Behind it a swirling mandala.

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:28.630
Beneath it -- or connecting all --

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:32.740
everything over here
together to a Christian cross.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.380
Acknowledging the fact that
we all share a common root,

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:38.620
back to Abraham.

00:57:38.620 --> 00:57:41.220
The Saint John's Bible
weaves in modern science.

00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.540
Look at the background
of this artwork,

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.950
and you will see very clearly
that in the modern world yes,

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:49.750
we understand our genealogy
as a family tree,

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:55.060
but we also understand
it through our DNA.

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.790
The entire background
of the Saint John's --

00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.020
of this artwork is over a
pattern of beautiful DNA.

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.270
And the DNA is absolutely
everywhere.

00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:06.100
The Saint John's Bible is
an amazing work of art.

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.450
And you've heard the story of this.

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:11.750
But one thing that's really unique
about the Saint John's Bible is

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:16.640
that for one of the first
times in the manuscript world,

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.720
a commission like this is done.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:22.960
It was finished on May 9th, 2011.

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.680
We wrote the last words.

00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:28.790
It took 23 individual
artists 15 years to create.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:34.330
At the same time the original
was being made, Saint John said,

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:39.540
"We have to find a way to
share it beyond our doors."

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:45.650
And so we created the finest fine
art edition we can possibly imagine

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:52.220
of a lithograph copy on paper
that recreates the look, the feel,

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.750
the texture -- oh I guess
the quality of longevity

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:58.580
of the inks and the materials.

00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.680
It recreates a texture of the gold.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.070
Even the fiber of the
paper is designed

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.310
to mimic the way the velum turns.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:09.950
And these 299 copies, the
final editions are known

00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:11.660
as "The Heritage Edition."

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.890
And the Library of Congress and the
American people have been given one

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:18.280
of those fine art editions,
called "The Apostles Edition".

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.580
And it was delivered.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:22.610 position:56%
I had the privilege of delivering --
and I skipped a couple things here.

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:26.530
I had the privilege of delivering
this volume when it was brought

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:30.090
to the Library of Congress in --

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:32.280
a few months ago when
Pope Francis was here.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.160
And it was delivered and
given to the American people.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.820
Today you have two of those
volumes which have been delivered.

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:42.640 position:56%
Over the next few -- several
months, all seven will be delivered.

00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:48.210
I will create a permanent home here
at the Library of Congress as well.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.510
&gt;&gt; You'll be delivering this?

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:50.810

delivering each volume.

That's up to Mark.

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.930
[Laughter] Trust me, because
I've only scratched the surface

00:59:55.930 --> 00:59:57.370
on the stories that I know.

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:59.820
I know I have gone a bit longer
than I said I would, Mark.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:01.120
I'm sorry.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.080
But if there are any questions, I
will stick around and answer them,

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.380
if we want to answer them now.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.470
But I want you to think about
one thing before you close today.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:12.450
The Saint John's Bible is
this incredible work of art.

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:17.340
But as I've said many times, it is
a complete waste of time, money,

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.190
and talent if it's never used.

01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:24.310
In a thousand years from now, I
don't want to see a clean book.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:27.490
I want to see it ripped.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.770
I want to see it licked.

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:31.440
I want to see the pages explode.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.270
Sorry, Mark.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:34.810
[Clears Throat] [Laughter]
I want to see it used.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.170
Because the legacy of the Saint
John's Bible won't be the fact

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:38.470
that we made it.

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.040
The legacy of the Saint John's
Bible will be what we choose

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.620
to do with it.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.920
So do something with it.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.220
