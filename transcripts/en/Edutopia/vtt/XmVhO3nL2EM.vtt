00:00:01.726 --> 00:00:05.496
&gt;&gt;Susan: What would it be like if we
walked around and we had mindful eyes?

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:07.416
&gt;&gt;Student: We'd notice like
almost everything around us,

00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:09.166
and we'd be aware of our surroundings.

00:00:09.406 --> 00:00:10.226
&gt;&gt;Susan: Absolutely.

00:00:10.296 --> 00:00:11.196
Think about that when you--

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:15.476
&gt;&gt;Joan: What makes Symonds
successful is the integration

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:18.766
of social and academic learning.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.046
&gt;&gt;Richard: By the time they get to fifth
grade, they're actually pretty good

00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:26.036
at being able to talk
about issues and things

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:27.726
that are happening in their lives.

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:35.966
&gt;&gt;Susan: Social Emotional Learning is an
essential piece of the child's ability

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.596
to function in a school setting.

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:40.696
They're being asked to integrate
their conversations in ways

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:41.996
that are not natural to them.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:46.056
They're asked to sit more closely to
someone than they might choose to.

00:00:46.406 --> 00:00:48.446
They need to function
in a social setting

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:50.326
in order to learn their academics.

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.286
The children need to see it and hear
it in many, many different ways.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:58.496
&gt;&gt;Joan: Because it is so integrated,
you almost can't pull it apart.

00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:00.396
It's all about the little pieces.

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:02.146
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Check for
whole-body listening.

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:07.346
Eyes, ears, heart-- showing me
that you're caring about me.

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:09.826
Brain, make sure you're
thinking about my words.

00:01:09.826 --> 00:01:10.766
Body is still.

00:01:11.086 --> 00:01:14.106
&gt;&gt;All: [singing] "Body,
body, body, body.

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:17.886
Whole-body listening with my body.

00:01:18.086 --> 00:01:21.306
Now's not the time for
practicing karate."

00:01:21.396 --> 00:01:24.556
&gt;&gt;Richard: We spent a lot of time
and effort trying to create a warm

00:01:24.556 --> 00:01:29.126
and supportive environment, so kids
graduate from here with confidence.

00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:31.886
But before you can understand
yourself and your feelings,

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:34.776
you have to be able to
identify what they are.

00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:39.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going to
read a scenario or a trigger

00:01:39.396 --> 00:01:41.166
about something that might happen.

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:46.616
Your job is to move your
body near a mat of that zone.

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:50.426
&gt;&gt;Joan: Let's say you
woke up feeling sick.

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:55.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I want you to move
like you are feeling sick.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:58.666
How would you feel?

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:01.476
What zone would be expected
if you're sick.

00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:06.686
&gt;&gt;Ivy: I picked blue because
you're tired, and you're sad,

00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:11.526
because you might have had a
playdate that day or something.

00:02:11.646 --> 00:02:14.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Disappointed
that you're feeling sick.

00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:16.836
What would be the red zone
feeling that you might feel?

00:02:17.186 --> 00:02:17.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Mad.

00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:20.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You might be mad
that you're missing something.

00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:22.856
That would definitely
be a red zone feeling.

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:26.246
&gt;&gt;Joan: We want kids to understand,
you know, what their feeling state is.

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:30.006
If it's an uncomfortable feeling
state, "What tools do I have

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:32.886
so I can bring myself
back into the green zone?"

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:35.206
&gt;&gt;Richard: We spent a lot
of time talking with kids

00:02:35.206 --> 00:02:39.926
about what strategies they should
apply in what circumstances.

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:44.086
&gt;&gt;Susan: Our shoulders are
down, our heads are tall,

00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.186
like they're poking through the clouds.

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:48.526
We're strong like a mountain.

00:02:49.126 --> 00:02:52.706
You can use your anchor spot to help
you with your mindful breathing.

00:02:53.076 --> 00:02:57.116
If your thoughts go away to
the past, or to the future,

00:02:57.116 --> 00:03:00.156
remember judging, planning,
just notice it.

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:02.836
Breathing in, breathing out.

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:09.466
Okay, here we go.

00:03:09.716 --> 00:03:14.236
&gt;&gt;Susan: Mindfulness is teaching
people to be in the present.

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:18.126
And to be open to what's
happening right now.

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:22.846
&gt;&gt;Gretchen: She's had a really
positive effect on the class.

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:26.256
They've had a chance to realize, "Oh,
when I'm really feeling stressed out,

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.116
I can go, "Stop," take some breaths.

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:31.316
Sort of be in a better
place, or be more ready

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:35.636
to handle what's happening in my day.

00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:37.076
&gt;&gt;Susan: Why are we doing this?

00:03:37.076 --> 00:03:39.036
&gt;&gt;Student: Stay in the
present and concentrate.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:40.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Helps to be calm.

00:03:41.136 --> 00:03:43.686
&gt;&gt;Justin: If I can't figure out
a problem in math or something,

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:46.416
it helps me not get stressed
out as much.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:50.006
&gt;&gt;Susan: We teach the social
skill, we model the social skills,

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:53.886
but the more opportunities
they have to do things outside

00:03:53.886 --> 00:03:56.456
of the structured classroom, the better.

00:03:57.176 --> 00:04:00.196
&gt;&gt;Susan: Lunch Groups are just
a way to support kids in terms

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:04.496
of their Social Emotional Learning by
getting an opportunity to come together

00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:09.336
with a supportive adult, and their
peers, and practice friendship skills

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:10.606
and problem-solving skills.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:11.796
&gt;&gt;Susan: What's your
happiest thing today.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:14.776
&gt;&gt;Student: That I got to go
ice-skating over vacation.

00:04:15.096 --> 00:04:16.686
&gt;&gt;Student: Aaliyah,,
what is your happy thing?

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:20.456
&gt;&gt;Aaliyah: I went to Massachusetts
to go see my dad for five days.

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:22.806
&gt;&gt;Aaliyah: It actually feels
good to have four people

00:04:23.166 --> 00:04:25.246
so you're not really
nervous about what you say.

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:27.416
&gt;&gt;Susan: When you get
compliments, how do you feel?

00:04:27.906 --> 00:04:30.906
&gt;&gt;Aaliyah: I feel really
proud, because I'm...

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:35.386
&gt;&gt;Susan: We're really asking them who
they are, and what matters to them,

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:39.396
and what's going well for them,
and what's not going well for them.

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:43.616
And encouraging each other
to help each other out.

00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:48.316
&gt;&gt;Aaliyah: It really hurts
sometimes, and it actually feels good

00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:53.786
when I let it out, because they
actually help me about my problems.

00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:56.426
&gt;&gt;Ivy: Sometimes when you let out
your feelings, you don't really

00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:58.716
like worry about it so much.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.236
&gt;&gt;Ivy: I feel mad because
I'm doing the work

00:05:01.296 --> 00:05:03.086
that I'm supposed to do, and you're not.

00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:04.796
&gt;&gt;Susan: Okay, and what do you want?

00:05:05.176 --> 00:05:07.086
&gt;&gt;Ivy: I would like you to do your part.

00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:07.926
&gt;&gt;Susan: Awesome.

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:08.746
Assertive.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:09.116
Great.

00:05:09.116 --> 00:05:12.226
&gt;&gt;Alli: One of my students was
new to Symonds School this year.

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:14.336
After she started going to group,

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:16.036
I noticed a big difference
in her behavior.

00:05:16.376 --> 00:05:19.106
She seemed more receptive
to directions and learning.

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:20.696
She really started to open up.

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:24.636
&gt;&gt;Richard: And we try to give
kids a lot of opportunities

00:05:24.686 --> 00:05:26.076
where they can be successful,

00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:30.186
and then have them build upon
those successful experiences

00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:33.126
and transfer them into
the academic world.

00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:38.656
If kids can graduate from here
with a degree of self-confidence,

00:05:38.876 --> 00:05:43.976
that is a gift that we can give them
which will carry them throughout life.
