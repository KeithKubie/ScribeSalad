Customer relationships is kind of a fourth piece,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and customer relationship has a really interesting interaction with these other three pieces.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It basically says how do I get customers, how do I keep them,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and how do I grow them, and just like thinking about distribution channels,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
these are very different for web mobile than they are for physical channels.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But visually, they kind of look like this double-sided funnel.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's just take a look at quickly a web example--in getting customers, you're going to be

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
o worrying about how do I acquire them that is how do I get them even to my website,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
how do I activate them that is how do I make them do something, and then later on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we'll see after I got them how do I keep them around that is how do I not lose them

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
through attrition and churn and then what can I do once I have customers

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to make them spend more money or use my product even more.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One of the things we'll be thinking about is how do I get, keep, and grow customers.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And just like every other step, you might have hypothesis on day one,

00:01:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but you're only going to figure this out when you're out of the building.
