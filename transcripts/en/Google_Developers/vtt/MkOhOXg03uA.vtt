Hello.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.740
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.239

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:07.830
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.500

started, take a moment

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.384

miss a single episode.

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:15.010
Daydream Labs has put
out another blog post

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.210
on what they've learned
from rapidly prototyping

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.030
virtual reality concepts.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.430
This week, they discuss
social interaction.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.650
It turns out being in
VR with others amplifies

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.690
and improves the experience, as
long as you take a few things

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.730
into account.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.760
Click through to the blog
post for their guidelines.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.010
Did you discover and catch the
Firebass time-traveling digital

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.910
fish at Google I/O?

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.050
If so, you'll want to check out
this behind-the-scenes article

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.960
on how we created the alternate
reality game that teaches you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.740
about Firebase.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.380
If not, follow the link
anyway and check out the game.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.610
It was a lot of fun.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.320
Notifications are
a key interaction

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.470
between your Android
app and your users,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.920
and Android N provides a better
notification user experience

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.940
with updates that include
a visual refresh, improved

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.660
support for custom views,
and expanded functionality

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.099
through direct reply,
a new messaging style,

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.770
and bundled notifications.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.920
Check out the post for
more details and code.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.830
Does your Android
app derive keys

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.420
using the SHA-1 PRNG algorithm
from the crypto provider?

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.370
If so, you'll need to start
using a real key derivation

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.250
function and possibly re-encrypt
your data in Android N.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280
The post has more.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.230
Google Stackdriver provides

while it's still running using
log points and six things

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.425
Stackdriver brings
to the DevOps table.

00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:43.190
Creating a few Google Forms
manually is manageable,

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.770
but what if you needed to
create hundreds or thousands?

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.890
Check out this post on
how Google Apps Script can

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.605
help you scale by generating
Google Forms programmatically.

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:56.780
The Google Maps operations team
just built a brand new Google

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.030
Maps APIs course.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.150
It was developed in
collaboration with Udacity

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.480
and teaches you best practices
when using our web APIs.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.510

the Google Maps APIs

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.373
or just want a
refresher, this course

00:02:07.373 --> 00:02:09.539
will teach you how to start
adding location features

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.476
and map visualizations
into your websites today.

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:16.150
In the last episode of
"The Mobile Ads Garage,"

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.030
the team showed you how to
implement AdMob interstitials

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.920
on iOS and Android.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.300
In this new episode,
they're back

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.800
to show you how to
put interstitials

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.780
to work in the best ways
possible with some best

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.300
practices.
