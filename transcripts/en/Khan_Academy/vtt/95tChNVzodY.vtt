00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.810
Complete the square on the
general quadratic equation.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.950
We have ax squared plus bx
plus c is equal to 0.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.160
So whenever I complete the
square, actually whenever I

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.620
deal with any of these types
of quadratic equations, I

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.710
always like to not have an a, or
a non 1 coefficient, on the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.630
x squared terms. So let's make
it into a 1 coefficient.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.140
And the easiest way to do
that is just divide

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.330
everything by a.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.930
So we divide every term on the
left side by a, and of course

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.110
we have to divide the right
side by a as well.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.300
And so the left side
will become x

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.890
squared plus b over ax.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.630
And then I'll write c
over a over here.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.970
So we have some room to add and
subtract things so we can

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.620
really complete the square.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.770
So plus c over a is equal to 0
divided by a, which is just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.960
going to be equal to 0.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.800
Now when we complete the
square, we've seen this

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.710
multiple times before, what
we want to do is take the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.819
coefficient on the x term right
here, it's b over a,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:05.750
take half of it.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.980
This right here is two
times b over 2a.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.420
Right?

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.420
The 2's cancel out.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.910
This is just 2 times
b over 2a.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.020
So you take half of it, half
of b over a is b over 2a.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.270
You take half of it, and then
you square it, and you add it

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.830
right here.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.565
So plus b squared-- Let
me write it this way.

00:01:26.565 --> 00:01:31.780
b over 2a squared.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.800
And of course I can't just add
something to one side of the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.510
equation, that would change
the equation.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.720
I also either have to add it
to the other side, or just

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.140
subtract it from the same side
that I'm adding it to.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.120
So I'll also subtract
the b over 2a

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.410
squared just like that.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.770
Now, the whole point of doing
this is so these first three

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.200
terms right here are a perfect
square trinomial.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.290
That's what completing the
square is all about.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.150
And we've seen the pattern
multiple times.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:08.590
If I have, let's say, m plus n
squared-- and I'm using m and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.650
n so we don't get confused
with the a's and b's

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:11.860
and x's over here.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430
But if I have m plus n squared,
we've seen multiple

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.250
times, that's going to be equal
to m squared plus 2mn

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.030
plus n squared.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.760
And here we have that
pattern now.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.770
That's the whole point behind
completing the square.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.390
That's the whole point behind
taking half of b over a--

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.780
that's b over 2a-- and then
squaring it and adding it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.140
right here.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.480
We now fit that pattern.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.540
m is x.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.390
n is b over 2a.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.140
And 2mn, if I take an x times a
b over 2a, and multiply that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.420
by 2, I get b over ax.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.780
So this expression, right here,
this trinomial, the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.250
first three terms, it is a
perfect square trinomial, and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.410
we can write it as x plus
b over 2a squared.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.840
And then of course we
have all this other

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.450
business right here.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.540
And then of course we
have all of this

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.960
other stuff right here.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.360
Which is negative b over,
and let me just actually

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.320
square it for you.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.410
So b over 2a squared
is negative b

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.970
squared over 4a squared.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.660
And then I have this
plus c over a.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.980
But let's write it with the
same denominator here.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.530
So I could have c over a, or I
could multiply the numerator

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.280
and the denominator by 4a.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.000
So if I multiply the numerator
by 4a, I get 4ac.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.040
If I multiply the denominator
by 4a, I get 4a squared.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.290
And the whole reason why I
multiplied the numerator and

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.060
the denominator by 4a was
so that we have the same

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.400
denominator right here.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.940
And, of course, that is going
to be equal to 0.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.540
And we could simplify it a
little bit more, or actually,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.550
well yeah we'll just simplify
it next in the next step.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.580
We don't want to skip
too many steps here.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.220
So you have x plus b
over 2a squared.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.380
And then we could say, plus-- we
could put the 4ac first, so

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.510
we could say-- actually let's
just say, plus negative b

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:23.230
squared, plus 4ac, all of that
over 4a squared is equal to 0.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.650
I didn't put the 4ac first,
I just put the negative b

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.280
squared there.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.880
Now let's isolate this
squared binomial on

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.600
the left hand side.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600
And the easiest way we can do
that is to subtract this thing

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.150
from both sides of
the equation.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.040
So let's do that.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.540
So you can imagine if we add
b-- let me do this in a

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.060
different color.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.540
If we were to add positive b
squared minus 4ac over 4a

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.950
squared on the left hand side,
those will cancel out and

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.570
we're also going to add it
on the right hand side.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.780
Positive b squared minus
4ac over 4a squared.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.650
Anything I do the left I
have to do the right.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.900
What do we end up with?

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.970
We end up with, on the left
hand side, these two guys

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.470
cancel out.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.460
We have the same denomenator,
when you add the numerators,

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.800
that cancels with that.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.270
The 4ac cancels with the
negative 4ac, these just

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.640
completely cancel out.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.060
And on the left hand side,
you just have x

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.640
plus b over 2a squared.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.090
And on the right hand side, you
have that being equal to b

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.660
squared minus-- let me do
that in a blue color.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:43.190
b squared minus 4ac, all of
that over 4a squared.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.330
Now the next thing we probably
want to do, if we want to

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.310
really solve for x, is to take
the square root of both sides

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.510
of this equation.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.300
So let's do that.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.050
Let's take the square root of
both sides of this equation.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.220
And if, when we do that-- We
don't want to only take the

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.120
positive square root because x
plus b be over 2a could be a

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.220
negative number, or it could
be a positive number.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.070
So we want to take
the positive and

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.740
negative square root.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.030
So we could say that the square
root, we could put the

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.420
positive or negative here or,
since we're taking the square

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.480
root of both sides,
we could put the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.120
positive or negative there.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.800
If you put the positive or
negative on both sides, it's

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.390
really just telling you
the same thing.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.290
It really is all the different
combinations.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.720
If the negative square root over
here equals the negative

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.750
square root over here, then it's
just another combination

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.280
of the different positives
and negatives.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.120
So you could just write it as,
this square root is equal to

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.410
the plus or minus square
root of b squared

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.710
minus 4ac over 4a squared.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.710
Now what does this
simplify to?

00:06:49.710 --> 00:07:01.140
Well, the left hand side just
becomes x plus b over 2a is

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.100
equal to-- and now it
gets interesting.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.960
And you might even start
recognizing parts of it.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.150
So let's take the plus or minus
square root of the top.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.480
What is that going to be?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.550
And you could just take the plus
or minus only of the top

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.560
because, once again, the
same principles apply.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.370
There's no reason why you have
to do a plus or minus over a

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.070
plus and minus and a plus or
minus on the left hand side.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.940
There's only one combination
here, where there's only one

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.910
plus or minus on
the numerator.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.630
I apologize if that
confuses you.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:34.030
So let's write this as the plus
or minus square root of b

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.770
squared minus 4ac over--
What's the square

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.050
root of 4a a squared?

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.300
Well, it's just going
to be 2a.

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:44.420
Right?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.930
The square root of 4 is 2.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.800
The square root of
a squared is a.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.100
And we're almost there.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.620
To solve for x, we just have
to subtract b over 2a from

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.070
both sides.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.640
We just have to subtract b over
2a from both sides of

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.800
this equation.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.360
The left hand side, we just
end up with our x.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:06.500
And then the right hand side,
we have a negative b over 2a

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:13.200
plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac-- all

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.630
of that over 2a.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:16.890
Since we have the same
denominator, we can write this

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:22.710
as negative b plus or minus the
square root of b squared

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:27.730
minus 4ac-- all of
that over 2a.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.260
And we're done.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.300
We've solved for the x's and you
see there's actually two

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.289
solutions here.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.340
There's one where you take the
positive square root, and

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.620
there's another solution
where you take the

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.380
negative square root.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.429
If this square root exists,
and if the positive and

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.090
negative-- and if it's
not 0, you're

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.789
going to have two solutions.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.360
And this, right here, this
result we have is-- Look, you

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:50.540
give me any quadratic equation,
you give me the a,

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.090
the b, and the c, we could now
substitute it into this

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.340
formula essentially we just
derived right here, and I'll

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.790
give you the roots, I'll give
you the x's for that quadratic

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.290
equation-- the x's that satisfy

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.490
that quadratic equation.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.960
And this formula, right here,
for solving any quadratic

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.040
equation is called the
quadratic formula.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.820
And you could see it just
comes straight out of

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.010
completing the square.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.570
There's no mystery,
magic here.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.700
But it's easily one of the
most useful formulas in

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.165
mathematics.

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:23.930
And I'm usually not
a huge proponent

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.070
of memorizing things.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.570
But it probably will benefit
you in life if you did.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.390
Hope you enjoyed that.
