light-hearted it should be suspenseful
and terrifying and so the director had

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
and terrifying and so the director had
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.449
and terrifying and so the director had
the right idea and trying to make it

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459
the right idea and trying to make it
 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.580
the right idea and trying to make it
more serious but the script wasn't

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
more serious but the script wasn't
 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.410
more serious but the script wasn't
supposed to be that serious and so the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420
supposed to be that serious and so the
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.930
