00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.020
Now that we know the
magnitude of the acceleration

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.480
due to gravity at 400 kilometers
above the surface of the earth,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.440
where the space
station might hang out,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.780
what I want to do in this video
is think about how fast does

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.051
the space station need to be
moving in order to keep missing

00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:18.550
the earth as it's falling, or
another way to think about it,

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.390
in order to stay
in orbit, in order

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.840
to maintain its circular
motion around the earth.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.300
So we know from our
studies of circular motion

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.110
so far, what's keeping it going
in circular motion, assuming

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.780
that it has a constant
speed, is some type

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.490
of centripetal acceleration.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.865
And that centripetal
acceleration

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:39.860
is the acceleration
due to gravity.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.680
And we figured out what
it was at 400 kilometers.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.410
And so we know that that
centripetal acceleration-- let

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.890
me write it here
in pink-- we know

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.920
that the magnitude of that
centripetal acceleration

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.590
has to be equal to the speed or
the magnitude of the velocity

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.710
squared divided by
divided r, where

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.770
r is the radius of
the circular path.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380
So in this case,
it'd be the radius

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.069
of the orbit, which
would be the radius

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.197
of the Earth, plus the altitude.

00:01:07.197 --> 00:01:09.280
So that, we already figured
out in the last video,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.180
is 6,771 kilometers.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.280
Let's just solve this
for v, and then we

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.110
can put in the numbers
in our calculators.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.590
So you multiply both sides by
r, and you flip the two sides.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.210
You get v squared is
equal to the magnitude

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.830
of our acceleration
times the radius.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.110
The magnitude of our
velocity or speed

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.680
is equal to the square root
of our acceleration times--

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.350
or the magnitude of
our acceleration--

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.221
times the radius.

00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.720
And so let's get
our calculator out,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.511
and you can verify that
the units work out.

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:43.340
This is meters per second
squared times meters, which

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.132
gives us meters squared
per second squared.

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:46.673
Take the square root
of that, and you

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.060
get meters per second, which
is the appropriate units.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.140
But let's get our calculator
out and actually calculate this.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.640
Let me see.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.080
My calculator's sitting
on my other screen.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.920
There you go.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.570
And then we want to calculate
the principal square root

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.115
of the acceleration due to
gravity at this altitude,

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:07.490
the magnitude of
the acceleration

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.740
due to gravity at that
altitude is 8.69 meters

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.160
per second squared times the
radius of our circular path.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.170
That's going to be the
radius of Earth, which

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.980
is 6,371 kilometers plus the
400 kilometers of altitude

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.130
that we have in this scenario.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.930
So that gives us 6.-- and we
did this in the last video--

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.830
6.771 times 10 to
the sixth meters.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.360
And it's important that
everything here is in meters.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.040
Our acceleration is in
meters per second squared.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.750
This right over
here is in meters.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.130
So the units don't
do anything strange.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.315
And then we get a drum
roll for how fast--

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.190
and this is going to be
in meters per second.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.940
We already thought about
how the units will work out.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.340
We get 7,670-- I could say 71.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.840
But actually I'm
just going to stick

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.006
to three significant digits.

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:04.320
7,670 meters per second.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.980
So let me write that down.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.220
The necessary velocity
to stay in orbit

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.780
is 7,670 meters per second.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.930
So let's just conceptualize
that for a second.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.790
Every second, it's
going over 7,000 meters.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.550
Or every second, it's
going over 7 kilometers.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.430
Every second.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.020
It's going at this super-- if
we assume that's the direction

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.610
it's traveling, it's going at
this super-, superfast speed.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.360
And if we want to translate
that into kilometers per hour,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.144
you just take 7,670
meters per second.

00:03:39.144 --> 00:03:40.810
If you want to know
how many meters it's

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.351
going to do in an
hour, you just say,

00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:47.090
well, there's 3,600
seconds per hour.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.880
And so if you
multiply that, that's

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.972
how many meters it
will travel in an hour.

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:52.430
But if you want
that in kilometers,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.790
you just divide by 1,000.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.440
You have 1 kilometer
for every 1,000 meters.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.110
Meters will cancel out.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.470
Seconds will cancel out.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.500
And you are left with
kilometers per hour.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.847
So let's do that.

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:08.180
So that was our previous answer.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.370
We multiply by 3,600 and
then divide by 1,000.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.880
So we really could have
just multiplied by 3.6.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.440
And then we get 27,000, roughly
27,600 kilometers per hour.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.440
So this is really an
unfathomable speed.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.110
And you might be wondering, how
does such a big thing maintain

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.370
that type of speed, because even
a jet plane, which is nowhere

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.710
near this fast, has to have
these huge engines to maintain

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.780
its speed.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.410
How does this thing maintain it?

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.570
And the difference between
this and a jet plane

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.770
is that a jet or a car or if
I throw a ball or anything

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.697
like that-- but a jet plane.

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:54.280
Let's focus on a jet
plane so we don't

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.654
have to worry
about other things.

00:04:55.654 --> 00:04:58.865
A jet plane has to
travel through the air.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:00.240
It has to travel
through the air.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.070
And actually, it uses the air as
kind of its form of propulsion.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.560
It sucks in the air, and then it
spits out the air really fast.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.770
But it has all of
this air resistance.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.910
So if the engines were
to just shut down,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.600
all the air would
bump into the plane

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.110
and provide essentially
friction to slow down the plane.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.850
What the space station or the
space shuttle or something

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.230
in space has going for
itself is that it's

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.230
traveling in an almost
complete vacuum.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.250
Not 100% complete vacuum,
but almost complete vacuum.

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.950
So it has pretty much
no air resistance,

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.840
negligible air resistance
to have to deal with.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.020
So we know from Newton's
laws, an object in motion

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.220
tends to stay in motion.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.500
So once this thing
gets going, it

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.130
doesn't have air
to slow it down.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.270
It'll keep staying that speed.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.650
In fact, if it did
not have gravity,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.530
which is causing this
centripetal acceleration

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.970
right over here, it would
just go in a straight path.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.494
It would go in a straight
path forever and ever.

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.160
And that brings up
an interesting point.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.290
Because if you are
in orbit like this,

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.580
traveling at this very,
very, very fast speed,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.050
you have to make sure that
you don't vary from this speed

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.620
too much.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.240
If you slow down, you will
slowly spiral into the Earth.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.390
And if you speed up a
lot beyond that speed,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.720
you will slowly spiral
away from the Earth.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.620
Because then the centripetal
acceleration due to gravity

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.660
won't be enough to keep you
in a perfect circular path.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.250
So you really have to stay
pretty close to that speed

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.070
right there.
