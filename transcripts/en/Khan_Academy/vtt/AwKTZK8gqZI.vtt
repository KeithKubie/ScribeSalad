00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.390
We're on problem 237.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.490
A part-time employee whose
hourly wage was increased by

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.520
25% decided to reduce the number
of hours worked per

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.320
week so that the employee's
total weekly income would

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.630
remain unchanged.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.110
By what percent should
the number of

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.740
hours worked be reduced?

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.790
So before, he made his
hourly wage times

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.280
hours worked, right?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.730
This is what he would normally
work in a week, right?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.730
So his wage per hour times
hours per week.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.250
This is what he used to make.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.550
But now what he's done is since
he's making 25% more of

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.200
his wage, he's going to reduce
his hours by some number, by

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.310
some fraction.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.390
Let's call that x.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.050
So then the new wage times the
new hours , and they're saying

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.410
that he doesn't want to change
the total amount that

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.430
he makes in a week.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.780
So the new wage times the new
hours will equal w times h.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.530
Let's divide both sides by w.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320
This goes to 1, that
goes to 1.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.250
Divide both sides by h.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.050
That goes to 1, that
goes to 1.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.640
And you're left with 1 is
equal to 1.25 times x.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.200
And I view that-- this is easier
to think of as what?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.780
5/4, right?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.400
1.25-- right?

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.430
4/4 is 1, and then you
add another 1/4.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.130
This is 1 and 1/4,
so this is 5/4.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.350
So let's write that as 5/4x.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.950
Multiply both sides by 4/5,
you get x is equal to 4/5,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.320
which is equal to 0.8.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.610
So another way to view it is he
would reduce-- he's working

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.470
80% of the hours that he used to
work, so he reduced by 20%

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.960
the amount that he worked.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.860
And that will be choice B.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.280
Next problem, 238.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.230
OK, they've drawn us a figure,
so let's draw the figure.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.550
Let me see if I could
make it thicker.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.170
OK, so they drew a box in a box,
and there's another box

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.180
in that box, and it looks
something like that.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.350
And then they shaded it in,
so I'll shade it in.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.710
And they say that this side up
here is 18, and they say that

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.560
this side over here is 15.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.300
The shaded region in the figure
above represents a

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.210
rectangular frame with length 18
inches and width 15 inches.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.300
The frame encloses a rectangular
picture that has

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.730
the same area as this
frame itself.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.160
So this area is equal
to this area.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.410
Fascinating.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.020
If the length and width of the
picture have the same ratio as

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.430
the length and width of the
frame, what is the length of

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.910
the picture in inches?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.670
So they're saying that this is
the length, so this is l.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.350
And this is the width.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.600
And they want us
to solve for l.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.040
What is the length of
the picture, right?

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.340
They're calling-- I mean, I
would call that width, but

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.390
they originally say the frame
with length 18 inches.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.630
So they want to know the
length of the picture.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.310
OK, first of all, they tell us
that the ratios are the same.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.600
So l:w of the picture is the
same ratio as it is for the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.782
frame, is 18:15.

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:32.810
You divide by 3.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.660
That's the same thing as 6:5,
right? l:w is equal to 6:5.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.590
And the other thing they told
us is that the area of the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.000
picture the same as the
area of the frame.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So the area the picture is
l times w, and what's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.360
the area the frame?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.960
What's the area of this whole
thing , which is 15 times 18,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.560
minus the area of the
picture, right?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.350
Because the area of the frame
is not this whole rectangle.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.090
It's just the part that doesn't
have the picture in

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.990
it, so minus l times w.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.020
So if we add lw to both
sides, we get 2lw is

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.060
equal to 15 times 18.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.019
I'm just going to leave
that as 15 times 18.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.529
Let's see, we could already
divide both sides by 2, so you

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:27.080
get lw is equal to 15 times 9.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.290
And let's see, we have two
equations with two unknowns.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.150
Let's see if we can solve.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.630
So we have l/w is
equal to 6/5.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.420
We can cross-multiply, so we
get 5l is equal to 6w.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.990
I ignored the stuff
in the middle.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.790
And we want to solve
for l, right?

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.160
So let's substitute for w.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.320
So we get 5/6l is equal to w,
and now let's substitute that

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.760
into this equation.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:05.110
So we have l times w, which is
5/6l, is equal to 15 times 9.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.520
And let's see, let's multiply
both sides by 6/5, and so you

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:21.210
would get l squared is equal to
15 times 9 times 6 over 5.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.500
So let's see, we could do
a little simplification.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.320
This becomes 3, this becomes
1, and then we have-- let's

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.850
see, now we have to
do some math.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.372
3 times 9 is 27.

00:05:35.372 --> 00:05:41.390
27 times 6 is what?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.150
7 times 6 is 42.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:55.360
2 times 6 is 12,
plus 4 is 161.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.190
That's a strange number.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.600
So let's see if I can
simplify this.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.180
Oh, I'm looking at choices,
and they have all sorts of

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.410
crazy square roots in it.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:11.320
So let's just say that l is
equal to the square root of--

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.640
let's see, how can
we rewrite this?

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.820
We could rewrite the 6
as 3 times 2, right?

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.170
So then we get 3 times 9 times
3, that's the same

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.210
thing as 9 times 9.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.970
That's 81, right?

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.010
81 times 2.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.040
And we have a 1 in
the denominator.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.420
So l is equal to 9, and I'll
do one more step, because I

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.400
think this confuses
a lot of people.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.080
That's equal to the square root
of 81 times the square

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.710
root of 2, which is equal
to 9 square roots of 2,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.330
which is choice A.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.760
Problem 239.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.430
Of the 200 students at College
T majoring in one or more of

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.630
the sciences-- I already feel
a Venn diagram coming on.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.360
Of the 200 students at College
T majoring in one or more of

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.750
the sciences, 130 are majoring--
so let me draw the

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.460
whole-- well, let me read
the whole problem.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.200
130 are majoring in
chemistry and 150

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.640
are majoring in biology.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.250
If at least 30 of the students
are not majoring in either

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.190
chemistry or biology, then the
number of students majoring in

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.090
both chemistry and biology can
be any number from-- OK, let

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.370
me draw the Venn diagram.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.930
So that's chemistry, that's
biology, and then there's a

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.350
leftover, right?

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.660
This is a whole pool.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.920
So they tell us there's
200 total, right?

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.010
There's 200 total.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:47.780
And they say that 130 are
majoring in chemistry, 150 in

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.530
biology, and then at least 30
of the students are not

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.830
majoring in either chemistry
or biology, so we could say

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.350
greater than or equal to 30.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.380
So this is driving a little
spin here by making it an

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.240
inequality.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.910
Then the number of students
majoring in both chemistry and

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:13.770
biology could be any number
from-- OK, so let's say that

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.120
this is 30, just to simplify
our thinking.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.850
If this is 30, how many
people are majoring in

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.270
chemistry or biology?

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.170
Well, then it's 170, right?

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.660
So let's think of it this way.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.970
Let's think of this as the
intercept-- this is both.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.720
Well, I used B for biology.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.640
So let's call this-- I don't
know, let's call this-- I used

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.200
C for combined.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.760
So let's call this I for
the intersection.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.360
So if 30 people are majoring
in-- well, actually, let's

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.730
just call this x.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.000
So how many people are majoring
in-- if I wanted to

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.040
add these two numbers up, if I
want to know the people who

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.090
are in chemistry or biology,
what would it be?

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:04.100
It would be 130 plus 150, and
remember, and we've done this

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.440
a couple of times with these
Venn diagram problems, if I

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.200
counted these 130, and then I
count these 150, I've counted

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.260
this intersection twice.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.830
I counted it with the 130, and
I counted with the 150.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.610
So I have to subtract out at
least the intersection once.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.250
So I subtract it out once.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.320
So these are the number of
people who are in chemistry or

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.800
biology or both, right?

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.630
So it's the intersection of
chemistry or biology or both.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:36.960
And now we know that that has
got to be equal to what?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.870
Well, 200 minus the people who
are in nothing, right?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.260
So I'm going to call
that x for now.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.605
200 minus the people
who are nothing.

00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:49.690
And let's see if we can solve
for the intersection, which is

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.810
what they're asking
us in terms of x.

00:09:51.810 --> 00:10:02.260
So this becomes 280 minus I
is equal to 200 minus x.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.720
And then they tell us to
subtract 200 from both sides.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.890
You get 80 minus I is
equal to minus x.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.680
Let's add I to both sides.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.820
So you get 80 is equal
to I minus x, right?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.010
Or even better, let's
add x to both sides.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:31.380
So you get I is equal
to 80 plus x.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.680
And so, if x is greater than
or equal to 30-- so we know

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:39.770
that if x is 30, then
we get what?

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.270
We get 130 plus 80
is 110, right?

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:47.550
So we know that I is
going to be greater

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.350
than or equal to 110.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.310
The intersection is
at least 110.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.750
Now, what's an upper
bound on it?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.960
How many people can
be studying both?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.860
And if you look at the choices
already, there's two choices

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.170
that have 110 as the minimum for
the number studying both.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.010
But what's the maximum that
can be studying both?

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.520
Well, it's 130, right?

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.980
If all the chemistry people
are also studying biology,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.200
then the intersection
becomes 130, right?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.490
But you can't have 150 people
studying both, because there's

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.780
only 150 studying chemistry.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.630
So the intersection is greater
than or equal to 110.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.300
And it's limited by the number
of people studying chemistry,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:32.340
130, which is choice D.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.770
And I'll see you in
the next video.
