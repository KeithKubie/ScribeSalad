00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:05.689
Given, 12x-3(5x+1)=-3x-3,

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.770
what will happen if I
ask you to solve for x?

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.325
This one's actually even
trickier than it looks, so

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:15.987
here are all the steps to solve it.

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:25.075
I first rewrote the equation
as 12x+(-3)(5x+1)=-3x- 3.

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:27.993
To make the negative sign
easier to distribute,

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:32.150
I distributed the -3 to the terms
inside the parentheses.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.370
I simplified a bit, and
rewrote the equation as 12x-15x-3=-3x-3.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.626
I combine like terms, and things are
starting to look a little funny here.

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:49.200
-3x-3=-3x-3.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.708
Okay, well let's keep going.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:55.771
I added 3 to both sides and

00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.400
got -3x+0=-3x+0.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.160
All right, stranger still.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.035
And then, I'm left with -3x=-3x,

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:12.141
then I divided by -3 on both sides and
I just get x=x.

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:13.880
So what does that mean?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.730
In algebra, we call this type of
an equation, an identity equation,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.160
x equals itself, that's its identity, so
that means I could put an any value for

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.890
x, and it won't change
what this equation means.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.889
Here, I could have divided
by x instead of -3 and

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:39.190
I would have gotten -3=-3, again,
that's an identity, -3 is -3.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.040
The important thing to remember here
is that the solution is stated,

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.020
all real numbers.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.390
Which means that, it doesn't matter
what value you substitute in for

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.460
x, the equation will remain true.
