00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.780
This is a normal distribution, or a bell curve. On the X axis we have the

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.430
scores. On the Y axis we have frequencies. Frequencies are how often a score

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.688
occurs. It might help to visualize with something like an IQ. Here The mean IQ

00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:22.410
is 100. Now we're going to look at deviations. So here we have one standard

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.454
deviation. For our IQ, one standard deviation above the mean would be 115. 85,

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:36.830
however, would be one standard deviation below the mean. We see that 68% of the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.810
population will fall between one standard deviation above the mean, one

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.750
standard deviation below the mean. Next we see that 95% of the population will

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.950
fall with two standard deviations above the mean or two standard deviations

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.200
below the mean. Next, we see that 99.7% of the population fall between three

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.120
standard deviations above the mean and three standard deviations below the

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.320
mean. We have the 68, 95 and 99.7 rule. That means that 68% of the population

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.770
is going to fall between one standard eviction below and one standard deviation

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.850
above the mean. 95% of the population will fall from two standard deviations

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.880
below two standard deviations above the mean. And 99.7% are going to fall from

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.200
three standard deviations. Below the mean to three standard deviations above

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.550
the mean.
