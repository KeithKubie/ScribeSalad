JASON SILVA: There
are people who

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.120
talk about the creative
process with such humility.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.330
There's a sense that
something larger than yourself

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.900
has worked its way through you.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.815
To paraphrase Kahlil Gibran's
notion about children,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.870
the creative
process-- creativity

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.720
comes through you
but not from you.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.210
Though it is with you, it
belongs not to you, right?

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.220
This notion that we are the
frontal lobes of the universe.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.540
And so when we
craft beauty, when

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.230
we vocalize, when we
utter inspiration,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.710
what are we actually doing?

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.910
Are we creating something
that isn't there?

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.600
Or are we merely
transcribing, right?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.740
The notion of inspiration means
we're breathing in and exhaling

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.220
what we've taken in.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.220
So we're merely transcribing
the observation of what is.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.560
We're recording.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.550
We are all cosmonauts,
psychonauts.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.650
And the creative
process is merely

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.460
what we brought back as
reporters of the numinous.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.800
When we go to Plato's realm of
ideals, we are as navigators.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.460
We are as Dorothy going
into Oz, seeing the world

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.690
through a different
lens, seeing reality

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.910
through a different operating
system, a different set

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.160
of filters, and thus being
able to read differently,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.750
to see something that others
can't and then bring that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.626
back and then share that back.

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:38.084
And I think that that's what's
happening during creativity.

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.580
And I think that that's why
we should be humble about it.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.080
Respect the gods.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.730
There's poetry in every moment.
