00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.400
By now it should be clear that
successful management of chronic

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.420
diseases in our highly specialized
healthcare system requires

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.677
digital data that can be shared as
needed to achieve coordinated care.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:20.090
However, patient-specific healthcare
data is highly sensitive,

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.620
and is protected by a law called HIPAA,
which calls for

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.050
severe penalties, including prison time,
for failure to properly

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.060
secure what is called
Protected Health Information or PHI.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.960
PHI is healthcare data that is linked to
information that identifies the patient.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.500
You will hear the term de-identified
data which refers to the same health

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.470
information once it has been separated
from any fields that could directly or

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.740
indirectly be used to
identify the patient.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.680
Everyone in healthcare is
concerned about HIPAA.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.520
So the topic of this lesson are the
critical technologies that secure

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.220
PHI to make sure it is only shared for
legitimate purposes and

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.260
even then, the sharing has been approved
by the patient or their legal designee.
