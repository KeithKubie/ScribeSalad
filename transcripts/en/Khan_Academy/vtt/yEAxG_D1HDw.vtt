00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's see if we can stumble
our way to another

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.590
logarithm property.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:21.090
So let's say that the log
base x of A is equal to B.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:37.000
That's the same thing as saying
that x to the B is equal to A.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.900
Fair enough.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.260
So what I want to
do is experiment.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
What happens if I multiply this
expression by another variable?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.690
Let's call it C.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.580
So I'm going to multiply both
sides of this equation times C.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.960
And I'll just switch colors
just to keep things

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.630
interesting.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.740
That's not an x that's a C.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.120
I should probably just
do a dot instead.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.860
Times C.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610
So I'm going to multiply both
sides of this equation times C.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:09.940
So I get C times log base x of
A is equal to-- multiply both

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.130
sides of the equation--
is equal to B times C.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.250
Fair enough.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.990
I think you realize I
have not done anything

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.980
profound just yet.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.580
But let's go back.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.300
We said that this is the
same thing as this.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.210
So let's experiment
with something.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.530
Let's raise this side
to the power of C.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.120
So I'm going to raise this
side to the power of C.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.500
That's a kind of caret.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.950
And when you type
exponents that's what

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:34.630
you would use, a caret.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.160
So I'm going to raise
it to the power of C.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:44.320
So then, this side is x
to the B to the C power,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.140
is equal to A to the C.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.680
All I did is I raised both
sides of this equation

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.430
to the Cth power.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.890
And what do we know about when
you raise something to an

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.610
exponent and you raise that
whole thing to another

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.710
exponent, what happens
to the exponents?

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.430
Well, that's just exponent
rule and you just multiply

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.640
those two exponents.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:12.460
This just implies that x to the
BC is equal to A to the C.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.350
What can we do now?

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.390
Well, I don't know.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.920
Let's take the logarithm
of both sides.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.010
Or let's just write this--
let's not take the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.990
logarithm of both sides.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.170
Let's write this as a
logarithm expression.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.280
We know that x to the BC
is equal to A to the C.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.240
Well, that's the exact same
thing as saying that the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:43.400
logarithm base x of A to
the C is equal to BC.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.220
Correct?

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.310
Because all I did is I rewrote
this as a logarithm expression.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.460
And I think now you
realized that something

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.170
interesting has happened.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.120
That BC, well, of course, it's
the same thing as this BC.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.350
So this expression must be
equal to this expression.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.200
And I think we have another
logarithm property.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.750
That if I have some kind of a
coefficient in front of the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.740
logarithm where I'm multiplying
the logarithm, so if I have C

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.820
log-- Clog base x of A,
but that's C times the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.660
logarithm base x of A.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.730
That equals the log
base x of A to the C.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.410
So you could take this
coefficient and instead make

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.490
it an exponent on the term
inside the logarithm.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.850
That is another
logarithm property.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.220
So let's review what we know
so far about logarithms.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:54.320
We know that if I write-- let
me say-- well, let me just with

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.120
the letters I've been using.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.430
C times logarithm base x of
A is equal to logarithm

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.480
base x of A to the C.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.710
We know that.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.880
And we know-- we just learned
that logarithm base x of A plus

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.360
logarithm base x of B is equal
to the logarithm base

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.130
x of A times B.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.340
Now let me ask you a question.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.850
What happens if instead of
a positive sign here we

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.530
put a negative sign?

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.180
Well, you could probably figure
it out yourself but we could do

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.320
that same exact proof that
we did in the beginning.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.000
But in this time we will
set it up with a negative.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.235
Let's just say that log
base x of A is equal to l.

00:04:53.235 --> 00:04:58.845
Let's say that log base
x of B is equal to m.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:14.330
Let's say that log base x of A
divided by B is equal to n.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.550
How can we write all of these
expressions as exponents?

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.340
Well, this just says that
x to the l is equal to A.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.190
Let me switch colors.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.230
That keeps it interesting.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.840
This is just saying that x
to the m is equal to B.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:39.600
And this is just saying that
x to the n is equal to A/B.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.410
So what can we do here?

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.660
Well what's another
way of writing A/B?

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.580
Well, that's just the same
thing as writing x to the l

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.250
because that's A,
over x to the m.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.770
That's B.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.980
And this we know from our
exponent rules-- this could

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.800
also be written as x to the
l, x to the negative m.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.780
Or that also equals
x to the l minus m.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:21.490
So what do we know?

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.020
We know that x to the n is
equal to x to the l minus m.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.070
Those equal each other.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.900
I just made a big
equal chain here.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:40.226
So we know that n is
equal to l minus m.

00:06:40.226 --> 00:06:42.340
Well, what does that do for us?

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.340
Well, what's another
way of writing n?

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.370
I'm going to do it up here
because I think we have

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.920
stumbled upon another
logarithm rule.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.660
What's another way
of writing n?

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.160
Well, I did it right here.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.690
This is another
way of writing n.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:07.130
So logarithm base x of
A/B-- this is an x over

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.610
here-- is equal to l.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.550
l is this right here.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.640
Log base x of A is equal to l.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:22.250
The log base x of A minus m.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.300
I wrote m right here.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.390
That's log base x of B.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.910
There you go.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.060
I probably didn't
have to prove it.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.085
You could've probably tried
it out with dividing

00:07:37.085 --> 00:07:38.310
it, but whatever.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:46.060
But you know are hopefully
satisfied that we have this new

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.080
logarithm property right there.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.240
Now I have one more logarithm
property to show you, but I

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.100
don't think I have time to
show it in this video.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.190
So I will do it in
the next video.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:57.811
I'll see you soon.
