1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,670
When you look at any other kind of car,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,370
like if you buy a Chevy or
if you buy even a, you know,

3
00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:06,450
a Porsche or something like that,

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,220
you can find these little mom
and pop fix it chops. Right?

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,240
You can find them all over the place.
Absolutely. All around. You know,

6
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:16,360
you go to a West hills, there's a bunch
of places that fixed cars, right? Hey,

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,930
did something wrong with my transmission?
Can you look at it? No problem.

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,330
They put it on the lift. They go, Oh,
you've got a leak here. You've got this.

9
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,830
He got that.
But the Tesla,

10
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:25,320
you're on your own son that's
either bring it to Tesla.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,680
I know man or Nada and I get
it from their point of view.

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,960
They don't want a bunch of people monkey
around with their shit. Yeah. But,

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,810
but even like Mac,
like you can go to the genius store,

14
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,540
which is gross genius bar. Yeah.
Whatever the fuck that name.

15
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:43,800
And that's gross genius bar picture.
Let me see your Ikea tests.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,710
That's a bit pompous.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,840
Met some of them people that again are
not geniuses smarter than you, whatever.

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,520
So you can either go there or you can go
to these little mom and pop max doors.

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,320
Those do exist and they're not approved,
but they can fix your computer.

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,710
They get shit done, they get shit done.
So that's the goal for me. So, you know,

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,220
I'm starting my own shop. I'm showing
a shop called the electrified garage,

22
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,470
and that's like, Ooh, I like it.
Yeah. Not Bad. How's good name?

23
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,260
I got some swag for you too. Um, so,

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,590
and that's the biggest thing is because
there's no mom and pop shop to fix

25
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,970
Teslas. Right? Like right now
it's the only game in town.
They're pumping out what,

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,390
like 5,000 cars a week now I photos a
week. Right. Which doesn't seem like much,

27
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,540
but for a small company, it's insane.
That's a lot. And he's got a day.

28
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,950
It's 30 days. It's a lie. It's like,
what, 20 20,000 a month? I don't know,

29
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:33,300
5,000 a week. Oh, heck yeah. It was like
20,000 a month or so. Geez. About that.

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,550
So, um, and then all of these thousand
cars is a lot. It's a lot of cars. Right?

31
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,360
That's a lot of fricking cars.
I think they're too busy.
So it's social right now.

32
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:44,640
You know, there's only two places
to fix tussles in my state.

33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,790
So when someone's like, Hey, I want
to get my car fixed, you called test.

34
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:49,920
So they're like, yeah, that'll
be about, you know, maybe a week.

35
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,860
I get you in like every two weeks.
Oh, you get you in in a week. Yeah.

36
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,490
Get you in a week, maybe two
weeks, sometimes three weeks,
sometimes a month. Yeah.

37
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,370
People weight loss,
man. So that's the goal.

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,860
So I'm opening it up and it should be
open department of about a month or so,

39
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,240
and then we'll drive people there.
