00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.920
Political Correctness is, in many ways, an
extraordinary and admirable achievement of

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.690
our age. It involves an acute sensitivity
to the suffering of minority groups traditionally

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.689
overlooked by the dominant forces in society
– and a commitment to teasing out examples

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.849
of adversity in the large but also the small
moments of daily life. Its aim is to spread

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.960
empathy, justice and fairness. For a movement
with such admirable aims, it is surprising

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.640
how many people it appears to have upset.
The reason may lie not so much with its noble

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.769
underlying ambitions as with the manner of
their execution. When we receive lessons in

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.900
political correctness, some of the following
may occur: – We’ll be invited to see ourselves

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.780
as rather nastier than we had ever imagined
we might be and much more closely involved

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.269
in oppressing others. We can – at points
– feel unbearably guilty. – A generous

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.280
path to redemption won’t necessarily be
on offer: the oppression to which we discover

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.700
we are party is so large and widespread, it
appears it won’t be in any one person’s

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.610
remit to solve it. We’ll just need to keep
feeling guilty. – We realise that the target

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.370
of our re-education isn’t just our manners
and what we outwardly say or do. It is also

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.610
our thoughts. Our guilt spreads to a new area:
the very recesses of our minds. – We learn

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.170
that we are, comparatively, extremely privileged.
What’s tricky is that we may not feel ourselves

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.810
to be so, though this is precisely – we
are informed – the leading symptom of our

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.360
inbuilt advantages. We are so privileged as
to be unaware of our privilege. But inside

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.540
us, it may seem as if we were being taxed
on a legacy we had never actually received;

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.800
as if four generations back, we’d had a
wealthy great-aunt we’d never met and from

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.020
whom we’d never received any money, but
on whose estate we now learnt we were expected

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.240
to pay an enormous tax bill. We seem to be
faced with an unfortunate choice. Either we

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.769
embrace the goals of kindness as defined by
political correctness, but face a high degree

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.790
of non-redemptive guilt and humiliation along
the way. Or, in a bid to regain our peace

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.010
of mind, we give up on all attempts to be
sensitive and generous under the terms proffered,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.880
and feel ourselves implicitly pushed into
the camp of the boorish, the insensitive and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.200
the crude – to which we don’t actually
want to belong, but to which there seem few

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.170
alternatives. There is, however, an important
way out of this dichotomy, a philosophy of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.980
social concern and interaction that flies
under a deceptively simple and traditional

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.470
name: politeness. Politeness shares some of
the major objectives of political correctness:

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.590
it too wants a world of sensitivity, kindness
and grace. It too seeks to avoid causing suffering

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.200
to strangers. But it has some decisive – and
very helpful – differences.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.320
Political correctness
zeroes in on the distress of particular groups

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.660
in society; it is selective in its emphasis
on where respect needs to be directed. The

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.469
ambition of politeness, however is more expansive:
it commands that one should be deeply courteous

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:28.340
to everyone, whatever creed, colour and background
they might be. No one is left out and therefore

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.480
no one can feel embittered.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.480
Politeness recognises we will naturally and inevitably
sometimes have mean or dark thoughts about

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.370
other social groups. The philosophy of politeness
doesn’t panic, because it accepts that our

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.989
brains are in many ways primitive. It doesn’t
believe that such thoughts can ever be entirely

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.260
removed. Instead, the effort is concentrated
in the one area where it matters above all:

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.069
how people actually behave towards one another
day to day. This is where politeness directs

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.500
all its attention – and gets strict. Our
manners must be beyond reproach; our thoughts

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.380
can be left to themselves.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.680
Political correctness is highly tied to politics, and specifically, to a left-leaning
agenda. The big risk is that if one disagrees

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.410
with the politics, one might then ignore the
overall command for sensitivity and kindness.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.580
This is where Politeness has an enormous advantage,
for it is prior to and larger than politics.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.280
It starts in childhood, in the way we treat
our little sister, the bus driver or our awkward

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.639
uncle. Politeness teaches us tenderness to
the vulnerabilities of others irrespective

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.780
of what’s happening in the economy and without
reference to a particular interpretation of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.400
history. Politeness doesn’t belong to any
one political group; it’s simply a basic

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.580
requirement of being human.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:08.240
The polite person is polite in a crucial area: the business of teaching
politeness to others. They never make anyone

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.990
feel guilty for not already being polite.
They take it for granted that no one ever

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.770
starts off that way. They see rudeness as
a consequence of not having been sufficiently

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.560
helped or of being in pain, not a sign of
evil. They make the attractions of courtesy

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.620
appealing through their own gentle behaviour.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.919
Political correctness can
seem as if it is laying down principles we

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.599
have to follow. Politeness suggests it is
giving us aspirations it would be beautiful

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:46.710
if we managed to follow. The difference is
key. When you have to do something, you no

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.139
longer feel any pride or virtue in doing so.
But if an action is voluntary, we come away

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.539
with a glowing sense of our own decency in
having chosen the right path. It is the difference

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:04.900
between charity and taxation: the former feels
noble and kindly, the latter, an oppressive

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:10.819
chore we’d love to wriggle out of. It is
a tragedy of the age that some of the goals

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.320
of politeness have been undermined by the
more forbidding aspects of political correctness.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.960
We need to rediscover politeness as a route
back to building more civil, less mean-spirited

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.289
societies and to giving proper expression
to what is always a fundamental force in us:

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.320
the desire to be kind and respectful to others.
