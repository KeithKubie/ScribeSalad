[TECHNO MUSIC]

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.810
ALEJANDRO MANCHADO:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.630
My name is Alejandro Manchado
I work on game analytics

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.270
and monetization at Google.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.800
Today I would like
to tell you about how

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.900
you can supercharge your mobile
game business with AdMob.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.120
AdMob is a huge smart platform
with mind-boggling numbers.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.450
More than 200 billion
app requests every month

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.400
from over 650,000 apps in
more than 900 million devices

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.640
with full global coverage
in 200 countries.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.190
We have totally relaunched
AdMob since 2013--interstitials,

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.990
video, analytics.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.860
The result? oUR Our CPM,
which is the price paid

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.300
to developers, has tripled.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.480
AdMob has paid out
more than $1 billion

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.220
to developers in
the last two years.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.670
How do we do this at
such a massive scale?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.630
Well, in one single
package we give you

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.450
over one million
AdWords advertisers,

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.030
programmatic demand from
DoubleClick ad exchange,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.670
mediation of 40 networks, House
Ads, and Google Analytics.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.930
Now the interesting thing
is that AdMob gives you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.050
equal full coverage on
both iOS and Android.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.400
We are also integrating with
the biggest game engines.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.950
We already have
certified plugins

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.700
for Unity and Cocos2d-x.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.380
We are building a smart
platform to supercharge

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.890
your monetization, use analytics
and understand your audience,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.310
and adapt your monetization
experience in order

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.720
to grow both your inner
purchase and ads revenue.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.110
Let's start with analytics.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
Last year we merged
Google Analytics and AdMob

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040
in the same interface.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.510
Setting Google
Analytics up is soon

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.690
going to be a piece of cake.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.300
You will implement in the Google
Mobile App's SDK, check a box,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.430
and it starts sending
data out to GA.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.710
Now we have recently launched
several analytics features

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.700
focused on gaming.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.290
We now support user acquisition
analytics on both Android

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.770
and iOS, cohort analysis,
and average revenue producer

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.155
and LTV reports.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.900
Audience Builder is
another key feature

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.760
that we have rolled out
since GDC last year.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.190
Google Analytics
is a powerful way

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.810
to build user lists
based on segmentation.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.140
With Audience Builder, you can
then use these lists in AdMob.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.590
Now this means that
with Audience Builder

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.790
you can tailor your
monetization strategy.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.330
For instance, cross-promote
your other games

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.360
to spenders, to your
high-volume users,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.660
while you monetize your
casual users with beta apps.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.250
We are also really enthusiastic
about inner-purchase apps,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.500
which we are relaunching.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.980
We can smartly target
these ads suspenders.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.390
In fact, our algorithms,
based on Google data,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.410
can predict which of your users
are likely to become spenders,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.120
even if you don't know them yet

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.280
Changing gears here, we are
very excited about a new format

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.180
that we are announcing
here today, Native Apps.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.870
We're launching
both content and app

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.420
install Native Apps which you
can modify in order for them

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.000
to better fit your game
and provide a better user

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.150
experience.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.470
A great example.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.720
Atari has partnered with
AdMob to introduce Native Apps

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.600
in RollerCoaster
Tycoon 4 Mobile.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.160
You can check out the game
on both Android and iOS

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.110
in the next few weeks to
see these Native Apps live.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.830
Last but not least, we
continue to drive paid ads

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:31.990
demand at scale.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.800
In 2014 we grew
programmatic demand,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.520
expanded mediation to
around 40 networks,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.810
and launched automated
live mediation across AdMob

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.750
and a dozen other networks.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.650
In 2015 we are going to
scale TrueView Ads, which

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.880
are video ads that the user
can skip after five seconds.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.600
And we are introducing direct
sales and programmatic deals

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.220
within AdMob.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.480
So to summarize, we are building
a smart monetization platform

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.450
with analytics at its core,
enhanced with Google data

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.610
and algorithms, so that you can
offer a fully audience-aware

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.930
experience to your users.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.240
Finally, remember
also that Google

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.560
is a massive user acquisition
platform with more than 1

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.180
billion users on it.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.040
On AdWords, for instance,
you can target users

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.440
by what apps they have
installed and whether they

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.700
have spent any money in them.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.380
So for those of sticking
around after lunch,

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.770
do not miss our Analytics
and AdMob Code Lab right here

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.920
this afternoon.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.060
We will have several
Google engineers

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.810
helping solve all of
your technical questions.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.670
Also, if you're here
later in the week,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.200
do not miss our presentation
this Thursday March 5 at 10 AM.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.760
Google's senior product managers
for Google Analytics and AdMob

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.600
will share all of the details
of our 2015 whatnot with you.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.127
And with that, we're done.

00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:02.460
You've been an awesome audience.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.359
Thank you very much,
and I wish you happy

00:05:04.359 --> 00:05:08.483
monetizing with Google
Analytics and AdMob.
