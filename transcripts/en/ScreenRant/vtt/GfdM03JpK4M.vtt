00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:08.899
Hollywood blockbusters only succeed by raising
the pace, scale or budget of the on-screen

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:09.899
action.

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:11.730
These days it's safe to assume that the craziest
stunts and sequences are made possible with

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.690
plenty of green screen or CG artistry.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.470
But when a director and crew are committed
to realism, or there's simply no way to fake

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.910
a shot, there's no limit they'll go to until
the job is done.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.119
Here are Screen Rant's Incredibly Hard to
Shoot Movie Scenes.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.119
Spider-Man

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.029
Not every movie stunt or sequence needs to
be on an epic scale to be a serious challenge.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.410
CG was used heavily in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man,
but it was Tobey Maguire's role as the awkward

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.939
Peter Parker who got people to care about
his computer-generated counterpart.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.110
Peter first discovers his superpowers in a
high school cafeteria, in a sequence the studio

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.579
actually wanted cut in order to stay on schedule.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.050
Raimi insisted it was needed for the origin
story, and went on to film a 16-hour day,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.420
with a stunt involving Peter's 'Spidey Sense'
largely to blame.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.769
Using his heightened senses to catch Mary
Jane and the contents of her lunch one item

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.159
at a time, audiences assumed some trickery
was at play.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.440
But the actor really did pull off the trick
for real, aided by some glue to keep his hand

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.440
stuck to the tray.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630
It took hours to finally pull off the trick,
but the scene would become one of the most

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.680
heavily-marketed, and a fan-favorite moment
that helped establish Spidey as a lighthearted

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.680
but talented hero.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.680
Kill Bill

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.680
Advances in moviemaking and cameras mean that
the concept of a “long take” or extended

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.680
Steadicam shot are more common than the used
to be.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.680
Movie fans are sure to have their favorites,
and with his first Kill Bill, director Quentin

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.140
Tarantino tried something especially ambitious.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.420
While most long takes follow behind or in
front of an actor, the film’s nightclub

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.360
sequence flew around, under, over and through
the set, laying out the environment and character

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360
locations.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.000
With so many wide angles and precisely-timed
moments, it took over six hours of rehearsals

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.680
before cameras could roll – an insane amount
of time, considering the shot itself is just

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.680
two minutes long.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.390
After the seventeenth take, veteran Steadicam
operator Larry McConkey apparently collapsed

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.390
from exhaustion.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.090
What’s most impressive about the shot is
that unlike other long takes, Tarantino puts

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330
the sights and sounds of the entire set in
the spotlight, encouraging the audience to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.840
take it all in, barely thinking about the
camera capturing the footage, or the person

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.190
holding it.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.190
Saving Private Ryan

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.190
Steven Spielberg became a household name for
fantastic adventures, from Jaws and E.T. to

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.190
Indiana Jones.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.190
So when he decided to tell a story set in
World War 2, audiences couldn't have known

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.190
just how dedicated the director would be to
showing the war as faithfully as possible.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.100
Recreating the D-day assault on Omaha Beach
meant outfitting an army of 1500 extras, including

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.979
1000 Irish soldiers, and countless hours of
preparation.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.299
Entire days were spent to make single shots
possible, with Spielberg using the action,

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.530
not storyboards to picks his angles on set.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.890
The tremendous effort put into the half-hour
sequence paid off, earning Spielberg the US

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.369
military's highest civilian honour, with Saving
Private Ryan seen by many as the most realistic

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.129
recreation of the war ever seen on film.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.129
Iron Man 3

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.280
Despite acting as the face of Marvel's Movie
Universe, once Robert Downey, Jr. puts on

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.560
the Iron Man armor, it's special effects teams
who make the character a box office hit.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.400
But when Iron Man 3 called for the hero to
rescue a dozen freefalling Air Force One passengers,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.909
someone decided to give the Red Bull Skydiving
Team a call.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.239
The veteran adrenaline junkies didn't disappoint,
and agreed that even if the backgrounds would

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.909
be changed in post-production, strapping cameras
to skydivers and capturing actual skydivers

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.269
would be worth it in the end.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.310
The team spent a week jumping continuously,
without goggles, wearing parachutes hidden

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.879
under their costumes that can still be spotted
in a few shots.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.879
Some on the team were even given roles in
the movie prior to the sequence, just to drive

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.230
home the point: when their characters are
scrambling to link hands or fall in formation,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.269
the audience is seeing what actually took
place thousands of feet in the air.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.269
Lord of the Rings

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.639
There was plenty of green screen work and
CG wizardry in Peter Jackson’s Lord of the

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.669
Rings trilogy – but not as much as you might
think.

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:54.669
Different sized sets were constructed to make
Hobbits seems just a fraction of the size

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.889
of their human co-stars, but the director
wanted to film real models, real actors and

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.280
real scenes as much as possible.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.940
To do it, the filmmakers turned to some old
school tricks, using forced perspective, not

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.409
computers to shrink or enlarge their stars.

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.340
By placing Frodo much farther away from the
lens than Gandalf, audiences were instantly

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340
fooled.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.379
But when the two were forced to interact inside
Frodo’s home, the crew had to pioneer a

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.499
brand new approach.

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:22.739
Even a small pan of the camera from side to
side meant moving one of the actors along

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.151
with it, sliding Sir Ian McKellen in front
of the lens, and shifting parts of the set

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:29.129
just to maintain the illusion.

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.930
Seeing how the shots were constructed is still
hard to believe, but the award-winning results

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.329
and realistic feel speak for themselves.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.680
Apollo 13

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.959
When he began work on his tale of a failed
mission to the moon, director Ron Howard expected

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.010
to shoot the movie's zero-gee sequences like
usual: by faking it.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.279
But to give his cast an idea of what weightlessness
would really feel like, he scheduled them

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:56.540
a trip on NASA's "Vomit Comet" - an airplane
used to prepare astronauts for the experience.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.989
By flying quickly to cruising altitude before
dropping the plane into a steep dive, passengers

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.330
on board are rendered essentially weightless.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.209
One trip was all it took for Howard to change
his mind, convincing NASA to let him build

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.359
sets inside the plane, and film his weightless
sequences during each one of the Comet's 25-second

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.359
dives.

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.970
His stars rose to the challenge, enduring
60 to 80 dives a day for a total of 612, resulting

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.970
in less than 4 hours of footage.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.900
But it was worth it in the end, even if the
zero-gee action is taking place a bit closer

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.569
to Earth than in the original mission (most
of the best footage for this comes from the

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:28.569
aired broadcast sequence).

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.290
Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.870
With director Brad Bird at the helm of Mission
Impossible 4, the franchise returned to the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.710
top of the box office, thanks in large part
to one incredible sequence set inside - and

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.790
outside - Abu Dhabi's Burj Khalifa hotel,
the largest building in the world.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.610
The script called for IMF agent Ethan Hunt
to climb, run and swing alongside the hotel's

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.550
glass exterior - with Tom Cruise performing
the stunt himself.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.539
The crew built a replica section of the building
to prepare special rigs, harnesses and equipment

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.620
ahead of time, before filming on the real
building.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.830
That included a rig that would allow the director
and camera man to lie facing out from the

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.199
building, in order to watch Cruise run towards
them, leap over, and continue down with the

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.860
camera catching every second.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.490
The finished scene was a total success - even
if the studio had to change insurance companies

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.650
to make it possible.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.680
The Abyss

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:57.759
Stuntmen and women known that their work on
a movie set could result in injury, but the

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:10.180
stars can usually rest easy knowing they won’t
be put in harm’s way.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.289
But in the underwater adventure The Abyss,
director James Cameron knew there was no easy

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.159
way to bring his vision of a drilling rig
on the ocean floor to life.

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:23.289
Building the sets in a 7 million gallon structure,
the demands of filming meant scenes needed

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.430
to be shot at night, in heavily chlorinated
water.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.840
With the cast forced to spend hours underwater,
diving without oxygen, and fleeing from flooding

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.960
rooms and hallways, some emotional breakdowns
were widely reported, particularly after star

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.210
Ed Harris’ near-drowning scare.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.629
The only thing keeping the actors from revolting
was Cameron’s commitment to enduring just

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.669
as much strain, reviewing footage in a decompression
chamber after spending the entire day in a

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:48.669
diving helmet.

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:49.770
As perfect evidence of why so few movies are
shot underwater, the fact that almost half

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.719
of the film was captured below the surface
meant fans can take their pick of stressful,

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.810
risky, or downright dangerous scenes.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.810
Cliffhanger

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:57.810
Movie fans know that these days, the importance
of safety and studio insurance means modern

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.810
stunts will never be as dangerous as those
in the past.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:59.810
But even in the old days of death-defying
Hollywood stunts, some were deemed too dangerous

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.810
to encourage.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.810
In Sylvester Stallone’s mountain-climbing
action movie Cliffhanger, the movie’s most

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:02.810
memorable stunt isn’t set on any cliff,
but thousands of feet above them, when one

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.810
of the villains slides down a rope from one
plane to another.

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.810
There’s no trickery to the shot, only stuntman
Simon Crane performing it exactly as it appears,

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.810
15,000 feet above ground.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.810
The studio refused to encourage or pay for
such a dangerous stunt, meaning Sylvester

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.810
Stallone offered to cover the costs out of
his own pay.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.810
After months of preparation, and calculating
the proper altitude and speed for Crane to

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.810
survive, he made it down the line to the waiting
door and crew, but a burst of turbulence sent

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.810
him over the plane’s body, forcing him to
detach and parachute down.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:11.810
It was close enough for the finished movie,
and the stuntman walked away with his life,

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:12.810
and a world record – receiving a cool million
dollars for a single scene.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.810
So what do you think of our list?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.810
