00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.110
How is it that 3 squared =9?

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.100
Exponents are just a different
way to express multiplication.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.760
With exponents we start with a base,
in this case our base is 3.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.490
And then we raise the base to
the power of the exponent.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.920
In this case, 2 is the exponent.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.460
Before I called this 3 squared but we
can also call this 3 to the power of 2.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.920
So what does 3 to the power of 2 mean?

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.452
Is it 3 times 2?

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:34.073
3 + 3?

00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:35.316
3 times 3?

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.837
3 divided by 3?

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:37.881
Please pick one.

00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:40.069
