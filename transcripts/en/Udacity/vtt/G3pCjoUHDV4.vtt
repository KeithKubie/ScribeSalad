00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.470
Now this wasn't just a linear function. This was a cubic function. And its

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.304
inverse is the cubed root of x minus 1. Now that's great work if you found this

00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:17.049
solution. Again, we'll start by making f of x by y, our output. Now we're going

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:21.510
to switch x and y. Now we have a function that we can solve for y in order to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.710
find the inverse. Now our goal is to get y alone, so first we'll subtract 1

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.635
from both sides of the equation, to get x minus 1 equals y cubed. Now we need

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:39.360
to undo this power of 3. Well, I know cube-roots undo a third power. So taking

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.490
the cube-root of both sides of the equation, I'll have one y equal to the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:50.600
cube-root of x minus one. Now, keep in mind this is our inverse function, so we

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.319
take y and replace it with f-inverse of x. Here's our solution.
