way this year's economic price is about

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
way this year's economic price is about
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.529

central things in people's lives it's
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770
central things in people's lives it's
about how they find a school when

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
about how they find a school when
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900
about how they find a school when
they're young how they go to college how

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
they're young how they go to college how
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.080
they're young how they go to college how
they maybe get married how that works

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
they maybe get married how that works
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020
they maybe get married how that works
and then how they find a job it's about

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
and then how they find a job it's about
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.959
and then how they find a job it's about
matching people with other people and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
matching people with other people and
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.950
matching people with other people and
with schools etc but it's just nothing

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
with schools etc but it's just nothing
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.180
with schools etc but it's just nothing
about finances or money no economics is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
about finances or money no economics is
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.660
about finances or money no economics is
not always about money and that's that's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
not always about money and that's that's
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.869
not always about money and that's that's
really clear in this year's price

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879
really clear in this year's price
 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.719
really clear in this year's price
however money can be used sometimes and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729
however money can be used sometimes and
 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.730
however money can be used sometimes and
there's not necessarily anything wrong

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
there's not necessarily anything wrong
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219
there's not necessarily anything wrong
with it but in many cases money cannot

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
with it but in many cases money cannot
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.679
with it but in many cases money cannot
be used such as the case with kidney

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
be used such as the case with kidney
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690
be used such as the case with kidney
transplants I think there's no developed

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

country where one is allowed to simply
 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.590
country where one is allowed to simply
start the market for kidneys and then

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
start the market for kidneys and then
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.210
start the market for kidneys and then
all the same we need to do something and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
all the same we need to do something and
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.090
all the same we need to do something and
how do we do it well and not even

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
how do we do it well and not even
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550

assignments of students to high schools

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560
assignments of students to high schools
 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.870
assignments of students to high schools
are allowed to be paid in some way right

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
are allowed to be paid in some way right
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380
are allowed to be paid in some way right
and I think here it's a little bit more

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
and I think here it's a little bit more
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940
and I think here it's a little bit more
different from country to country

good school or not but certainly many

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
good school or not but certainly many
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.710

countries have very strong restrictions

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720
countries have very strong restrictions
 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410
countries have very strong restrictions
on what can be done and usually it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
on what can be done and usually it's
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.789
on what can be done and usually it's
politics and and I think certainly in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
politics and and I think certainly in
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.410

the case of Sweden there are very strong

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
the case of Sweden there are very strong
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.060
the case of Sweden there are very strong
restrictions and that's what people vote

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
restrictions and that's what people vote
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.969
restrictions and that's what people vote
to get so given those rules we have to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
to get so given those rules we have to
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.700
to get so given those rules we have to
think of a smart system

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
think of a smart system
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.420
think of a smart system
but the whole story started with Lloyd

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430
but the whole story started with Lloyd
 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.150

Shapley quite theoretical works in games

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
Shapley quite theoretical works in games
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.720
Shapley quite theoretical works in games
theory and anyhow he used actually a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
theory and anyhow he used actually a
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.420
theory and anyhow he used actually a
concrete example in his article as I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430
concrete example in his article as I
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.220

understand can you tell us about this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
understand can you tell us about this
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.520
understand can you tell us about this
right actually I think it started with

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
right actually I think it started with
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.000
right actually I think it started with
his colleague David gale who asked this

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
his colleague David gale who asked this
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.510
his colleague David gale who asked this
concrete question how should we organize

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520
concrete question how should we organize
 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.050

the college admission process and

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060
the college admission process and
 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.640
the college admission process and
because they realized that it was hard

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
because they realized that it was hard
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.990
because they realized that it was hard
it was a hard problem even

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
it was a hard problem even
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.350
it was a hard problem even
mathematically a really hard problem and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360
mathematically a really hard problem and
 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.900
mathematically a really hard problem and
then they together came up with this

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910
then they together came up with this
 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.100
then they together came up with this
solution that was a purely mathematical

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110
solution that was a purely mathematical
 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.850
solution that was a purely mathematical
solution but often when you do abstract

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
solution but often when you do abstract
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.290
solution but often when you do abstract
economic theory you still have to have

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300
economic theory you still have to have
 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.540
economic theory you still have to have
very concrete examples and the example

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550
very concrete examples and the example
 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.150
very concrete examples and the example
was matching students to schools even

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
was matching students to schools even
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.850
was matching students to schools even
though they had been college in mind so

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860
though they had been college in mind so
 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.650
though they had been college in mind so
they worked from from I don't think they

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
they worked from from I don't think they
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.810
they worked from from I don't think they
had any idea that it would one day

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
had any idea that it would one day
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.130
had any idea that it would one day
become well number one put in practice

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140
become well number one put in practice
 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.920
become well number one put in practice
and number two actually be a Nobel Prize

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
and number two actually be a Nobel Prize
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.729
and number two actually be a Nobel Prize
level contribution so if they were to

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
level contribution so if they were to
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.240

unfortunately died a number of years ago

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790
unfortunately died a number of years ago
 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.840
unfortunately died a number of years ago
and he was instrumental in the process

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
and he was instrumental in the process
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.640
and he was instrumental in the process
as well so that's just very unfortunate

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650
as well so that's just very unfortunate
 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.460
as well so that's just very unfortunate
what was what was the crucial research

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
what was what was the crucial research
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.090
what was what was the crucial research
in this field that led to the prize

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100
in this field that led to the prize
 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.340
in this field that led to the prize
I think it's very clear this year that

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350
I think it's very clear this year that
 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.390
I think it's very clear this year that
you cannot imagine one out one without

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
you cannot imagine one out one without
 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.890
you cannot imagine one out one without
the other so first it was his

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900
the other so first it was his
 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.750
the other so first it was his
theoretical work that we were just

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760
theoretical work that we were just
 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.630
theoretical work that we were just
talking about but then the practical

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640
talking about but then the practical
 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.230
talking about but then the practical
side of things was also absolutely

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240
side of things was also absolutely
 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.380
side of things was also absolutely
crucial it was when Roth in the eighties

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390
crucial it was when Roth in the eighties
 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.080
crucial it was when Roth in the eighties
he had studied the gaels Shapley

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090
he had studied the gaels Shapley
 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.140
he had studied the gaels Shapley
algorithm but he didn't much believe in

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150
algorithm but he didn't much believe in
 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.080
algorithm but he didn't much believe in
it and as to rally some percent

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090
it and as to rally some percent
 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.160
it and as to rally some percent
presented the case here today he

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170
presented the case here today he
 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.260
presented the case here today he
actually was skeptical that it could

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270
actually was skeptical that it could
 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.800
actually was skeptical that it could
work and when he looked at the economic

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810
work and when he looked at the economic
 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.960
work and when he looked at the economic
outcomes in the market for physicians he

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970
outcomes in the market for physicians he
 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.780
outcomes in the market for physicians he
realized that actually to his big

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790
realized that actually to his big
 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.800
realized that actually to his big
surprise it had worked and that was a

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810
surprise it had worked and that was a
 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.660
surprise it had worked and that was a
revelation that was a true discovery and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670
revelation that was a true discovery and
 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.260
revelation that was a true discovery and
then it took off from there I think but

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270
then it took off from there I think but
 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.290
then it took off from there I think but
actually students were admitted to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300
actually students were admitted to
 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.910
actually students were admitted to
topologies into the high schools a long

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920
topologies into the high schools a long
 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.690
topologies into the high schools a long
time before rods work what is the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700
time before rods work what is the
 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.320
time before rods work what is the
difference between then and later well I

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330
difference between then and later well I
 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.530
difference between then and later well I
think one issue in practice is that you

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540
think one issue in practice is that you
 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.560
think one issue in practice is that you
get better or worse indications that

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
get better or worse indications that
 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.360
get better or worse indications that
things don't work it was very clear in

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370
things don't work it was very clear in
 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.970
things don't work it was very clear in
the in the market for us doctors that it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980
the in the market for us doctors that it
 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.130
the in the market for us doctors that it
didn't work because people were

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140
didn't work because people were
 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.570
didn't work because people were
participating in the system they

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580
participating in the system they
 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.580
participating in the system they
realized that there was a lot of

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590
realized that there was a lot of
 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.860
realized that there was a lot of
crowding a lot of people were left

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870
crowding a lot of people were left
 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.860
crowding a lot of people were left
unmatched so the whole thing broke down

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
unmatched so the whole thing broke down
 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.100
unmatched so the whole thing broke down
but in many cases in practice the the

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110
but in many cases in practice the the
 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.600
but in many cases in practice the the
mechanism doesn't break down it just

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610
mechanism doesn't break down it just
 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.660
mechanism doesn't break down it just
doesn't work well and it's not so clear

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670
doesn't work well and it's not so clear
 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.760
doesn't work well and it's not so clear
maybe to the policymakers that that the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770
maybe to the policymakers that that the
 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.290
maybe to the policymakers that that the
kids are unhappy that the schools are

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300
kids are unhappy that the schools are
 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.110
kids are unhappy that the schools are
unhappy in that situation so I think you

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120
unhappy in that situation so I think you
 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.460
unhappy in that situation so I think you
could certainly have something that

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470
could certainly have something that
 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.620
could certainly have something that
somehow works a little bit but it may

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630
somehow works a little bit but it may
 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.450
somehow works a little bit but it may
not work very well and I think this this

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460
not work very well and I think this this
 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.050
not work very well and I think this this
year's price really makes us think again

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060
year's price really makes us think again
 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.730
year's price really makes us think again
in all these contexts do we really have

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740
in all these contexts do we really have
 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.780
in all these contexts do we really have
a good system and now we have the

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790
a good system and now we have the
 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.390
a good system and now we have the
their system and I hope I made by poor

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400
their system and I hope I made by poor
 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.450
their system and I hope I made by poor
developed by Alvin rock what are the

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460
developed by Alvin rock what are the
 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.560
developed by Alvin rock what are the
limitations of this system what are the

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570
limitations of this system what are the
 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.220
limitations of this system what are the
limitations well as so right now I'm

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230
limitations well as so right now I'm
 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.780
limitations well as so right now I'm
thinking more about the great scope for

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790
thinking more about the great scope for
 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.180
thinking more about the great scope for
for applications but of course there are

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190
for applications but of course there are
 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.150
for applications but of course there are
limitations I mean why one issue that he

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160
limitations I mean why one issue that he
 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.550
limitations I mean why one issue that he
works with and many of his collaborators

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560
works with and many of his collaborators
 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:58.640
works with and many of his collaborators
is the problem that sometimes schools or

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650
is the problem that sometimes schools or
 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.070
is the problem that sometimes schools or
say politicians want to have certain

systems mechanisms but that's a

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550
systems mechanisms but that's a
 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.920
systems mechanisms but that's a
challenge and they're still working on

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930
challenge and they're still working on
 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.530

it doesn't work perfectly so it's some

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540

important and and that's what they're
 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.220
important and and that's what they're
working on so we have to put mathematics

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:35.230
