Don't forget the semicolon.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.100
JavaScript uses semicolons to signal the end of statements.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.760
Try console.log without the semicolon at the end and

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.600
you'll see, that it still works.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.920
Most JavaScript interpreters are smart enough to guess when you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.240
need a semicolon.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.750
But they aren't perfect, so you shouldn't leave things to chance.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good to know.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.770
You know, in Python you don't have to use semicolons at all.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.280
When I was learning JavaScript, I had to keep reminding myself to include one.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's pretty common.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.930
What about this undefined line here?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.630
&gt;&gt; It simply means that the console.log command returns undefined.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.900
Telling us that console.log doesn't create any new data we could save.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.700
This makes sense,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.300
because we only want to use console.log to print debugging information.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.150
&gt;&gt; For example, if I had a property like document.URL, it returned a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.340
string as the page's URL.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can see it in closed in quotes telling us that we've got a string.
