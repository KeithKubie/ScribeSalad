[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.747 --> 00:00:06.580
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Keep the applause going.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.244
Scott Hutchison.

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:09.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:14.160
We're full of them.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.909
SCOTT HUTCHISON: You
guys have three mics.

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.237
That's amazing.

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:18.820
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Unlike many places

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.490
where you've been spending
your time lately, I'm sure.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.350
SCOTT HUTCHISON: No, yeah.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.350
We usually just use one.

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.575
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So you touched on it

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:29.547
a little bit as you played,
but these songs are old.

00:00:29.547 --> 00:00:30.880
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah, they are.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.049
Well, yeah.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:37.360
They're mostly-- the album came
out 10 years ago this spring,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.390
and the songs are older
than that, you know?

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.940
So they're just getting ready
to go high school, I suppose,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.950
these songs, you know?

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.450
It's funny.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.470
Well, because it's funny.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.430
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Spending
some time in the basement.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.870
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Spending
time in that basement, yeah.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.034
But it's like funny when
my songs about fucking

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:53.700
are getting ready to
go fuck themselves.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.870
[LAUGHS]

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.080
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Is it strange to be

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.167
revisiting this material now?

00:01:02.167 --> 00:01:04.750
Though I'm sure everybody knows,
but for those who don't know,

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.630
the tour is the 10th anniversary
of "The Midnight Organ Fight."

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.070
SCOTT HUTCHISON: It is, yeah.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.990
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
How is it for you

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.230
to be, at a 10-year marker
point, revisiting this album?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.850
SCOTT HUTCHISON: It's--

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.430
I mean, there's a lot of
stuff that I had either

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.840
forgotten or blanked out from
the time when we were first--

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.820
the main thing that strikes
me is not so much the content.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.170
The content is what it is.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.240
And emotionally,
in 10 years, one

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.885
would have hoped to have
moved on, and I have.

00:01:36.885 --> 00:01:37.975
It's OK.

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:40.850
It's cool.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.480
But it's just
thinking about the--

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.320
being that I'm 36, when we
were touring obviously--

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.610
26, 27-- even just
then, how much more

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.900
I could get away with, like,
abusing my body on tour.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.130
You know, it's--

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.950
I get kind of pissy if we do
more than four shows in a row

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.450
now.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.665
But I remember doing--

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:05.050
we would happily do like 12,
13, 14 shows without a day off

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.430
and stuff, and nobody cared.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.720
It was just like we were
so full of excitement.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.520
This album snowballed
for us that year.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.200
And one of the reasons why
I have such affection for it

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.840
is essentially we got
back off that tour

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.696
and I didn't have
to go get a job.

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:24.040
[LAUGHS]

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.090
It's as simple as
that, you know?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.280
So, yeah.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.250
It's I have a great deal
of affection for the album,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.310
and hence why we
decided to roll it out.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.920
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, and it seems

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.200
that a lot of other people
have a great deal of affection

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.530
for this album too.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.790
SCOTT HUTCHISON: It's true.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.290
It's true.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.470
There's-- I mean, I would say
about 80% of the conversations

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.105
I have about our
music are still--

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.070
with fans of the band--

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.337
are still about that record.

00:02:46.337 --> 00:02:48.670
A friend of mine who runs a
record shop said that's it's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.610
our business card album.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.020
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
That makes sense.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.430
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.930
It's like, if you don't like
this, you're just not going to.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.570
Don't bother.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.712
So--

00:02:55.712 --> 00:02:57.670
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And
interestingly, you guys

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.378
announced that you're
going to go on tour

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:00.700
and perform the record.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.470
And I saw that come
across the email

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.934
and was like, oh, that
was not that long ago.

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:07.100
10 years doesn't seem like--

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.540
SCOTT HUTCHISON: I know.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.200
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
--a big time.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.340
But then I went to
look and get tickets

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.540
and they were all sold out.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.290
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.081
People are into it.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.780
I don't know.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.320
I think it's not just for us.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.900
This tour, it's not selfish.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.411
Because I was-- when
I was saying before,

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.410
I actually used to think
that this kind of thing

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.790
was pretty corny and sort
of some kind of obvious way

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.710
to make extra
money or something.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.720
But what we did instead
was we kind of--

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.720
instead of completely
rinsing the concept,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.210
we decided to play shows
that were approximately

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.380
the same size as we did
back then, hence why

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.311
it sold out so very quickly.

00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:53.700
And lots of people
complained about it as well.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.530
So there's a lot of
unhappy customers.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.050
They might never come back
to a Frightened Rabbit show.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.162
But you know what
the problem is?

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:01.930
Back in the day, I guess--

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.570
before, your audience had a
direct lane straight to you.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.760
So it's not my fault that
all of this happened.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.500
But they can contact me
and say, hey, dickhead.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.250
Are you going to add
another show or what?

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.579
And it's like, there's
10 people in between me

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.150
and adding another show.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.420
There's not-- I don't
have control over that,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.079
but I'm the first call.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:28.620
So, like, announcing these shows
and then selling out-- like,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.880
some of them genuinely
within minutes.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.400
I remember I was taking a train
ride and I was just, like--

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.650
I just opened Twitter to see
how the sales were going,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.160
and then just this
volley of abuse

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.780
at me from people who
claim to love my band.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.265
But it's like, yeah,
they don't like me now.

00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:49.890
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
What do you think--

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.970
I mean obviously, we have the
lens of time to look back.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.990
And a lot of people have
reviewed the record, discussed

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.220
the importance of the record.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.350
And obviously, you guys
recognize the importance,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.020
to revisit it now for fans.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.740
What do you think is
the connection that

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.630
brought so many people to
this particular record?

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.590
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
It's very much--

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.080
it's probably the
most open album

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.764
we've ever made
lyrically, thematically.

00:05:20.764 --> 00:05:22.930
There's a great deal of
honesty on it, which I think

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.730
people always connect with.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.420
The strange thing
about that, though,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.660
is even though
that was a success

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.420
after we toured the album,
towards the end of that tour--

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.790
it was like a year
and a half, and I just

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.440
started to feel like I was on
stage complaining at people

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.570
or revealing too much.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.950
And there's something
special about that naivete

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.840
that we had that created
something that wasn't

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.120
censored as such, you know?

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.100
Like you said, there's kind
of use of poetic structure

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.450
to kind of veil and romanticize
these occasionally pretty

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.200
painful times.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.090
But it's laid out, you know?

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.290
And I think the other
thing is, I joke now

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.370
about it being a cold-hearted
commercial enterprise,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.370
because heartbreak
never goes out of style.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.320
So there's always going to
be some poor bastard who's

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.070
just been dumped.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:30.550
And this record has
become a bit of an anthem

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.240
for the heartbroken, I suppose,
because I was at the time,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.829
you know?

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:37.120
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And you
were saying before that you

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.680
get a lot of those stories.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.910
People will just come up
to you and start unloading.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.201
SCOTT HUTCHISON: They do, yeah.

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.480
[CHUCKLING]

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.590
That was a dirty laugh.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.090
But--

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.690
Unloading, come on.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.560
[GROAN]

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.840
They do-- that's what I
thought he was getting at.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.540
Sorry.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.150
Let's get back on track.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.070
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Minds
out of the basement now.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.403
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Let's get back.

00:07:01.403 --> 00:07:03.280
Yeah, I know.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.270
They do.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.040
And it's strange.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.280
A friend of mine once said--

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.980
and this isn't unique to
our album or our band.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.370
But because of the
consistency of the subject

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.710
matter within this
album, he said, people--

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.100
and it is usually
a breakup situation

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.750
where someone loses the person
that they loved the most,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.380
and then there's me.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.950
And for those two
weeks, I sort of--

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.330
it sounds creepy.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.050
I sort of seep into
their lives, you know?

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.060
And for that reason,
I think a lot

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.370
of people, when they
come and talk to me

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.610
and share their memories
and what they associate

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.100
with that album,
kind of already feel

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.270
like they know me well enough
to say these really personal

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.880
things, and that's lovely.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.630
But also, I had to take a little
step back from it at one point,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.310
because it becomes
kind of draining.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.018
And there's, like, a
responsibility there

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:07.167
that is difficult to
come to terms with.

00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:09.250
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: They've
heard your heavy story

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.041
through the songs and
they think, oh, well,

00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:12.430
I'll share mine with you.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.920
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.630
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We can
go through it together.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.470
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Well,
little do they know,

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.928
I'm totally fine by the time
they're talking to me, anyway.

00:08:17.928 --> 00:08:21.190
Because it's all happened, like,
a couple of years in advance.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.770
But, yeah.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.706
But it's not a negative
thing for people to connect--

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:30.830
project their lives onto
something that I've made.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.503
Yeah, I like it.

00:08:32.503 --> 00:08:34.919
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And the
other question that I had was,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.169
as an artist, you've
not stopped working.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.270
You've been very busy
over the past 10 years.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.600
Frightened Rabbit put out "The
Painting of a Panic Attack."

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.490
That's the fifth studio
album, is that right?

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.670
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah, yep.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.800
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Is
it strange to constantly

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.820
be presented with
the old, instead

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.600
of wanting to talk about the
new record, talk about even

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.610
the Owl John kind of artwork?

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:03.160
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
Yeah, so honestly, I

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.460
have to put myself in
the shoes of a music fan,

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.484
which I am as well,
where I think--

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:14.650
maybe you guys can agree
or disagree on this theory.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:18.580
But I think the first record
you hear by your favorite band

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.120
generally tends to be
the one that remains

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.820
your favorite, that album.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.560
It doesn't have to
be their first album.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.720
It's like your entry
point into it, you know?

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.110
So going back to when
I was a teenager,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.782
I definitely loved "Versus" more
than any other Pearl Jam album.

00:09:38.782 --> 00:09:39.990
I don't listen to it anymore.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:45.020
But it's like that's
where I came in.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.630
And a lot people came
in at that point.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.900
So that's why I think people--

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.400
and I can't complain about that.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.500
At least they're
enjoying something

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.530
that I've done, even if they
hate the new ones, which

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.790
is fine as well.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.180
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
I don't think

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:01.970
anybody hates the new ones.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:02.880
SCOTT HUTCHISON: OK.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.755
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: But
we can talk about it.

00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:09.210
There does seem to be,
with "Painting" especially,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.750
a massive progression in
how the music is produced.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.617
I guess also on how you
guys wrote the record.

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:18.700
Why don't you talk a little
bit about that process

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.174
and the change from
10 years ago to now?

00:10:21.174 --> 00:10:22.090
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:25.690
I mean 10 years ago, we didn't
have any fancy equipment,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.710
for one.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.110
I was writing and
recording songs

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.470
onto a cassette four track.

00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:37.630
The leap that I thought
we took sonically

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.400
between our first album and
"The Midnight Organ Fight"

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.560
now seems ridiculous to me.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.560
Because I was like, oh,
this is really polished.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.670
And I obviously had call to
listen back to the second album

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.520
recently to just
learn the songs again,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.390
and it sounds crappy to me now.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.150
But I remember thinking
it was super polished.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.280
But I guess we have
been progressing.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.710
But at the same
time, there's a lot

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.590
to be learned from, again,
that kind of naivety

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:06.879
of making that album.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.420
There's something
very human in that.

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.100
And I think if you
remove that entirely,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.720
then your music will lose out.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.060
So I have definitely
taken some tips

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.820
from that 25-year-old version
of me to maybe try and tap

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.570
into that a little bit
more going forward.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.610
Because I think things
can get overproduced,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.500
and I think we've
been guilty of that.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.770
So it would be nice to
just keep the mistakes in.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.230
Don't erase them on
a computer, which

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.049
is all too often the case now.

00:11:40.049 --> 00:11:42.340
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
and that's a very interesting

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.540
comment to make.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.270
So many people talk about
the rawness and the honesty

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.040
of the lyrical content.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.100
But that is also then served
by the rawness and honesty

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.989
of the recording.

00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:53.405
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
It matches, yeah.

00:11:53.405 --> 00:11:57.040
I didn't really-- we didn't
really know what we were doing.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.205
And there was no
expectation of an audience.

00:12:00.205 --> 00:12:01.422
There was no--

00:12:01.422 --> 00:12:03.880
I didn't really know how many
people were going to hear it.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.290
So therefore, that allows
you to be much more bold

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.040
in your decisions.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.140
There's always something--
now, making a record,

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:13.129
there's a much larger
group of people

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:14.170
in the back of your mind.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.450
As much as you may
try and make an album

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:21.020
just for yourself
and for the band,

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.050
the audience is there a lot.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.550
Your live experience is there.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.300
It's like, oh, this
little whoa-oh bit's

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.810
going to kill live, you know?

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.530
And it's there.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.000
Again, so the whole
process now is

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.230
trying to be a little
naive about how

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.300
you're making the music and not
censoring yourself too much.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.760
And if a mistake sounds
good, well, maybe you

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.950
should keep it or do it again.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.392
Because if you do it
twice, it's not a mistake.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:48.779
That's how it works, right?

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:49.320
Just in life.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.400
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I
think it's the third time.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.130
Third-- third time
is intentional.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.340
So with "Painting" you
recorded big portions of that,

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.220
or produced big portions of
that here, right, in Brooklyn?

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.150
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Some
of it was in Brooklyn.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.800
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: With Aaron?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.258
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
Aaron Dessner used

00:13:03.258 --> 00:13:09.810
to have a studio in Ditmas, and
he doesn't have that anymore.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:15.790
But that was the room where they
recorded most of the records

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.850
up till the last one,
pretty much, the bulk of it.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.630
And it's a tiny garage
at the back of his house.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.452
But he just-- it's an
extension of his brain.

00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:27.910
So when we got
there-- you know, we

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.980
were in a bigger,
fancier studio upstate,

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.720
near Woodstock, called
Dreamland, which is beautiful.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.220
But we did try and kind
of rough it up a little

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.660
when we got to the
garage, as Aaron calls it.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.840
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: There
was a lot more difference

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.870
with "Painting of a Panic
Attack" than 10 years ago.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.887
You wrote the album in a very
different way as well, right?

00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:52.345
SCOTT HUTCHISON: It was remotely
written, really, because I

00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:53.943
had moved to Los Angeles.

00:13:53.943 --> 00:13:57.010
And for that reason--
so I'd always

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.670
relied very heavily, or
certainly for the last 10

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.290
years, had relied quite
heavily on my bandmate, Andy,

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.030
who is very, very proficient
in music software.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.540
And he just recorded
all our demos.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.330
And I didn't have to push
a single button, you know?

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.730
And then I moved to LA,
and I'm like, ah, shit,

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.260
I'm going to have
to figure this out.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.400
So I started using
Logic, and that

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.239
introduced a whole new raft
of sound to me as well.

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:25.780
So I wasn't necessarily
sitting down,

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.810
as I did with-- almost all
of "The Midnight Organ Fight"

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.040
was sitting down with a guitar
in a room, writing like that.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.970
That kind of went
out the window and I

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:39.100
wrote a lot more from
beginning with a loop

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.160
or electronic sound,
just because I

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.030
was excited by this new
world that had been opened up

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.980
within my laptop, you know?

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.040
So that was a progression.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.500
And yeah, just the
back-and-forth collaboration

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:54.530
was--

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.980
well, things take two
days to come together,

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.230
because they got an email
there when they were asleep.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.771
And then they send me back what
they've done, and I'm asleep.

00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:03.310
And then it goes
back and forward,

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.680
and let's call the
whole thing off.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.280
But no, it was a little
bit of a longer process.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:15.610
But I think it doesn't matter
if the situation is better

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.440
or worse than the last record.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.730
It just needs to be different.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.271
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah, I was going

00:15:21.271 --> 00:15:23.360
to ask if now, going
back and looking,

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.970
has the nostalgia
gotten to you as well?

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.660
Do you look back at those
earlier times with the band,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.830
and think, man, it was
so different back then.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.680
I opine for that past.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.730
SCOTT HUTCHISON: I don't
pine for turning up

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:42.060
at a venue with my
pedals in a plastic bag.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:43.570
I definitely don't
pine for that.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.930
But our setup is
quite complex now.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.820
Sometimes, that can be a pain.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.955
And yeah, there was an innocence
to it that-- you know what?

00:15:52.955 --> 00:15:56.020
It just naturally-- it goes.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.640
Your music becomes a business.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.540
Your band becomes a business.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:04.570
It's hard to avoid that, if
you want to make a go of it.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.160
So it does change.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.060
I don't pine for it.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:12.430
I mean, I'm able to do
this freely and focus

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.150
on nothing else.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.360
And that's a privilege
that I definitely

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.060
don't take for granted.

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:20.020
No, it was fun.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.195
It's just, like-- thinking
about it is just--

00:16:22.195 --> 00:16:24.990
it exhausts me to
think about that time,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:30.308
because it was ridiculous
what I could get away with.

00:16:30.308 --> 00:16:31.727
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:31.727 --> 00:16:34.310
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: One of the
things that has also come along

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.712
with the new record
that is more different--

00:16:37.712 --> 00:16:39.920
and I think it's also we're
in a different landscape,

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.837
as far as being musicians and
artists in the world today--

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:44.920
are some of the videos
that you guys have put out.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.820
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:46.550
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
And I'm curious

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.350
how involved in some
of that stuff you are.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.630
Because they-- they're not
like a typical music video.

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.970
They're sort of
these micro vignettes

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.244
of interpretive storytelling.

00:16:55.244 --> 00:16:56.160
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.590
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And
I wonder how heavy-handed

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.750
your involvement in
that is, or if that's

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.280
something that is
done, and then you

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.835
get to experience
it as a viewer?

00:17:03.835 --> 00:17:05.210
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
Our involvement,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.480
and the reason why our
videos are done that way, as

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.619
in they're sort of a
narrative, is that we

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.270
don't want to be in them.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:15.650
So we try-- it's like we
sort of pitch for people

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.240
to make little mini
movies to our songs.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.079
Because I don't think anyone
gets into Frightened Rabbit

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.280
because they are
attracted to us.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:28.780
So--

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.620
It's just a fact.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:35.690
I'm all right with being
substance over style.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.240
But no, the videos--

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.420
I actually much prefer that.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.521
We have had to do a couple
of performance videos,

00:17:42.521 --> 00:17:45.020
but I think generally they suck
and they're not interesting.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.230
They don't say anything and
they don't take the song

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.460
into a new realm.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.510
So I'd much rather have
someone else's story plonked

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:54.970
on the song, and then
that puts it into--

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.420
puts a new
perspective on things.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.880
It's much more interesting.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.120
But I don't really have anything
to do with them, particularly.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.770
But I always prefer to see what
someone else's interpretation

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.469
of the music is.

00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:09.760
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Can you
talk about maybe a reaction

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.530
that you might have had from
seeing some of these videos,

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.810
like the video for "Sober"
or "Wish I was Sober?"

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.601
SCOTT HUTCHISON: "Sober,"
that was full on.

00:18:15.601 --> 00:18:17.870
Yeah.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.670
So a drunk lady having a
really bad time, and yeah.

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.870
No, I was sort of
struck by that.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:28.762
That was more-- that was further
than I thought the song went.

00:18:28.762 --> 00:18:30.220
I mean, the song
was kind of like--

00:18:33.472 --> 00:18:35.290
it has depth.

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.750
But I don't think
it's distressing.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.780
But yeah, I mean, it wasn't
my favorite video, actually.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:47.270
But it happened.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.520
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I'm just
curious about the control

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.184
and letting that control go
and how other people interpret

00:18:53.184 --> 00:18:54.350
what you're putting forward.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.266
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:57.490
That's actually
one-- I would call

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.800
that one of the greatest
pleasures of doing this work,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.380
is not having-- once it's
out, it doesn't belong to us

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.890
or me anymore.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:13.270
It's in the hands or the ears
or the brains of the listener.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.260
And that's really exciting,
for your album to,

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.310
like, pinball around and
different interpretations.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:28.860
And hopefully-- and again,
I ask people this a lot.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.900
And oh, I could ask you now.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.640
If you're listening
to-- it doesn't have

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.931
to be a Frightened Rabbit song.

00:19:33.931 --> 00:19:37.330
But if you're
listening to a song,

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.890
are you playing a movie in
your head that involves you

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.840
or the person that's singing it?

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.445
So I would hope
that it's not me.

00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:47.320
I don't want to be in
your movies, all right?

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.717
I'm not attractive enough
to be in your movies, OK?

00:19:52.717 --> 00:19:54.550
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: But
you're about to be--

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:56.800
you're currently
being in a movie

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.510
that's being made right now.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.025
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
Well, it's appropriate

00:19:59.025 --> 00:20:01.330
that I'm in that, because it's
a documentary about Frightened

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:01.980
Rabbit.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Right.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.085
SCOTT HUTCHISON: So--

00:20:03.085 --> 00:20:04.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:04.462 --> 00:20:07.306
I couldn't avoid that one.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.090
I guess I'm going to
have to be in that video.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.760
No, I'm really
excited about that.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.100
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
There's probably

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.516
people who would volunteer to
play you in the documentary,

00:20:14.516 --> 00:20:15.120
if you needed.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.090
SCOTT HUTCHISON: That
would be awesome.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.664
Actually, yeah, apparently
the cop from "Stranger Things"

00:20:18.664 --> 00:20:20.080
is coming out to
the show tonight.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.650
Maybe he could do it.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.950
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
I was also thinking--

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.310
I mean, we kind of
look a little similar.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.710
SCOTT HUTCHISON: You
want to be in it too?

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.400
OK, fine.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.050
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
How-- this is

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:31.030
a guy who's following
you around with a camera

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.690
as you're going through this
retelling of a past story.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.075
Does it ever reach a
point of just surrealness,

00:20:37.075 --> 00:20:39.220
of what is happening
around me that I'm

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.234
no longer in control of-- this
life has come into itself?

00:20:42.234 --> 00:20:43.150
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.240
See, that's where you just
lose your mind with anxiety.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:50.230
I think this band
has given me cause

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.460
to sort of practice
a lot more living

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.840
in the moment and acceptance
of that and mindfulness.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.560
It's been hard and it
doesn't always work.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.470
But if you do get
too caught up in it--

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.140
because it's not
real life, really.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.000
I go back to real
life when I go home.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.530
And I go out on tour
and succeed at that,

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.270
and I'm comfortable there.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.840
And I'm happiest when
I'm performing, in a way.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.540
And I go home and it's just
like, what the fuck do I do?

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.720
Who am I, as well?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.720
You know, you live--

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.640
a lot of what I had to do was--

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.040
because I was-- when
this album first came

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.960
out, the one we
were talking about,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.160
I was receiving a lot
of people's stories,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.430
people's praise as well.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.890
And that can just--

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.450
that can take you in a
bad direction, I think.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.190
So I have to now almost--

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:49.490
there's a persona
that I've maybe

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.490
developed a little bit,
which stops me from being

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.000
too personally involved in it.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.760
That's really important to
keep my own life for me.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.420
So there's been
adjustments along the way,

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.620
and there's been proper
breakdowns as well.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.750
It's not always been fun.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:14.900
But I'm grateful that it's
caused me to seek out tools

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.030
to sort of mentally survive.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.260
But it's a drain
sometimes, for sure.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.510
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We do
want to leave plenty of time

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.415
for members of our
audience to ask questions.

00:22:25.415 --> 00:22:26.790
So if you guys do
have questions,

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.820
make your way to a microphone.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.350
While people are
getting set, I want

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.220
to ask you about the experience
so far of "The Midnight Organ

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.820
Fight" 10th anniversary tour.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.653
You've got a couple of
shows under the belt.

00:22:37.653 --> 00:22:39.170
There's a handful more going on.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.790
Are you enjoying
yourself doing this?

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.290
SCOTT HUTCHISON: I am, yeah.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.280
I said that it feels like
being the DJ at a really

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.890
weird wedding.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.580
Like, everyone knows what
songs are coming next.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.300
There's crying.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.050
There's drinking.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.380
I mean, that's weddings, right?

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.080
Yeah, because we're
playing the album in order.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.710
Which to me, the structure
of an album and the running

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.930
order of an album
isn't necessarily

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:07.700
ideal for a live show either.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.520
Those are two different
art forms, I think.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.560
So I've been getting
used to having

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.764
big depressing dips in our set.

00:23:15.764 --> 00:23:17.180
Which are kind of
difficult for me

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.680
to deal with, because
I like to keep

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.180
things exciting and upbeat.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.740
So that's been an adjustment.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.600
But I am really enjoying it.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.300
And I hope that
everyone that comes

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.160
is also getting a
kick out of it too.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.420
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, and I was curious,

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.650
a couple of years
from now will be

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.110
then the 10th anniversary of
"The Winter of Mixed Drinks."

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:36.020
SCOTT HUTCHISON: I don't
like that record, no.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.010
No, we're good.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.212
We're good on that one.

00:23:38.212 --> 00:23:39.920
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Let's take a question

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.442
from the audience over here.

00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:42.900
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.270
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Thank you.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.740
AUDIENCE: So a silly question--

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.030
I've noticed a lot of
musicians move to LA.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.440
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.190
AUDIENCE: Have you noticed that?

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:50.700
And why did you move to LA?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.680
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Well, if they
did, I didn't meet any of them.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.200
Because I had no
friends out there.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.600
Actually, I kind
of got my wife--

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.560
I moved there because my
girlfriend lived there

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.290
at the time.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:04.040
And that was the only
reason I had to be there.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.160
It's a good reason,
but I didn't have

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:14.120
any ambitions to work in the
world that exists out there.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.110
Because I didn't really
find a very coherent music

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.300
scene that I could
step into particularly.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.140
It's all very disparate there--

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.810
a lot of closed doors, I think.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.840
So the one place
I found solace was

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.300
in the form of a
small theater called

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.340
Largo in West
Hollywood, which is run

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.900
by an Irishman named Flanny.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.750
And it turns out,
lots of stand-up

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:38.120
comedians really like
Frightened Rabbit.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.730
I think we're all depressed
at heart, you know?

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.266
So I ended up doing
some really great shows

00:24:43.266 --> 00:24:44.390
with great comedians there.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:49.250
And that was almost the only
kind of community I felt there.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.780
So if there are musicians
who are listening or watching

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.380
this--

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.190
I mean, just don't move to LA.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.370
It's weird.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.047
It's so strange for
it to be-- it truly

00:25:00.047 --> 00:25:01.880
is one of the most
creative places on earth,

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.830
because lots of cool
stuff gets made there.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:07.240
But you don't feel
that within the city.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.040
It's all happening behind
closed doors, and it's like--

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.190
I just didn't feel like there
was a creative hub that I

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.130
could get involved in there.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.690
Or maybe just nobody liked me.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.650
So, who knows?

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.240
But I didn't have a
terrible time there,

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.363
but it wasn't for
me, in the end.

00:25:24.363 --> 00:25:26.363
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We'll
take another question.

00:25:26.363 --> 00:25:26.826
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:25:26.826 --> 00:25:27.290
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Hi.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.040
AUDIENCE: I'm so excited
you're here, because now I get

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.206
to talk about my heartbreak.

00:25:30.206 --> 00:25:31.200
No, I'm just kidding.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.980
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Hey, no, no.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:32.772
Let loose, come on.

00:25:32.772 --> 00:25:33.313
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:33.313 --> 00:25:33.881
I'm cool.

00:25:33.881 --> 00:25:34.380
I'm good.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:34.620
SCOTT HUTCHISON: All right.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:35.400
You're good now?

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm great.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:36.960
SCOTT HUTCHISON: That's awesome.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.700
AUDIENCE: 10 years,
we've been through stuff.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:39.367
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
I'm really pleased.

00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:39.990
AUDIENCE: I love this record.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.500
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
All right, great.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.140
That's the new one.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.040
You don't hate it?

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.960
AUDIENCE: No, I think it's good.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.080
I like all your records.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.370
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
Awesome, thank you.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.740
AUDIENCE: But I wanted to ask
you-- first, I was like, oh,

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:47.690
why did he move to LA?

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.530
But they already asked that.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:48.870
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:50.400
AUDIENCE: So now I want
to ask, when is it time

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.750
to move on to the next record?

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.245
I mean, with bands that
have lots of studio albums,

00:25:54.245 --> 00:25:55.620
it's hard to please
all the fans.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.390
Because you go and everyone
is expecting to hear

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.790
their favorite
song or they don't.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:25:59.000
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.458
AUDIENCE: So when
is it time-- when

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:02.400
do you start feeling,
oh, maybe this

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.399
is something for the new album?

00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:05.940
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
Oh, like, when do we

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.950
start writing that really?

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:13.680
Well, I think the beauty of a
relatively long touring cycle

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.417
is, by the end of that, you're
pretty sick of the material

00:26:16.417 --> 00:26:17.250
that you just wrote.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.129
And you're also noticing a lot
of the flaws in it and the ways

00:26:20.129 --> 00:26:22.170
that you would like to
improve on that next time.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:23.550
So that's handy.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:27.360
And for us, it seems to take--

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:31.440
the timeline is, like,
finish a tour, do

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.440
nothing for, like, a month.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.040
Decompress and try and
start living normally again.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.770
And then we'll try
and find another thing

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.709
to do that isn't necessarily
Frightened Rabbit.

00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:45.000
You have to have some distance.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.750
Because you spend all your time
in the pockets of one another,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.210
and just personally, you need
a break from those guys--

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.100
especially my little brother,
who plays drums, you know?

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.490
Anyone else fancy taking
a sibling on a tour

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.215
bus in front of the world?

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.770
I love the guy, but anyway--

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:10.980
yeah, so having
said that, I guess

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.200
this tour is our
in-between thing,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.836
and we've already started
writing the next album.

00:27:16.836 --> 00:27:18.460
We're taking a
different route with it,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.910
in that we feel
like, at this point,

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:26.200
we're kind of ready to
self-produce a lot more.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.459
So we've kind of
refurbished our studio

00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:31.250
and we're going to do
it there and it's all

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.530
going to be much
more in our hands,

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.886
as opposed to bringing
in a producer.

00:27:35.886 --> 00:27:37.510
Which, there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.970
But I think we just feel it's
time to let our own voice

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.845
go kind of
untrammeled, in a way.

00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:43.470
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.360
Thank you.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.335
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Thank you,

00:27:47.335 --> 00:27:47.876
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:47.876 --> 00:27:48.242
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Hi.

00:27:48.242 --> 00:27:49.930
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.040
I'm just kind of curious.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.530
How did you guys decide
the name of your band?

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.910
Is there a story about it?

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.390
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
There is a story.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:04.170
I was very shy as a child,
and that was a nickname

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.289
that my mom and dad gave to me.

00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:08.330
You know when you go to
those-- when you're a kid

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.450
and you're going
to parties that--

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:15.180
your parents' friends'
parties, but their kids

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.940
aren't necessarily your friends.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.975
Right?

00:28:19.975 --> 00:28:21.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
know what that means.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.490
SCOTT HUTCHISON: I really
hated those events.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.427
And I was just--

00:28:25.427 --> 00:28:27.510
I was just very shy, and
that kind of comes across

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.470
as being anti-social.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.391
But I would just kind
of sit in the corner,

00:28:31.391 --> 00:28:33.390
like, with the frightened
rabbit look on my face

00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:34.450
and not talk to anyone.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.170
So I thought it would
be humorous to call

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.840
the band that I hoped to play
in front of a lot of people

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.530
after a social anxiety.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.742
So that's where it comes from.

00:28:46.742 --> 00:28:47.450
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.024
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Thank you.

00:28:49.024 --> 00:28:51.190
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Let's
take a question over here.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.676
AUDIENCE: Ah, he was first.

00:28:51.676 --> 00:28:52.634
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: OK.

00:28:52.634 --> 00:28:53.620
Go ahead.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.480
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks
for being here.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.520
So my question is
about the artwork

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.190
that you did for Michael
Pedersen-- is that how

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.710
you say his last name?

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.820
The oyster-- the poetry book.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:09.666
How do you find the artwork that
you want to make out of a poem?

00:29:09.666 --> 00:29:11.540
It seems like they're
very different mediums.

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:13.640
So how do you, like, draw
the essence out of it?

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.030
SCOTT HUTCHISON: They are.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.780
And Michael's poems are often
quite sprawling and long,

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.720
and that is hard to
distill into one image.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.340
But what I tended to do was--

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:29.260
because I really
think about poetry,

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.690
the way that it can be often
and quite studiously worked

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.720
through, I much prefer
hearing poems performed

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.500
and reading them quite
quickly and taking whatever

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.820
jumps out at me from that.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.520
So I take that kind of tactic
with the artwork, where it was,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.100
like, I would give it a
couple of runs through,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.392
and then if an image
came, I would draw it.

00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:50.600
And it was as simple as that.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.471
Because I didn't want to have--

00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:55.100
again, thinking
about videos and how

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:59.720
you distill a song into
a concept for film,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.490
I didn't want it
to be too heavily--

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:11.130
the drawing should bring another
aspect to the poem, as opposed

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:15.230
to me just describing something
exactly as it is there.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.230
So that was a challenge.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.670
But luckily,
Michael is a friend,

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.150
and we've worked together
and known each other

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:21.780
for many years.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.887
So it was a very lovely
collaborative thing.

00:30:24.887 --> 00:30:26.970
And he liked all the
drawings, so they all got in.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:27.960
It was great.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.360
I hope to do his
next one as well.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.727
It's a real pleasure.

00:30:31.727 --> 00:30:32.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:32.940
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Thank you.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.840
AUDIENCE: See you, tonight.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:34.480
SCOTT HUTCHISON:
All right, nice.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.310
Yeah.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.270
I forgot I was playing the show.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.810
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We'll take
our final question over here.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:39.960
AUDIENCE: Hey, I just
wanted to thank you

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:40.680
for the music over the years.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.850
I still remember
where I was when

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.400
I heard "Things"
for the first time

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.870
eight years ago at 1 o'clock
in the morning, writing code.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.064
And it's the drone that
really hit me hard.

00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:49.980
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Yeah.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.060
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious, just what

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.710
are you listening to now that
you can't get out of your head?

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.240
Because I couldn't get you out
of my head for a long time.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Really?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.562
Oh, wow, OK.

00:30:57.562 --> 00:30:59.520
"Things" is my favorite
Frightened Rabbit song,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.162
by the way.

00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:00.870
AUDIENCE: Really?

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.310
SCOTT HUTCHISON: So we're
together on that one.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:08.190
What am I listening to now?

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:15.210
I love-- because
I'm on tour, I love

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.430
kind of cyclical
modern classical stuff

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.980
like Max Richter and,
unfortunately, the late Johann

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.850
Johansson.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.195
And that kind of is all I can--

00:31:30.195 --> 00:31:31.850
in general, actually, that's--

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.330
because I analyze music
when I listen to it,

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.730
that kind of music is
sort of analysis-free.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.430
And that's really,
really comforting to me.

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:43.710
So it's in that
kind of wheelhouse,

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:50.530
like Nils Frahm and all
those studious dudes.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.380
They're kind of my
rock stars, actually.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.890
I went to see Max
Richter "play" recently

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.222
and I was, like, taken aback.

00:31:58.222 --> 00:31:59.680
He was at the merch
desk and stuff,

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.620
and I couldn't even bring
myself to go and say hi.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.220
I was, like, all
starstruck and stuff.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.090
So, yeah.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.230
It's a very meditative
listen for me,

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.550
and that's really important, as
opposed to listening to a song

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:15.300
and either deconstructing
it because I think it sucks,

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.019
or being really jealous
because it's fucking awesome.

00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:19.810
That's really hard.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:22.810
That's something I need to
let go of a little bit more.

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:23.677
Yeah.

00:32:23.677 --> 00:32:24.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.770
SCOTT HUTCHISON: Thank you.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:26.760
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, and I thank you.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.968
Thank you for taking the
time to sit and talk with us

00:32:28.968 --> 00:32:30.270
today in front of Google.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.800
And everyone, Scott Hutchison.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.460
SCOTT HUTCHISON: It
was great, thanks.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.480
Thank you very much.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.630
