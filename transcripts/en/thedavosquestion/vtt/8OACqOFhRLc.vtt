RD THULASIRAJ &gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube. This is Thulasiraj

00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:16.290
representing Aravind Eye Care system in Moderai,
south India. Ah, this is wholly sure of ethics-ah-whether

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:23.000
the business community should adopt some of
the ethics, at least as stated in the health

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.430
care community as for the doctors and others.
Ah-my personal opinion is-ah-yes, it should.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.050
Ah-I think we also need to make it more a
point of practice rather than just being just

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.850
a-this oath being taken. But the core of it
is how do you create the __________ paradigm.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.059
More vote for your customer and-ah-in the
case of health care, for the patient and the

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:56.309
doctor. In the case of business, the-within
the business and the customer. How do we engage

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.960
in a process that is non-exploitative and
that truly adds value both to the customer

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.040
and to the business in a way that it mutually
synergizes. And to me this should form the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.290
core foundation for-um-the development of
such an ethics framework. I just want-ah-I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.110
wouldn't be able to get into details of spelling
it out, I think that is a much larger debate.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.750
But I think-I strongly feel creating this
_____________ as a paradigm or the foundation

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.290
is-is the way to go.
