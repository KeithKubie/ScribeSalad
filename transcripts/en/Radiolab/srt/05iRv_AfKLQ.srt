00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,140
You are listening to radio lab radio from

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,810
W. N y. S. T. E. N. P. R

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,120
please enter your address for
Colorado calculating route.

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,070
Okay, now I'm getting closer to him. Woo.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:32,010
We begin our journey this hour. How
old are you? I'm 42. Oh Man, I'm 63.

6
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:35,730
This isn't gonna work with this woman.

7
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,950
Her name is Sharon Roseman.
Okay. Enough of that.

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,290
We're going to talk about a little
predicament she got herself into. Um,

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,380
I was about five years old.

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,700
I lived in a small suburb
of Chicago called Maywood,

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:51,900
Illinois.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,900
And I was outside playing on the
street or in a bunch of kids.

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,020
They were playing this game, blind man's
bluff. And she was the person who is,

14
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:06,021
it wears a blindfold and all the other
kids try and scatter around and they have

15
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,950
to freeze and then they can turn
to you and you can only hear them.

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,930
And the objective is basically to feel
around fall the voices until you tag

17
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,810
someone. Then they become
it. And that's what she does.

18
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,160
Everybody laughs because the person
that I tagged as kind of the loser,

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,080
you know, cause they found them first.

20
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,230
So I'm playing the game and they
took the blindfold off and suddenly

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,720
I didn't know where I was.
I didn't recognize anything,

22
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,580
this horrible panic set in because
nothing looked familiar to me.

23
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,790
Absolutely nothing. I just, uh,

24
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,230
I ran blindly just running, just to run,

25
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
cause I was so scared and I ran into the
backyard of this house in front of me

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,970
and I saw my mother sitting
in a lawn chair and I said,

27
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:04,140
why are you here? And she said, what?
What do you mean? Why am I here?

28
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,460
I said, why are you in this
backyard? Where are we? She said,

29
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,390
what are you talking about? We're at
home. I'm in the back yard. And he said,

30
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,480
but this is in our
house. And she said, yes,

31
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:17,520
this is what are you talking about?

32
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:22,050
And I couldn't explain it and I just
kept crying and just kept saying,

33
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,400
I don't know where I'm at.

34
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,010
And your mother must've been very
worried at that moment. Well,

35
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,820
unfortunately my mother said something
to me that actually changed my life

36
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:40,800
forever. She pointed her
finger in my face and she said,

37
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,070
don't ever tell anybody,

38
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,850
because they'll say you're a
witch and they'll burn you. What?

39
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,820
Shit? I don't know. I don't know.

40
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,060
And from that moment on, it was my secret.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,100
She realizes now that what happened to
her in that moment when she was five and

42
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,480
playing the game was that her whole
world had rotated a quarter turn,

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,500
a quarter turn picture where
you're sitting right now. Yeah.

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,810
You would still be
sitting in that same room,

45
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,170
but the wall that you're looking at right
in front of you is now one wall over

46
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,380
to the right. Let me make it
easier. If I were on the toilet,

47
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,960
say sitting there looking straight ahead.

48
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,950
[inaudible] is now the bath
tub in a different place
than it was before the sink

49
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,320
in a different place by
about 90 degrees. Everything.

50
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:37,060
Everything in the entire universe, but
just horizontally. It doesn't tilt or no,

51
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:41,640
it doesn't tilt. East West becomes
north south, like in Colorado here,

52
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,730
the the mountains, the rocky mountains
are on the west end of town. Right.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,570
When this happens to me, they
moved to the north end of town,

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,930
but everything else moves with it. So
the first time that happened did you,

55
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:56,920
you say you didn't know
where you were yet,

56
00:03:56,921 --> 00:04:00,520
you recognize things but they just weren't
where they were supposed to be or I

57
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,970
didn't even recognize them that
very first time. I was so panicked.

58
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
I just didn't know what to
do. Did it ever happen again?

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,910
Over and over and over.

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay. I mean I get lost
all the time as you, you,

61
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:23,240
but that's loose is different.
Yeah. Before we go any further,

62
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:26,870
let's just orient real quick. I'm
Chad at boom rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.

63
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,840
This is radio lab. This hour we're
calling it the lost and found,

64
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,980
so I'm going to be experiencing the
feelings like Sharon pat of being totally

65
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:38,480
lost and then that relief that you feel
as Sharon will feel eventually of being

66
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:39,500
totally found.

67
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,810
Oh, not totally. Let's go back to
her story. Did it ever happen again?

68
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,030
Over and over and over.

69
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,170
She says this 90 degree rotation
problem would come on in all kinds of

70
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:54,560
situations. Sometimes even
when she had her eyes closed.

71
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:59,180
But what saved me was that
shortly after that first episode,

72
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,870
I went to a little birthday
party and we were playing, um,

73
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,690
pin the tail on the donkey and they
put a blindfold on me and spun me in

74
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:13,160
circles. You must've been like, oh
man, you want to do that? It was,

75
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,340
it was awful because after that
first turn, everything did shift.

76
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,560
But then on the second turn, when they
spun her around again, it fixed it.

77
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,060
Really? Yeah. Dizzy. That's so weird.

78
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:30,650
If I played a third time crazy again,
so it's binary. It's like on, off, on,

79
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:33,740
off. Sadly. Exactly. But I
couldn't tell anybody that,

80
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,970
but now she had a fix or a temporary
fix. So from that moment on,

81
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,320
anytime her world would shift,

82
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,970
I would go into the bathroom and I'd close
the door so nobody could see me and I

83
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:46,640
would spin in circles until it fixed it.

84
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,270
You spin and it reasserts
itself correctly. Yeah.

85
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,720
And I still do that to this day.
And with her secret spinning,

86
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,760
Sharon has managed to lead a
relatively life. She got married,

87
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,880
had three kids. When, when
my children were babies,

88
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,300
if one of them would cry out,
just cry out in their sleep.

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,180
Invariably she'd wake
up being into a while,

90
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,540
completely turned around and then
I would have to follow their cries,

91
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,650
the sound of their cries until
I could find the their bedroom.

92
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,580
There was no explanation for that.
I had to just say I was clumsy.

93
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,680
So you never told them? No.

94
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,930
And my husband didn't know and I'm
not married to him anymore. But um,

95
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,640
and you can leave that in there.

96
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,030
The point is she kept it a secret.
But one day when Sharon was 29,

97
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,850
she was on her way to her brother's house

98
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,210
and uh, she got turned around.

99
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,980
So I called him from a
pay phone and I said, I,

100
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:47,530
I can't find your house. She read him the
names of the street signs and he said,

101
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:50,440
Sharon, you're like two
blocks from my house.

102
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,680
And I just started crying
and I told him the story.

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,120
He was just shocked.

104
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,530
[inaudible]

105
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,460
so he dragged you to the hospital and
they saw some specialists and they kept me

106
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,390
in, um,

107
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,290
in the hospital for like a week doing
every kind of test you can imagine.

108
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,510
And it showed nothing.

109
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,800
They basically told me
it was psychological.

110
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,460
Like it's all in your head. Yes. Wow.

111
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,450
And that you were the only one in the
whole universe who had this problem? Yeah,

112
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,550
I thought, okay, I must be a witch.

113
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,213
[inaudible]

114
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,960
Huh? I mean that, that's, that's
just, that's a crazy story. Okay.

115
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,240
Just to pull out for a bit,
after we talked with Sharon,

116
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,080
we ended up speaking with them. Well,
if you've heard Radiolab before,

117
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,150
you probably know that voice. Um,

118
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,430
Jonah Lehrer literally asked him
like a question. Jonah Lehrer.

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,390
There you go. Jonah is a science
writer and an author. Uh,

120
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,160
my last book was how we decide
and it was a lot about the brain.

121
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,850
And so we played him tape from the Sharon
interview just to see what you think.

122
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,580
And he had an interesting
take. I mean, it just,

123
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:12,360
it just one of these great windows
into this talent we completely take for

124
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:16,890
granted. Um, and in you realize
this is such sophisticated software,

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,250
there are so many different algorithms
that are running that allow us to not get

126
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,450
lost in the way out of the bathroom.

127
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,560
One way to think about this story he
says is not why does Sharon get lost all

128
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:27,760
the time? But why don't the rest of us,

129
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,310
and a lot of this is brand new science
or we're talking the last three,

130
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,890
four or five years. But
in the time he says,

131
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:38,580
scientists have just begun to figure
out how brains make maps of our

132
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,380
surroundings from moment to moment.

133
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,620
They've identified at least four different
types of cells that make these maps

134
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:47,190
possible. Everything from place
cells to grid cells to border cells.

135
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,510
Like can we go through ways? So yeah,
no, we'll, we'll slow down. But, but,

136
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,350
but all these cells come together
to give us incredibly rich masters.

137
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,250
All began to make more sense to us when
Jonah said, okay, let me do it this way.

138
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,380
I just took a trip into this office,

139
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:05,040
but I'm sitting in a radio station and
let me do the same thing as I did it in

140
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,160
my brain. I got out of my car, I
walked to the front of the building.

141
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,660
So I open up the door

142
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,030
and somehow some way my brain
begins to make sense of this space.

143
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,500
First thing that happens, he says his
little cells in his head called red cells.

144
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,240
Come on mind grid cells are
pretty weird. I gotta be honest.

145
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,640
Before he's even taken a
step into the building,

146
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:31,030
these grid cells kind of like mappers
are surveyors. They lay on a grid.

147
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,810
It's great. This matrix over the
hallway right in front of him.

148
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,860
Unbeknownst to me, that grid is
composed of equal lateral triangles.

149
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,320
[inaudible] triangles. Yeah, it's,
it's pretty spooky. As I'm walking

150
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,950
down the hallway, I pass from
one triangle to the next.

151
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,590
My brain is keeping track of exactly which
triangle I'm in. I pass it by a wall,

152
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,240
so some border cells go off.
Avoid the concrete road,

153
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:04,630
just respond to borders,
edges, physical limits.

154
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,180
I look to my right and my
head direction cells change,

155
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,810
but then they change the act. Woo.

156
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,180
The erection l so there's a head direction
neuron firing all the time when I'm

157
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:19,160
facing dead ahead. When I turned my head
to the left, that neuron stops firing.

158
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,860
We have a new head
direction neuron firing.

159
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,930
Now I'm back to the deadhead.

160
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,820
I turned to the right new head
direction on firing that ahead.

161
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,540
These cells keep you oriented so you know
where you are in the grid and now it's

162
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,840
time to fill in the details. And
this is where things get really cool.

163
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Proceed down the Cardo as
I take a couple more steps.

164
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,040
Now my place cells are probably
beginning to get active. It's the,

165
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm here. So it's like for
every landmark in the space,

166
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:54,130
each body passes by the
brain will drop a little pin.

167
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,580
It's like an I'm here people. Yeah,

168
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,470
at the coffee table and then
I'm here at the potted plant in,

169
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,940
then I'm here at the
door or in the studio.

170
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,580
So now as I imagined myself walking from
this little closet like space back to

171
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:14,600
my car, as I pass by the coffee
table with the magazines,

172
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,220
that place I'll fire now and by the
front door, that place all fires.

173
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,050
Now I'm on the sidewalk. That place,
so fires now I'm by my car. That place,

174
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:27,980
so fires and when you put it all
together, the place sells the grid cells,

175
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:32,060
the boarders hell's what you get. He
says it's a symphony of electricity,

176
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,600
which somehow is translated for me

177
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,930
into an idea of a space

178
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,750
and this whole neural symphony,

179
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,290
it mostly takes place in that particular
part of the brain, hippocampus.

180
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,230
So if Jonah were to just
hazard a guess about Sharon,

181
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,620
she should get her hippocampus
checked at is you should do

182
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,120
meet me. You know? That's just a
guess. Now getting back to that story,

183
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,810
even though I was 29 I was
an adult. I had children.

184
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,630
The point at which we left off,
Sharon had gone to the hospital,

185
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,290
got in a bunch of tests and the doctors
had told her that I needed to go see a

186
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:11,020
psychiatrist. I felt like a freak.

187
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,953
Hello.

188
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,710
But then one day years after that,

189
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:21,850
I was watching some TV show,
Belgian scanning a crowd.

190
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,130
It was a newsy 2020 type thing
about face blindness, blindness,

191
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,030
people who can recognize faces.
And at the end of the show,

192
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,290
the reporter mentions this website, the
website, Sharon goes, she was curious.

193
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,311
And when she gets there,

194
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:36,550
this little window pops up that asks
her if she wants to take a survey.

195
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,990
I thought, well, I'll do it. And it was
mostly questions about face recognition.

196
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,050
But as I got deeper and
deeper into the questionnaire,

197
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,110
the questions start turning more to have
you ever experienced being in a place

198
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:54,580
that should look familiar to you but
suddenly does not. And I was like,

199
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,680
oh my gosh, that's me. And
asked for explanations.

200
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,700
So I was just typing away and typing away.

201
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:05,200
And eventually she meets the doctor
who had finally d, which her.

202
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,180
Uh, my name is Giuseppe urea.

203
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,410
I am a cognitive neuroscientist
at the University of Calgary.

204
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,400
And do you have a strong
sense of direction? And I'm
curious. I don't actually,

205
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,810
I am, I'm not a gifted direction.
Like you know Guy [inaudible]

206
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,450
but just said that had this idea that
maybe just like face blindness there could

207
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:24,910
be such a thing as location blindness.

208
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,720
So he asked Sharon to go
online and play this game,

209
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,570
sort of video games like virtual reality,

210
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,930
like where do you have to shoot people
and find people and Blah Blah Blah.

211
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,960
The screen would be showing you these
landmarks like a flower shop at Bar Bang

212
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,860
Bakery and then eventually I need it to
be able to to say where things are with

213
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:48,460
respect to one an order. Well No,

214
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,540
nothing now,

215
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,960
not even a guess for me and it actually
made me physically ill and then juice

216
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,060
up. He told her something
before you, I'd met this woman,

217
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,860
this lady who has complained about
orientation and she also failed this test.

218
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:05,190
So I brought her in to the lab and had
her play the game in this counter in the

219
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:09,270
MRI scanner in the brain scanner and we
were able to find activity all over the

220
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:12,030
brain except in one little place.

221
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,780
We were not able to detect any increased
activity within the hippocampus,

222
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,550
which just so happens to be though

223
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,850
home of Jonas little guys play
cell border, cell grid cells,

224
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,420
that particular part of the brain,

225
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:27,421
the hippocampus just never developed and
at that point that's when Giuseppe for

226
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:32,560
the first time told her this thing
has a name d t d for developmental

227
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,320
topographical disorientation

228
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,450
[inaudible]

229
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,780
and that's not trivial because when
something like this has a name,

230
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,610
suddenly it's not your fault. I felt
like I was reborn. I keep telling him,

231
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:50,450
you are my hero, you'll always be my
hero but have you ever met Sharon?

232
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,010
I mean face to face and we are, we

233
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,510
are supposed to meet now in this fall.

234
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,110
What if you like meet her and fall in
love with her and then she gets lost and

235
00:14:57,111 --> 00:15:00,110
you rescue her and the science
is ruined. But you get married.

236
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,300
I am already [inaudible] never,
nevermind. But anyway. Do you set,

237
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:05,871
he's there.

238
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,830
He's got a couple of patients and he's
wondering how many other folks like this

239
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,350
are out there. So he puts
up a website. We said, okay,

240
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:15,230
we are looking for people who
have this specific symptoms.

241
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,580
One year later we were basically
dealing with 700 people.

242
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,480
We did say, oh see the same issue. Yeah.

243
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,560
So he sets up an Internet forum where
they can all talk to each other.

244
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,630
I'm the moderator and now
Sharon corresponds with
DTD sufferers from all over

245
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:36,860
the place. There are others out there
who experienced the 90 degree rotation.

246
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,690
Yeah. Oh, what about spinners though?
Do you have, you've ever met at spinner?

247
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:42,850
Yeah.

248
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,680
No, no, no.

249
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,283
Okay.

250
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,880
Actually I should get some lighter
cause if I look here, oh here.

251
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,140
Well there's one there
that, that one, that's fine.

252
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,370
But then another one she
wants later, I haven't drank.

253
00:15:57,371 --> 00:16:00,910
She did another woman named
Sharon. My name is Sharon Mitchell.

254
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,170
The last name is m a. C. H.
E. L rhymes with Rachel. Okay.

255
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,890
When this Sharon heard about the first
Sharon, she says she bolted straight up.

256
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:13,450
There is a woman in Colorado
who has what I have and I,

257
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,650
it was such an emotional moment for me
that she decided to fly to Colorado to

258
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:21,670
meet Sharon Roseman and they
spent a day together. All right,

259
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:23,320
so let's just start with the easy stuff.

260
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,860
And they spoke with reporter Dave
Fender described yesterday. I mean,

261
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:31,000
what was it like to, uh, to get together
yesterday and yesterday was awesome.

262
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,380
I got out of the car and we just gave
each other a hug. And it was, it was,

263
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,860
it was a band that I've never experienced
with anybody else in my life ever.

264
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,190
We sat down right away in the
hotel lobby and started to laugh.

265
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,480
We couldn't stop laughing.

266
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:50,110
Everything we were telling our experiences
right away and comparing notes,

267
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,760
not even finishing our sentences. No,

268
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,940
we still don't know what's wrong with
Sharon and Sharon and the others.

269
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,700
We certainly don't know how
to fix it, but whereas before,

270
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,680
Sharon and Sharon were lost and alone,

271
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,850
now they're lost and together this
bond that we share, so in a wave,

272
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,530
it's like they're not really lost.

273
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:10,480
Like we sat there probably for 15
minutes describing how we were going to

274
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:15,481
navigate from this hotel to the shopping
mall that we could see right out the

275
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:20,590
window of the hotel and we had to come
up with some contingency plans. Yeah.

276
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,700
Yeah. So we had, we had
the gps if we needed it.

277
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:28,600
Sharon had a map in her hands if
we needed it. We had street names.

278
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,870
We were just hoping that at least one
of us was there instead instead of being

279
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:38,280
messed up. And so, um, we got there.

280
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,460
There it is. There it is. There it
is weird. Most stocks are jumping up.

281
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,100
It was really ridiculous if anybody and

282
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,760
they have no clue why we were so
excited that we found Nordstrom.

283
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,063
[inaudible]

284
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,930

Hi,

288
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:23,590
this is Sharon Roseman radio lab is
funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:23,770
Foundation. Okay.

290
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,850
I'm seeing public understanding of
science and technology in the modern war.

291
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:29,980
[inaudible] from Calgary.

292
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:34,980
More information
aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org sorry,

293
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:37,150
I'm so late. I've been on the road.

294
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:41,230
I'm calling from my shelf on video that
is produced by WWE NYC and distributed

295
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:42,130
by NPR.

296
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,800
Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab today.

297
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:54,070
Our program is lost and found

298
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,590
approaching zone without
gps or it, well, you know,

299
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,850
I think we're getting real close on the
linear driving into our next adventure

300
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,370
is our producer Tim Howard.
Yes, yes. This is it.

301
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,730
So I sorted and I took a trip.

302
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,900
Your picture id to Fort
Monmouth, New Jersey.

303
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,010
For what? Fort Monmouth. Is
that a military base? Yup.

304
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,220
We were going to this
museum they have on the base

305
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,510
to meet you at the store to meet
this woman Mindy, Mindy rose,

306
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,400
what's on the museum curator at a US
army communications to show us around to

307
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:35,630
see what patients, Chad, do you wanna
hear some stories? Absolutely. Okay.

308
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,840
Here on display we have the war heroes.

309
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,340
So she pointed to this one glass
case, sort of like a memorial. Well,

310
00:19:43,341 --> 00:19:45,680
he was born in 1918,

311
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:50,000
died here at Fort Monmouth in
1937 so he lived about 20 years,

312
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,760
served with the army expeditionary forces.

313
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,050
He was wounded and blinded in one eye,
carrying a very important message.

314
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,770
What's all this on his, on his
face there? Looks like putty.

315
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,220
Like what's all this stuff on his nose?

316
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,760
It's called crop and it's
a natural growth. Um,

317
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,610
I think it's a calcium growth
and some pigeons just get that.

318
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,480
Did she just say pigeons?
You got it. A lot of get it.

319
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,700
There's another one marker. I don't
know. Yeah, but he has one eye.

320
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,070
His eye was shot out in a second.
Tim, what's the story? Why Pigeons?

321
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,500
Pigeons. Yeah. Well

322
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,560
a pigeons are awesome. And B,
there's a big question here,

323
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,810
which is, well, let me,
let me just start you off.

324
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,590
Training wheels with a simple
little story on, this is GI Joe.

325
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:42,910
He's our hero pigeon, but there's one
pigeon named GI Joe GI Joe is pretty cool.

326
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,610
Well, he looks like a totally
ordinary pigeon. I wouldn't know that.

327
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,610
I'm standing a foot away from a
a war hero. I think he's cute.

328
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,450
He's got yellow legs. Remember I told
you about the legs? The feet. All right,

329
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,170
so what's the story? Okay, so
it's 1943 there was a town,

330
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:00,660
the British have just taken this little
Italian town call of the Chia full with

331
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,890
Chia from the Germans, the bad guys.

332
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,000
The problem is it took it really fast
and their American allies are about to

333
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:10,810
bomb the town in 20 minutes.
Oh, the radios are down.

334
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,960
They can't get anybody back to the base
in time to tell them to call it off.

335
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,060
How nearby is the space? 20 miles away.

336
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,730
And so they only really have one
option. Let me guess. No, wait,

337
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,040
just so you really get
this. Yeah, bring it home.

338
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,620
This bird is in a place
that he's never been before.

339
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,190
[inaudible] hallway there for
hours. He's been in a dark box.

340
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,320
He should be completely
confused. Should be.

341
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,640
And yet when they take him out and
throw them in the air [inaudible] like a

342
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:40,300
cosmic zip court. He's pulled
over mountains, lakes, forest.

343
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,130
None of which he's ever
seen before. Right back.

344
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,370
Yeah.

345
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,370
Did the army base where he lives just
in the nick of time, just as a bombers,

346
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,310
they're about to take off.

347
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,250
He's credited with saving
over thousands British live,

348
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,370
American hatched and GI Joe Kennedy,

349
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,140
the message through and
artillery bombardment in Italy
and the same units of the

350
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,610
56th London division.

351
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,540
How the hell did he do that? How
did he know exactly where to go?

352
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,880
Some of them returned with, um,

353
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,660
the message capsule hanging from their
leg and their breastbone shot open and

354
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:12,050
all that kind of stuff. But they
would always, um, fly back home.

355
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,120
How that's your question? Yep.

356
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,250
Hello? Hello there. So I called
this guy. This is Charlie Wolcott.

357
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,180
He's a heavy hitter in the vision world.

358
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,350
The former director of the
Cornell lab of ornithology.

359
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,190
My question is if GI Joe
had never been to that town,

360
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,600
how did he know

361
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:35,810
how to get back home? Well, the first
thing that GI Joe needs to know is where,

362
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,250
wait, wait, Tim, I'm sorry.

363
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,940
I feel bad for saying this because
it's your first piece for the show,

364
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:44,830
but I mean, don't we know the answer
to this? What's the answer, Jen? Oh,

365
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,550
birds have a compass in their
head. That's how they migrate. Jed.

366
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,050
You dummy.

367
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,690
You're just not getting
the degree of difficulty

368
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,083
about it. This way,

369
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,610
if I take you in a little boat and put
you out in the middle of a large body of

370
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:03,030
water, all you can see is
water and every direction.

371
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,040
Which way do you paddle to find New
York City? Are you asking me? Yeah.

372
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,150
Can I have a compass and this scenario?
Sure. But that's not going to help you.

373
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,160
Sure will. No, no.

374
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,600
What do you mean? No? Just think about it.

375
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,480
Which way are you going to paddle first?

376
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,710
Hmm. I

377
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,570
don't know enough to say yes

378
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,443
exactly.

379
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,990
It depends a little bit on whether
I've dumped you in the Atlantic Ocean,

380
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:32,680
the Pacific Ocean, the Indian
Ocean or whatever. Yeah,

381
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,760
you can't swim home if you don't
know which direction home is.

382
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,770
And you're saying this
is what a pigeon does.

383
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,960
You can throw it anywhere and
it knows. That's my whole point.

384
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,990
I W if you were a pigeon, I
wouldn't need to tell you anything.

385
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:43,630
Huh?

386
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,290
How did GI Joe figure out where
he is with relation to home?

387
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,530
That's the great question. That it, okay,

388
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,820
I'm with you now and I'm
sorry for interrupting you
earlier. That's all right.

389
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,570
So how do they do it? Well, and if
you have a one sentence answer for it,

390
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,440
then that's a short answer.

391
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,520
It is a very, very easy
answer. We don't know.

392
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,180
Wow.

393
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,910
But they have been doing a lot of crazy
experiments on pigeons over the years,

394
00:24:06,911 --> 00:24:09,280
like 60 years now to try
and figure all this out.

395
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,990
Um, let us count the ways [inaudible].

396
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,910
We have tried flying pigeons
with frosted contact lenses.

397
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,150
They've put coils on their head
with the pigeons head like a hat.

398
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,880
They've glued little brass
weights to their backs.

399
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,340
They put radio transmitters
on them. Yes, indeed.

400
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,620
Dave followed pigeons in airplanes.

401
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,420
The point is that it is a complex issue
and they have definitely not arrived to

402
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,250
any consensus

403
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,210
for how pigeons do this. They have
theories, plenty of theories. Oh yeah.

404
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,051
For example,

405
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:42,910
you get talions Floriano poppy and his
colleagues believed that when you take

406
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:45,550
the pigeons out to the release point,

407
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,480
they sample the odors on the
way to the release point,

408
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,060
all the smells of the places
that they pass, right?

409
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,630
Essentially a series of
olfactory landmarks. You know,

410
00:24:55,631 --> 00:25:00,631
you go past the chocolate factory and
the olive groves of the garlic plantation

411
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:03,010
or whatever sounds like a beautiful place.

412
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,690
And so when a pigeon is released, uh,

413
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,580
what it does is it sniffs
the breeze and says, Aha,

414
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,150
continue past garlic,
take a left at chocolate.

415
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,510
This is the odor that came to me on the
Northwind and therefore I need to fly

416
00:25:17,511 --> 00:25:18,980
south in order to get home.

417
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,540
[inaudible]

418
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,570
but Charlie's actually put this idea, that

419
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,160
test or we anesthetized the
pigeons, put them in a box,

420
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,720
artificial air so they can't smell
anything and are rotating turntable and

421
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:34,090
transported them about
a hundred miles away.

422
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,200
And when they got over being kind of
car sick, they flew home just fine.

423
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,250
So something else is going on here. Yeah.

424
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,300
And here's where we get to my
personal favorite theory. All right,

425
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,380
forget about smell.

426
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,470
There are some researchers who think
that the key to pigeon navigation is,

427
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,700
are you ready for this?
Yeah. What is it? Metal,

428
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,690
which is to say if you go all the way
down into the center of the earth,

429
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,320
there's all this iron down there churning
and as it's churning it's throwing off

430
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:07,260
this magnetism.

431
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,230
Yes. Lines of magnetic force

432
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,690
through the earth out into space.

433
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,900
So imagine up there in the
atmosphere above the planet,

434
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:20,901
there are all these lines that are wiggly
and as GI Joe is flying through the

435
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,540
air is moving through these lines.

436
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:26,910
[inaudible]

437
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,360
do you think he sees the lines?

438
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,110
Well I can tell you that he might feel
them because there are these little

439
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:36,790
particles in his beat. Magnetite
magnetic iron particles.

440
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,403
They're twitching.

441
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,010
Some spots they twitch more in in
some spots less. And if you can

442
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,890
measure various aspects
of the magnetic field,

443
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:51,480
like its strength and its angle,
you can tell whereabouts you are.

444
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,010
Do you think that's
what's actually happening?

445
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,280
I think it may be partly what's
happening. I mean Charlie,

446
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,820
Charlie says there's probably
a lot of things going down.

447
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,390
Anytime you think you've figured it
out, the pigeon goes and messes you up.

448
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,100
For example, he told me about this
one place, a place in New York. Oh,

449
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:13,740
about 90 miles west of here
called Jersey Hill fire tower.

450
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,970
If we take Cornell pigeons to
Jersey Hill and let them go,

451
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,690
they go random and so
they are essentially lost.

452
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:26,220
It is a Bermuda Triangle
for Cornell pigeons.

453
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,530
Why would that be that? Sorry, I
hadn't, if we knew, I would tell you.

454
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:36,450
Is it a magnetic thing? No, no. There's
nothing magnetically disturbed about it.

455
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,790
Is it a sewage treatment capitol? No.

456
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,420
Hyper active radio
frequencies? No, it's a,

457
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:46,290
it's a hill surrounded by
pine trees. It's just a hill.

458
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Does it make you wonder if there's a
whole other system going on in a pigeon

459
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:54,780
that we haven't even started
to think about? Yes, of course.

460
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:58,140
And then use you say, well,
what could it possibly be? Yeah.

461
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,580
And after a long day of,

462
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:03,780
of being out there with the pigeons and
releasing them and waiting for them to

463
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:07,140
make up their mind and fly home
and get the vanishing bearings.

464
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:10,200
You come back and you open the
loft and there they are, you know,

465
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:13,020
all sitting on their little
purchasers going, cool, cool.

466
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,190
And here's long to grab one by the scruff
of the neck and say, how do you do it?

467
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:21,460
But so far obviously they
haven't told us. Okay,

468
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,110
one more thing I didn't tell you
about how they were monogamous.

469
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,490
The pigeon mind might be unknowable,

470
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,960
but the pigeon heart
is an open book. Yeah.

471
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,960
Well Mindy said that with a lot
of other birds and chickens,

472
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:39,050
you get them all together.
They all go wild and party.

473
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,510
One thing leads to another. They all,

474
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,690
well maybe they go the
Jacuzzi, maybe they,

475
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:48,140
I don't know what they do in the
Jacuzzi. I'm not judging, but pigeons,

476
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,460
they would mate and they would stay
mated until death do they part.

477
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:56,480
So one thing you can do to make the pigeon
fly home faster is you take the male

478
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:59,810
out of his cage, you put another
male in there with his girl,

479
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,610
and of course he's
going to get pissed off.

480
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,790
This feathers are fluffing in who is the
straight male in my cage and all this

481
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,050
kind of stuff. Drive him away. He
flies back so fast to clean house.

482
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,310
So this is called the widow hood method
and yes, it is a powerful motivator.

483
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,730
Yeah, they miss the misses, so
wow. So who knows how he did it,

484
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,300
but what may have propelled GI Joe
through those darken war-torn skies was

485
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,700
jealous. Rage. A Ban could've Ben,

486
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,790
you go judge or you go get that
young buck [inaudible] you go ga Joe.

487
00:29:31,791 --> 00:29:35,600
And if you have to save a thousand
lives in the meantime, okay, just do it.

488
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,733
[inaudible]

489
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,580
pretty good. Pretty good. Those pigeons.

490
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:51,540
But I think we can go one more round for
the human being and our natural ability

491
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:55,620
to navigate. I met a
woman named Lira Borucki.

492
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:58,500
She's in the psychology
department at Stanford University.

493
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,950
She studies languages and she's found
that some languages have a curiously,

494
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:09,510
I don't know how to put this a curiously
pigeon like power. No, seriously.

495
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,500
There are languages that don't rely
heavily on words like left and right and

496
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:17,880
some languages actually don't have
those words at all. Um, in the, uh,

497
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:22,800
culture I got to spend some time in,
they rely on north, south, east, west.

498
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,790
Oh, you mean like sort of taking
in left at the biscuit factory.

499
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:30,450
I'm going to hang it east
more so than that. Uh,

500
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,540
you would say things like there's an ant
on your southwest leg or move your cup

501
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:38,850
to the north northwest a little bit.
Where are we talking about, by the way?

502
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,710
I should back up. This story is
too good. You should start at the,

503
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,240
where are we in the world right now?

504
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,070
This is a community called pumper out
on Cape York. In Australia. Per Rao.

505
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,340
When was this? Uh, this
was a few years ago,

506
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,190
I guess 2006 there.

507
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,540
The way you say hello in
pumper out is you say,

508
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:02,140
which way are you going? Ah, so in
English you say, how are you? Fine.

509
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,360
In Palm you say, which way are you going?

510
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,620
And the answer must be something like
north, northeast in the middle distance.

511
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:11,920
How about you? What? Say, imagine as
you're walking around your studio,

512
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,420
each person that says hi to you,

513
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,650
you have to report your heading direction
to them so you literally can't get

514
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:22,651
past hello in this language without
knowing which way you're facing.

515
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,720
And you said North northwest
and the Middle Direction.

516
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:28,930
Is it really that that precise? It's
actually more precise than that.

517
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,740
There are 80 some
different choices. Oh yeah.

518
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,750
It was socially very awkward.

519
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,460
People thought I was quite dim because
I wasn't oriented and I didn't know

520
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:42,910
exactly which way it was, which all the
time you can ask a five year old there,

521
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,970
can you point northeast? And
they'll point without hesitation.

522
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,140
If you ask a Stanford professor or
Harvard professor to do the same thing,

523
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,320
they have no idea. It isn't. And that
you know what if you were indoors,

524
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,590
like what if you were in a, in a
shelter, could they still do it? Yep.

525
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,650
They keep track of directions
even when they're indoors,

526
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,450
how without windows you pay attention,
you just have to pay attention.

527
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,150
And I think what's really
striking about, um,

528
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,410
the discovery of languages like this and
folks like this as they have an ability

529
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:18,850
that we call dead reckoning and
it's an ability to, you know,

530
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:23,851
after any kind of circuitous path to
turn around and head straight back home.

531
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,550
That ability we thought
was beyond human capacity.

532
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,630
We had observed it an aunt and
we had observed it and birds,

533
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,150
but there was always
some other explanation.

534
00:32:34,151 --> 00:32:38,150
Like birds have magnets in their beaks
and answer counting steps in, you know,

535
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:41,330
there's some kind of extra
thing that they were doing.

536
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,030
Now there's 7,000 languages in the world,

537
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:48,090
about a third of the world's
languages have this property. Hello,

538
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,550
not a third of the world's speakers, but
a third of the world's languages. Wow.

539
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,580
And these are not folks that have
magnets or special ant super powers.

540
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,100
They're using this, the same
cognitive system that we're using.

541
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,600
They're just using it differently.

542
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,530
They're paying attention to something
that we normally don't pay attention to.

543
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,770
But interestingly earlier
it says there was a moment,

544
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,650
a very particular moment when she
sort of slipped into attention.

545
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,010
I had this interesting
experience and I was there.

546
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:22,370
So after about a week
of being there, I was,

547
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,500
people were constantly pointing, uh,

548
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,640
to locations and I was constantly
trying to stay oriented.

549
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,790
And after about a week,
I was walking along,

550
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:33,230
I was kinda trudging through the sand.

551
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:36,920
It was hot and I was thinking
about whether I was wasting
my time there or not.

552
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,960
I wasn't sure if this
study was gonna work out.

553
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,950
And all of a sudden I noticed that in
my head there is this extra little,

554
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,220
it seemed almost like a
window, like an extra window.

555
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,920
Like in a video game there
was like a little console.

556
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:53,900
And in that console was a bird's eye view
of the landscape that I was walking on

557
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:57,530
and I was a little red dot. That
was traversing. Now that is kidding.

558
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,490
No kidding. And you just
become a pillow pole,

559
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,540
aloe or whatever they're called them.
And I thought, wow, that's really cool.

560
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:10,541
That makes it so much easier if you have
that little extra module in all of a

561
00:34:10,911 --> 00:34:14,430
sudden is the correct word is that
you happened all of a sudden it, oh,

562
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,870
I just saw it. It was, it was just there.

563
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,050
And then I kind of shyly shared
this with someone. I said, you know,

564
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:24,050
this weird thing happened. I was
walking along and I got this,

565
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,430
I had this view in my mind and they'd
looked at me kind of strangely and said,

566
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:33,190
well of course. How else would you do
it? That's exactly the, of course, you,

567
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:37,520
you have a bird's eye view and you keep
track of your location from a birds eye

568
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,960
view. Of course. You do.
I have that all the time.

569
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,340
No you don't. I don't either.
Proceed to break. And by the way,

570
00:34:46,341 --> 00:34:49,580
that voice right there that's been
joining us from time to time, uh,

571
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,100
we should explain that is Karen, Jake.

572
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,970
And I'm also known as the GPS girl.

573
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,650
She was nice enough to, uh,

574
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,450
agree to read some things that
we could use in our stories.

575
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,160
So that's what you've been hearing.

576
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,620
Okay. Well let's, shall we start with
the scripts that I have in front of me?

577
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,100
Okay. Please enter your address.

578
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,450
Well that's amazing.

579
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,910
It sounds like you've actually
gone into the machine somehow.

580
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,130
I don't work out how to
bottle that. Oh, I did.

581
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,050
Okay.

582
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,020
This is Jim Donahue

587
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,680
hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember
the Krill, which this is radio lab.

588
00:35:44,681 --> 00:35:49,000
Today on this program we are
calling it lost and found, right?

589
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:53,830
You have stories of getting lost
and of course getting found now.

590
00:35:53,831 --> 00:35:56,900
I think we're gonna, we're gonna make a
little adjustment here. Recalculating.

591
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,150
Shift gears, approaching
emotional lift and thank God.

592
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,960
I don't know. Give it to me.

593
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,430
This next story is a very different kind
of lost and found sort of a love story.

594
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,860
If you can tell us your name. Oh, here's
the guy. My name is Alan [inaudible].

595
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,170
Do you want to say anything more
than that? I Dunno. Is this,

596
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:21,240
is this for like a credit intro?

597
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,330
Let people introduce themselves? Oh, I
don't know. I don't have a title. Okay.

598
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,490
All right. So that salad girl,

599
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,910
Emily will meet her a bit later
for reasons that will become clear.

600
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,270
The story begins on a
fall day in Brooklyn.

601
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,510
And so the day in question, um,

602
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,900
I guess was the morning of October 8th.

603
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,950
They're both living in this one room
loft in Brooklyn and we woke up and you

604
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:49,340
know, both 21 went about our
daily routine and prepared to go.

605
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,570
He was in art school,

606
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,840
she was taking some time off from art
school to work for a local artist.

607
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:56,720
So she would take the bike and I would
take the train. What was it morning like?

608
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,010
It was a beautiful day. It was, you
know, sun was low in the skies there,

609
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:05,270
you know, long shadows. I strapped
on her helmet and adjusted it,

610
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,110
took her bike out for her. We kissed
each other goodbye and said, I love you.

611
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:10,550
And I watched your ride down the street

612
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:12,883
[inaudible]

613
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,900
this early morning. And then you
know on, I went down into the subway,

614
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,780
six hours later he's working in the
studio doing some sculpture and he gets a

615
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:27,760
call from a cop and he
just said, Emily Goseo,

616
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,780
she had an accident. She said, Bellevue,
this is the address. And I said,

617
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,410
oh, I mean do you have any
more information? He just
told me that it was bad.

618
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:38,750
[inaudible]

619
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,710
I was like carrying a bunch of stuff and
I just dropped everything and started

620
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:43,544
running

621
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,080
[inaudible]

622
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,600
now Alan and Emily had only
been together nine months,

623
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,730
but when it started says Allen,

624
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:56,650
it was just so immediate.
The night they got together,

625
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,090
they both just kind of knew.

626
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,150
It was sort of like a weird prophetic
kind of thing where they think it was the

627
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:06,310
first day that the school has had
a snow day. It was snowed out.

628
00:38:06,311 --> 00:38:10,210
It was kind of like this past blizzard,
you know, sort of like city shuts down,

629
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:11,500
magical kind of thing.

630
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:16,450
He'd gone out with some friends just
as the snow was coming down and we were

631
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,570
trapped at this party and that's
where he bumped into Emily pint sized.

632
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,610
Cause he's big like you're a desiccant
eyes and very kind of have trouble

633
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:34,030
describing your voice. It's almost as
if, I know you guys are audio people,

634
00:38:34,031 --> 00:38:38,470
but it's like stereo. Almost. Truth is
they've known each other for a while,

635
00:38:38,471 --> 00:38:42,970
but that night says Allen fireworks
all of a sudden. And it felt right.

636
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,260
So you had, you had a feeling this wasn't
just a thing, this was a thing. Right,

637
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,350
right. Or the thing, the thing, right.
The thing that you think the soul thing.

638
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,573
Yeah. All right.

639
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:56,100
Well Emily, uh, they've always
been boys frowned to Emily.

640
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,290
I mean that's Susan Gosu, Emily's mom.

641
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:01,530
She says at first when Emily told
her about Alan, she thought, okay,

642
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:02,790
so that's another boy.

643
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:07,170
Emily seemed to have that effect on boys
perhaps because she didn't really seem

644
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:08,004
to need them.

645
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,340
Here is someone who's been obsessed with
art and it's given up every body in her

646
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,820
life for art. At the age of six,

647
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:19,370
she was creating her own comic
books in junior high school.

648
00:39:19,371 --> 00:39:23,540
She took drawing classes every night
and then in high school she left us

649
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,320
friends, boyfriends to go to a
high school of the arts in Florida.

650
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:32,240
No one stands in the way of her art. It's
all she sees, it's all she focuses on.

651
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,380
But then she visited Emily in May a few
months before the accident and she met

652
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,340
Allen. I met Alan and
he was delightful. Um,

653
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,660
but there was a different look that I'd
never seen in Emily's eyes before when

654
00:39:44,661 --> 00:39:47,390
she looked at him and I didn't like it.

655
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,830
Tell us about the accident from your
perspective. From my, for when I, yeah,

656
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,760
I was at work. I, you're
in New Orleans mattering,

657
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,800
which is a suburb of New Orleans and I
get a telephone call and I looked and I

658
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:06,890
saw it was Allen Allen has never
called me before, answered the phone.

659
00:40:06,891 --> 00:40:10,460
I said Hello Allen. And he
said, ah, you have to come.

660
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,140
Emily was hit by a truck,

661
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,170
uh, 18 wheelers, semi truck,

662
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,820
and I took a breath and I
said, Alan, is Emily dead?

663
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:23,530
And he said, no, but you need to get here
as soon as possible. Six hours later,

664
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,610
her and her husband, Emily's dad, we're
at Bellevue hospital here in Manhattan.

665
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,820
They brought us into the,
her Roman surgical ICU.

666
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,440
We all went in, she was just lying in
bed and they were tubes, tubes down,

667
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:39,040
her throat coming in and out
and her face was so swollen.

668
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,690
Emily covered in blood,

669
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,040
wait at probably at the
time of the accident,

670
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:48,041
about a hundred pounds and she then
weighed 128 she had swollen 28 pounds.

671
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,350
She had multiple fractures in her leg
and her pelvis in the left side of her

672
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,184
face

673
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,090
open her abdomen and they had taken her
intestines out and put them on top of

674
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:01,100
her body so that she could breathe

675
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,730
and she was just lying completely still.

676
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,590
You know that first 48
hours, nothing moved.

677
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,530
Not Nothing. We took up shifts, you know,

678
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:15,730
her mother would be there in the day
and her father in the evening and then I

679
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,693
would be there with her.

680
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:21,530
Her eyes weren't even flickering and as
she sat there watching Emily not move,

681
00:41:21,531 --> 00:41:22,011
she says,

682
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:27,011
she kept thinking why I got these four
kids and everything bad seems to happen

683
00:41:27,201 --> 00:41:31,760
to Emily starting at six months ear
infections than sinus infections than

684
00:41:31,761 --> 00:41:34,070
asthma, than kindergarten. Emily was

685
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,770
losing her hearing for reasons
no one could quite figure out.

686
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,980
She had to get hearing aids on both
sides. But somehow her mom says,

687
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:44,810
all this just made Emily more
fierce if anyone can conquer this,

688
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,500
it's Emily.

689
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,580
I think on the second day they started
to take her off her medication,

690
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,240
expecting to see some sort
of reaction from her and

691
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,933
nothing,

692
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,593
nothing.

693
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,830
There was a nurse and the nurse said
that Emily was gone and asked me about

694
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,580
organ donations and I said yes. And so,

695
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,900
um, I worked up enough courage to go
into what they call the track room,

696
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,610
which is where the residents usually are.

697
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,050
And there was one woman residents sitting
at a computer and I went and I said,

698
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,030
when are you going to let Emily go?

699
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,750
And she's so we will have a family meeting
tomorrow morning and we'll talk then.

700
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,690
And so I said, okay. And I,
I left and I went back and,

701
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,820
and I'm sitting with Emily side
of her bed and I'm telling her,

702
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:42,530
Emily and I read the book,

703
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:45,230
the bridge of San Louis right
when she was a sophomore.

704
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,240
And I remember the ending of the
book, there's a land of the living,

705
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,600
there's a land of debt
and the bridge is love.

706
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,800
And that love is the only
thing that survives. And
it's kind of the way it goes.

707
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,700
And so I was sitting there with
Emily and I was telling this to,

708
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:06,200
I was saying this and talking in her ear
and saying this and talking to her and

709
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:09,110
telling her that I would love
her eternally through all time.

710
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:13,640
That I love with never end.
And Emily raised her left hand

711
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:17,010
did chick,

712
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,200
I got it. I can wait. What
was it was, it was k Hos

713
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,910
I was yelling for the nurse.
I saw it. I saw her move.

714
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:32,090
That was really one of the
really abrupt moments. Now

715
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,910
they knew Emily was not dead.
Emily was alive. But how alive

716
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:41,470
over the next few days says Allen,
she slowly started moving more,

717
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,880
not really in response to
anything. She'd arrive in bed,

718
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,280
scratch your leg where there was a wound,

719
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,800
hold her hand down and she'd
slap shit, slap our hands away.

720
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,240
But when they tell this to the doctors,

721
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:59,110
the doctors would say that's
not indicative of any kind
of mental functioning.

722
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,090
Could just be a reflex really.

723
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,370
So the medical team began trying to
determine just how damaged was she?

724
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,310
The ophthalmologists teams were coming
in and they were trying to get Emily's

725
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,150
eyes to eye peoples to respond
and they weren't responsive.

726
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,320
And so I knew what that meant. What did
that mean? It meant she could be blind.

727
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,630
So Emily couldn't see,

728
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,500
couldn't hear because remember she wore
hearing aids and why didn't you just put

729
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:27,490
those in? We tried. We tried
many times to put it in,

730
00:44:27,491 --> 00:44:30,730
but she just wouldn't allow it. But
what you do exactly when you did it,

731
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,200
flail her head shake around
kick and she would hit,

732
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,070
had a lot of bruises on my body where
she'd kicked me and pitched. So we,

733
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:41,370
we stopped. We every once in a
while we would go back to it,

734
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,070
but there was the question, you know,
um, maybe she couldn't hear anymore.

735
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,070
So what do you, what do you
do to a person who's gay?

736
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,890
You don't know what's going on inside
her and you can't get to her. Um,

737
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,730
you send it to a nursing
home and you know,

738
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,770
that's where she would have remained.
And after several weeks in the ICU,

739
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:06,210
Emily, she was stable and that
meant they had to make a decision.

740
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,230
Once you become stable,

741
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:10,830
then you have to move off surgical ICU
and out of the hospital to either a

742
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:14,250
rehabilitation or to a nursing home.
So that became the new question.

743
00:45:14,251 --> 00:45:17,010
Where would she go? Could
she be repaired, so to speak?

744
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:20,610
In which case you'd go to
Rehab or is it for her?

745
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,980
In which case she'd go to a nursing home.

746
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,330
Now making that call
medically is sometimes tricky.

747
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,130
That's Dr McCalla Eisenberg.

748
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:32,580
She's a physician at NYU and
it's her job to make that call.

749
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,930
And she says one of the key criteria for
getting someone into rehab to do Rehab

750
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:39,870
on somebody, you need to
have them reacting to you.

751
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,030
A person needs to be able to participate
in a meaningful way for three hours of

752
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:45,930
therapy a day.

753
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,950
They have to be able to follow commands
because that's how you rehabilitate

754
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,670
someone. If the person can't
hear, if the person can't see,

755
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,580
then there's no way to
communicate with her.

756
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:02,270
And so they made the assessment that
she could not go to rehab and that Emily

757
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:04,950
should go to a nursing home.

758
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:08,690
Mm MM.

759
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,580
So I sent my husband back to New
Orleans to look for a nursing home.

760
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:17,060
Did they can bring her back to,

761
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:20,700
they just kept it all secret from me that
they were going to take her away from

762
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:21,660
me. I mean, how do you

763
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,020
tell someone who loves your daughter
that much? That we're taking her away.

764
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,670
But there was not just one life that
we had in our hands. It was two lives.

765
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,630
We felt that that would
be the best thing for him.

766
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,270
And Alan could hate us.

767
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:37,540
[inaudible]

768
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,250
maybe as a way for him to bridge
and let go for that grief.

769
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:45,080
[inaudible]

770
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,890
but then as the doctors are prepping
Emily to move her to a nursing home,

771
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,040
they had to remove her tracheotomy,
which was helping her breathe.

772
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:56,610
And she all of a sudden started
talking. Really? She, she spoke? Yes.

773
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,180
What was she saying? He
would curse. Don't touch me.

774
00:47:00,181 --> 00:47:03,720
You blank to blank. You
know, she would say, stop.

775
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,210
This was in response to someone
touching her, touching her.

776
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,670
And if she wasn't cursing, says Ellen,
she would call everybody Miss Dash.

777
00:47:09,671 --> 00:47:14,120
Would certain people that were touching
her where mustache would, oh, let's,

778
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,470
um, from sentence sensibility
coding gene aust yellow. Yeah.

779
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:21,470
We had watched the movie like a
couple months previous to this,

780
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:26,530
so somehow she was locked in the movie
and it was just the assumption of the

781
00:47:26,691 --> 00:47:29,000
doctors that she was
just sort of mentally,

782
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,040
but if she's calling people miss dash,
doesn't that at least mean something? No,

783
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:37,990
it wasn't enough to say that Emily
could follow a command, like set up,

784
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,020
raise your right hand. So the plan
was still the nursing home, right?

785
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,280
I mean though, every possibility had
not been exhausted. I can see him.

786
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:50,290
He was sitting across the room
and his jaws were just clenched.

787
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,540
It just was not going to
give up. And he was saying,

788
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,950
you have to give her a chance. She,
you have to give her the chance.

789
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:01,300
You have a plan. No, I had no
plan whatsoever. It was lost.

790
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:06,040
This experience was just completely
traumatic to me emotionally.

791
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:10,140
But at the same time I was going to
help her in whatever way I could. Uh,

792
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,650
the only trajectory I had
was to help her in one night,

793
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,940
just a few days before Emily was going
to be discharged to a nursing home away

794
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:21,850
from him. I was there alone with
her and it's 3:00 AM or something,

795
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,760
and she was calm. Like she wasn't
trying to fight me away or anything.

796
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,740
I had helped her fix a thing that
was wrong with her, uh, mouth wiring.

797
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,080
It was like a wire that was
poking her and I fixed it for it.

798
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,590
And he says at that moment, something
occurred to him. I really just was like,

799
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:37,060
in the recesses of my mind,

800
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,640
he thought of the story of
Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan.

801
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,160
He'd read about it a few days
earlier online and he thought,

802
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:48,130
what if I tried what Annie Sullivan
did with Helen Keller on Emily?

803
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:53,160
I took her left hand with my left hand
and I leaned over and using her wrist as

804
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,180
the baseline for the words. And
his finger is the pen I just wrote.

805
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,230
I waited a second. Oh, wait a second.

806
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,580
Oh, waited a second. The e

807
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,880
waited a second. You then according
to Allen, she said to him,

808
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,220
she said, Oh, you love me. Thank you.

809
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,520
She literally replied the
reply immediately because
she knew who, you know,

810
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,790
she has no idea who I am.

811
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:25,923
Uh,

812
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:32,260
now we had a way to get to her so he
could figure out how much of her was

813
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:35,770
actually there and maybe even
prove it to the doctors. You know,

814
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:38,800
I had to have something that was
conclusive to present to them.

815
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:44,130
The following evening I took out my cell
phone and it has a record function on

816
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,420
it and I started recording

817
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,910
question after question to
determine her Tonya disability.

818
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:54,910
What is your name?

819
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:01,380
What? W. H. A. T. Hi.

820
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,690
Yes, I am.

821
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,473
Hey,

822
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,730
you finger spelled every letter. Yeah.

823
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,290
[inaudible] Hi

824
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,263
[inaudible] [inaudible]

825
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,370
[inaudible] [inaudible] she's
writing her name on the poem of mine.

826
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,920
Alan called me at four o'clock in the
morning, said, you have to come now.

827
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:01,993
I have proof.

828
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:05,300
No one's going to ask her what year it is.

829
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,520
[inaudible] hi, I'm going to ride year.

830
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,093
[inaudible] [inaudible]

831
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:31,110
question mark. Very good.

832
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,570
And Emily. Very good. Very, very good.

833
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:44,080
You know where you a question mark?

834
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,020
Okay. Right now I'm going to ride hospital

835
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,660
that they're about four 45 in the morning.

836
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,670
Alan is over there by the bed continuing
to finger spell and talk to her and

837
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:01,650
she, she calls him Allen.

838
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:06,660
She knows that this person who is finger
spelling on her hand is named Allen,

839
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,010
but Allen can't get her to understand
who he really is. That it's her alley.

840
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,960
I'm just going to read
my name again. Alan.

841
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,630
She just couldn't make that mental
jump to connect her past life with her

842
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,853
present.

843
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:24,763
I

844
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,160
[inaudible] am I Asian or no?

845
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,070
Next thing I hear her say
is pull me out of the wall.

846
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,070
She kept saying, pull me out. Please
pull me out of here. It's dark in here.

847
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:47,090
Pull me out, help me know you can
do it. Pull me out of the wall.

848
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,930
I kept saying I can't, I would
write on her hand that can't,

849
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,230
Allen starts to sob and I'm crying too.

850
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,250
What are you thinking at this point?
It wasn't enough. It wasn't enough.

851
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,550
It wasn't enough. And I said, Allen

852
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:06,290
ask her about her hearing
aids and so he finger spells,

853
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:10,050
hearing aid aid and she said okay.

854
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:12,900
She agreed with the hearing
aid and for the first time,

855
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:17,680
so we put it in and
switched it on. He said,

856
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:19,810
Emily, Emily, can you
hear me? It's me, Ellen.

857
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,180
Everything came back to me. I
there. I did not read everything.

858
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,630
The door opened and Emily stepped out.
She was back. Yeah. It's just a hearing.

859
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:36,320
His voice. I knew it was Han and I.

860
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,010
He sent anomalies there
and I heard her say what?

861
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:45,480
I had been waiting for her to say all
those weeks I screamed, mom, you know he,

862
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,410
she said, Mama, no, I couldn't
leave her there the whole time.

863
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,570
We asked Emily before she
came back, where was she?

864
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,380
I didn't know where I was.

865
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,560
If I could see at all,

866
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,960
and I knew that I was sleeping
and I was already dreaming.

867
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:10,200
She says people would come to
her in her dreams and say, don't,

868
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,930
don't touch that. Stop
scratching your wounds.

869
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:16,380
And I dreamed they blend in with reality.

870
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,250
She says she knew somehow that
there are people around her,

871
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,670
but she couldn't get to them and that
she also knew she was in a dream.

872
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,540
Why am I still sleeping? But you
couldn't send my awake up from,

873
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:30,050
I felt helpless. I felt really helpless.

874
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,500
Where you waiting for someone
like that? I mean, where are you?

875
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,690
Because I was waiting for

876
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:41,370
some communication, you know,

877
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:49,240
[inaudible] and I always
really [inaudible]

878
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:50,993
[inaudible]

879
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,100
Alan, he's very call to me.

880
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:02,770
[inaudible]

881
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:04,810
Emily's now at the Rusk Institute,

882
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,020
which is one of New York
city's leading rehab centers,

883
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:13,100
and on the day we visited her, she just
had a breakthrough. I said, first day,

884
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,270
okay, stand on both legs
and walk. Actually walk.

885
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,820
I walked a hundred feet today

886
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:25,070
after Rehab, she'll be moving into an
apartment in lower Manhattan with Allen.

887
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,210
She's blind. And the chances
of receiving again are slim.

888
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,650
But Allen plans to spend his time helping
her cope and helping her find a new

889
00:55:33,651 --> 00:55:36,530
way to make art. Really. Can
you, can you introduce yourself?

890
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:38,590
Do you want me say, my name is Allie?

891
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,670
Yeah. Just with, just so we have it all
on tape. If I would have the title on,

892
00:55:42,671 --> 00:55:46,510
I couldn't think of one, but
I thought of one title. Yeah.

893
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:51,820
And I'll do mine. My name is
Alan llangoed. Um, the boyfriend,

894
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:56,560

895
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,740
