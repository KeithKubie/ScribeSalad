Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and this is Crash
Course Economics.

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:08.870
So, you want to be happy? Here’s your checklist:
Get a job where you make about $82,000 a year.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.680
Do not get fired from that job. Make sure
your commute is no more than 22 minutes.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.560
And, please, please: you’ve got to stop
looking at your friends’ Facebook profiles.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:27.520
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.800
In the U.S., the pursuit of happiness is one
of our inalienable rights;

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.480
written into the Declaration of Independence
right along with the biggies — life and liberty.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.100
The self-help industry is worth billions of
dollars.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.359
I mean, some of us hire life coaches.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.799
And for all that, happiness can seem pretty
elusive.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.360
Economic thought over the last couple of centuries
is built on a model that says

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.969
we all have unlimited, inexhaustable desires.
More equals better.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.229
And economists believed they could tell what
makes us better-off by

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.039
looking at how we spend our money and time.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.459
But in recent years, those assumptions are
being called into question.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.280
Economists and psychologists have discovered a disconnect between how we buy and spend and do,

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.740
and what actually makes us FEEL better off.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.860
They’ve realized that sometimes, getting
paid nothing for doing something

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.469
can make us feel happier than getting paid.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:19.720
Like say I cooked a friend a dinner for his
birthday,

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.709
and after we finished up the last bite of
birthday cake, he offered to pay me for it.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:29.769
All of the sudden my gesture of kindness my
warm fuzzy feelings, they disappear.

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:35.509
Economists have discovered a correlation between greater income and greater happiness across cultures.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.280
But in some places the effect is greater than
others.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.160
But, they’ve also found that more money has diminishing returns when it comes to our day to day happiness.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.020
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.
Say Stan and I are both successful bakers.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.729
Thanks to a combination of my impressive baking
skills and some luck, I've become a star baker.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.780
I make $500,000 a year in cupcake sales and
baking pan endorsements.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.499
Stan, on the other hand, is a masterful, but
not-famous baker.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:04.979
He makes $50,000 a year selling cupcakes out
of his modest bakery.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.200
Stan and I enter a cupcake contest.
I win $10,000 in the cake category.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.000
Stan wins $10,000 for his icing and decoration.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.080
But that money is going to have very different
effects on our lives and our feelings of happiness.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.640
For Stan, $10,000 represents a significant
portion of his income.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
That $10,000 may make him feel a whole lot
more relaxed and better off.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.660
For me, an extra $10,000 is nice and all.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.660
But it’s not going to change much about
how I live my life or what I do with my time.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.860
$10,000. Cool. Whatevs.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.460
Beyond some level of income, the value of
each additional dollar

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.620
has diminishing returns in terms of our day
to day well-being.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:53.000
A 2010 study found in the U.S. it was about $75,000 a year— or about $82,000 when you adjust for inflation.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.340
After that, the researchers discovered, a person’s day to day happiness levels just didn’t change that much.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.080
But, the same researchers also looked at another
form of happiness;

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.280
asking people how satisfied people were with
their place in the world.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.100
And there, money mattered.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.120
The study found that there was a difference between the wealthy and super-duper-insanely wealthy

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.390
when it came to overall satisfaction with
their lives.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.420
Thanks Thought Bubble! So, we know that some people have a natural predisposition to be unhappy.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.780
And some people seem more inclined to constant
joy. Those people are annoying.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.020
For a long time, psychologists believed that
people have a “set point” for happiness.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.140
And that most big changes — positive or negative — had only a temporary effect on happiness.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.240
But, more recent studies show that economic choices and circumstances can have lasting effects on just how happy we are.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.360
For one, there is a pretty clear relationship
between unemployment and happiness.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.760
Basically, being out of work can make people
out-and-out-miserable.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.260
By some estimates, unemployed people have 5%-15% lower life satisfaction scores than people with jobs.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.180
Studies have found that the negative effects of unemployment are greater in high-income countries.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.940
There’s also research showing that the happiness
of middle-age people is

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.560
more negatively affected by unemployment than
older people.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.520
You might be thinking, duh, people without a job aren’t making any money, so of course they’d be less happy.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.240
But economists have found that the loss of
well-being due to unemployment is

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.220
greater than can be explained by the immediate
loss of a paycheck.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.280
One explanation is that unemployment makes people worried not just about paying the bills today,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.630
but also about the future.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.130
Economists have also found that moving from a part time job to a full time job makes people happier.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.420
But, the correlation between hours worked and happiness doesn’t continue up and up and up.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.360
At some point,when you’re working ALL THE
TIME, happiness levels start declining.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.980
Imagine it like an upside down U shape.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.520
Kind of like an I’m-working-all-the-time-and-never-get-to-see-my-friends sad face.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.180
Long work commutes make people less happy.
Credit card debt makes people less happy.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.340
And inflation, it turns out, especially unpredictable
inflation, can make people less happy.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.340
We like stability.
And for our savings to hold their value.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.240
It’s not just the ups and downs of what
you can afford that affects your happiness.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.900
It’s also what the neighbors can afford.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.800
There’s something called the reference-income
hypothesis or ranked-income hypothesis.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.240
It says that the satisfaction I get from my
income and consumption level

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.350
depends on how I’m doing compared to everyone
else around me.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.320
So, if the wealthy-star baker version of myself
lives around millionaires,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.200
I might be less happy than if I lived in a
middle class neighborhood.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.660
Even if I’m making the same income.
A 2009 study found this is true, to an extent.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.340
Researchers found out Americans were happier when they lived in rich neighborhoods in poor counties.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:46.860
The authors wrote: “it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.000
as long as the poor do not live too close.”

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
This idea that status matters, maybe more
than absolute income,

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.660
brings us around to something known as the
“Easterlin Paradox.”

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.880
It’s named after an economist named Richard Easterlin, who, back in the '70s, found that that

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.280
as the income level in a country rises, the average level of happiness in those countries doesn’t always follow.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.360
This happens even though we also know there
is, at some level,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.400
a positive relationship between income and
happiness.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.760
So, what’s going on? One explanation is that we derive happiness from status, rather than absolute income.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.639
So when an entire country gets richer, even
if our income goes up,

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:27.619
our status and relative income stays about
the same.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.620
And we don’t get any happier.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.139
Another explanation gets back to the “set
point” of happiness we talked about before.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.060
Some economists talk about the “hedonic
treadmill” or “hedonic adaptation”.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.530
Here’s Rousseau — describing the phenomenon:

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.300
“Since these conveniences by becoming habitual
had almost entirely ceased to be enjoyable,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.180
and at the same time degenerated into true
needs,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.160
it became much more cruel to be deprived of
them than to possess them was sweet,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.930
and men were unhappy to lose them without
being happy to possess them.”

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.980
I can remember the joy I felt when I got my
first smart phone.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.700
Now I’ve adapted to the point that my phone is kind of annoying, but if somebody took it away, I might cry.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.400
There’s a third explanation out there regarding
the Easterlin Paradox

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.960
and that’s that it’s not actually a paradox
at all.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.440
Basically that it doesn’t hold.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.919
There has been some research that shows the paradox is only true for relatively wealthy countries,

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.070
where the basic needs of citizens are already
being met.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.900
In lower GDP countries, the studies find, there ARE overall increases in happiness when income rises.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.380
More recently, economists Betsey Stevenson
and Justin Wolfers argued that

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.280
average levels of happiness rise in countries where income rises, regardless of how wealthy that country is.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.440
The data, they say, points to a clear relationship between GDP per capita and average levels of well-being.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.270
All of this happiness research matters when
you think about

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.900
how governments measure progress and decide
what the right path is for a country.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.880
For a long time economic growth has been at
the center of economic policy.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.660
It explains some of our global fixation on
GDP numbers.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:07.880
But, if you believe that an increase in income and stuff isn’t going to make people happier and better off,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.760
income growth may not be the best way to mark
or judge the progress of a society.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.150
A focus on GDP and growth might hide and even
exacerbate issues like income inequality

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.810
and environmental damage related to increased
consumption.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.150
In the 1970s, the king of the tiny country
of Bhutan proclaimed that

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.660
"‘Gross National Happiness is more important
than Gross National Product.’"

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.789
Instead of measuring economic progress using
GNP or GDP,

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:39.699
the government tracks GNH — Gross National
Happiness,

00:08:39.699 --> 00:08:44.790
which considers the social, physical, spiritual
and environmental health of its citizens.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.040
And it's not just Bhutan.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.440
In 2011, the United Nations adopted a resolution

00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:53.889
that calls for member states to give greater
weight to happiness and well-being

00:08:53.889 --> 00:08:57.759
when figuring out how to pursue social and
economic development.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:03.299
But this focus on happiness in addition to
economic growth isn’t a truly new idea.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.500
All the way back In 1968, U.S. presidential candidate Robert Kennedy got up in front of an audience

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:14.839
at the University of Kansas and criticized
the focus on economic output alone.

00:09:14.839 --> 00:09:20.050
"Our Gross National Product, now, is over
$800 billion dollars a year,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:25.430
but that Gross National Product — if we
judge the United States of America by that —

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.740
that Gross National Product counts air pollution
and cigarette advertising,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.880
and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.”

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.920
He goes on: “It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning,

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.280
neither our compassion nor our devotion to
our country,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.120
it measures everything in short, except that
which makes life worthwhile.”

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.079
Well, I don’t think we can write a better ending to the show, or to the series, than that.
