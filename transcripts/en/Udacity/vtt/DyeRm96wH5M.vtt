00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.610
Okay, why is statistics useful in data science? There's a

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.980
lot of reasons, obviously. The, the, the first reason, I would

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.990
say, is, the most basic one and this goes back

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.180
to why statistics was, you know, developed a hundred or so

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.340
years ago. And it really is to make sure that

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.650
you're making reasonable inferences from data. So you hear a lot

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.230
of people talk about big data and the value of big

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.520
data and how we can you know, have data on just

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.120
about everything nowadays. And it's easy to get caught

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.150
up in that and it's important to remember, that

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.710
anytime, you're looking at any sort of data whether

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.648
it's observational or experimental. You want to make sure that

00:00:36.648 --> 00:00:39.060
you're making valid inferences, right? You want to do things

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.380
like check for statistical significance, understand confidence intervals. Make

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.450
sure that you're not pointing you're working with in,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.420
in certain conc, wrong direction because you've over interpreted

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.940
some data so I think that's the first,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.630
probably most important reasons why statistics is important to

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.790
data science there's a lot more just working

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.550
with data, day in and day out there's a

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.310
lot of what I would call. Sort of,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.960
you know very fine-grain technical skill, to just make

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.190
sure, you're doing the right thing, and you're

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.410
extracting the most information you can out of data.
