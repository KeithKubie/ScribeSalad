00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.960
So now that we understand tasks,
what comes next?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.640
&gt;&gt; Well, then you actually start
to get drawing the screens.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.460
You get to pick up the pen, or
the white board marker, or the mouse and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.420
start trying to imagine
what these scenes,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.810
these environments the user's going
to interact with actually look like.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.590
So you're going back to the tasks and

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.540
kind of figuring out what are the pieces
of information that they need to see.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.100
What are the pieces of
information they need to provide.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.520
How do those all fit together on
the screen to support that task?

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.700
And from there you can kind of
start building one screen and

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.080
maybe a couple of screens
that cover that task.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.718
And then look for connections.

00:00:40.718 --> 00:00:44.635
You can start looking for things
that happened earlier to the user,

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.569
that brought them to this stage.

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:49.450
You know, those screens want
to be related in some way.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.590
Or you think about things
that they want to do from

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.890
that point once they complete that task,
well where do they go?

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.296
And as you start to kind of get all
these screens you start to build these

00:00:59.296 --> 00:01:00.521
flows and connect them.

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:04.551
You have a sense of which things are
really important which things are less

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:06.340
important or frequently used.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.770
You start to build out the structure for
this experience.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.110
And you think about the user might come
in this way and spend a lot of time here

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.370
and then hop over into this different
condition and spend time there.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.170
That starts to guide you about how the
overall navigation of that experience

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.180
is going to work.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.610
&gt;&gt; And which tool do you
love to use to do that?

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.835
&gt;&gt; I love paper and pencil.

00:01:26.835 --> 00:01:28.164
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:28.164 --> 00:01:32.040
&gt;&gt; But at some point you get more and
more detailed with what you're doing.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.860
So you can start very coarse.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.720
You can just start with a white board or

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.030
scraps of paper because you
want to kind of fail quickly.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.340
You want to draw out things,
realize what's wrong with them,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.730
crumple them up, and throw them away.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.990
And draw them again.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.200
A lot of what I do as
a designer is iteration.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.770
And there's a saying that
writing is rewriting,

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.030
that applies to design as well.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.790
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Design is redesigning.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.430
&gt;&gt; So you design it to show it to
someone, you get some feedback, and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.490
then you redesign it.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.040
And you often will draw
a lot of different things.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.840
And just kind of get a feel for, from
feedback and from your own experience,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.810
and from the understanding of the user
that you've built up through all those

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.008
other steps.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.350
Which ones are the best bets,
which make the most sense?

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.910
And some of that is about making
a choice based on the whole product.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.710
It's good if you can get to a smaller
number of patterns that the user has to

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.930
learn rather than the user having
to learn 100 different styles of

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.250
working with your app.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.750
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.530
So when do I know that I'm
done with all these checks?

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.227
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So you're never done.

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:35.272
That's a joke.

00:02:35.272 --> 00:02:36.810
That's design.
&gt;&gt; Oh that sounded unfortunate.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.630
&gt;&gt; No sorry.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I mean it's great you could try but

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.520
you're never going to quite get there.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.505
Like there's always going to be
something that you want to change.

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:49.047
You learn something else from
the testing or from putting it out.

00:02:49.047 --> 00:02:51.865
Or there's some new capability
that comes around that you

00:02:51.865 --> 00:02:54.875
want to incorporate into the product.

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:56.675
You'll get closer and closer.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:59.645
You'll continue to approach it,
but you'll never quite land there.

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:03.050
So you'll kind of go through and
you'll iterate, and you'll redesign, and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.690
you'll go to higher and
higher levels of fidelity.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.008
You'll go from those pencil sketches
to mockups to very polished mockups to

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:10.820
prototypes.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.190
And you'll start building
it at some point.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.630
So that said,
there's things you can look for.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; You don't have to give up all hope.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.019
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So,

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.471
have you covered all of those tasks
that you want to address, right?

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:29.022
Have you completely solved
the problem you were looking at?

00:03:29.022 --> 00:03:33.627
Does the product have a point of view
about what things are important and

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:34.711
which aren't?

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:38.048
You know, if you have the tasks that
are high priority make them feel like

00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:39.587
they're important to the user.

00:03:39.587 --> 00:03:42.809
Like stress them so that they know
this is what this product is about.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.890
You've done user testing, right?

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.620
&gt;&gt; Of course
&gt;&gt; Okay, so

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.460
have you covered all of
the issues that arose from that?

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.250
Have you kind of addressed
those high priority items?

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.640
And then finally, have you solved
the problem you set out to solve?

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.870
You go back to those original goals and

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.339
see am I actually meeting what I
understand I need to do for that user?

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.581
&gt;&gt; And what would be a good mark or
signal to tell me that I need to move

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.960
from design to actually do rapid
prototyping or stuff like that?

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.130
&gt;&gt; You should do that
as rapidly as you can.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.490
You know, even if you're just testing
things on paper Prototyping it out.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.200
Using kind of the simplest
tools that you can do.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.170
You have that analysis phase and
then once you move into design,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.860
you know design and prototyping
should be very much hand in hand.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.790
The closer you get to something that
feels like a real experience to a user,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.640
the better feedback you're
going to get from them.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.510
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; In many cases.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.580
So, you want to get to that
point as rapidly as you can.
