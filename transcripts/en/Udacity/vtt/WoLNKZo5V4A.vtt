00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a straightforward implementation of the forward Euler method.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This x at the initial step is actually 2D vector. S is the y.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The result will again be a 2D vector with those two values for the two trajectories in it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The resulting diagram may need some explanation.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We see the distance between the x values of the two trajectories over the course of time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Initially, they are really close--10^-14.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then they grow and eventually become macroscopic--10^100.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The important thing to be seeing is this linear slop.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But actually it's not linear.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We are working with a logarithmic vertical axis,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
which means that the distance grows in exponential fashion.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It takes about 30 units of time to increase the error from 10^-14 to 10^-4.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
These are 10 orders of magnitude, a factor of 1 to 10 billion.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This leads to the following conclusion:

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
whenever there is an uncertainty about the initial conditions--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
however tiny--the effect of this uncertainty will quickly grow to a visible size.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, even those the system is deterministic,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
once we have fixed the initial conditions, everything is determined--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
even though that is the case, it's behavior looks random.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the hallmark of deterministic chaos.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That is to be expected.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Every system, which includes convection, also inherits this aspect.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
If somewhere a butterfly flaps its wings, some days or months afterward

00:01:38.000 --> 09:59:59.000
this is going to change the weather at some remote location on the earth.
