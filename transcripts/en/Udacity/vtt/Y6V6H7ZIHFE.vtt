You could register a listener 
for the action power connected event

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.400
and you should do that 
within your manifest.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.240
That way, it can be called 
to start your app

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.860
once the device is getting charged, 
even if it's been terminated

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.970
since the last time you were using it. 
You can use a similar approach

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.160
to delay trying 
to send data until the device

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.850
has internet connectivity. 
Would it change behavior

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.120
of the user experience when you're 
connected to a car or desk dock?
