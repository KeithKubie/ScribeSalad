00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:15.500
I want to start by telling you
two things about myself

00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:17.657
before I get into the full talk.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.184
And the first is that I've been writing
about manners and civility

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:22.379
for more than 20 years,

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:24.870
as a book author
and as a magazine columnist.

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:27.672
The second is,

00:00:27.696 --> 00:00:32.530
my friends know to be very wary
of inviting me over for dinner

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:34.864
because any faux pas
that happens at the table

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:36.539
is likely to wind up in print.

00:00:36.563 --> 00:00:37.657
(Laughter)

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:41.482
So, I'm watching, I can see back there
and I can see through the portals, too.

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:42.656
(Laughter)

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:45.783
So, speaking of dinner parties,

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:49.950
I want to take you back to 2015
and a dinner party that I went to.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.077
To place this in time,

00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.206
this was when Caitlyn Jenner
was first coming out,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.809
shedding her identity as a Kardashian

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.888
and moving into her life
as a transgender activist.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.574
I wrote a column
in People magazine at the time,

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:06.561
talking about the importance of names

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:09.307
and how names are our identity.

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:13.768
And that to misuse them or not to use them
erases us in a certain way.

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:15.712
And especially with Caitlyn Jenner,

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:19.101
I talked about Caitlyn,
but also the use of her pronouns.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.275
Her pronouns.

00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:23.387
So I'm at this dinner --
delicious, wonderful, fun --

00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:27.824
when my host goes on a rant
about Caitlyn Jenner.

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:33.842
And she is saying that it is
disrespectful for Caitlyn Jenner

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:38.416
to force her to use a new name
and to use these new pronouns.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.713
She's not buying it,

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:43.871
and I'm listening,
and because I do meditation,

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.714
I took my sacred pause before I responded.

00:01:46.738 --> 00:01:47.888
(Laughter)

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:52.319
And I reminded her
that when she got married,

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:54.105
she changed her name,

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.422
and that she took the name of her husband.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:58.979
And that's the name all of us now use.

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.776
We don't use it just
because it's her legal name,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.640
but we use it because it's respectful.

00:02:04.053 --> 00:02:05.520
Ditto for Miss Jenner.

00:02:06.268 --> 00:02:08.529
She didn't buy it
and we didn't speak for years.

00:02:08.553 --> 00:02:10.378
(Laughter)

00:02:10.887 --> 00:02:12.173
So ...

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:15.823
I am known as the Civilist.

00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:19.514
And it's probably a word
that you're not that familiar with.

00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:21.515
It's not in common parlance

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.561
and it comes from the Latin
and the French,

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:28.656
and it means an individual
who tries to live by a moral code,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.147
who is striving to be a good citizen.

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:34.466
The word "civility" is derived from that,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.752
and the original definition of civility

00:02:36.776 --> 00:02:40.934
is citizens willing to give of themselves
for the good of the city,

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.879
for the good of the commonwealth,
for the larger good.

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:45.585
So, in this talk,

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.511
you're going to learn
three new ways to be civil, I hope,

00:02:49.535 --> 00:02:53.863
and it will be according
to the original definition of civility.

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:56.350
My first problem is:

00:02:57.403 --> 00:02:59.336
civility is an obsolete word.

00:02:59.684 --> 00:03:01.763
My second problem is:

00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:04.192
civility has become
a dirty word in this country.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:07.834
And that is whether you lean right
or whether you lean left.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.768
And in part, that's because modern usage
equates civility with decorum,

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.537
with formal politeness, formal behavior.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.942
We've gotten away
from the idea of citizenship.

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:24.672
So, let me start by talking a little bit
about my friends on the right,

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:28.216
who have conflated civility with
what they call political correctness.

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:31.047
And to them, callouts for civility

00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:35.395
are really very much like
what George Orwell wrote in "1984" --

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:36.688
he called it "newspeak."

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:40.680
And this was an attempt
to change the way we talk

00:03:40.704 --> 00:03:43.069
by forcibly changing
the language that we use.

00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:46.093
To change our ideas
by changing the meaning of words.

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:50.117
And I think my dinner host
might have had some of that

00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.442
rattling around there.

00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:55.713
And I first personally understood, though,

00:03:55.737 --> 00:03:57.384
the right's problem with civility

00:03:57.408 --> 00:04:00.086
when I wrote a column
about then-candidate Donald Trump.

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:03.299
And he had just said

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:07.053
he did not have time
for total political correctness,

00:04:07.077 --> 00:04:09.316
and he did not believe
the country did either.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.474
And I took that to heart, it was very --

00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:17.696
The audience was very engaged
about that online, as you can imagine.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.220
There was a thousand responses,
and this one stood out to me

00:04:22.244 --> 00:04:24.244
because it was representative:

00:04:25.093 --> 00:04:28.339
"Political correctness
is a pathological system

00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:30.807
that lets liberals dominate
a conversation,

00:04:30.831 --> 00:04:33.964
label, demonize and shout down
the opposition."

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:39.696
So I think, to the right,
civility translates into censure.

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:42.450
So that's the right.

00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:46.863
Now, my friends on the left
also have a problem with it.

00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:49.150
And for example, there have been those

00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:51.561
who have harassed
Trump administration officials

00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:54.276
who support the President's border wall.

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.030
They've been called out as rude,
they've been called out as nasty,

00:04:58.054 --> 00:04:59.656
they've been called out as worse.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.912
And after one such incident last year,

00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:03.810
even the Washington Post --

00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:05.892
you know, left-leaning
Washington Post --

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:08.072
wrote an editorial and sided with decorum.

00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:12.622
And they argued that officials
should be allowed to dine in peace.

00:05:13.828 --> 00:05:14.978
Hm.

00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:18.774
"You know, the wall
is the real incivility here.

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:22.095
The tear-gassing of kids,
the separation of families."

00:05:22.595 --> 00:05:24.389
That's what the protestors say.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.685
And imagine if we had sided,
in this country,

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.943
with decorum and courtesy
throughout our history.

00:05:31.306 --> 00:05:33.615
You know, I think about the suffragettes.

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:36.559
They marched, they picketed.

00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:39.656
They were chastised, they were arrested

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.452
for pursuing the vote
for women in the 1920s.

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:46.180
You know, I also think about
the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.,

00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:49.458
the father of American
nonviolent civil disobedience.

00:05:49.784 --> 00:05:55.187
He was labeled as uncivil in his attempt
to promote racial and economic justice.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:05:58.241
So I think you get a sense

00:05:58.265 --> 00:06:02.292
of why civility has become
a problem, a dirty word, here.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.007
Now, does this mean we can't disagree,
that we can't speak our minds?

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:10.093
Absolutely not.

00:06:10.775 --> 00:06:13.175
I recently spoke with
Dr. Carolyn Lukensmeyer.

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:16.347
She's kind of the guru
of civility in this country,

00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.205
and the executive director of a body

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.696
called the National Institute
for Civil Discourse.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.871
And she told me,

00:06:21.895 --> 00:06:26.236
"Civility does not mean appeasement
or avoiding important differences.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.522
It means listening and talking
about those differences with respect."

00:06:32.696 --> 00:06:35.903
In a healthy democracy,
we need to do that.

00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:38.460
And I call that respectful engagement.

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:42.340
But civil discourse also needs rules,
it needs boundaries.

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:46.139
For instance, there's a difference

00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:49.504
between language
that is simply rude or demeaning,

00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:53.093
and speech that invokes
hatred and intolerance.

00:06:53.117 --> 00:06:55.029
And specifically of groups.

00:06:55.053 --> 00:06:57.156
And I'm thinking
of racial and ethnic groups,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.379
I'm thinking of the LGBTQ community,

00:06:59.403 --> 00:07:01.180
I'm thinking of the disabled.

00:07:02.523 --> 00:07:05.684
We snowflakes
call this speech "hate speech."

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.968
And hate speech can lead to violence.

00:07:11.048 --> 00:07:14.713
So, to that point, in the fall of 2018,

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:17.893
I wrote a column
about Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.

00:07:18.269 --> 00:07:19.483
You may remember her,

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:24.015
she was one of the women who accused
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.239
of sexual assault.

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:27.212
And among the responses,

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:30.236
I received this message,
a personal message,

00:07:30.968 --> 00:07:33.285
which you can see here on the slide.

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:35.055
It's been largely redacted.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.299
(Laughter)

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.759
This message was 50 words long.
10 of them were the f-bomb.

00:07:40.498 --> 00:07:44.178
And the Democrats were called out,
President Obama was called out,

00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:47.863
and I was referred to in a pretty darn
vulgar and coarse way.

00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:53.680
There was an explicit threat
in that message,

00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:56.847
and that is why my editors at The Post
sent it to authorities.

00:07:58.108 --> 00:08:01.704
This came shortly before the pipe bombs
were sent to other media outlets,

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:04.513
so everybody was really
kind of on guard there.

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:09.212
And the larger context was,
only a few months before,

00:08:09.236 --> 00:08:11.815
five staffers had been killed
at a Maryland newspaper.

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:15.276
They had been shot dead
by a reader with a grudge.

00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:18.070
"Shut up or else."

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.134
And it was around that same time

00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:26.284
that a different reader of mine
started stalking me online.

00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:27.824
And at first, it was ...

00:08:28.737 --> 00:08:30.170
I'll call it light and fluffy.

00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:31.785
It was around this time last year

00:08:31.809 --> 00:08:33.872
and I still had
my Christmas decorations up

00:08:33.896 --> 00:08:35.871
and he sent me a message saying,

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:38.592
"You should take your Christmas
decorations down."

00:08:38.616 --> 00:08:41.318
And then he noticed that my dog
was off leash one day,

00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:43.809
and then he commented
that I had gone to the market.

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:48.091
And then he wrote me one that said,

00:08:48.115 --> 00:08:50.328
"If anyone were to shoot and kill you,

00:08:50.352 --> 00:08:52.172
it would not be a loss at all."

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.434
I wish that were the end of the story.

00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:59.710
Because then, a few months later,
he came to my door, my front door,

00:08:59.734 --> 00:09:02.182
in a rage and tried
to break the door down.

00:09:02.206 --> 00:09:05.150
I now own mace, a security system

00:09:05.174 --> 00:09:07.848
and a Louisville Slugger baseball bat.

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:09.942
(Sighs)

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:12.047
"Shut up or else."

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:14.109
So, what's to be done

00:09:14.133 --> 00:09:17.273
to forestall civility from turning ugly,
from turning violent?

00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:20.038
My first rule is to deescalate language.

00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:23.508
And I've stopped using
trigger words in print.

00:09:24.332 --> 00:09:27.295
And by trigger words, I mean
"homophobe," I mean "racist,"

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:30.141
I mean "xenophobe," I mean "sexist."

00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:31.432
All of those words.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.982
They set people off.

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.713
They're incendiary

00:09:35.737 --> 00:09:38.244
and they do not allow us
to find common ground.

00:09:38.268 --> 00:09:40.890
They do not allow us
to find a common heart.

00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:45.717
And so to this point,
when John McCain died in 2018,

00:09:47.196 --> 00:09:51.132
his supporters noted
that he never made personal attacks.

00:09:51.448 --> 00:09:53.107
But his opponents agreed as well,

00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:55.424
and I though that was
what was really noteworthy.

00:09:55.448 --> 00:09:58.424
He challenged people's policies,
he challenged their positions,

00:09:58.448 --> 00:09:59.900
but he never made it personal.

00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:02.289
And so that's the second rule.

00:10:03.275 --> 00:10:07.031
So the problem of civility
is not only an American one.

00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:11.314
In the Netherlands, there are calls
for a civility offensive right now,

00:10:11.338 --> 00:10:13.677
and as one Dutch philosopher has put it,

00:10:13.701 --> 00:10:17.069
the country has fallen
under a spell of "verhuftering."

00:10:17.614 --> 00:10:21.494
Now, this is not a word that I knew before
and I did quite a bit of research.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.158
It loosely means bullying
and the disappearance of good manners.

00:10:26.552 --> 00:10:30.249
It actually means much worse than that,
but that's what I'm saying here.

00:10:31.228 --> 00:10:34.854
When you have a specific word, though,
to describe a problem like that,

00:10:34.878 --> 00:10:36.680
you know you really have a problem.

00:10:38.196 --> 00:10:41.863
And in the United Kingdom,
the [2016] Brexit vote ...

00:10:42.838 --> 00:10:46.326
you know, has divided
a nation even more so.

00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:51.109
And one critic of the breakup
called those who favor it --

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:52.982
I just love this phrase --

00:10:53.006 --> 00:10:55.971
"the frightened parochial
lizard brain of Britain."

00:10:56.417 --> 00:10:59.188
The frightened parochial
lizard brain of Britain.

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:00.362
That's personal.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.576
And it makes me miss "Downton Abbey"

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.947
and its patina of civility.

00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:11.180
But therein lies the third rule:

00:11:11.204 --> 00:11:13.538
don't mistake decorum for civility.

00:11:14.165 --> 00:11:17.982
Even if you have a dowager countess
as fabulous as Dame Maggie Smith.

00:11:18.006 --> 00:11:19.014
(Laughter)

00:11:19.038 --> 00:11:20.958
[Don't be defeatist.
It's so middle class.]

00:11:20.982 --> 00:11:22.955
So let me end with one last story.

00:11:23.609 --> 00:11:27.297
Not that long ago, I was at a bakery,
and they make these amazing scones.

00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:29.613
So, long line --
there are a lot of scones.

00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:31.733
And one by one,
the scones were disappearing

00:11:31.757 --> 00:11:34.590
until there was one woman
in between me and that last scone.

00:11:34.614 --> 00:11:35.764
(Laughter)

00:11:36.315 --> 00:11:39.057
Praise the Lord, she said,
"I'll have a croissant."

00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:40.315
(Laughter)

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:43.236
So when it became my turn, I said,
"I'll take that scone."

00:11:44.814 --> 00:11:46.346
The guy behind me --

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.862
I'd never turned around, never seen him --

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:50.499
he shouted, "That's my scone!

00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:53.132
I've been waiting in line 20 minutes."

00:11:53.156 --> 00:11:55.683
And I was like, "Who are you?

00:11:55.707 --> 00:11:58.752
I've been waiting in line 20 minutes,
and you're behind me."

00:11:58.776 --> 00:12:01.235
So, I grew up here in New York,

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:03.625
and went to high school
not that far from here.

00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:07.315
And I may seem, you know,
very civil here and so on,

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:12.961
but I can hip check anybody for a taxicab
in this room, on these streets.

00:12:12.985 --> 00:12:15.307
So I was surprised
when I said to this guy ...

00:12:16.398 --> 00:12:18.001
"Would you like half?"

00:12:18.025 --> 00:12:19.458
"Would you like half?"

00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:21.704
I didn't think about it, it just came out.

00:12:22.006 --> 00:12:25.077
And then, he was very puzzled,
and I could see his face change

00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:26.291
and he said to me,

00:12:26.315 --> 00:12:29.663
"Well, how about if I buy another pastry
and we'll share both of them?"

00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:33.202
And he did, and we did.

00:12:33.577 --> 00:12:34.977
And we sat and talked.

00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:37.213
We had nothing in common.

00:12:37.237 --> 00:12:38.618
(Laughter)

00:12:38.642 --> 00:12:42.868
We had nothing in common: nationality,
sexual orientation, occupation.

00:12:43.332 --> 00:12:47.705
But through this moment of kindness,
through this moment of connection,

00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:50.118
we developed a friendship,
we have stayed in touch.

00:12:50.142 --> 00:12:51.292
(Laughter)

00:12:51.316 --> 00:12:54.808
Although he was appalled to learn
that I'm called the Civilist after that.

00:12:54.832 --> 00:12:55.982
(Laughter)

00:12:56.474 --> 00:12:58.874
But I call this the joy of civility.

00:12:59.276 --> 00:13:00.442
The joy of civility.

00:13:00.466 --> 00:13:01.808
And it led me to wonder,

00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:05.037
what is the good we forgo,
not just the trouble we avoid,

00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:06.995
when we choose to be uncivil.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:11.137
And by good, I mean friendship,
I mean connection.

00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:13.224
I mean sharing 1000 calories.

00:13:14.336 --> 00:13:16.336
But I also mean it in a larger way.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.428
You know, as communities
and as a country and as a world.

00:13:20.233 --> 00:13:22.033
What are we missing out on?

00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:27.886
So, today, we are engaged in a great
civil war of ideas and identity.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.910
And we have no rules for them.

00:13:30.886 --> 00:13:33.153
You know, there are rules for war.

00:13:33.618 --> 00:13:35.317
Think about the Geneva Conventions.

00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:37.793
They ensure that every soldier
is treated humanely,

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:39.617
on and off the battlefield.

00:13:41.372 --> 00:13:44.410
So, frankly, I think we need
a Geneva Convention of civility,

00:13:44.434 --> 00:13:47.172
to set the rules for discourse
for the parameters of that.

00:13:47.776 --> 00:13:52.172
To help us become better citizens
of our communities and of our countries.

00:13:53.395 --> 00:13:55.268
And if I have anything to say about it,

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:59.069
I would base those rules
on the original definition of civility,

00:13:59.093 --> 00:14:01.212
from the Latin and from the French.

00:14:01.236 --> 00:14:02.982
Civility:

00:14:03.006 --> 00:14:06.913
citizens willing to give of themselves
for the greater good.

00:14:07.526 --> 00:14:09.193
For the good of the city.

00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:12.938
So I think civility, with that
understanding, is not a dirty word.

00:14:13.534 --> 00:14:18.858
And I hope the civilist will not become,
or will not stay, obsolete.

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:20.825
Thank you.

00:14:20.849 --> 00:14:25.833
(Applause)
