00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.770
Hi I'm Geoff Donaker. I live here in the Bay

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.626
Area, California Bay area and I have red-green color blindness.

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:09.077
&gt;&gt; Okay, so red-green color blindness, we, you know, just sort of

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:11.250
heard about that for the first time. And in the course and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.838
we're learning a bit more about the inheritance patterns. What is red

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:16.890
green color blindness? What does it mean to be red green color blind?

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.180
&gt;&gt; Well to me what it means is that I often mix

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.020
up colors that have red in them. And so in particular I

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.810
mix up reds and browns and sometimes browns and greens because I'm not

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.740
seeing the red correctly in those. Sometimes it can even show up in the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.060
form of blues and purples. I'm sort of seeing them all at about

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.590
the same. And in fact you know they may look different to other people.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.655
&gt;&gt; So, would it be accurate in saying. Just, they kind of

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:46.610
look like darker colors or is it something about the shade, maybe?

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.790
&gt;&gt; I'm not really sure. I think that the way

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.870
to think about it you know, for me is that sometimes

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260
what you may be seeing as, as the red

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.540
in a particular orange for instance. To me I'm

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.890
not seeing the red the same way you are.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.370
because I'm seeing it maybe like a dark yellow. and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.710
so, I still, certainly see the world in a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.480
vibrant colorful way and it's so like black and white

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.690
or anything like that. I just see it differently

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.920
than everybody else who doesn't see it in red-green color.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.200
&gt;&gt; It's such a great like literal and

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.000
metaphorical statement. I think a lot of people do

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.930
go through life thinking you know the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.640
assumption, this is the color vision, this is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.390
the vision I have. But not everybody

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.670
literally sees the world in the same spectrum.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.510
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.580
&gt;&gt; what when did you first eh, know that you had red green color blindness?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.740
&gt;&gt; You know I don't really remember. It was when

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.680
I was a really young child, my uncle had been red

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.560
green colorblind. And then actually my mom's uncle as well

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.100
so I think I inherited it from her side. And so

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.860
when I was a little kid she recognized that I might be color

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.820
blind or have this propensity. And so she had me tested at you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.260
know, one of the eye doctors with looking at the, the those little

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.114
bubble charts with colors that you may remember having taken at some point.

00:01:53.114 --> 00:01:55.420
&gt;&gt; Sure and for anybody who may not be familiar with

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.440
those. What, can, can you describe that bubble chart a little more?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.220
&gt;&gt; Sure it's, a basically a lot of little dots and those dots typically show

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.000
some sort of a picture or character or

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.940
letter. that a red green colored blind person

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.090
may not be able to pick out the particular

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.133
picture or letter that everybody else. You know, what

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.480
it pops out. So for instance, back to my

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.490
yellow orange analogy. you know you may have two

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.910
different shades of orange in there that to you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.430
look really obviously different and to me look actually

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.400
about the same. So I'm not seeing that letter

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.570
that's popping out of the picture and you are.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.070
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.610
&gt;&gt; There are actually other versions that go the other way.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.120
Where you know it looks really stark to the red green

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.400
color blind person. And to the not red green color

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.870
blind person it actually looks you know, camouflage. and so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.660
those tests you know make it pretty easy for the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660
eye doctor to pick out whose color blind and whose not.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.460
&gt;&gt; So you were very young when, when

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.490
you, your I guess your mother found this out.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.480
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.790
&gt;&gt; And did it I mean was it a? Did it cause any issue? I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.260
mean it was like okay, we knew this was a possibility and now what kind of,

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.720
if anything, was there to do at that point?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.990
&gt;&gt; Not really much. you know, as I say her brother

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.730
and uncle had had it and so she was sort of

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.560
aware of it. And you know it, it's useful to know

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.000
that you see the world in different colors than everybody else.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
&gt;&gt;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.164
[LAUGH]

00:03:12.164 --> 00:03:15.880
&gt;&gt; Just so you can be prepared and obviously that's not that I'm

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.240
just aware of today, too. So that I don't say, you know, this is

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.420
definitely purple to people if they if I realize, I go oh my gosh

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.870
it might actually be blue and you know others are saying it is blue.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.270
&gt;&gt; Nice, it does bring that interesting perspective though, that, the fact

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.370
that you put it in that context. You know, you don't want to speak

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.730
with certainty that this is this color because you're like it may not

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.720
be right. But what is quote unquote right is just what the majority

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.755
of other people see. I mean, you could argue

00:03:39.755 --> 00:03:43.170
that if more people had solved the spectrum as

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.790
a red-green color blind person the way we describe

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.780
that, you know. Then that would be purple I guess.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.923
&gt;&gt; Agreed, agreed.

00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:50.923
&gt;&gt;

00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:50.800
[LAUGH]

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.680
so as you've grown up, and even know as an

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.000
adult. How does breaking color blindness breaking affects your daily

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.710
life? Do you have, what kind of special, if anything

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.784
sort of interactions you have to go through to accommodate?

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:07.910
&gt;&gt; You know not much when I close

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.550
shop, you know, online certainly helps these day because

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.660
the colors are all labelled. you know when

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.850
I go clothes shopping in a store. I'll often

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.930
ask the retail person just a sanity check. What color is this? If it's blue I'm

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.060
generally pretty sure I'm okay. Or black or

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.400
things like that. but if I'm getting something that's

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.350
in the green spectrum. You know I'll want

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.130
a sanity check that it's what I think it

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.760
is and it's not some version of orange.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.430
Or something that people are going to comment on.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.780
&gt;&gt; So that's one way, you know, another way is just

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.870
periodically things that look camouflaged to me won't be camouflaged to

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.050
other people. So for instance, you know, my kids the other day were playing with

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.070
an orange ball in the yard. And to me when they it dropped in the grass

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.729
it was almost camouflaged in the grass. And they new, they thought that was the

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.191
funniest thing in the world, because to them

00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:54.955
it's orange just totally popping off the lawn.

00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:56.480
&gt;&gt; Right, right. So, you'd actually have to

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.980
sort of keep track of where it is to.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.880
&gt;&gt; A little bit. You know, again, if it's

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.548
right by me, of course, I could see it, but

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:03.574
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:04.910
&gt;&gt; I'm going to back up a little bit and talk

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.867
about generalities. I mean, just as you as Jeff Donaker,

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.868
what are the what are your kind of hobbies? What

00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:14.420
kind of things do you do for fun in general?

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.140
&gt;&gt; Well, I've got two young kids who are pretty into sports at this point.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:18.580
And you know certainly helping them with

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.310
school and their sports they like to play

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.410
baseball and soccer. And just generally run

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.070
around like little boys do. So other than

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.290
work, what I tend to with my spare time is kind of hang out with my family.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.850
And run around playing sports with them and doing things like that.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've heard that kids can be

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.400
a full-time job but a full-time play job too.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.100
&gt;&gt; Indeed, it's a little of both. A labor of love.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.710
&gt;&gt; were you did you have to get your your, you said you have two sons?

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.840
&gt;&gt; Did you ,were you worried

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.450
about having, them having red-green color blindness

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.940
too, at all? We didn't really think about it. I had always assumed based

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.150
on our family history that had come through my mom's side of the family. And, as

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.520
a result given my wife doesn't have any

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.040
history of color blindness on her side of the

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.240
family. We sort of assumed that our kids

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.190
weren't, would not be colorblind. And then they haven't

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.270
been. they haven't you know indicated any color

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.940
blindness and so we haven't bothered to follow up.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.910
&gt;&gt; Sure, you know we've talked about a lot of

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.680
other traits in our course like lactose intolerance. Some some traits

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.360
that are just sort of, you know, every day

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.710
but people may interact with differently. Some people assume, you

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.940
know everyone is may be lactose tolerant or that

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.620
everyone can see you know all colors the way they

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.790
do in certain ways. how have, do people in

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.030
general, friends, strangers respond to anybody, news of someone being.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.910
Hey guys can you wait a second I'm not sure

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.795
about this. How do people respond to this particular trait

00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.262
of red-green color blindness.

00:06:48.262 --> 00:06:51.052
&gt;&gt; I would say that, you know, probably about half

00:06:51.052 --> 00:06:54.400
of people that I interact with already know somebody closely who

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.290
is red-green colorblind. So it's no news to them and they'll

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.790
just say, oh yeah, my brother is also or something of

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.160
that nature. And then the other half, it's like a

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.955
great party trick. So the first time they hear that you're

00:07:04.955 --> 00:07:07.070
red-green color blind, what they want to do is walk around the

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.015
room going, what color's this? What color's this? What color's this?

00:07:10.015 --> 00:07:10.090
[LAUGH].

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.545
You know which is fun for about 30 seconds

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:13.055
[LAUGH].

00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.330
Then you're kind of ready to move on

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.950
but that's been my general. Experience over the years.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.305
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can imagine that's good for

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:19.670
[LAUGH]

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.980
like the first two times.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.110
&gt;&gt;

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.390
[LAUGH]

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.170
&gt;&gt; You actually, one thing that occurred to me in terms of day-to-day life

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.430
is, sometimes LCD projectors and things of

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.340
that nature. The reds in those don't show

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.320
up very well. And so that's kind of another way in, you know, kind of

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.490
modern life, where sometimes. Things that are

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.611
real obvious to the other people in the

00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:36.171
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:37.383
kind of like, well, I don't see that

00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:39.069
at all because of the particular hues that were

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:39.628
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:39.628 --> 00:07:42.740
&gt;&gt; It's interesting you say that, I am from a research

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.880
science background. And there's a particular kind of experiment for lack

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.860
of a better word, called a microarray that you can do.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.890
And when you get the results back, they color code all

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:56.030
of the results and it's a spectrum from red to green

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.900
and yellow. It goes from like red to yellow to black

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.760
to yellow to green. And it's supposed to give you, it's

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.820
essentially a heat map and of some of sorts. And there was

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.410
eventually, finally you know, people spoke up who

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:08.860
were regular color blind. And said, guys change

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.400
we please change this to like blue yellow so that we can look at the data too?

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. If you're ever doing those kind

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.320
of charts, if you can make the red blue or the

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.840
green blue or something. Like that, just pick one of

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.840
them so it doesn't go from green to yellow to red.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.150
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Have you ever not been able to participate

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.940
in something or anything because of the color blindness or anything

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.044
like that. Or have you pretty much always been able to find some work

00:08:33.044 --> 00:08:36.210
around if it was an issue, you could you know it was always doable?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.549
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean as a general statement it's

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:41.070
really never been a big deal. I certainly remember

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.510
a couple times as a kid where I felt a little left out or picked on during art

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:48.070
projects at school. Where you know, inevitably I'd pick

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.590
the wrong color. You were supposed to do something

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.640
that was brown and I picked green or something

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.130
of that nature and the other kids would tease me.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.660
You know I really remember maybe two

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.720
or three instances. But you certainly work around

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.860
it and somebody points you to the right color and you keep moving. So never been

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.610
a big deal by any means but yeah, there's certainly a little bit of that. Like

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:06.780
you and me we're a little bit different

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.740
from the way everybody else is seeing it.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.108
&gt;&gt; Sure. in that same vein, I mean, it

00:09:11.108 --> 00:09:13.500
seems like a follow-up question that I've asked lots

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.500
of different people about their various traits. Would you

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.900
want to change this about yourself or would you not?

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.090
you know, that's an interesting questions. I think now in my life, no, I

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.240
don't think I'd bother. I guess if I had it all to do over in

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.150
the spirit of what you're, you guys are talking about out. Sure, yeah, I'd

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.860
probably rather see the world in the

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.100
same color hues and that everybody else does.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.311
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:39.950
&gt;&gt; Just, you know, kind of one more thing. Makes things a little bit easier.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:45.720
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Are there any advantages to seeing colors differently?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.300
&gt;&gt; yeah, the main one

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.580
at this point is really the party trick that we talked about.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:50.880
&gt;&gt; [laughs]

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.460
&gt;&gt; but.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.370
&gt;&gt; Making, making friends quickly.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:59.960
&gt;&gt; Right, right. But ostensibly in and earlier time. because

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:05.350
there are some forms of camouflage that look like camouflage to, you know, the

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.140
normal folk but don't to me, extensively during World War II. And

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.400
kind of the previous era, red-green color blind people could be pilots because

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.040
they could actually spot the camouflage from, you know, the army

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.410
troops much more easily than you know a typical person's eyesight

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.180
could. So that's a legend that I've heard in the years.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.590
never been relevant in my life. You know I guess another

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:29.690
funny way in which it shows up for me is things

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.040
like it's very easy for me to take the Christmas tree

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.400
lights on and off the tree every year. Because the wires

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.620
actually really pop out for me and to everybody else ostensibly

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.085
they're totally blended in with the tree.

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:42.569
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, it's totally true, I normally have trouble

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:45.640
unlike searching the branch trying to like just yank and pull.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:46.626
&gt;&gt; Happy to come over to your place.

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:47.626
&gt;&gt;

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:46.680
[LAUGH].

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.340
I appreciate the offer I might take you up on that.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.190
so we will finish up here. I want to ask you one

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:57.840
more question, if like if someone is watching this. And you

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.820
know, there are like oh, you know, I wonder if I

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.130
am color blind. Or maybe someone's recently found out they are,

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.800
someone they know is. What advice would you give to somebody

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.686
who may have recently find out that, you know, they are

00:11:08.686 --> 00:11:10.763
red green color blind? And of course there are other kinds

00:11:10.763 --> 00:11:13.570
of color blindness too. what advice would you give to them?

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:14.070
&gt;&gt;

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.610
you know, I guess, first point would simply be,

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.230
it's not that big a deal. So you know

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.820
roll with it and enjoy the fact that you're

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.010
seeing the world in a slightly different color hue

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.360
than everybody else is. and then the other one

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.530
would be yeah, when your picking clothes. Ask a

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.570
friend who there who knows or a sales associate

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.576
at the store just so you know what you're buying.

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:39.576
&gt;&gt;

00:11:38.576 --> 00:11:38.891
[LAUGH]

00:11:38.891 --> 00:11:41.390
Sure well, thanks Geoff for joining us.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.310
&gt;&gt; Thanks Mat and good luck to everybody out there
