00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.560
We've all heard the phrase, "get your creative
juices flowing."

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.880
Weird as it sounds, there may be some truth
to the term, "creative juices..."

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.100
which I will stop saying right now,
because it feels weird to say.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.740
Meet BDNF, also known as 
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.700
BDNF isn’t a synthetic creativity juice you
can just grab at Costco.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.140
The role of BDNF is stimulating, maintaining,
and supporting neuronal growth

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.860
in your nervous system, helping make
more connections in your brain.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.240
Those increased synaptic connections can help
you get out of that creative rut.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.880
And how is it released? Exercise!

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.680
And I’m not talking Crossfit, Zumba, or
Milly rocking on every block.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.740
Lighter exercise like walking 
can help you get some BDNF in your system.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.500
BDNF is integral to processes of learning
and memory,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.660
and if you need more proof that it's important, 
there's significant evidence that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.500
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and 
Huntington’s Disease patients

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.540
have less BDNF in their brains.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.020
So getting those levels up early in life could help 
stave off those neurodegenerative diseases.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.700
Write a little, walk a little.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.800
If you get blocked, take a walk.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.580
If the juices ain’t flowing, 
get up and get going.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.720
Honestly, what am I doing here?

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.460
I should be writing science mixtapes 
and selling them in Times Square.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.160
There’s so much scrutiny from so many people
into our lives, increased exponentially by social media,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.160
that it could be doing damage to our mental health,
increasing psychosocial stress.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.100
All of that in turn affects our depression
and anxiety.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.259
But, that damage isn’t irreparable.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.840
Changing small things about your mindset and
routine can affect you on a neurological level,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.180
a.k.a. “neuroplasticity.”

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.600
Neuroplasticity is exactly what it sounds
like: neuro, “brain” and plasticity, “flexible.”

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.020
In this case, it means that our brains have
the ability to change and adapt

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.340
in response to our environment.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.520
We can help alleviate these symptoms of depression,
anxiety, and psychosocial stress

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.760
by changing small things in our routine.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.980
It doesn’t have to be a reboot of your
entire life - #NewYearNewMe;

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.920
it could be a small change that makes things better...

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.600
#NewYearSameMeButILikeChangedSomeStuff...?

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.520
That’s clunky, we gotta fix that in post.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.500
Hop off social media for a while. 
Take a trip.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.940
Change your work environment.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.320
Cut that messy friend who talks all kinds
of trash out of your life,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.660
or stop being that friend.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.000
All of these things will not only positively
affect your physical health,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
like your heart and immune functions, 
but also your psychological health.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.360
Finally, I cannot STRESS this enough:

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.500
GO TO SLEEP.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.450
If you gotta cut this video off now and go
to sleep immediately, do it.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.640
I’ll be here when you wake up.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.480
Welcome back!

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.280
I realize that there’s extenuating circumstances
to getting enough sleep:

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.760
work and family stuff, being a college student trying to survive in a capitalist society, et cetera.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.740
But important things happen in your brain
when you’re asleep.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.320
First, cerebrospinal fluid is cleaning toxins
out of your brain while you sleep.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920
The more time asleep, the more thorough that
cleaning can be.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.900
Second, it preserves and encodes our memories
in our hippocampus,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.540
in turn helping us keep track of our day, 
the next day’s agenda, and who owes us money

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.940
(Steve, I know you saw the Venmo charge, so text me back).

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.180
Third, it solidifies new information
we’ve learned over the last day.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.000
This especially goes out to all my people still
in school – you’ve learned so much information

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.820
in your last day of classes; just go to sleep
to help remember it,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.140
stop playing FIFA, Fortnite, and 2K all night
(yeah, I was you once, I know what you’re doing).

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.800
These are small tips that have science to
back them up.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.500
Try all of these for a month and track your
progress.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.820
Did you finish a project?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.220
Did you write that supahotfiyah science mixtape
that went double platinum, no features?

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.180
If so, keep at it, and let’s make #NewYearSameMeButALittleBitBetterThanBefore

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.080
trend.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.540
One mechanism to deal with stress that I didn’t
mention is mindful meditation, which, if you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.820
which, if you have a friend who doesn't shut up in line
at brunch, you've probably heard about.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.900
But is there ANY scientific truth to that?

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.280

out and while you’re at it,
