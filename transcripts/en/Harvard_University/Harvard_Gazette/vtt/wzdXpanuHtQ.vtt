I got to Harvard and heard about female identifying
students auditioning for the group as a form

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.330
of protest so I decided to do that just to
show them that they had this incredible range

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.450
of talent that they were totally ignoring.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.270
They announced that they were going to let
women on cast and I remember sitting there

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.760
and just, my jaw dropping and being so excited.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.320
I feel so lucky and so grateful to be one
of those first women, to be the first ever

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.210
black woman, it's so cool to be part of literally
the oldest theatrical group in the country

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.450
and to be part of a show that has a huge legacy.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.030
To have everyone be so excited that we're
here, and wanting to watch us perform and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.671
wanting to help us out and everything, has
been amazing and I think we're all so, we

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.120
feel incredibly grateful that we get to be
a part of it.
