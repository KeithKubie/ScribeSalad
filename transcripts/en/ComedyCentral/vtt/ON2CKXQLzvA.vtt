00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.100
If you guys were together for
a year and you haven't said it.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.120
Break up. You're right.
Like break up. That's crazy.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.350
Yeah, I was telling a story.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.620
Like, I was with a guy
for a year

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.890
and I was just waiting
for him to say "I love you."

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.810
I knew he did by his actions.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.220
Like, the way he high
fived me after sex but-

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.950
Chris Redd is here
everyone from SNL

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.320
and the movie "Pop Star"

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.090
which is my favorite comedy
movie in the past decade,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.410
I would say.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.930
He had such a fucking funny
stand-up.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.160
And yeah.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.470
Jesus Christ. That's dope.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.530
Well, Chris Redd,
you're killing it on SNL.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.740
Yeah, dude.
Hey, man.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.960
Kanye. Oh my God.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.500
Just 'cause your on SNL doesn't
mean you're gonna kill it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.030
We've seen so many times
people come and go

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.890
and I remember
when you got it.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.540
I was just like
"I hope he makes a splash."

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.890
And you certainly have.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.770
I mean, you are going to have
such longevity on that show

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.610
if you want it
and in your career.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.610
You've always been talented

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.290
but it's just so nice
to see people acknowledging it.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.420
What is it like
being over there?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.350
Are you still frightened every
time you walk in the building?

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.560
Nah.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.840
I mean, it had to started
that way.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.380
Were you so intimidated?

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.940
I wasn't really intimidated
by Lorne or the show.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.100
It's just, I learned how much
anxiety I actually have,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.990
which is crazy 'cause there's
so much pressure to it.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.790
Then there's like the people
that get to have opinions

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.080
about your work all the time
.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.340
Yeah.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.000
And I wasn't really used to that
but I'm very curious to know-

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.370
Do you mean
Twitter or producers?

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.650
Yeah, Every.
Internet, everything.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.900
Okay.
Do you read that shit?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.190
Yeah.
Dude.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.420
I'm an insane person, Bro.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.640
I do too. It's alright.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.650
Nah, I tried.
I know it's not good for me.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.120
You're [crosstalk]
so much.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.350
I'm surprised you have time
to even see it.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.460
First of all, if you're on
the show a lot to people.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740
It's only three sketches.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.010
Right.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.140
So, the rest of the time
I'm sitting there watching

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.000
the show with everybody else
and I'm just on Twitter

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.530
seeing what's hit
and seeing what's not.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.760
Right. Interesting.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.460
It's kind of like
being on stage.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.580
You hear those laughs,
like I know this joke's working.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.470
That's how it feels 'cause
every Saturday you're trending

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.330
unless there's somebody
on there that no one knows.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.110
Then you're and the trend's
after the fact which is weird.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.880
But you can see exactly
how things are hitting,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.760
like immediately.
So, I'm all interested in that.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.670
Do you like that or are you
like this is bad for me?

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.970
I kinda like it
and I kinda hate it.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.180
Yeah.
I know it's bad.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.430
Yeah.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.370
But, I kinda like it
when it's going well.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.030
It's like overwhelmingly
positive though, right?

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.250
Oh, yeah.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.080
'Cause you're killing it
on there.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.120
Yeah, but it's like
everything else.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.350
I focus on the one guy.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.610
Of course.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.810
The one egg thing.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.540
Flappyballsack72.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.460
Like, this mother
fucking egg avatar.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.840
I let it go though.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.840
I was in a bad place
when I made that account.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.380
Okay?
I was a little jealous.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.390
I feel like that show's
never acknowledged me

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.380
or asked me
to audition and-

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.170
I think it's bullshit.
I think it's bullshit.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.870
I bring you up all the time.

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.350
Your Kanye was fantastic and
that wasn't an easy role to do.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.090
How did you prepare for that?

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.000
Well, they told me I was gonna
do it on Friday.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.210
Friday morning.

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.460
That's great 'cause it's like,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.010
I only have this amount of time,
I can't over think it.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.290
Yeah.
What do you do?

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.520
When you do shit like that
it works out better.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.730
Do you start googling?

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.980
Do you just start
watching videos?

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.680
Well, I'm like a huge Kanye fan.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.750
I have this very complicated
feeling about Kanye now,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.450
or have for
a very long time.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.040
So, I was just like
listening to the music,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.480
which is what
I was already doing,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.430
and watching that meeting
a bunch,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.090
and kind of seeing
where his points were

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.850
and how he felt, his intensity
and just trying to match

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.749
the things that were fun
for me to do.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.530
I just had to watch it
over and over again

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.860
to the point where I was like

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.670
"he's not wrong
about everything."

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.940
Yeah.
Right. Right. Right.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.220
Right.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.310
Oh, so you were able
to become him

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.620
when you were able
to empathize with him

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.380
and see his perspective
so it wasn't like

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.910
"let me just find a way
to ridicule

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.170
this person
with my impression

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.440
but let me try to be him
and see where he's coming

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.980
from and attack
that impression from that?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.980
Yeah. 100 percent.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.240
I have too much empathy
for everything.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.320
That's just kinda like a thing
I get from my grandma and my ma.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.620
They pass that shit down,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.160
so I care about things
that are really weird.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.810
But, yeah.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.730
For me, he's a rich guy
that became this headline guy.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.410
He wants to bring
the world together.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.190
He's just doing it wrong.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.170
And doing it the way
a lot of us don't agree with

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.190
but everything
he's saying wasn't crazy like

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.010
Stop, Stop and Frisk
is like a thing.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.260
Prison reform.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.480
He's always been that way.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.210
He's been more informed
in how to do it.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.720
Now, he's just.
Yeah.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.930
You can't say "I'm on the side
of the guy who has kids in cages

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.060
but this is fun
and we should do this."

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.900
It just feels like he wants
to be subversive to,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.130
I don't know. He wants to
make headlines with stuff.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.500
Yeah, he wants to do that.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.190
It's like ego with good ideas
and no reading.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.520
And bipolar disorder
that's not being

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.319
medically treated at the time.
He's not taking his meds.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.700
He's not on his medication
but he also lies a little bit

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.490
so you don't know exactly
what he has, what he doesn't.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.820
Let me ask you about

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.520
when you're actually working
on an impression,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.660
was there a nuance
in his voice or a way

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.300
he said a certain word
where you're like

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.790
"I'm definitely gonna say
that word

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.840
because I can really nail that?"

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.130
Yeah, he has this thing where
he tries to hide his Chicago

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.390
but then it comes out
when he gets excited.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.640
So, that growl like "You know."

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.940
That very guttural thing.
He tries to hide it

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.240
'cause he's talking
to white people.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.650
So, he's trying to not hide it
but then it comes out anyways.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.830
So, it was like watching two
people fight in the same throat.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.880
Was there a line you
especially loved

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.580
saying because you were like,

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.500
'cause sometimes when I'm doing
an impression

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.290
there's a moment where I really
feel like I'm them.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.390
I can only hold onto it
for a a second sometimes

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.970
and it frustrates me
and it's hard to maintain it.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.670
How did you maintain it?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.060
I'm still working on it.
I've done it.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.820
The impression is maybe
two days old.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.520
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.169
Like when he says stuff
like "time."

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.700
Those things I can dive
into real well.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.670
I like playing with that and
just anytime he gets too hype.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.460
That's the energy he puts onto
all of his albums.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.820
Song, Kanye can do even better
than I can do.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.580
You know what's fun to say
as him is

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.430
"Hurry up
with my damn croissant."

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.800
Hurry up with my damn croissant.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.550
I love it.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.640
I wanna make a song as him next
to help me tone that shit more.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.930
What album were you
listening to to get-

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.490
Oh man, I was listening
to old Kanye.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.770
Yes!

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.780
Which I listen
to most of the time.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.220
Dark Twisted Fantasy
is just so perfect.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.120
It's the perfect album.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.360
Amazing. Front to back.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.030
I think it started the Kanye
that we see,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.240
though 'cause he put all
of his issues on that record

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.560
and people praised it.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.160
So, then he's like
"No, people praise my crazy."

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.020
And that's just like,
I don't know.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.490
We could talk about
ye all day.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.330
Yeah.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.760
I do think once he started
putting his weird thoughts

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.660
on record, new slaves
and all that shit like yesus,

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.730
we started just like "yeah,
we like you and your crazy."

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.200
He's like oh well,
I'm gonna be crazy

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.600
with something else
that you don't agree with.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.820
Did you like yesus?
I love yesus.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.300
I thought it was dope. I thought
it was a mental breakdown.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.740
I think it's great.
I think it divided people.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.560
That was the first
dividing line. Yeah.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.300
I thought it was a breakdown
over Beats

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.300
but I thought
it was a genius.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.910
You know what came up in shuffle
for me

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:38.650
yesterday at the best time?

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.250
I was working out
and it was Kanye's workout plan?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.010
That song is so fun!

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.710
When those strings come in.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.530
Oh, I love it so much.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.030
Dude, Jesus walks
is one of my favorite.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.840
Oh my God.
It just makes you wanna "Yeah."

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.620
It was like right around
the time where hip hop was like

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.840
"don't talk about Jesus and God
when you're doing hip hop."

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.090
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yep.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.050
And then Kanye was like
"I'm gonna do it."

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.620
But he's been the same guy
the whole time.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.840
You know what I mean?

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.790
Like don't press the red button
and he presses the red button?

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.040
Exactly. He's just now choosing
the one side

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.960
that's pissing people off.
But that's always been him.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.250
Yeah.
Yep.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.090
You just wish he just read
a book of some kind.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.890
No honestly, though.
It's not even-

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.180
What book would you rec,

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.010
if you could come up
with Kanye's-

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.999
"One Fish, Two Fish,
Red Fish, Blue Fish."

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.030
Red Fish, Blue Fish.
That's the Democratic party

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.130
and the Republican party
if you just.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.090
Any book.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.790
Any book by any author.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.600
So, what has been the most
unexpected part of

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.930
working at SNL for you?

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.860
You walk in, we would
all walk into SNL with

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.890
"I think I know what this is
gonna be, I've read the books,

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.240
I've heard the interviews",

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.850
what was the most
unexpected thing for you?

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.080
The most unexpected
was how cool Lorne is.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.260
He's like an Old G.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.810
I'm used to old school,
like gangsta types

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.370
and he's very much that.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.320
He's very nice dude and there's
a lot of other things that,

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:14.430
he's just knows there's
so many stories

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.030
about him that he's like,
"you can't stop them all."

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.310
That's a great Lorne.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.640
Everybody has their
good version of Lorne.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.880
I thought I was gonna
get fired so much.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.380
I realized that wasn't like,
you're not gonna get as fired

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.970
as much as you think you are.
But, also you could.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.280
But, also.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.980
Yeah, you definitely could.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.020
You know what I saw?

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:42.950
Did you see Lorne on Norm
MacDonald's show?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.270
Oh, I haven't seen that yet. No.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.990
I haven't seen that yet.
I really recommend watching it

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.130
because I've always thought
of him as someone to fear

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.870
and I'm just like this guys
seems mean for no reason

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.630
and just like stuck up.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.390
There's never been a part of me
that's like

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.230
"I can't wait to meet
Lorne Michael some day.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.010
He just seems like frightening."

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.560
But, he is so sweet
and funny and soft.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.820
Yeah, he's so cool.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.230
He was like that on WTF, too.
He was Maron's podcast.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.680
I was like oh,
it's not what I thought.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.970
It's not what you think.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.990
He's so dope. He's a dope dude

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.950
and he runs a super crazy
powerful business

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.910
which is dope just to watch
and be a part of, I guess.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.970
And the crowd, the stage.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.730
I thought it was
gonna be a lot bigger

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.260
and a lot more intimidating
and it's not.

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.700
When I've been to SNL, the one
time I went when Amy hosted,

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.360
it felt like going to see
my friend

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.040
in a play at the high school.
That's what it felt like again.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.680
It gave me that same like
"Oh my God,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.760
I can't believe my friend is",
but it's like watching a play.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.020
It definitely is.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.300
It's so fun.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.540
That's so cool.
It's so crazy.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.960
Now, the cold open
was nerve racking like crazy

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.270
'cause I knew
what it meant to the show

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.510
and I'm playing along side

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.880
Alec who I know
is gonna kill it.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.130
Right in front of me
and I'm like

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.730
Oh, man.
So, I was just hoping,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.600
and nothing
felt good until live.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.780
Live just start to felt alright

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.579
'cause I knew
where the laughs were.

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:02.900
Live was like oh, okay.
I feel, I feel better.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.390
Yeah.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.700
I feel like you've reached
this point now where,

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.660
as comedians and as artists
we always just think

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.760
we're tricking everyone
to thinking we're talented

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.530
and people are like
we've tricked the system.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.490
I shouldn't be doing
this right now.

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.010
But when you get on SNL,
they make so many good decisions

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.530
and they have a track record
of making great decisions.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.760
Do you at that point go,
"Okay, I am good?"

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.060
Yeah.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.150
Like this is validating enough
to be like

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.530
I should be here right now.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.960
I'm gonna come out
and nail this.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.410
Does it give you that sense
[crosstalk].

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.880
Yeah, that imposter syndrome
has started

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.120
to slip away a little bit.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.360
Good!

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.750
'Cause at first it was very much
like I'm a student of the game

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.200
and I'm just learning
how to move in this.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.800
You know what I mean?
Now,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.649
I'm just gonna try to figure
what I want my legacy to be,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.010
just try to up
myself every time.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.650
And come in here
and just try to kill it

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.860
and bring what I bring
to the show.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.130
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:56.300
I feel way more comfortable.
This second year is like breeze.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.140
Anybody coming into
the show, man.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.320
Just get through the first year.
You're straight.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.830
I mean, I'm not gonna say
you're straight.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.040
Shit, there has been hard years.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.360
I've seen people
have hard years.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.610
You know?
Yeah.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.840
And they tell me all the time

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.690
"you're here
for some good times."

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.570
Right. Right.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.290
I wasn't there when Trump
was there.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.110
There's a lot of things
that happened.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.150
The show could go
any way any time,

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.660
which is something I like
about it.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.950
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.610
Yeah. Well,
the imposter syndrome thing

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.920
that I always go back to,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.710
a therapist once said to me,
she was like

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.380
"who do you think you are
that you're tricking everyone?

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.980
Do you think that these people
are stupid?"

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.790
When you're on SNL, you're
dealing with Lorne Michaels.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.770
He's made the smartest
comedy decisions.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.470
Right.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.800
If you were able to trick him
and weasel your way on the sh,

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.920
you know.
If Lorne Michael's picks you,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.520
it's validating of "okay,
I am talented."

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.720
Yeah.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.960
And I'm glad you got that
because you are.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.120
Thank you so much.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.320
It's so exciting to see you
become famous and dress better.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.520
You just look richer.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.710
Yo, dressing better
is like so important.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.770
You look rich now.
You walk into a club

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.800
and I'm like
"Chris Redd's rich."

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.500
Or at least successful.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.650
I was just wearing the same
clothes for so long,

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.770
people aren't used
to seeing me do shit.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.060
I know. I can't wait.
My friend gave me this shirt.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.530
It's true.
No, I didn't know you that well.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.090
But, you just know
when someone's on SNL.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.830
One thing about the show.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.490
It's like a fashion show
for some of us.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:16.700
Oh, yeah.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.940
I want to be the flies
at all times.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:22.110
What? And Chase always flies.
Sam J is always flies.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.780
Get Rich dude,
one of the writers always flies.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.980
So, we just kinda like,

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.530
we're always coming in
with new shit, new shoes

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:28.550
and she's like
"look what I got."

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:32.130
It's one thing like people
just assume you're a Democrat

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.990
because you're on the show,
which is a very weird thing

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.180
'cause I'm like I'm not
in any political games.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.920
I don't really care that much.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.120
I vote for who makes
sense to me.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.600
But, people just put you in like

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.990
"oh, you're this
or you're that."

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.930
Everybody on the show
is not one or the other

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.390
but a lot of the write
makes it seems like.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.720
I'm like a lot of things

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.050
I write aren't even
political in the show.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.300
I'm writing
socially political stuff.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.090
It has nothing to do with
the shit you guys talk about.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.840
But, they put you in that box
which is very weird

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.820
'cause they feel like
they're in a box.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:02.540
So, everybody is in a box,
putting other people in boxes

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.330
and there's just a bunch
of boxes running around.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.770
Everybody gets so intense
and serious about SNL

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.070
and they criticize it like
I give a fuck.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.280
Right. Right.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.520
We ain't been funny in 45 years.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.740
Oh, that!

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.970
Well you don't have
the real picture, sir.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.450
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I can't stand that.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:17.940
They've been saying
that since year one.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.140
Yeah, dog.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.500
It was funny last year.
That's been funny since '75.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.730
Yeah.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:23.950
People are the worst

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.830
but you want people talking
about the show in any way.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.070
Right.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:28.320
I mean, that's what
keeps it alive.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.460
We gotta go to break but
I can't wait to spend another,

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.830
will you stick around?

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.580
I'm chillin. I'm chillin, man.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.070
Okay, I can't wait. Thank you.
Chris Redd is here, everyone.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.250
We are back in studio
right now with

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.440
That Thakkar, Ian Fidance,
and Chris Redd from SNL.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.880
Chris, so excited
to have you in.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.250
So excited to be here.
I love me some Nikki Glaser.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.990
Oh my God, I love me
some Chris Redd.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.470
We just become friends I would
say right before you got SNL.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.690
Yeah, dog.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.530
I kind of like became buds
with you

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:00.780
Yeah, I think it was in L.A.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.020
and then you were gone.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:03.560
We were gonna go to dinner
in L.A. together

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.390
I know, dude.
and you're like "I'm moving."

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.610
Yeah, it was crazy.
We had planned to go to lunch

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:12.640
and then I had to move quick
and couldn't say why.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.320
So, I just had to dip
and I was like

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.640
"I feel like an asshole

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.989
'cause I had so many
different plans that week.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.300
I had finally
started liking L.A.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.170
I finally starting
finding friend groups

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.940
I really like to fuck with
and then I had to just leave.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.360
And then I couldn't say
nothing for a week.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.800
So, what'd you tell people?

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.260
Dog, I just didn't.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.090
Well, I'm not a great
text backer anyway,

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:37.380
several people will say that.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.590
Oh, really?

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.210
Yeah. I mean, no.
I answer you all the time.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.470
Yeah, you're pretty good
with me.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.940
Yeah but I'm generally
not great at it.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.030
So, for some people
I could just not say anything

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.830
and then once the news
came out they're like

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.440
"oh, I get it."
And I'm like yeah.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.000
Some people who I,
comics get like an in with me

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.130
'cause it's usually something
I'm dealing with right away.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.520
I'm gonna see you out

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.120
so I'm gonna definitely hit you
back because you're a comic.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.470
But, if it's like
a regular person,

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.160
I ain't got time
to talk to regular people.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.980
That's crazy.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.030
Well, talking about
dating and stuff.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.250
It's so difficult.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.910
I've seen you on the celebrity
dating app, Raya.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.090
Oh, yeah?

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:23.510
I think you're still active
on there

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.740
even if you don't wanna be.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.300
Yeah, I mean
it's like off my phone.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.560
Oh no, it might still be
on my phone, honestly.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.020
That's the thing with these
dating apps,

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:32.770
you take them off your phone
but you're still on there.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.040
Yeah.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.120
You have to go disable
your account.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.970
The way I jumped on those apps
is not believable.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.300
It's very true.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.050
I did this social experiment
with the Moses Storm,

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.930
like four years ago,
and my caret-

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.220
It was like a half prank show,
half written scripted

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.550
and so what we were
trying to do

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.690
is have people come
to this red light

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.390
that was a text friendly light.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.380
It lasted a lot longer so people
can get their texts out.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.290
So, the whole thing
was my character

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.620
was like the serial dater.
So, I jumped on all the apps

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.900
to get people to come
to this street

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.770
so we can fuck with them
at this text friendly light.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.440
So, after that I just
stayed on all the apps

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.920
'cause I didn't really
give a shit

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920
and then I got addicted
to just swiping.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.250
It's an addiction. Yeah.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.540
So, anytime I would be on tour,

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.840
I would see how ugly
is this city?

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.830
And I would play that game
for a while.

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:26.190
And then I just have the apps
sometimes on these apps.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.030
So, people tell me
all the time I'm on them

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.670
but I don't really use them
that much at all.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.050
I don't mind being seen on them.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.570
Everyone is like
"Well, you're a celebrity

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.970
and what if people see?"
I'm just like so-

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.210
Yeah, who cares.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.130
If they see you in the world,
what's the difference?

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.890
And you can't talk.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.140
You're not gonna meet up
with me any quicker.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.840
I'm just still an image
on your phone that is not,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.950
maybe,
but, now though with Instagram,

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.270
that's how i think
people can get in touch

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.880
with celebrities
if you want, slide into-

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.450
Nothing is preventing you
from sending me a message

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:58.760
and me maybe seeing it.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.860
I've met more people
off of Instagram

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.110
than any dating app, dog.

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.310
Yeah. That's the way.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.520
Not even for a date.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.640
Just like, yo, I'm doing shows,
can I show whatever.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.100
And it feels so much smoother.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.030
It does. It's the same thing.
It's the same exact thing.

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.380
Yeah. It is the same.
It's exactly the same.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.590
It's like okay cupid
or whatever

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.689
because you don't have
to match with them.

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.190
You can just reach out
and message people.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.970
Yeah. The other day
Padma Lakshmi slid into my DM's

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.300
and asked me to a show that
she's putting on in Brooklyn

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.400
and I was like,
I can't believe Padma.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.420
I would have missed her message
had I not gone

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.840
to that weird folder
that has the other ones?

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.080
Right.
Right.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.300
Oh, I go to the other ones
all the.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.680
The other ones is
a good name for it.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.900
Yeah.
The other ones.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.500
And you look for a blue check?
You look for a blue check

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.870
so that there's someone
that's like important and rich.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.240
Not rich, I don't care
about money. You do.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.960
Or you look for someone
to say

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.430
something in those
first couple lines

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.810
'cause all you can see
are the first lines.

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:51.050
Right.
Right.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.480
Or you try to look
at the tiniest

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.730
avatar to see
if they're attractive.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.070
Is it worth it for them to know
I've read this.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:56.270
Yeah.
That's so funny.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.540
Yes. Yes.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.140
But, I mean, that's the new way
everyone is meeting each other

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.510
including celebrities, whoever.
Instagram's the new dating app.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.210
Did you go on dates
from dating apps?

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.440
Have you ever been on one?

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.230
Yo, so I went on, Oh my God,
I went on one from Bumble.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.620
Yo, and it was this girl
who I met

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.510
but it took us about a year
to actually go out

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.740
'cause I was on tour.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:22.940
Right. Right. Right.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.140
Every time I was back
in New York

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:27.750
I only had like a day and I was
like I'm not gonna rush around.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.160
Yeah, with a stranger. Right.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.690
Yeah. That would be crazy.
So, at the end of this summer

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:34.920
is actually when
we went out on a date.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.060
I took her to Soho House.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.410
Are you a member?

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.610
Yeah.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.850
Dude. Will you take me sometime?

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.120
Of course.

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.340
Or will you just
recommend me?

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:44.990
Anytime.
Great. It's so cool.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.320
Dude, we did that show there.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.100
I felt like they were gonna
kick me out afterwards.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.190
Yes, I know. You had
I don't be in Soho House energy.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.310
I loved it.
I loved it, dog.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.160
No, but that show's awesome.
That show's always pretty fun.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.010
Yeah, it was a fun time.

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.650
How long have you been
a member of Soho House?

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.080
And for those
that don't know,

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.360
Soho House is just this
like exclusive, cool place

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.000
to go hang out, have meetings,
get work done, there's a gym,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.070
there's a restaurant,
there's apartments.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:13.490
It's just a place
you can go.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:16.020
When you go there, you pay
full price for everything

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.960
but to be a member of it,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.830
to even be able to dine there
or get a drink there

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.420
or have a meeting there,
you have to pay

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.450
I think it's $3,000 a year
to be a member.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.080
It's like a city country club
or some shit.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.290
Yes.
It is.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.330
Yeah, kind of.
It totally is.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.410
But I would go to the one
in Chicago

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.020
and do shows
and in the one in L.A.

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.790
and then they were like

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:40.020
"If you do one more show for us,
we'll make you a member."

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.020
That started a couple years ago.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.510
That's like a stamp card
in a fucking coffee shop.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.320
Exactly, I was like "okay, damn.
Let me get my promo stamps."

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.630
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.410
Then, when I got to Lulo,

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.280
Yasmine was one of
the directors over there

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.850
or still is
and I did her show.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.610
She was like "Yeah,
we gotta make you a member."

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.070
I was like, yeah,
I wanna throw shows in here

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.610
because there's not enough
black people in here.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:05.750
So, I wanna throw more shows.
That was kind of like the goal.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.680
And it still is.
I take advantage of it a lot.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.610
I love that spot.
It's very low key.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.170
What a great date place, too.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.740
So, you brought this girl
to Soho house.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.480
Yeah, we had these drinks.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.900
The drinks are amazing there
and we're sitting there

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.090
and I'm like just
getting to know her

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:25.560
and I'm realizing
she doesn't ask any questions.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.930
She's like "I don't really talk.
I'm just.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.180
Everybody says
I'm mysterious."

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.710
Oh, this girl was so hot.
You're boring.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.910
I'm like, what?

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.530
You're the most boring person
I've ever met in my life.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.770
How hot was she, though?

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.010
She was kinda hot.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.240
I mean, so hot!

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.289
To get away with that type
of personality

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.730
That's the thing.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.110
She wasn't that banging
where it was like, come on.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.290
You gotta have some opinions
about something.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.530
She was acting like
she belonged at Soho House

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.220
but she's only living
at Equinox.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:58.310
She's not like a prototype
of a person at Soho House.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.999
She sounded like she plugged
herself up before she go to bed.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.960
Just like a robot.
I was like, so what do you do?

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.860
Do men just talk and you
just listen the whole time?

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.240
She's like "
Yeah, pretty much."

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.470
I'm like that's stupid.
I don't wanna do that.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.740
A hot therapist?

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:17.080
That works a lot for, I mean,
that's a technique

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.780
that I've read about in books

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.990
where it's like
how to get a guy,

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.290
it's just listen,
don't talk, shut up.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.900
You can start talking once
you're in a relationship

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.170
but shut up before then

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.450
because men just wanna talk
and be heard.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.710
I hate that.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.920
Please don't cosmopolitan
article me lady.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.310
Yeah. I hate that.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.480
I don't need this.
I wanna talk to a person.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.600
I already have ten sexy ways
to get abs.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.340
Yo, for real.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.310
Sexy abs? I have gross abs.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.190
Gross abs?

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.860
Yeah, that's a bad date.
So, how did it-

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.650
Did she know who you
were before hand?

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.120
Oh, I think she knew me
from Disjointed.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.560
That's what took me a long time

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.230
to even go out with her
in the first place

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.580
'cause it was just like
I don't wanna do this.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.700
Why? What are you in Disjointed?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.220
I play this weed head.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.420
Oh, okay.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.700
People just, I don't know.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.110
They assume you're like
your character.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.110
Yeah, or I wanna talk about
that the whole time.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.310
Right.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.520
Yeah, and they don't know
you at all.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.730
At all.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.300
Yeah, they just know you
from t- like,

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.660
they just know you as
a character so that's not you.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.010
Yeah, it's like a weird energy.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:28.360
I just don't. Yeah.
Sometimes it's very weird.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.730
I knew she was gonna be weird
going in

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.950
but I had a free night.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.220
Yeah.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.490
I kinda wanted to see
what it is.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.800
I've kinda been putting it off
for a minute

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.630
and she was kind of fun
to talk to on

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.170
like back and forth
texting every now and then.

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:42.310
Yeah, sometimes you get
someone who is a good texter

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.510
and then you're like
why are you such a dud?

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.850
We should just
text each other.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.280
This is why I say get off
the app as fast as possible

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.600
'cause then you find out.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.480
'Cause some people will waste
your time texting forever

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.630
and then you're like
"Oh, this was such a waste."

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:56.860
Yeah, I hate the apps.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.500
Although, I did get
recognized on Grinder.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:23:59.730
So, that's.
You did?

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.220
You got recognized on Grind?

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.070
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
From a torso.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.420
A picture of a guys torso
and he was like "I'm a fan."

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.200
I like to think it is
just his torso

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.080
and then he started
a Grinder account.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.940
I bet you've been recognized
from Grinder before.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.730
I bet that's where
most people see.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.530
You're the guy who asked
how my butt hole's doing.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.990
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.940
I can only get
recognized from this.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.050
Look like a glory hole face.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.310
Glory hole face.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.280
Yeah, Glory hole
face recognition.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.210
Glory hole's are so disgusting.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.610
It's so disgusting.
It's such a crazy concept

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.590
to put your most
precious item of your body

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.290
in a hole that you don't
know on the other side.

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:55.160
Talk about fear of intimacy.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.130
That is literally
the most un-intimate thing

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.030
you can do to be
completely blocked off.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.280
It's like what you want to do
though

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.710
where it's like a guy
in a mask or whatever.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.350
I'm so into glory hole porn
because I'm scared of intimacy.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.360
You're into glory
hole relationships.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.030
Yo, wait. Why?

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.030
I like, all the porn I watch,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:22.760
I'd have to say it's like
a woman being used by a guy.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.490
Why do I like glory hole?

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.280
Because the woman's
just like a hole.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.790
A vessel.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.090
And she's not like a person,

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.840
and I don't want
to be not a person

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:34.660
but I want to distance it.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.300
Sex for me is so weird
and it's just so,

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.100
I have to disassociate to engage
in it because it is so.

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.540
You're like naked
and you're like.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.730
No, you're just sober
so you're aware of it.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.620
Yeah, I'm sober.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.400
She fucks like Elaine dances.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.650
I kind of do.
When I'm squirming around.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.850
I like the maracas though.
That shit's dope.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.840
But, sex is so weird.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.420
It's so strange that you could
be at dinner

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.740
with someone having
a conversation at Soho House

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.690
and then cut two, like boom,
yoU guys are naked.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:11.490
For the first time,
it's so weird.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.800
It's so dope.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.090
Oh weird, I mean.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.300
I love it, man.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.750
It rules. Sex rules.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.310
Of course it's so great
but to get to

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.280
Yeah, sex is pretty cool,
I guess.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.010
Sex is pretty cool.
Who's dad is this?

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.710
Sex is pretty fly.

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.580
You kids having sex?
You guys doing intercourse?

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.040
You know, I had sex once.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.930
Right, son? Right, son?
Ew , dad.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.340
I was always so fascinated by-

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.550
I'll show you the pictures.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.830
Before I hooked up
and I was a late bloomer

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.390
so all my friends were
hooking up before me

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.910
and I was always so fascinated
by how do you go

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.950
from doing nothing
to doing that?

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.270
What is the transition?

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.510
You can't ask.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.270
You can't be like be like
"can we have sex now?"

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.970
There's gotta be a move.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.060
I'm so uncomfortable
with that transition

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.330
and whenever my friends
get prostitutes I'm always like

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.680
"do they walk in and comment
on your sconces

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.610
and then they take off
all their clothes?"

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.000
How do you move
from just being hello.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.140
I always ask them if they want
something from Seven Eleven.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:07.490
Do you really?
Do you really?

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.080
Yeah. Yeah. Then I bring them
a red bull and a snack.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.680
You leave them alone
in your apartment?

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.910
No, I go to them.

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:14.410
Oh, you go to them and you
bring them,

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:15.680
that's what I do
with my uber driver's

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.900
when they drop me off at
Seven Eleven.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.870
When I make them stop,
I go "do you want anything?"

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.960
So it makes them feel better
and they never do.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.940
And sometimes when they do,
I go "really?

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.280
I have to buy you
something now?

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.650
I know it was an offer,
but I didn't mean it."

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.450
The transition is fun.
It's the fun part.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:30.960
What's your go to?

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.720
Can we give people
listen some tips?

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.580
'Cause I think that
there's some,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.570
a lot of people have anxiety
about that first moment.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.920
What's your first move?
What's your go to?

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.120
Well, I-

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.340
Pretend it's Kanye.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.700
Yeah. Yeah. First of all,
I do it as Kanye.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.390
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.000
I don't know if I have a move

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.320
but it's like a tale
when you know it's going down.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.280
Like "Hey, you wanna go back
to the house and chill

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.990
and watch a movie
or something."

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.910
That's a very standard
old way to do it.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.200
I did not know
that that meant sex.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.430
For so long I was sitting
and watching "Almost Famous."

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.080
But also have a movie ready,
fam. You gotta have a movie.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.470
Don't just go there like,
lights out.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:08.670
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:09.920
You gotta go through the motions
like you

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.480
don't know it's happening.
You know what I mean.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.780
'Cause that's generally
the way to do it.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.000
[crosstalk] gotcha.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.950
I don't even have a TV.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.399
Or an apartment. All right.
Load up your phone.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:25.850
Get in that box.
That is kidnapping.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.570
That's a Netflix gift card
dangling.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.580
That's a good one.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.040
The, just come back
to my apartment.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.370
We all know what that means.
We're having a good time,

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.110
let's keep this going
and go somewhere private.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:39.480
The time makes sense too.
Right?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.480
'Cause if it's like 1AM,
I don't wanna stop hanging out.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.040
That's where it initiates.
Almost like hanging out

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.070
but if you gotta go home,
I could take you home.

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.300
And then, depending on
how the energy is,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.630
right, is kind of dependent on
if you're gonna get down or not.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.120
What about, like I went on
a date

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.070
with a guy not too long ago

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.200
and we didn't know
if it was a date or not,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.110
it was like friends hanging out
and then we were at dinner

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.340
and then we were like, let's go
walk over here and get dessert.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.950
Now, let's walk over here
and get tea.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:07.450
Now, let's,
and it got to the point

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.100
to where it was like okay,

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.010
and we both,
and he didn't ask me over

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.400
and we're just standing
on the corner,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.570
I'm calling an uber,
and I'm like are we gonna kiss?

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:15.850
It was so awkward.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:17.320
Then my Uber shows up
and I'm like bye

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.670
and I just get in a getaway car
and I run away.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.410
In a getaway car.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.760
There could have been a moment

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.870
where he could have kissed me
or something

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.800
but it was too awkward for us
to both handle on the street.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.560
Somebody's gotta do it.
Somebody's gotta make a move.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.570
Yeah. I make a move.
I don't wait for it.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.300
Yeah. I've been making the move.
It feels good.

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.890
But, I've been rejected before.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.100
Being rejected
is part of the game.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.300
Yeah. Hey, swing and miss.
That's okay.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:46.390
No, all right.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.300
I was just kidding.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.780
Dude, one time I got rejected
and I pulled up a kid swinging

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.570
and missing in a t-ball game
and was like "look it's me."

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:57.300
That's great.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.610
I moon walked away. I did.
I did.

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:02.380
Because it's funny as hell.
Why not.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.590
That's so fucking funny.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.830
That's so funny.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:07.170
Yeah. I'll moon walk.
Fuck that shit.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.320
That's so great.
Just do the robot.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.270
System shut down.
Boner disengaged.

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.700
Yeah, just so she don't feel
weird for making a decision

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.010
she has every right to make.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:21.320
I don't think I've ever had
a guy go in

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.630
where I didn't want him to.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:25.050
I think I'm very good about
putting out the energy

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.140
of don't kiss me right now
if I don't want it.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.370
I just give them no oppor-

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.380
You've never had anybody
try where you're like

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.600
"I didn't want
to do that."

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.800
No.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.210
Wow.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.740
I think I'm pretty good at,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.810
not to say that women who do
have guys that try to kiss them

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.080
Yeah, well they're asking
for it.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.310
Exactly.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.730
Well, guys,
maybe you should be better

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.460
about putting it out there
if you don't want it.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.800
Change your outfit.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.210
There's energy though. There's
definitely energy to pick up on.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:52.700
My favorite energy
of new relationships is when

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.700
Oh my God, yes,
Dr. Drew is back.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.990
Hell, yeah.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:57.560
Getting a selfie.
Look at you, cutie.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.830
I forgot to do that.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:00.570
Look at that.

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.270
I love you. The best energy
ever is when you.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.100
Okay, so say Ian and I
were hanging out at a show

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.550
or something and we're sitting
next to each other

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:10.740
and we're not even on a date.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.510
It's just like a guy
I'm sitting next to that

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.710
"oh, i could be into him."

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:16.310
This has happened to me recently
and I love it.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:18.970
Where you accidentally touch
but you won't take it away.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.300
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.540
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:22.760
I love those moments.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.330
I love it because you know
if I wasn't into,

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.060
Ian I could do like this
'cause he's my friend,

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.780
but if I wasn't into a guy
that is just my friend

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.330
or just someone that
I would never be, we would touch

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.210
and I would instantly be like
"oh, that's our space."

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:38.580
But, when you just leave it
and they leave it

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.280
and you go "conformation."

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:42.990
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.580
It's not even just a point
on your arm

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.500
where you do your whole arm
is flush with them.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.700
Yeah. I love this.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.180
And it's like we have
all the room not to do this

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.150
right now,
that's the hottest thing.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.560
That's what's fun figuring out
where people stand,

00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.880
how you feel about somebody.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.580
Those little moments.
I love that shit.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:01.930
But, seriously,
get away from me.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.260
Yeah. It's making me
uncomfortable looking at you.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.200
Yeah, it is weird.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.900
I'm like, do you need help?

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:10.700
Or if you're saying hi
to someone.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.220
The other night,
there was this guy

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.440
that I had some energy with
and so we were saying hi.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.360
We were greeting everyone

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.250
and I kinda just like held
on a little bit longer.

00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:22.500
Oh.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.560
You just give little indications
like that.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:26.020
Oh, that's what you were
doing to me.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.210
I get it.
Yeah, I like you Nikki.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:29.910
I may have done that to you.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.120
Here, you sit here
and redo that whole.

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.330
Yeah.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.700
I love those little things
but I will say the best,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.190
and I'd give this advise
to every guy

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:39.640
who doesn't know
how to make a first move.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.160
The best first move
I've ever had pulled on me

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.140
was on the street
one of those like

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:45.580
we're both going
our separate ways,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.840
is there gonna be a kiss,
it's the end of the night.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.770
I was just kind of like
staring at the ground

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.230
and he just goes
"get over here."

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:52.600
And he just grabs
my wrist gently

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.840
Yeah.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.100
And kind of tugged me and it was
like the hottest thing.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.110
But he said it like he was
in mortal combat?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.310
Get over here.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.530
Yeah. You gotta go in confident.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:01.850
Yeah, but just like the,
what are we doing?

00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.310
He goes "just get over here."

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.330
It was just the way,
I really recommend that move.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.810
It's so hot. It's aggressive,
but not too aggressive.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.980
It really is a perfect move
that I recommend.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.260
And if he comes too fast,
you say "Whoopsy."

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:21.000
You gotta do that. Because life
is comedy and mortal combat.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.540
Chris Redd, you were so great.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.480
Thank you so much for coming in
on such a short notice.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.720
Dude, this is awesome, man.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.660
You are so funny and so fun
and I cant wait to watch you

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.160
just get more
and more successful.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.610
Killer stand up.
Thank you so much.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.250
If you haven't seen Chris Redd
in the movie "Pop Star",

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:43.010
please watch him in that.
He is a break out star in it.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.770
But, that movie is so good.
I recommend it so much.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.960
I got shows.
I got shows at Caroline's.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.820
Tonight through Saturday.
Come out and hang out with me.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.600
I'm talking all the shits.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.090
Oh my God, you have to go see
Chris Redd

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.020

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.170

Chris Redd, thank you so much.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:02.870
Ian Fidance,
how's your butt hole?

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.250
It's amazing. What a great show.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.890
And That Thakkar, I love you.
Love you. [crosstalk]

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.430
I'm gonna be in Philly all week.
Come to shows.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.729
Please come see me

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.810
Bye.
