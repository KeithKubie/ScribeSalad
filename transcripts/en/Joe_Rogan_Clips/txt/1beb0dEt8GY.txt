Speaker 1:          00:00          Now when you take a guy who's working as a truck driver and he's making $50,000 a year and you tell him that automation is going to take away his job, but good news, we're going to give you $12,000 a year. That's a substantial loss in income and yeah, it leaves them. Yeah. It also leaves them with this feeling of uselessness or hopelessness that they're not contributing. You know? I think one of the things that people enjoy is a earning their own way. You know, they, they, people don't, it sounds counterintuitive. People don't like free money. They'd like a feeling of satisfaction of a job. Well done that they've created something that they've done something.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Yeah, you're 100% right. It's one reason why we call this the freedom dividend. We say, look, it's not money for nothing. You're an owner and shareholder of the richest country in the history of the world. Just like when I buy Verizon or Microsoft, they send me a dividend. Like I don't complain about that. Like your now a shareholder in this great nation and you get a dividend. But when I was with Dennis, the trucker who owns his own trucking company in Iowa, uh, the, the role that job's playing in truckers' lives is vital. And again, I'm a very data driven guy where men deal with joblessness very, very poorly by the numbers we spend between 40 and 75% of our time on the computer playing video games or doing other things, uh, are substance abuse, goes up, are volunteering in the community, goes down, even though we have more time and we generally spiral into antisocial and self destructive behaviors.

Speaker 2:          01:39          Now this is not something that's, uh, experienced by women in the same levels like women and joblessness. Women actually have more adaptable. They're more likely to go back to school and volunteer. They don't spend all their time on the computers the way that we do. So there's a real problem. Uh, and the purpose of universal basic income is not meant to be a job replacement for those truckers because right now those truckers, and when I talked to the truck drivers, so I've been campaigning for president now for a number of months. So I spent a lot of time in Iowa, which is a really huge trucking hub. And you go to them and say, hey guys, you worried about robot trucks taking your jobs? They're like, there's no way rubble. I could take my job like that. That's, you know, that's like totally matter of fact, they're like, they're like, this is not something that they worry about. Their attitude has transitioned from that somewhat too. Uh, we should make robot trucks illegal or we should make it so that a robot truck cannot displace me. So that's been a big shift because a year ago they were like, it's impossible.

Speaker 1:          02:42          The idea that an American would say we should make a a robot job illegal. Like it's, we should have some laws that keep you from being free to use robots for your business instead of person. Like you should be forced to highly mandatory unionization

Speaker 2:          03:00          or something. That sounds pretty ridiculous. Well, that's where a lot of the Marjoe, uh, so only 13% of truckers are unionized. So 87% are like Dennis where there are small independent firms. And a lot of them actually, uh, bought or leased their own trucks. So they took out tens of thousands of dollars in the equivalent of a mortgage to get this truck. And so if they have to compete against a robot truck, that doesn't stop. That's like, you know, that's existential level stuff. And right now truck drivers have time use regulations where they cannot drive more than 14 hours a day. Uh, so you can't, you literally cannot compete because the robot trucks just gonna keep going. Our 15, 16, 17, et cetera. So these guys make, some of them make really good money. Like some of them make 70, 75, $80,000. It's one of the higher paying jobs for, um, men without a college degree.

Speaker 2:          03:56          And so if you look at what they're facing, it's not so crazy that they're like, hey, you need to make the robots illegal because for them, what is the next best economic alternative? If the robot trucks take over that job, like what are they going to go from? Yeah. It's not crazy for them, but it's a crazy idea to tell a company that they can't do something that's more efficient, safer, and probably economically more viable. Oh yeah. Again, the savings from automating truck driving are estimated to be $168 billion per year and not just labor savings, but also equipment utilization because the trucks never stop fuel efficiency because the trucks can daisy chain together, so there's less wind resistance, fewer accidents, cause right now truck accidents kill about 4,000 people a year, so you'd probably save lives. There's a very, very powerful argument for the fact that we should be trying to automate this stuff, but on the other side you have literally three and a half million truckers who apply upon this further livelihoods to support their family and there's going to be a lot of passion, a lot of resistance to this.

Speaker 2:          05:00          Anyone who thinks that truck drivers are just going to shrug and be like, all right, I guess I had a good run. I'm just going to go home and figure it out. That's not going to be their response. Right? It's going to be much more likely that they say you need to make these robot trucks illegal or they're just going to park their trucks across the highway, get their guns out. Cause a lot of these guys are ex military and just be like, Hey, like I'm not moving my truck until uh, you know, I get my job back and that there'll be a lot of truckers in the same situation. You really think that would happen? Well I think they blocked the highway for their job back. That's less efficient. Kills more people. So I was with these truckers in the truck stop in Altoona, Iowa and Joe, they have really, really difficult jobs.

Speaker 2:          05:40          I mean, I don't know if you knew truckers where you were, but they, they have this 14 hour window where they're allowed to drive their truck and they drive most of that. So they have these other 10 hours and they sleep in their truck, their trucks have a bed, they go into the truck stop, they take a shower, you know, there's a laundry and they're like plugged into this machine of this truck of and, and the industry, you know, they spend days, sometimes weeks on the road. A lot of them listen to podcasts. Probably a lot of them listening right now. A lot of them listened to podcasts and uh, they're doing it primarily because it's a more lucrative opportunity than the other jobs that are available to them. A lot of them have families that like, you know, like the support of their families.

Speaker 2:          06:23          Uh, and so if you say, hey guys, like, you know, Time's up for, for this way of life. Most of them I think will not like, uh, like, uh, actually I look at how much they frankly they like into your, there's so much endurance baked into that job that I think most of them will be like some of the guys you and I know where they're much more likely to like implode or like, you know, do something where, where it's self destructive than they would be to take their truck in La, you know, park it across the highway. But you're talking about a population of hundreds of thousands, including many small business owners and small business owners have a different mentality very often. Like I've been an entrepreneur, I'm a serial entrepreneur for the last 20 years. Like you're an entrepreneur and if you saw this happen, you might say, Hey, I'm adaptable.

Speaker 2:          07:13          I'll figure it out. Or you might say, Hey, I think I can do something about this. Like if I parked my truck this way, like that's going to cause such havoc that it's, you know, it's like hundreds of millions of dollars worth of economic harm very, very fast. And if you look at the industrial revolution, which people site as the precursor to what we're going through, there were mass riots in the industrial revolution that killed dozens of people, caused billions of dollars worth of damage. Labor Day's a holiday today because of those riots. And then we implemented universal high school in 1911 in part as a response to these riots. So according to the estimates, this is called the fourth industrial revolution, and we're going to displace jobs at three to four times the rate of that industrial revolution. And that industrial revolution included mass riots. So thinking that this one will not strikes me as really, really optimistic and perhaps unrealistic.
