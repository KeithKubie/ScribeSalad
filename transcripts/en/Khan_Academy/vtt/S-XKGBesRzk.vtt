00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.910
Let's see if we can learn a
thing or two about partial

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.210
fraction expansion, or
sometimes it's called partial

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.560
fraction decomposition.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.800
The whole idea is to take
rational functions-- and a

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.980
rational function is just a
function or expression where

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.170
it's one expression divided by
another-- and to essentially

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.560
expand them or decompose
them into simpler parts.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.020
And the first thing you've got
to do, before you can even

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.850
start the actual partial
fraction expansion process, is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.760
to make sure that the
numerator has a lower degree

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.650
than the denominator.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.440
In the situation, the problem,
that I've drawn right here,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.560
I've written right here,
that's not the case.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.190
The numerator has the same
degree as the denominator.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.430
So the first step we want to do
to simplify this and to get it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.850
to the point where the
numerator has a lower degree

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.780
than the denominator is
to do a little bit of

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.270
algebraic division.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.320
And I've done a video on this,
but it never hurts to get a

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.530
review here, so to do that, we
divide the denominator into the

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.810
numerator to figure out the
remainder, so we divide x

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:18.590
squared minus 3x minus 40 into
x squared minus 2x minus 37.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.010
So how many times?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.620
You look at the highest degree
term, so x squared goes into x

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.380
squared one time, one times
this whole thing is x squared

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.690
minus 3x minus 40, and now you
want to subtract this from

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.470
that to get the remainder.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.010
And see, if I'm subtracting, so
I'm going to subtract, and then

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.410
minus minus is a plus, a plus,
and then you can add them.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.540
These cancel out.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.320
Minus 2x plus 3x, that's x.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.680
Minus 37 plus 40,
that's plus 3.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.410
So this expression up here can
be rewritten as-- let me scroll

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:05.680
down a little bit-- as 1 plus x
plus 3 over x squared

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.690
minus 3x minus 40.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.250
This might seem like some type
of magic thing I just did, but

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.380
this is no different than what
you did in the fourth or fifth

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.930
grade, where you learned how
to convert improper regular

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.620
fractions into mixed numbers.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.180
Let me just do a little
side example here.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.520
If I had 13 over 2, and I want
to turn it into a mixed number,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.910
what you do-- you can probably
do this in your head now-- but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.360
what you did is, you divide the
denominator into the numerator,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.810
just like we did over here.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.755
2 goes into 13.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:39.490
We see 2 goes into 13 six
times, 6 times 2 is 12, you

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.050
subtract that from that,
you get a remainder of 1.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.870
2 doesn't go into 1, so
that's just the remainder.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.310
So if you wanted to rewrite
this, it would be the number of

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.820
times the denominator goes into
the numerator, that's 6, plus

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.160
the remainder over
the denominator.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.560
Plus 6-- plus 1 over 2.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.110
And when you did it in
elementary school, you would

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.130
just write 6 1/2, but 6 1/2 is
the same thing as 6 plus 1/2.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.480
That's exactly the same
thing we did here.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.710
The denominator went to the
numerator one time, and then

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.245
there was a remainder of x plus
3 left over, so it's 1 plus x

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:14.590
plus 3 over this expression.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.260
Now we see that that numerator
in this rational expression

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.760
does have a lower degree
than the denominator.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.530
The highest degree here is 1,
the highest degree here is 2,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.470
so we're ready to commence our
partial fraction decomposition.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.420
And all that is, is taking this
expression up here and turning

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.290
it into two simpler expressions
where the denominators are the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.310
factors of this lower term.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.570
So given that, let's
factor this lower term.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.510
So let's see.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.650
What two numbers add up to
minus 3, and when you multiply

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.050
them, you get minus 40?

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.380
So let's see.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.810
They have to be different
signs, because when you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.280
multiply them you get a
negative, so it has to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.700
be minus 8 and plus 5.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.810
So we can rewrite this up here
as-- I'll switch colors--

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:17.990
1 plus x plus 3 over x
plus 5 times x minus 8.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.770
5 times 8 is minus 40-- 5 times
negative 8 is minus 40, plus 5

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.170
minus 8 is minus 3,
so we're all set.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.110
Now I'll just focus on
this part right now.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.530
We can just remember
that that 1 is sitting

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.700
out there out front.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.110
This is the expression we
want to decompose or expand.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.010
And we're going to expand it
into two simpler expressions

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.810
where each of these are the
denominator-- and I will make

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.010
the claim, and if the numbers
work out then the claim is

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.600
true-- I'll make the claim that
I can expand this, or decompose

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.560
this, into two fractions where
the first fraction is just some

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.500
number a over the first factor,
over x plus 5, plus some

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.890
number b over the second
factor, over x minus 8.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.200
That's my claim, and if I can
solve for a and b in a way that

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.530
it actually does add up to
this, then I'm done and I will

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.250
have fully decomposed
this fraction.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.960
I guess is the way-- I
don't know if that's the

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.850
correct terminology.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.750
So let's try to do that.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.530
So if I were to add these
two terms, what do I get?

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.320
When you add anything, you find
the common denominator, and the

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.640
common denominator, the easiest
common denominator, is to

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.220
multiply the two denominators,
so let me write this here.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:39.570
So a over x plus 5 plus b
over x minus 8 is equal to--

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.230
well, let's get the common
denominator-- it's equal to

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.580
x plus 5 times x minus 8.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.080
And then the a term, we would--
a over x plus 5 is the same

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.010
thing as a times x minus
8 over this whole thing.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.030
I mean, if I just wrote this
right here, you would just

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.720
cancel these two terms out and
you would get a over x plus 5.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.010
And then you could add that to
the common denominator, x plus

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:19.450
5 times x minus 8, and it
would be b times x plus 5.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.110
Important to realize,
that, look.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.690
This term is the exact same
thing as this term if you just

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.330
cancel the x minus 8 out, and
this term is the exact same

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.320
thing as this term if you just
cancel the x plus 5 out.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.800
But now that we have an actual
common denominator, we can add

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.820
them together, so we get-- let
me just write the left side

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.000
here over-- a over x
plus 5-- I'm sorry.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.230
I want to write this over here.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:54.550
I want to write x plus 3 over
plus 5 times x minus 8 is equal

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.710
to is equal to the sum of
these two things on top.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:07.440
a times x minus 8 plus b times
x plus 5, all of that over

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:15.830
their common denominator, x
plus 5 times x minus eight.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.600
So the denominators are the
same, so we know that this,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.990
when you add this together,
you have to get this.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.600
So if we want to solve
for a and b, let's just

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.370
set that equality.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.000
We can ignore the denominators.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.110
So we can say that x plus 3
is equal to a times x minus

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:38.430
8 plus b times x plus 5.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.550
Now, there's two ways to
solve for a and b from

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.950
this point going forward.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.950
One is the way that I was
actually taught in the seventh

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.150
or eighth grade, which tends to
take a little longer, then

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.340
there's a fast way to do it and
it never hurts to do

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.890
the fast way first.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.290
If you want to solve for a,
let's pick an x that'll

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.940
make this term disappear.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.000
So what x would make
this term disappear?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.190
Well, if I say x is minus 5,
then this becomes 0, and

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.760
then the b disappears.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.660
So if we say x is minus 5-- I'm
just picking an arbitrary x to

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.610
be able to solve for this--
then this would become minus 5

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:19.070
plus 3-- let me just write it
out, minus 5 plus 3-- is equal

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.520
to a times minus 5 minus 8--
let me just write it out,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.750
minus 5 minus 8-- plus
b times minus 5 plus 5.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.610
And I picked the minus 5 to
make this expression 0.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.090
So then you get-- pick a
brighter color-- minus 5 plus

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:44.230
3 is minus 2, is equal to--
what is this?-- minus 13a

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.990
plus-- this is 0, right?

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.690
That's 0.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.130
Minus 5 plus 5 is 0, 0 times b
is 0, and then you divide both

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.600
sides by minus 13, you get--
negatives cancel out-- you get

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.940
2 over 13 is equal to a, and
now we can do the same thing up

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:05.270
here and get rid of the a terms
by making x is equal to 8.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:11.150
If x is equal to 8, you get x
plus 3 is equal to 11, is equal

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:19.660
to a times 0 plus b times--
what's 5-- 8 plus 5

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.340
is-- plus b times 13.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.880
Their b looks a bit like a 13.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:32.430
And then you get 11 is equal to
13b, divide both sides by 13,

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.130
you get b is equal
to 11 over 13.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:39.300
So we were able to solve
for our a's and our b's.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.370
And so we can go back to
our original equation

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.060
and we could say, wow.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:47.960
This just has to be equal to
2 over 13, and this just has

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.765
to be equal to 11 over 13.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.080
So our original, our very
original thing we wrote up

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.750
here, can be decomposed into 1,
that's this 1 over here, plus

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.150
this, which is 2 over 13-- I'll
just write it like this for

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:11.850
now-- 2 over 13, over x plus 5.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.735
You could bring the 13 down
here if you want to write

00:10:13.735 --> 00:10:15.970
it so you don't have a
fraction over a fraction.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:27.115
Plus 11 over 13 times--
over x minus 8.

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:29.190
And once again, you could bring
the 13 down so you don't have

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:30.400
a fraction over a fraction.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.075
But we have just successfully
decomposed this pretty-- I

00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:37.600
don't want to say that we
necessarily simplified it,

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.320
because you could say, oh, we
only have one expression here,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.690
now I have three-- but I've
reduced the degree of both the

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:43.660
numerators and the
denominators.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.420
And you might say, well,
Sal, why would I ever

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.250
have to do this?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.140
And you're right.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.680
In algebra you probably won't.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.800
But this is actually a really
useful technique later on when

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.560
you get to calculus, and
actually, differential

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.160
equations, because a lot of
times it's much easier-- and

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.080
I'll throw out a word here that
you don't understand-- to take

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.000
the integral or the
antiderivative of

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.550
something like this, then
something like this.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.930
And later, when you do inverse
Laplace transforms and

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.600
differential equations, it's
much easier take an inverse

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.920
Laplace transform of
something like this than

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.070
something like that.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.120
So anyway, hopefully I've given
you another tool kit in your--

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.950
or another tool in your tool
kit, and I'll probably do a

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.750
couple more videos because we
haven't exhausted all of the

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.800
examples that we could we
could show for partial

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.770
fraction decomposition.
