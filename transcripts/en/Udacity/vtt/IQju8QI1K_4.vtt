00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The highest speed is reached at position B.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We have energy conservation in this system that points B the distance of is the smallest,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which means that at point B the potential energy is the smallest,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But if the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy remains constant,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
kinetic energy has to be maximum at that point,

00:00:22.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which means that the spacecraft has achieved its highest speed at this point.
