00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.090
How do you search for life on other planets?

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:09.090
Follow the water!

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.370
Hi everyone, I’m Amy Teitel and I’m guest
hosting for DNews.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.090
If you’re among the living you have something
in common with every other life form on the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.840
planet: You need water to live.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.650
So it would make sense that if you find the
substance necessary for life on Earth elsewhere,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.570
it increases the chances of finding extraterrestrial
life.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
Now, we’ve never found liquid water on Mars,
so it’s probably not the best place to be

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.590
looking, right?

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.160
We should be focussing our energies on the
subsurface oceans on Titan and Europa, shouldn’t

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.160
we?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
Well, maybe not.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.260
A new study from a team at the University
of Michigan has found a way for liquid water

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.859
to exist on the surface of Mars, and the key
is salt.

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.370
We’ve been exploring Mars with orbiters,
landers, and rovers since the mid-1960s, and

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.610
most of what we’ve found where water is
concerned is evidence that ancient Mars was

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.610
wet.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.079
We’ve found weathered rocks indicative of
ancient rivers, photographs of gullies flowing

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.010
down crater rims, and chemical signatures
in rocks that can only have formed in the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.010
presence of water.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.170
But in 1998 we got an interesting break in
the form of pictures from NASA’s Phoenix

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.170
lander.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.340
Some showed ice in trenches left by the lander’s
scoop and others showed globules on the landers’

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
legs.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.090
These globules caught scientists’ eyes because
they not only persisted in later images, they

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.350
seemed to get bigger.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.670
It was a clear that something was happening
on Mars.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.130
Could it be that water droplets were somehow
pooling on the lander’s legs?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.700
The obvious problem in thinking the globules
were water is Mars’ environment.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.450
Being further from the Sun than the Earth
with a much thinner atmosphere, the red planet

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.220
is cold; the average surface temperature is
about 80 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.570
This is where salt comes in.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.539
Just like how salt melts ice on the roads
in the winter, salt in Martian soil could

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.830
melt subsurface ice.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.340
It’s possible that the Phoenix lander blasted
away enough top soil to expose the necessary

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.859
salts and subsurface ice for the two to interact
and form liquid water, water that then froze

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.149
on the lander’s legs.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.580
Which means the same thing could be happening
elsewhere on Mars without the facilitating

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.009
effects of a lander exposing the materials.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.399
The key is the salt content in Mars’ soil.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.479
The Phoenix lander and the Curiosity rover
have both detected calcium perchlorate on

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.759
Mars, a salty mixture of calcium, chlorine,
and oxygen that is also found in arid places

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.070
on Earth like the Atacama Desert in Chile.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.150
To test whether this salt could form water
simply through contact with ice, the University

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.950
of Michigan team recreated Phoenix’s landing
site and late spring/early summer environment

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.950
in a laboratory.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.890
In one of these duplicate Mars environments
the team put millimeter-thick layers of salt

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.590
on a temperature-controlled plate of Mars-like
soil.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.590
And nothing happened.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.480
But in the other duplicate Mars environment
the team put calcium perchlorate directly

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.580
on a 3-millimeter-thick layer of ice and watched
as drops of water formed within minutes, even

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.430
with the chamber set at minus 100 degrees
Fahrenheit.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.230
From these lab results the team concluded
that small amounts of liquid water could exist

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.159
on Mars’ surface, specifically in shallow
areas between the polar regions and mid-latitudes

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.800
during the daytime hours of the warmer spring
and summer seasons.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.049
It’s a natural cycle that might explain
how gullies flow, freeze, and thaw before

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.420
flowing again, and also might explain how
it is that water has been able to form just

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.900
below the Martian surface.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.650
Which might itself be a compelling way to
look for life: we’ve seen frozen saltwater

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.700
lattices playing host to microbial life on
Earth, so the same thing could be happening

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.900
on Mars.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.739
So do you think we should dig deeper into
the Martian soil to see if there’s life

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.739
underneath?
