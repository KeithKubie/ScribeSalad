[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.380
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.160
interesting developer community.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.180
has asked this question.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.756
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:16.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.010
answer show.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.260
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.650
MIHAI IONESCU: Hello.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.470
Welcome to Payments Live.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.930
We have another very exciting
session today.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.580
We'll be talking about one of
fastest-growing growing

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.580
segments in online payments,
that is,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.910
digital goods and services.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.680
And our special guest today is
Google Wallet product manager

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.270
Arundhati Singh.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.120
Arundhati, thanks for finding
the time to join us.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.970
ARUNDHATI SINGH:
Oh, absolutely.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.760
Very happy to be here.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.140
Thanks, Mihai.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.630
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank you.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.040
We're glad to have you.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.320
And so let's get started.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.525
Arundhati, what is Google Wallet
for Digital Goods?

00:00:55.525 --> 00:00:58.860
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Google Wallet
for Digital Goods is a great

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.240
new service that we have to
monetize your online content

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.170
and services.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.140
So if you take a look at the
slide that I've just put up,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
what it is is an in-context flow
that we support both on

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.640
desktop and mobile web.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.290
And some of the key benefits of
using this flow are that it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.480
keeps customers on your
site while they're

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.790
completing their purchase.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280
So it increases conversion.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.700
And it's a very simple
integration for integrators.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.900
From a consumer perspective,
it provides convenience as

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.340
well as the security of the
Google Wallet brand to

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.480
complete their payments.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.750
And the last key point of one
of the great things that we

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.620
are very proud of that we've
been able to do for

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.990
integrators is provide really
developer-friendly pricing.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.220
So it's 5% for microtransactions
or 1.9 plus

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.580
30% US dollars for larger
transactions.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.345
And the lowest price is
automatically applied.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.630
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:54.700
Can you give us some example?

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.180
Who are the users of this API?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.020
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.130
So we've been fortunate to
partner with some great

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.850
developers.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.020
And up on this slide, you'll
see just a few of the great

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.060
developers we've been working
with over the past year plus--

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.000
Zynga, Kabam, Graphicly,
Playdom, Rovio.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.635
MIHAI IONESCU: Wow.

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:12.670
That looks like all big names.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.476
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.155
MIHAI IONESCU: And are we also
using this at Google?

00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:21.120
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Yes,
we absolutely are.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.640
So the other key point about
Google Wallet for Digital

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.160
Goods is that in addition to
powering a number of great

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.910
external developers, Google
Wallet is the way to pay

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.920
across Google.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.130
So for any user who's completing
a transaction on

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.620
Google Play, Google Offers,
Google+, Google Voice, they're

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.550
all paying with stored

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.940
credentials from Google Wallet.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.570
And the great part about that is
that's really enabled us to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.210
scale up our Wallet user base
tremendously, which is

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.480
obviously an advantage to
developers looking to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.380
integrate because it makes sure
that a greater percentage

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.460
of your user base will be able
to get a single-click purchase

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.483
experience.

00:02:57.483 --> 00:03:00.240
MIHAI IONESCU: Sounds like an
easy to use and easy to

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.300
implement API.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.880
Do you have an example?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.380
Can we see a demo
how it works?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.900
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.960
So one of the integrators I've
mentioned on the previous

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.820
slide was Graphicly.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.660
They do digital content
distributions.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.460
Comic books are just one example
of what they sell.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.350
And I am now logged
into Graphicly

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.990
with my Google account.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.890
If I choose to purchase The
Walking Dead, I'm able to do

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.180
so very quickly from
their page.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.020
Here's the Buy Now button.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.680
By clicking that, it will now
invoke the Google Wallet for

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.270
Digital Goods API, which
should be loading.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.770
As you can see, the purchase
screen loads up

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.030
right over the content.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.040
So there's no redirect away.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.300
And you can also see that
because, again, as a user who

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.790
also purchases from Google
Play or Offers, my stored

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.300
credentials are available
right here, both

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.870
cards that is use.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.370
MIHAI IONESCU: So you choose
whatever card you want.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.350
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So I can
choose very quickly.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.310
And then very quickly complete
a purchase with

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.240
just a single click.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.480
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Very nice.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.410
It's nice that we gloss over the
window, and you can still

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.330
see what you're purchasing.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.045
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Right.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:09.010
MIHAI IONESCU: And it's good for
the website that the user

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.830
does not actually
leave the site.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.880
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Leave
the sites.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.060
MIHAI IONESCU: It's not taking
to another page.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.350
ARUNDHATI SINGH: It's much
less jarring for them.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.830
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.920
ARUNDHATI SINGH: And we do see
improved conversion from that.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.370
So one thing I'll point out just
before I talk a little

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.060
bit more about how this is
performed for Graphicly, is

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.090
that this confirmation screen
is optional for integrators.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.100
So it's up to them whether
they'd like to show it as an

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.260
additional confirmation.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.950
Or you can turn it off,
and then it is

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.980
literally just one screen.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.750
But to your point of the fact
that it's in context,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.520
Graphicly has seen, overall, 5%
increase in conversion from

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.050
implementing this flow, and
also 10 to 22% increase in

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.240
revenue per item depending on
the item, partially due to the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.780
friendliness of the
pricing scheme.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.732
MIHAI IONESCU: That's
very nice.

00:04:48.732 --> 00:04:50.340
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Yeah.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.521
So let me--

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:54.960
MIHAI IONESCU: So besides
Graphicly, and we've seen a

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.650
lot of big names on the previous
slide, big game

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.760
companies, are there other
use cases for this API?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.580
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.030
One of things we tend to see
with digital content is games

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.740
are often early integrators.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.010
But there are a wide variety
of use cases that can be

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.950
served with this type of
integration, so online

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.710
services, anything from
something like TaskRabbit to

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.830
match.com that you can
pay for online--

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.000
online apps and software;
games, as I've already

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.300
mentioned; paid content, so
music, videos, articles that

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.380
you pay for.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.240
Event tickets and non-profits
are all segments that we're

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.170
starting to work with
more broadly and are

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.220
very excited about.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.180
MIHAI IONESCU: I see this slide
is covering basically

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.830
the entire spectrum of digital
goods and services.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.570
What is the average
transaction size?

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.620
Do we have any numbers
around that?

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.350
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So that's
actually one of the great and

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.650
very interesting things as we
look at who's integrating and

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.790
who our user base is.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.250
Given the very flexible pricing
structure, we have

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.430
integrators whose typical
transaction price is $0.99 all

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.150
the way up to integrators whose
typical transaction is

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.030
hundreds of dollars.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.280
And again, it tends to vary
a little bit by industry.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.660
So when you're talking about
apps or online services, you

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.880
see higher ticket prices
versus games.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.010
But the pricing structure
as well as the overall

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.141
architecture support both.

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:12.960
PENG YING: Cool.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.430
One of the questions that we
hear a lot is when will Google

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.900
Wallet for Digital Goods be
available in my country?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.140
Can you speak about
internationalization at all

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.005
and where it's currently
available?

00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:23.800
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.320
So to start with, it's
something that is a

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.760
priority for us.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.040
Since launching, we've
opened up support to

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.720
over 18 seller countries.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.880
Now, one thing to point out is
that, in general, all of

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.560
Google Wallet products are
available online to buyers in

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.610
140 countries.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.780
But you can set up
as a seller.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.390
We support 18 countries
and 9 currencies.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.360
The process to get additional
countries added involves

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.880
making sure that we can
support that all

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.650
throughout our stack.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.610
It's something we continually
work to do.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.530
And we are looking to add
additional countries in the

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.860
next couple months.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.470
MIHAI IONESCU: Very
nice slide.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.630
I like the summary here
with the nice, simple

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.980
graphic right there.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.950
ARUNDHATI SINGH: With
all the flags.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:06.850
MIHAI IONESCU: With all
the flags, yes.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.840
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.470
PENG YING: So I don't know if
you can get into any more

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.320
detail about that.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.150
Like a lot of developers are
always asking, oh, why isn't

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.060
this available in Poland?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.880
Or why isn't this available
in the Czech Republic?

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.010
Or those countries.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.500
And I'm guessing there's a lot
of procedurals and regulations

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.826
that would have to comply
to before it can

00:07:24.826 --> 00:07:25.940
be available there.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.080
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.950
And as I mentioned, it is the
very top priority for us to

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:32.550
work through each of those so
that we can bring this support

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.040
to more and more developers.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.180
We are looking at launching four
additional countries in

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.030
the next month or two.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.510
So stay tuned for
more details.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.540
That's about as much as I can
say today about that.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.210
But you are right.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.470
We do have to evaluate on a
country-by-country basis what

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.810
is the licensing and the
regulatory position and make

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.200
sure that we're perfectly
set up.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.830
PENG YING: OK.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.850
So let's get into one of the new
features-- subscriptions.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.310
Can you tell us a little
bit about that?

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.230
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.990
So we're very excited
about subscriptions.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.160
We announced them at I/O.
And they are live

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.850
in production now.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.160
We have support for
monthly billing.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.000
And in addition to that, you
can support free trials are

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.790
prorated first month.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.160
One of the things I wanted to
mention is while we announced

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.520
subscriptions for external
developers at Google I/O, this

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.630
is the same subscriptions
platform that powers

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.490
subscriptions at Google,
whether you're buying a

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.910
subscription through Google or
YouTube for premium content or

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:24.910
even Google Storage, as
I've illustrated here,

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.110
Google Drive Storage.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.100
So in addition to being able to
support monthly billing and

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.659
these particular use cases,
integrators who integrate with

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.120
us will then be able to have
buyers manage their

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.720
subscriptions via the Google
Subscription management UIs.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.929
We also provide merchant
tools for that.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.980
And just one area of
subscriptions that I did want

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.540
to call out is we do have
support for dunning

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.250
management.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.648
PENG YING: What is dunning?

00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:50.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:50.114 --> 00:08:52.040
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So it's a
subscriptions-related term.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.220
But what it really means is
that when you've created a

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.790
relationship with your customer
and they've agreed

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.840
that they want your service
on an ongoing basis, but

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.440
something goes wrong-- their
credit card gets declined in a

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.170
few months--

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.990
we help you manage that process
so you don't lose that

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.610
subscriber.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.930
So the way that works in this
launch is that there is a

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:09.850
grace period.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.510
We notify the subscriber.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.980
We provide them a way for them
to update their payment

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.780
information and RUIs.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.920
And that'll apply to all future
subscription periods.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.342
MIHAI IONESCU: Got it.

00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:20.150
PENG YING: Cool.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.635
MIHAI IONESCU: Very exciting.

00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:21.450
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.305
We're very excited about
subscriptions.

00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:26.060
PENG YING: Where do you see the
future of Google Wallet

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:26.915
for Digital Goods going?

00:09:26.915 --> 00:09:29.110
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So as
always, it's hard to

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.590
speak to specific roadmaps.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.220
But there are a few things that
are on our mind overall

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.050
as a product that we can talk
to you about today.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.350
And I've listed just a few of
them here on the slide.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:44.980
So user challenges is one
for risk-based reasons.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.370
Basically, the ability to say,
re-enter your password to

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.770
complete this purchase or
provide the last four digits

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.930
of your credit card.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.200
We are also, as mentioned
earlier, looking at supporting

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.140
additional merchant countries
in the very near future.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.260
As mentioned, subscriptions is
something that we've launched

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.820
very recently at Google I/O. And
we'd like to continue to

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.160
extend and enhance
that offering.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.390
And one of the things that I
can say about that is we

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.650
absolutely are looking at
providing support for

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.020
additional subscription
billing periods.

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.380
A couple other tools to make--
so that's more in the core

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.110
product and in the
buyer experience.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.610
We're also looking at how can
we make it easier for

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.330
merchants and developers
to then manage

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.410
their day-to-day business.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.510
So we will be rolling out a
brand new merchant center with

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.560
improved UI and enhanced
functionality, including

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.470
support for better subscription
management.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.270
And also analytics to help you
better realize how your

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.640
business is performing.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.490
PENG YING: So you were talking
about user challenges before.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.100
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.590
PENG YING: And then I'm just
thinking about it.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.705
I don't quite understand how
that would simplify the flow.

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:50.420
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Right.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.540
PENG YING: What the
benefit of it is.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.100
ARUNDHATI SINGH: I'm glad you
asked that question because

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.530
it's an important one
to understand.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.920
The reason that user challenges
are an important

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.310
part of the experience is that
they enable us to complete a

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.220
higher percentage of
transactions that might

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.490
otherwise be flagged as risk
or friendly fraud.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:09.170
This is an issue we see
with digital goods.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.140
Now, a lot of things we've
done have enabled us to

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.940
streamline the purchase flow,
enabling you to have a longer

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.390
session so that users aren't
constantly prompted for login

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.900
before completing
the purchase.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.560
But a key component of that is
that to make sure that it's

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.840
not someone from your family
making an unauthorized

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.010
purchase on your behalf or that
your account hasn't been

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.150
taken over.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.920
These challenges are a really
low-friction way to make sure

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.430
that we can continue to enable
that more seamless experience

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.896
in the very broad majority
of cases.

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:37.690
PENG YING: Got it.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.760
So we're trying to reduce the
friendly fraud and like--

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.150
ARUNDHATI SINGH: We're trying
to reduce friendly fraud.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.980
And again, make sure that
a higher percentage of a

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.050
merchant's transactions go
through as opposed to being

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.445
flagged by risk and failing.

00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:49.080
MIHAI IONESCU: Protect
both the merchant--

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.320
ARUNDHATI SINGH: And
the consumer.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.920
MIHAI IONESCU: And
the consumer.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.316
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:11:52.316 --> 00:11:54.471
PENG YING: Cool.

00:11:54.471 --> 00:11:56.510
And I think that's pretty
much all the

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.520
questions that we have.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.626
We didn't get to interrogate
you there.

00:11:58.626 --> 00:11:59.270
ARUNDHATI SINGH: No.

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.030
I love talking about this
product, super excited about

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:05.320
it, and happy to answer any
questions that developers or

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.910
prospective developers
may have about it.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.365
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:08.790
Let's look at online
questions.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.580
We actually got a few.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.630
PENG YING: So if somebody wanted
to integrate this,

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.650
where would they go for
information or resources?

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.430
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Sure.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.815
PENG YING: What's the URL?

00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:19.780
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So if you go
to wallet.google.com, you'll

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.080
find information about all
of our online products.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.510
And this particular product, as
mentioned, is Google Wallet

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.400
for Digital Goods.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.380
PENG YING: Got it.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.630
MIHAI IONESCU: Thank you.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:30.900
All right.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.650
Time for online submitted
questions.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.320
I'm looking at our Moderator
page right now.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.650
And of course, we have a
question about launching in

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.110
more countries and currencies.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.100
And the country mentioned is
Poland, which we actually

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.852
picked as an example.

00:12:45.852 --> 00:12:46.640
PENG YING: Psychic.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.211
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:50.800
ARUNDHATI SINGH: I will say that
we know that there's a

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.980
very active developer
base in Poland.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.660
And it is very close to the
top of the priority list.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.920
And so hopefully, you'll hear
something exciting in the next

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.855
month or two.

00:12:59.855 --> 00:13:03.010
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.610
Have a-- you want to
do the next one?

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.920
PENG YING: Yeah, I'll
do the next one.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.320
So Stephen from New York asks,
"Can I use the Digital Goods

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.860
Wallet API to support
my blog?"

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.050
ARUNDHATI SINGH: You absolutely
can use this API to

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.830
support a blog.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.570
Just like you would do for a
normal e-commerce integration,

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.710
you can sign up for a merchant
account, again, at

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.120
wallet.google.com.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.050
Once you've signed up for a
merchant account, you are

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.540
absolutely free to use this
API to integrate with your

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.175
blog and ask for support.

00:13:33.175 --> 00:13:36.290
PENG YING: Are there any caveats
with support versus

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.450
donation versus contribution?

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.550
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So, a great
thing to clarify.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.770
In some of our additional
products, we do make a

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.360
distinction between donations
and political contributions.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.420
So we provide Donate buttons.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.480
But to use those,
you have to be a

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.990
registered 5013(c) nonprofit.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.000
And similarly with our
Contribute buttons, you have

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.040
to be a registered federal
political candidate or a

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.360
political action committee.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.220
But to be able to just use this
API and to be set up as a

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.680
merchant, you can use that
for a support use case.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.545
You just won't be entitled
to use the Donate

00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:12.380
or Contribute buttons.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.622
PENG YING: Got it.

00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:16.740
MIHAI IONESCU: Let's move
on to the next question.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.220
This one is from James
who's testing

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.470
subscription in the sandbox.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:28.380
And he wants to know "As the
user places the order, how can

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.440
he cancel the subscription right
away?" He's trying to

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.765
test the entire API.

00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:37.590
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So users are
actually able to cancel

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.940
subscriptions by going
into their personal

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.450
Wallet accounts online.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.190
So if I've made a purchase on
your site or if I've made a

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.690
purchase on Google Play, I can
then log into my account at

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.910
wallet.google.com.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.660
And I'll see all of my
subscriptions listed there.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.740
There's a subscription-specific
view.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.810
And I can cancel from there.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:57.790
MIHAI IONESCU: And you
can click and cancel?

00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:58.420
ARUNDHATI SINGH: I can
click and cancel.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.386
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:14:59.386 --> 00:15:00.640
And then I--

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.015
for the API, then James
will get a callback.

00:15:05.015 --> 00:15:05.660
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Yes.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.350
So from a merchant
perspective--

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.975
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:10.030
From his perspective he wants
to know when that happens.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.140
ARUNDHATI SINGH: How
he can test that.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.451
MIHAI IONESCU: How
he can test that.

00:15:12.451 --> 00:15:15.234
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So the minute
that a user cancels, we do

00:15:15.234 --> 00:15:17.830
fire off a post back to the
merchant informing them so

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.830
that they can update their
subscriber databases.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.812
And make sure to update that
particular user's account on

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:25.272
their site.

00:15:25.272 --> 00:15:27.070
MIHAI IONESCU: I think
we have one more.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.180
You wanna take it?

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:28.960
PENG YING: We do?

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.570
I have not seen it.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:30.760
Oh, maybe we do.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.965
MIHAI IONESCU: OK, just--

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:32.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.220
PENG YING: Why don't
you take this one?

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.100
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.140
People are submitting
it to live, so yes.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:36.760
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Great.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.650
MIHAI IONESCU: So I have a
question coming from Canada.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.570
"How will Google Wallet stay
competitive with devices ISIS

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.080
in US and worldwide?"

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.120
ARUNDHATI SINGH: OK, so this
particular product is actually

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.440
aimed at the Digital Goods
Market, Google Wallet for

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.630
Digital Goods.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:57.690
So again, online services,
online apps and software,

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.570
tickets and events, games.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.070
So it's not directly competitive
to ISIS or Square.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.165
PENG YING: OK.

00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:08.410
And I guess if the question's
related to the physical wallet

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.490
or the tap-and-pay wallet,
then none of

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:12.970
us our subject experts.

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.305
And we will bring on somebody
from Wallet again to answer

00:16:17.305 --> 00:16:17.940
that later on.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:19.950
ARUNDHATI SINGH: And I believe
there was a recent session

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:22.660
done with Robin Dua that's
probably available online to

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.110
go back and look at.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.200
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.800
So you can probably check out
last week's Wallet session.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.930
I think we covered something
similar to that when we were

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.360
talking about ISIS and MCX and
other initiatives as well.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.430
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Right.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.850
But just to be clear again,
for this product it's not

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.330
directly competitive
to either.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.590
And we are seeing very good
traction in the market with

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.980
it, which we're excited about.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.780
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.370
Looks like we keep receiving
questions live as we speak.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:49.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.920
MIHAI IONESCU: Let me look
at the next one.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.760
So the next one has to do with
subscription periods.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.580
And in particular, it looks
like three months and six

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.030
months are quite popular.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:01.110
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Right.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.790
So as I mentioned, right now
we support monthly billing.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.490
But we are absolutely looking
for feedback from our

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.300
developers of what additional
periods are most important

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.980
because this is something we'd
like to continue to enhance.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.930
So please do send that feedback
through our Developer

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.760
Relations team or
on our forums.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.690
Whether weekly, biweekly,
quarterly, six months, or

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.130
annual, what are your
priorities?

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.630
And we can look to
incorporate that.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.830
PENG YING: Are you doing
anything like

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.030
merchant-initiated
recurrences?

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.710
So I would say I want a
bill something like

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.160
12 times in a year.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.540
But then I can bill at any
period or at any rate as long

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.080
as I submit an API request.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.190
ARUNDHATI SINGH: So at this
point, we will do the

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.510
initiation of the charges on
behalf of the merchant.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.180
And it will be based on an
ongoing subscription schedule

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.010
that's established upfront
with the user.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.510
PENG YING: Got it.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.905
But--

00:17:53.905 --> 00:17:54.300
OK.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.286
Cool.

00:17:55.286 --> 00:17:57.460
ARUNDHATI SINGH: But again,
that's what we're really

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.155
looking for in terms of feedback
from developers via

00:18:01.155 --> 00:18:04.580
our forums what are the use
cases you'd like to see us

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.022
enhance so we can
help prioritize.

00:18:07.022 --> 00:18:08.696
PENG YING: Sounds good

00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:10.690
MIHAI IONESCU: Keep getting
more questions about

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.625
international availability.

00:18:11.625 --> 00:18:12.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.440
ARUNDHATI SINGH: We answered
that one to death.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.375
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Absolutely.

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.400
MIHAI IONESCU: Things--

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.390
more countries are coming.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.992
ARUNDHATI SINGH: It's absolutely
a priority for us.

00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:22.510
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.155
So I think this is it.

00:18:24.155 --> 00:18:26.880
We're getting closer to
our allocated time.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.070
So thanks everyone for
watching again.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.450
And thanks, Arundhati,
for stopping by.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.200
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Thank you.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.300
Very happy to be here.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.210
MIHAI IONESCU: And we'll
see you next time.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:37.810
Bye.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.710
ARUNDHATI SINGH: Take care.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.310
PENG YING: That's it.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:19:08.667
