00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:07.607
- I was scared now, because
if he's not pressing charges,

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.409
that means he wants to kill me.

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.110
[laughter]

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.781 align:end position:100%
So me, out of paranoia,
I got hooked on crack.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.683
[laughter]

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.585
I mean, I got hooked on crack!

- Every time I see him, he

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:03.996
He's fucking

Ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:07.500

<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.006
- My name is Felipe Esparza.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.843
I grew up, like,
five miles from here,

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:21.014
in Boyle Heights,
the capital of East Los Angeles.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.819
What's up, fool?

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:32.157
And this is how
I became a comedian one night.

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:33.693
I've always wanted
to be a comedian,

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.594
since I was a little kid.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:37.930
My friend Jackie Escalera,
he had a--

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.366 align:start position:0%
one of those little
record players you--

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.535 align:start position:0%
you plug in,
and we heard

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.971
Bill Cosby
for the first time.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.373
And I said,
"Man, that's funny."

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.674
And I memorized it,
and I said,

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:51.143
"I wanna be just like him."

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.378
Not anymore, but--

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.814
[laughter]

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:57.050
But I wanted to be
just like him.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.818
So I grew up, and...

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:02.388
I got older, and I didn't follow
my dream, you know,

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.890 align:start position:0%
to be a comedian,
so I end up--got--

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.827
I got jumped to a--
I got jumped into a gang.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.795
I didn't really wanna get
jumped into a gang,

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:12.865
but I was hanging around
with them too much,

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:15.501
so then one day they asked me,
"So what's up, Batman?

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.169
You wanna get jumped in?"

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.539
And they punched me,
and I got jumped in.

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.507
[laughter]

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.909
And my name was Batman.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.546
They chose Batman because
I wore Batman shirts every day,

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.549
and they were
just underwear, though.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.683
They were Underoos.

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:32.985
[laughter]

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:36.189
So one night, you know,
my friends and I, we know--

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.692
We liked going
to the drive-in movie theaters,

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:42.095
because you could sneak
in one person--and Mexicans,

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.330
we're used to sneaking in
people anyway, so.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.098
[laughter]

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:49.401
So we're drinking
at the drive-in theater,

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:51.604
watching the "Terminator 2,"

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.439
that's how long it goes,

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.274
and I love
the "Terminator 2", man.

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:56.942
I love all the "Terminator"s.

00:02:56.942 --> 00:03:02.782
'Cause the story about somebody
that they hate you so much,

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:05.051
that they're gonna bring
somebody who's not even

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.586
fucking born...

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:07.954
[laughter]

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.122
To kill your fucking mom.

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.857
[laughter]

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:15.561
I said, "I got to watch
this shit."

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:19.798
So, you know, we're--we're,
you know, little gangster guys,

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:22.802
you know, my friend Donald
and my friend Bobo.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.136
You know, they say,

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:26.973
"Hey, Batman,
you wanna smoke some PCP?"

00:03:26.973 --> 00:03:29.976
I said, "Fuck it, why not?

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:33.245
Let's get
into the 'Terminator.'"

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:38.784
So we're smoking PCP
at the drive-in theater,

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:43.255
and I don't know
how we made it home

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.090
without killing anybody.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.827
But we made it home safe,
thank God,

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.161
but when we got
to the neighborhood,

00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:51.130
there was, like,
a lot of people there.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.966
They were partying; it was,
like, 1:30 in the morning.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:55.934
Everybody was--
The whole neighborhood was out;

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:58.003
there were no police,
because the police doesn't come

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.639
to our neighborhood at night,

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.243
and there was this guy there
who was, like--

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:07.079
I like to say,
'cause he was older than me--

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.449
I was only 21;
he was 30.

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:14.020
And in my neighborhood,
if you're 30, your life is over.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.088
[laughter]

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.856
So I looked at him
like an old man,

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.791
because nobody in my
neighborhood really made it

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.193
to be 25.

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:24.497
So he should've been dead
a long time ago.

00:04:24.497 --> 00:04:27.332
So he--he don't like me,
because I'm a popular guy

00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:30.303
in the neighborhood;
I'm funny; I'm likable.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.838
And he goes,
"What's up, Batman?

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.273
I heard you beat up
my friend Batman."

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.308
And I did.

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:37.710
Um, this guy
came out of prison,

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.880
and he said, "I heard
they call you Batman,"

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.549
I said, "Yeah, well,
some people do."

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:47.052
"Well, I'm the real Batman."

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.222
And I said, "Whoa, you know,
I could be the Joker right now."

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.791
[laughter]

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.893
Penguin, Riddler...

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.897
So him and I end up fighting,
and didn't--

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.667
It didn't go too well for him.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.970
So this guy goes, "You know,
um, that's not right,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.839
the way you beat up my homey,"
and I said,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.908
"Well, I didn't really
wanna fight him

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.410
for the name, you know?"

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.746
So he ended up punching me
in the face right away,

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.248
and I was on PCP,

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:19.084
so I don't know if he punched me
or his friend,

00:05:19.084 --> 00:05:21.253
'cause I was looking
at two people, you know?

00:05:21.253 --> 00:05:24.690
[laughter]

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.426
And...he hit me really hard.

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.862
My eyes closed right away.
I was, like--

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:31.597
you know, like Rocky.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:34.166
"Cut me, Mick," you know?

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:36.669
So he starts punching me more
in the face,

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:38.771
the other eye, busted lip.

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.172
I can't fight.

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:43.742
I might be 6'1", 270 pounds,

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:45.277
but this is just for looks.

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:47.046
[laughter]

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.548
This is just...armor.

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:51.083
[laughter]

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:54.721
This is a shield
to hide that I'm a big pussy.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:59.225
So he's punching me,
and nobody's helping me;

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.293
like, every--

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.394
Nobody's watching.
It was too soon.

00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:05.964
Nobody was yelling
"World Star," or they would.

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:07.467
There was just
the same stuff, like,

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:12.305
"Man, could this be the end
of the Dark Knight?"

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:18.811
He is strangling me now,
like, I can't breathe,

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:22.047
and he's, like, strangling me,
and nobody's helping me.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:24.550
Now, he's really
choking me to death.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.885
So I didn't know what to do,

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.488
so I ended up biting
half his ear off.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.726
Before Tyson, who--
He hacked me.

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.896
So now I'm, like,
chewing his ear,

00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:40.966
like Ozzy Osbourne, you know?

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:42.968
Running to the--
You know, crazy train...

00:06:42.968 --> 00:06:44.470
I was like, "Fun!"

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:49.842
I don't remember this part,
because I blanked out,

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:52.477
of course, because of the PCP
and the alcohol,

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:56.983
but my friends told me that
I ended up taking my belt off

00:06:56.983 --> 00:06:59.519
and started whipping him,
also, in the streets.

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.956
So he had like
a "Hecho en México"

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.324
on his forehead.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:09.094
[laughter]

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:12.765
He ends up going
to the hospital, and he--

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.366
He didn't press charges,
you know?

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:16.335
Because he could've
pressed charges.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:19.538
He didn't press charges
because he's not a rat.

00:07:19.538 --> 00:07:22.174
You know? He's a--
He's a hardcore guy,

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:24.043
and I was like, fuck--
I was scared now,

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.645
because if he's not
pressing charges,

00:07:26.645 --> 00:07:28.214 align:end position:100%
that means
he wants to kill me.

00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:30.182
[laughter]

00:07:30.182 --> 00:07:33.786 align:end position:100%
So me, out of paranoia,
I got hooked on crack.

00:07:33.786 --> 00:07:36.721
[laughter]

00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:38.890
I mean, I got hooked on crack!

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.726
I was walking
around the neighborhood

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:42.895
like Jeff Dunham
with no puppets.

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:46.065
[laughter and applause]

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:52.037
Tweaking hard.

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:53.872
And I was still wearing
the same shirt

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:56.642
from the bloody night,

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.978
so I looked like a walker.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.747
So I'm scared, you know?

00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:04.249
My mom was scared, because...

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:07.185
she knows that they're after me.

00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:11.190
So I come from a family
where nobody says, "I'm sorry,"

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.158
Nobody had ever said,
"I'm sorry."

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:14.826
My mom never told me,
"I'm sorry."

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:17.062
My dad never said,
"I'm sorry."

00:08:17.062 --> 00:08:19.198
So my Mom was praying,

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.401
and this priest
comes to my house,

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:24.203
Father Greg Boyle,

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:27.039
from Homeboy Industries.

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.375
He tells me that,
"Your mom told me

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:34.079
that you're walking around
with a loaded pistol."

00:08:34.079 --> 00:08:36.782
And then I was,
"Who told you that?"

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.584
"Well, you've been telling
everyone in the neighborhood

00:08:39.584 --> 00:08:41.720
that you have a loaded pistol."

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.590
So I give him the loaded pistol,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.459
and he puts me in rehab,
but I don't wanna go to rehab,

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:50.962
because I feel like
I'm pussing out, you know?

00:08:50.962 --> 00:08:53.399
Like, "Rehab?
I could take this guy.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:55.301
You know, I already bit
bit half his ear off."

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:57.369
[laughter]

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:01.907
So I go to rehab,
and I have a black eye

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:03.041
from the fight, you know?

00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:04.410
I'm all--I'm all messed up.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.479
I'm like a young--
I'm a loser, what I am.

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.449
I didn't mean anything--
I'm a fucking loser.

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.652
And I'm there in rehab
with heroin addicts,

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:17.623
and I'm praying every night;
I'm crying every night.

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:19.325
I don't know, I'm too--
I'm, like--

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:22.561
I wanna escape, but I don't know
how to get home.

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.599
And this real nice guy--
I'll never forget his name--

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:29.602
from the valley--
this Irish guy named Tim.

00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.404
He comes up to me one day,
and he goes,

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.840
"Felipe, what did you ever
wanna be in your life?"

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.009
And I said,
"Before a crackhead?"

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:39.411
[laughter]

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:43.114
"I wanted to be a comedian.
I wanted to be a comedian."

00:09:43.114 --> 00:09:44.984
And he goes, "Why don't you
write that down?

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.251
"So write down five things

00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:48.654
that you wanna
accomplish in life."

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:50.189
And nobody's ever
told me that, like,

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:51.524
five things
to accomplish in life.

00:09:51.524 --> 00:09:52.825
Nobody had told me--

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:55.694
I never thought I would live
this long to be here,

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:58.530
at Cheetah's,
and not being kicked out.

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.632
[laughter]

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:01.667
And, so--

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.970
[cheers and applause]

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.439
I wrote down,
"I wanna be a comedian,"

00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:10.542
and the second thing was,
"I wanna be happy,"

00:10:10.542 --> 00:10:13.178
and the third one was,
"Because I love Olive Garden,

00:10:13.178 --> 00:10:14.513
I wanna go to Italy."

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:18.117
[laughter]

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.118
And four and five,
I didn't write shit,

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:22.721
because I thought--I couldn't
think of anything else, man.

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:25.691
[laughter]

00:10:28.193 --> 00:10:31.062
So I--I graduate
out of rehab--

00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:34.332
you know,
my first time graduating.

00:10:34.332 --> 00:10:38.703
I got a one year diploma
for being sober.

00:10:38.703 --> 00:10:42.708
I come back home,
and who do I see?

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:45.411
Half ear.

00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.345
I see the guy I fought,
you know?

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:51.216
And I wanted to tell him
I'm sorry, you know?

00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:53.252
Because I really was sorry,

00:10:53.252 --> 00:10:55.320
even though
he started the fight,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.423
but I really felt sorry
'cause I was sober.

00:10:58.423 --> 00:11:02.494
And I remember
he came up to me, and--

00:11:02.494 --> 00:11:05.231
Fuck, man.

00:11:05.231 --> 00:11:06.665
He wanted to fight.

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:08.767
[laughter]

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:11.170
He said, "I'ma kill you!"

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:11.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
 "

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:11.303 align:start size:78% position:22%

n m-

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:15.241
I turn the other cheek;

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:17.176
like, I didn't even fight.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.445
I just gave him my back,

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:22.448
and he kicked the Bible
off my hand, you know?

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:24.116
Like, "You're not
a fucking Christian.

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:25.584
You're a [bleep]."
You know?

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:28.287
And I was like, "Ugh!"
I held it in, you know?

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:30.523
Not to do nothing to him,

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:34.126
And then I ran inside the house,
and I was crying.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.394
I said, "Man, everybody
gonna think

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.629
I'm a big [bleep],
a big pussy."

00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:40.565
I took my shirt off,
threw my Bible in the air,

00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:43.802
and I ran outside,
and my dad clotheslined me,

00:11:43.802 --> 00:11:45.437
"What are you doing?

00:11:45.437 --> 00:11:48.040
Don't you wanna be a comedian?"

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.642
And I said,
"Oh, yeah, I do. I do."

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:53.245
So I went back inside
and didn't do nothing.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:54.813
And I'm proud of that,

00:11:54.813 --> 00:11:57.215
because I probably would've
killed him, and--

00:11:57.215 --> 00:11:59.418
If you're alive
and you're watching this,

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:01.587
I hope your life
turned out great.

00:12:01.587 --> 00:12:04.256
Mine did okay.
I'm very sorry.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.323
Thank you very much.
