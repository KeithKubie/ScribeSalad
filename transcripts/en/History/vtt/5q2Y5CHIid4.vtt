00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.919
[music playing]

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.796
We're here at Speed Week
at the Bonneville Salt Flats.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:06.506
This place is huge.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.675
There's all kinds of extreme
machines here, not to mention,

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:12.637
its fair share of
just cool ass cars.

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:14.931
Dude, get that pickup truck.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.599
Yeah, old Ford, huh?

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.436
It's like a '27, '29, '30?

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.271
That thing is cool.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.605
That's probably
the rig they brought

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:23.773
out here to drive around.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:24.941
Oh, just to
drive around, yeah.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:26.109
Oh, wow.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.777
Old school Studebaker, dude.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.446
And there's the stock one
sitting right in front of it.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.072
Look at that.

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:32.824
That used to be that.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:34.909
That's a different year, but
they're pretty much the same.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.413
And this is a sought after body
from the factory, aerodynamic,

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:39.497
made for Bonneville.

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:40.665
How are you doing, bud?

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:41.583
I'm Ryan.
- Ryan?

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:42.917
Shawn.
- I'm sorry.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.002
I didn't mean to stop
you from working.

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:45.044
Hi, Shawn.
Kevin.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:46.463
Kevin, nice to meet you, man.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.339
Shawn, you got a minute
to talk about your ride?

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.091
Yeah, sure.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.093
I was telling Kevin how this
body style Studebaker is sought

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:55.805
after for basically one of the
first streamlined door slammers

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.682
from the factory
made for Bonneville.

00:00:57.682 --> 00:00:59.934
You look at a
'53 Studebaker, you

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.020
look at a '53 Chev,
or a '53 Ford,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.730
look at the front end of them.
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.023
The Chevy or the
Ford is like a brick.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:06.232
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.817
They were way
ahead of their time.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:09.694
What stock motor did you
say would be in this one?

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:10.612
289.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.905
Like a little 289?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.407
The Studebaker 289,
not the Ford 289.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.494
Now I know there's not a
stock 289 that's still sitting.

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:18.870
Do you mind if we
look under the hood?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.038
No, sure.

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:20.789
You give me a hand
lifting it off?

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:22.081
Oh, hell, yeah.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.792
Well, hat's off
on the color, man.

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.293
It really is beautiful.
- Thanks.

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:26.544
It's a classy color.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:27.545
It stands out, and
it's still classy.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.588
Wow.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.924
Yeah, that's not a 289, Ryan.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.509
Oh, what motor's that?

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.968
- 515.
- 515.

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:36.596
What's the horsepower
putting out on it now?

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.225
1173 flywheel,
about 990 rear wheel.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.726
Wow.

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:43.436
That's over 1,000 horsepower
in this little car.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:44.813
Yeah, that's amazing.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:47.524
The car still
holds a record today.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:48.399
What was the record?

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.276
240.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.321
240 in a door slammer.

00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:54.572
Wow.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:57.158
- We're going to be chasing 250.
- 250.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:58.827
John, man, good
luck out there.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:01:59.828
Well, thank you.

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:00.870
I hope you get the record.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.871
I appreciate it.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.623
This is one bad car, dude.
