00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.400
Hey guys, welcome back! I'm hanging with my brother again today. Last time we were together

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:09.000
we took the battery right on my car, cracked it open, and we harvested the lead and the sulfuric acid out of it which is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.910
what we got here today.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.620
But it's really really crude and what we want to do is refine this. We want to melt this down and make

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.500
lead ingots and this sulfuric acid is really dilute we wanted to concentrate that as much as possible,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.440
so that is what we are doing today.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.199
Alright guys,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.249
so when we took the acid out of the battery yesterday, you saw how dirty it was; it was really cloudy,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.029
it was really black,

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.129
and I think that's because of the lead sulfate was

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.299
contaminating the mixture. Now that it's sat for a couple of days, all that is settled down to the bottom,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.200
we're left with a relatively clear mixture, which should be water and sulfuric acid. Now the idea is to boil off the water and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.950
leave the sulfuric acid behind. Now guys, obviously this is a lot of

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.840
sulfuric acid to try and concentrate at once, so rather than doing the whole thing, we're just going to do a little sample here.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.840
I'm going to dip down in there in this container will fill up about

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.480
3/4 of a cup so we can put this on a burner, get it up hot enough that [we] can boil off the water, and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.058
this thing should not crack as long as we don't thermally shock it by cooling it too quickly.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.399
So I picked up a little burner here; It was about 20 bucks.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.749
I'm going to stick a pot on there just to help collect any spills if there are any and then set our

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.599
Pyrex container of Sulfuric acid right on top there. Now,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
let's crank this up about as high as it goes; that's only going to reach about 100 degrees

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.789
Celsius because the water will start blowing off; and what we're looking for is white vapor to start coming up the top.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.069
It's been an hour and a half on our battery acid

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.449
and you can see we've dropped from 3/4 of a cup down to 1/4 of a cup. That means this thing is pretty much

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.519
Concentrated sulfuric acid and that's confirmed by all this white vapor coming off the top there, and what's at this point?

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.420
We do not want to let it run any longer so it's good time to go and turn off the heat and let this thing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.299
start cooling down.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.969
So with all these fumes vaping off you can see why this is important to do this outside or under a fume hood because these

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.700
fumes are very toxic and they sting the lungs when you breathe them in. I don't have a whole lot of acid, and it's a

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.240
pretty tall glass, so as long as it stays on the bottom and doesn't tip over this should be able to store relatively well for

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.720
A long time. But how cool is that?
Concentrated sulfuric acid from a car battery. And over here,

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.078
this is all the lead we were able to extract out of those pouches you saw and all of the

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.849
individual cells. And come check this out, you can next see how the different plates work now. These are the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.409
plates that were inside the vinyl pouches and you can see it's coated with lead.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.160
I think this is the stuff that we're after. I'm not sure if the lead oxide will melt down into lead. If there's anything salvageable

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.840
from that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.000
but we're just going to put the whole thing in the pot and

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.090
melt it down and see what we get. So, we're outside with the lead plates.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.060
We've got a stainless steel container; because this can take a lot of heat.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.229
We're going to melt the lead into that using the gas blaster propane torches, that we made in a previous

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.340
project, and see how much lead we can collect and salvage into these mini muffin trays as [it drips].

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.840
Woo! Toasty warm! Crazy hot!

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.300
We got some lead there... doesn't seem like a whole lot.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.680
Alright! That's a pretty good one

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.219
We're going to just nuke all the leftovers and see if we can get any lead just to drizzle down to the bottom and then

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.490
pour [that out of ingots.] I'm really surprised that we're not getting more than we are,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.820
I thought there would just be a ton, but that's how it's going.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.900
Yay! Feels like we're getting more!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.180
Oh yeah!

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.040
That looks a little bit dirty. Looks like there's more than just lead in there.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.980
So guys, we did get some pure lead and gets near the beginning of our melt. As it progressed,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.499
I think this got so hot, we mixed in some other kind of metal alloys, and these are still still raging hot right now if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.250
I jiggle this pan, you can see it's actually still in liquid form.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.419
We just have some impurities on the top and we get rid of that, and then we've got some nice lead ingots.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.999
Sweet! It looks like this might work after all!

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.040
So let's just go ahead and knock these out, and then knock them out on the sidewalk here.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.670
So these came out really nice, I mean, that's really pretty. Look at that.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.079
Now check this out guys, these are all the mini metal biscuits

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.190
we got out of our car battery, but they are full of impurities, so to purify them a little bit more

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.670
I'm going to remelt these right here in this pot, and all the impurities should float to the top.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.799
We should be able to skim those off and then record them.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.809
Wow! Dang, that's heavy! Wow! That's really heavy!

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.140
So, there you go.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.470
We came out with about eight

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.959
Mini-muffin lead ingots from our car battery. So these things are looking pretty good. The next thing to do is just let them harden

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.560
up a little bit and then douse them in water to let them cool down, and we are done.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.050
And there you have it guys! Eight

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.420
mini-muffin lead ingots from our car battery.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.070
Theoretically, they should be cold enough for you can reach in and grab them. So Mark is going to demonstrate that for us.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.740
There you have it, it's pretty weighty. How does that feel? (Weighty-wise?) It does feel really weighty. Let me see the rest of them. Oh,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.679
that's warm water. That's really warm. Ooo! Want me to stop? Oh, you're pretty much done now. Hahaha!

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.940
Here we go!

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.140
Whoa! (Wow!)

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.809
Oh yeah, yeah, definitely has a good amount of weight to it. Leads are really heavy metal;

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.690
it's very dense and that's why almost everything metal floats on top of it.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.920
Which makes it really easy to clean it up because you can just melt it, scrape the [slag] off the top and you come up

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.849
with relatively pure ingots like this.
Alright guys, now there is some backyard science for you.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.640
We took a car battery, which my brother helped me hack out of my own car,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.360
and we have converted it into these stacks of beautiful lead ingots and

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.539
Concentrated sulfuric acid. If you don't know what this stuff is for yet,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.659
stay tuned because we got some really cool mad science experiments using this stuff.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.950
So there you go guys! A lot of really cool things that we can salvage out of a car battery. And don't forget we have

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.349
a ton more battery acid that we can concentrate in

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:02.289
sulfuric acid very cool stuff, very good to know in times of emergency because sulfuric acid is kind of one of the building blocks of

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.939
Chemical Society. You can make a ton of stuff with this chemical so thanks for joining us for this experiment guys

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.460
and we'll be looking for it in a next project video. Talk to you then.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.970
He's so random.
