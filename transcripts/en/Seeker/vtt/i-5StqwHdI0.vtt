00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.480
The family is gathered around the table, the
question rings out: white meat or dark?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.710
Your soul struggles with the decision, shall
you follow Yoda or Palpatine?

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.020
The YING OR THE YANG?!

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.490
WHAT TO DOOOO?!

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.919
Meat eaters of the world are full of opinions
on rare versus well done, lamb or mutton,

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:26.919
light versus dark.

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.440
There are so many delicious choices!

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.780
So when you're carving up a bird, does science
even care which meat is which?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.460
Why is meat that color in the first place?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
WHAT MEAT IS?!?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.539
I'll use the turkey as an example, because
it's far easier to see the meaty differences.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.809
Turkey breasts are made up of fast-twitch
muscle fibers.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.230
They're made for short bursts of energy and
tire quickly; they become the white meat.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.510
The legs, on the other hand, are slow-twitch
muscles; they're used all the time, and can

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.690
work for long periods.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.000
When you're eating meat, you're eating these
two muscle types.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.410
The color of meat is determined by the amount
of myoglobin the muscle fibers have in them.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.520
You've probably heard of hemoglobin, it's
a molecule on red blood cells that helps carry

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.850
oxygen; myoglobin is the same molecule, it's
also known as "muscle hemoglobin."

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.200
To determine how MUCH myoglobin, you have
to consider what the muscles of the animal

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.780
are doing all day.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.880
Slow-twitch muscles that are used all the
time need lots of oxygen and therefore have

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.340
lots of myoglobin.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.460
Example: cattle and pigs spend a lot of time
standing and walking, so their meat is pink

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.530
or red -- a rare steak has lots of myoglobin
up in there.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.580
Chickens and turkeys spend their time standing,
and almost NO time flying around.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.780
Thus, their legs will be filled with fast-twitch
muscles, (YOU SAY ABOVE THAT THEIR LEGS ARE

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.360
SLOW-TWITCH…) because they're using them
a lot.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.450
Their breasts and wings, though, kinda weak
fast-twitch muscles -- less myoglobin and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.930
therefore lighter in color.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.100
Now ducks -- ducks fly and swim all the time!

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.979
So duck breasts and wings and legs are all
slow-twitch, dark muscles.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.460
Speaking of swimming, fish meat would be considered
"darker" around the tail or fins -- because

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.790
those move the most.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.930
Ocean fish like tuna swim ALL the time, so
they're much darker than say, a catfish which

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.409
slinks around slowly.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.290
Humans have a mix of the two depending if
they're say, sprinters (fast-twitch) or distance

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.480
runners (slow-twitch).

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.830
I don't know why that would be helpful.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.870
I dunno... you know... you get really hungry.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.290
When you cook a fast-twitch muscle its myoglobin
changes color depending on the temperature.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.090
As it undergoes a chemical change, the myoglobin
can no longer hold oxygen, and the iron atoms

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.400
at the center of the protein's structure loses
an electron.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.070
That chemical change forms a hemichrome -- for
the brown of medium cooked meat, and as heat

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.060
rises more it becomes metmyoglobin… which
is a brownish-grey.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.330
White meat doesn't have the myoglobin concentration
to color the meat, so it looks more translucent,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.420
and as it cooks, the muscle fibers, which
are normally bound up in tight coils, uncoil

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.270
-- or denature; the water leaks out and the
meat becomes an opaque white.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.120
Because of the way the muscles are used, they're
going to taste different when cooked.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.300
The white meat is thinner, less dense, and
is more tender -- so it can be cooked more

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300
quickly.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.030
The denser, darker meats take longer -- which
is why white meat tends to come out more dry

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.030
at Thanksgiving.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.030
It's difficult!

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.659
But when you fry a meat, the juice is held
inside -- so fried chicken breasts are still

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.659
deeeelectible!

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.521
When it comes to which is BETTER that's up
to you.

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:25.000
A study in the European Journal of Nutrition
said taurine, found in dark poultry meat,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.860
could lower coronary heart disease in some
women.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.819
All in all, white meat is lower in saturated
fat but slathering gravy on the white to combat

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.689
its dry texture… kind of scraps the benefits.

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.779
Dark meat is higher in saturated fats, but
contains a lot more vitamins as well as iron,

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.240
zinc and other minerals!

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:53.130
So which do you prefer, white meat or dark?
