00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.040
[music playing]

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.040
A young girl who might be
interested in pursuing magic

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.120
just might not even think
of it as a possibility

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.710
because the magician she sees
on television are all men.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.120
[music playing]

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.540
I first got started in
magic when I was 10 years old.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.040
I joined the society
of young magicians.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.210
And I was the only girl who
was a part of the group.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.580
Magic has a woman problem.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.750
The tradition of magic
that is practiced now

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.750
evolved from the late 18th
and early 19th century,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.250
when there were women,
but they were assistants.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.330
But they were actually very,
very skilled magicians.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.380
And it's built into the
art, the way the magician

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.750
and the assistant interact.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.880
The powerlessness of the
assistant-- which is actually

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.420
just a ruse to make you
think she's powerless

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.620
and strengthen the trick.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.620
We enter into the mystery,
and we are transformed.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.790
If you look at the women
of the vaudeville era,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.120
they were doing magic.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.920
They were plucking
coins out of the air

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.120
and manipulating
cards and reading

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.920
minds, all on their own.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.380
Adelaide Hermann was the first
successful female magician.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.580
And in 1899, Adelaide,
at the age of 46,

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.290
debuted her solo magic
act in vaudeville

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.790
as the queen of magic.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.540
Audiences just loved
seeing a woman doing magic.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.750
She immediately was
booked at the Winter

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.000
Garden theater in Berlin,
in London, and in Paris.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.420
She was a headliner.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.830
She was a particular
favorite of ladies,

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.830
as much for what she would
wear as for her magic.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.960
She was often written
up in the fashion pages.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.960
She was a huge hit.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.120
People loved her.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.250
I think the time for women and
magic is finally happening.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.330
This whole creaky
gender bias machine

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.170
is just breaking at the seams.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.170
Jen Kramer is one of those
new up and coming magicians

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.080
who amazingly, at a very young
age, has her own Las Vegas

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.120
show.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.830
She's very much like
Adelaide in that

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.460
she's heading her own company
out there in the world.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.670
And she also, like Adelaide,
reaches out to her audience.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.880
[music playing]

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.040
If a young girl sees my
show and feels inspired,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.460
that would really
mean a lot to me.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.040
Because magic is incredible,
meaningful part of my life.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.000
I'd love it if more young
girls are able to have

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.540
that experience, as well.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.960
Magic is an art that
continues to evolve.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.830
The techniques change,
the props change,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.710
but the personality
of the magician

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.380
is what shines through.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.540
You see that spark of charisma,
that spark of talent that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.380
gets people excited,
and they want to watch,

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.710
and they want to know.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.420
And most of all, they
want to be reminded

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.750
that anything is possible.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.080
March On.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.210
Celebrating women who
changed the world.
