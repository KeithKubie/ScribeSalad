00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.100
An Iranian scientist says that he has created a time machine

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.100
Woah, woah, woops. The tiny invisible

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.100
bullshit detector I invented is going crazy!

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.100
I don't know why.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.300
 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm Anthony. And yes, Ali Rezaei,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.300
a scientist at the Iranian Center

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300
for Strategic Innovations, has created

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
a device he calls The Aryayek

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Time Machine. You touch it,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300
and it predicts the next 5 to 8 years

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.300
of your life with 98%

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
accuracy. Prints your future out, right

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.300
on paper. He just can't

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
show it to anyone or explain

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
how it works, right now. I told my totally

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.300
real girlfriend, who lives in Niagara falls and

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.300
is a supermodel about this, and she was like

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.300
so, he's lying...

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.300
and he named it wrong? Because that's not

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.300
actually a time machine. Then she tried to make out

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
with me, again. But this brings

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.300
up some really great questions.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.300
Is there any way for us to actually

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.300
see the future and will we

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.300
ever be able to travel through time.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300
So, as of right now, we've got

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.300
no clue how we'd see into the future.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.300
Bright side, we already have the ability

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
to see into the past. We actually do it all

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300
the time. See light travels at a

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.300
186,000 miles per second,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300
right? And the farther something is from us

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
the longer it takes the light from it

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
to get here, and that's where the term light years

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
comes from. It takes light from the north

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300
star 430 years to

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
get to us. So, when you look up at the north star

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300
you're seeing it as it was

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
430 years ago. If you could create

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300
an insanely huge telescope and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300
take a look at the Curiosity Rover on the surface

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.300
of mars, you'd see everything it was

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300
doing 3 minutes ago. Even looking at

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.300
this screen right in front of you ,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
taking into account the speed of light

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.300
and your brain's processing time, you're seeing

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
something 3 hundredths of a second

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
old. You are always looking into the past,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
you can't help it. Travelling through time

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
as opposed to seeing through time,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300
that's a different story. We're all

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
actually travelling through time right now

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
at the speed of 1 hour per

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.300
hour. Not super exciting,

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.300
I know. But, there is a way to slow that down.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.300
The closer an object

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300
moves to the speed of light, the slower

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.300
time moves for that object. This happens on a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.300
really small case for astronauts. So,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.300
the space shuttle takes of at

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
17,500 miles an hour, and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300
when the astronaut comes back

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
they're a millisecond younger

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
than they would've been if they had stayed home. If

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
you could travel 500 light years away from earth

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.600
and then back at 99.95%

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
of the speed of light, you would land a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.600
thousand years into the future and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.400
it would've been only 10 years for you.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400
Great, let's do it! Hook it up! Well...

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
here's the issue. Einstein's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400
theory of special relativity. See, the faster an

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
object moves, the more mass it has.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400
The more mass it has, the more energy it takes

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400
to move. So, travelling at the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400
speed of light, would take infinite

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400
energy. And as impossible as that sounds

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.400
getting back from the future

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400
or travelling into the past, that's even more

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400
insane. We are talking about Sci-fi stuff,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
like worm holes and cosmic

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.400
strings and space time curvature

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400
and all sorts of things that may not exist

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400
and if they do exist they would either

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
destroy you or a galaxy

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400
when you try to poke at them. Stephen Hawking

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400
had this theory called Chronology Projection

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.400
Conjecture. It basically means that the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
laws of physics will not allow anyone

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400
to go back in time. He thinks that no matter

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.400
how close we come, some new obstacle

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.400
is always gonna pop up to keep us from

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
doing it. Anyone else have a headache? Short

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400
version: We can see the past,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
we can travel to the future, and we

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400
cannot switch that up. At least not

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400
yet. And probably not with a box

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.400
some guy refuses to demonstrate

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400
for anyone. But let's say we made it happen. Where

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.400
would you go? The future or the past?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.400
I would go future, because, number 1,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400
there are too many diseases in the past

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400
and not enough hover boards. Let me know down below

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.400
