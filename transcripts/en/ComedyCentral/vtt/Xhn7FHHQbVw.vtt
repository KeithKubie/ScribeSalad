THEIR OPINION.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.101 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:06:52.377 --> 00:06:56.282 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS A PREPARATION FOR
MARTIAL LAW.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.217 line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS NOT A
PREPARATION FOR MARTIAL LAW,

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.954 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:07:23.775 --> 00:07:26.946 align:start position:0% line:85%
I THINK IT'S IN THERE.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.181 size:84% position:42% line:91%

TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY ANYONE

00:07:29.214 --> 00:07:31.217 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHO HOLDS ACTUAL POWER.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.186 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ON TUESDAY GOVERNOR GREG
ABBOTT ORDERED THE TEXAS

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:45.764 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH DEAR LORD.

00:07:45.797 --> 00:07:48.834 align:start position:0% line:91%

YET ANOTHER WASTE OF

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:51.770 size:88% position:44% line:91%
TEXAS FUNDS THAT COULD HAVE
BEEN SPENT ON ACTUAL THREATS

00:07:51.803 --> 00:07:56.876 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE YOUR INFAMOUS CHAINSAW
MASSACRES.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.578 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, TEXAS, IT'S NOT AS IF I
DON'T FIND IT ADORABLE THAT

00:07:59.611 --> 00:08:02.982 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR GOVERNOR THINKS YOUR
STATE GUARD COULD TAKE ON THE

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.885 line:91%
UNITED STATES MILITARY. IT'S
LIKE A LITTLE DOG GROWLING AT A

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:10.523 align:start position:0% line:91%
BIG DOG OR-- OR AN
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD PICKING A

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.027 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT ENOUGH OF THE
FEARMONGERING.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.962 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU KNOW THESE TYPES OF
EXERCISES HAVE BEEN GOING ON

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:19.064 size:81% position:41% line:85%
IN TEXAS FOR YEARS, RIGHT?

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.799 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MARINE AIR

00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:30.543 size:88% position:44% line:85%
JOINTLY, IT'S GOOD EXERCISE.

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:31.810 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IN TEXAS! OPERATION
ROVING SANDS.

00:08:31.843 --> 00:08:34.580 align:start position:0%
IN FACT THE 2001
ROVING SANDS OPERATION WAS

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:36.916 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE LARGEST EXERCISE OF ITS
KIND IN HISTORY.

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:41.554 line:91%
BUT DID THEN PRE-OOPS GOVERNOR
RICK PERRY START SPREADING FEAR

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.822 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABOUT A TEXAS TAKEOVER?

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:45.558 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE DID NOT.

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.627 align:start position:0% line:91%
TEXAS WAS FINE WITH THE
CONCEPT OF WIDESPREAD

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.030 align:start position:0% line:91%
MILITARY OPERATIONS IN THEIR
STATE.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:53.832 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN THE 20-OTS.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:56.502 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS
CHANGED SINCE THEN, OH,

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:57.336 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:00.739 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; AMERICA ELECTED A BRUTAL

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:03.842 align:start position:0% line:91%

CONSTITUTIONAL PROFESSOR
AGITATOR WARLOCK.

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:16.622 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO TEXAS-- IT APPEARS, IT
APPEARS YOU ARE ON THE VERGE

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:20.326 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF BEING TAKEN OVER BY ISIS
OR THE UNITED STATES OF

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:21.794 align:start position:0% line:85%
AMERICA.

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.429 line:85%
SO YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:27.833 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND WHEN YOU MAKE IT, JUST
REMIND YOURSELF, AND I NEVER

00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:30.869 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THOUGHT I WOULD BE SAYING
THIS, WHAT WOULD RICK PERRY

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:31.902 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO?
