00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:04.137
[music playing]

00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:07.841
NARRATOR: In the rugged
Montana High Country--

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.542
This is a scary situation.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.045
NARRATOR: -- Jake's racing one
of the mountain's deadliest

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.046
beasts.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:16.049
Wolves are just
nasty, nasty predators.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.151
They want to kill a dog
just because they're

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.220
competition to them.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.789
NARRATOR: The wolf tracks he
spotted are a sign of trouble

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.725
for his team of hunting
dogs, who are miles ahead

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.961
in the middle of a lion hunt.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.930
I'm just trying to follow
the dog's tracks here.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.232
Everything's pretty chopped up.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.967
The snow is pretty crappy.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.502
Looks like they
came through here.

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:38.605
NARRATOR: The hounds are trained
to track a lion relentlessly,

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:40.707
with a single-minded
focus that leaves them

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:42.208
vulnerable to other threats.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.943
About the last
thing in the world

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.746
I need right now is a wolf
getting in with my dogs.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.082
NARRATOR: Jake has
no time to lose.

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:50.850
And with the tracks
at a dead end,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.486
he calls in his backup plan.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:58.758
All right, the GPS is showing
'em heading for that saddle

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.727
just over the ridge here.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:03.863
It's not gonna be
too easy to get 'em.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.532
NARRATOR: The team
is a half mile

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:08.935
north, on the other side of a
jagged 50-foot limestone cliff.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.474
Picking your way through
these rock piles is dangerous,

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:17.310
but it's definitely the shortest
and fastest route to the dogs.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:26.519
One slip away from about
a 30-foot fall here.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.489
It's definitely not
the best footing.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:33.326
[music playing]

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:34.794
Whoo.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.276
Come on.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.711
Hoo-whoop!

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.412
Let's go, dogs.

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:58.751
Henry, Clutch, Marlene.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:00.553
Hoo-whoop!
Come on.

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:08.228
I can just hear Henry just
up here through the trees.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.762
Henry, come here.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:13.967
Henry, there you are.
Good boy.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.134
[dog barking]

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:15.935
Come on, Henry.

00:02:15.935 --> 00:02:17.036
Good boy.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.472
You're a good dog there, Henry.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.507
Clutch, man, come on.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.544
Come here, Clutch.

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.445
[dog barking]

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.312
Henry.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.881
Good boy.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:31.484
All right, I've got Clutch
and Henry caught up.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:35.688
Now I'm just looking
for my pup, Marlene.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:36.990
Marlene, come on.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.191
Come on, girl.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.560
It's definitely a little
concerning that Marlene's

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.196
running around here by herself.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.399
Marlene, come on.

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.867
Marlene.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:50.803
[music playing]

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.338
Marlene, come on.

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:54.274
There you are.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.142
Good girl.

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:57.010
Good girl.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.977
All right.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.612
NARRATOR: Jake's
called off his dogs

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.081
until the wolf danger passes.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.783
But the lion hunt isn't over.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:05.685
JAKE: We've just got
to set up camp tonight

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:07.987
before it gets too dark on us.

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.423
We'll go ahead and pick up
the chase tomorrow morning.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.792
But, for now, these dogs
need some food and water,

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.894
and we all need some rest.

00:03:14.894 --> 00:03:16.729
It's been a long
day on the mountain.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.765
Come on, dogs.
