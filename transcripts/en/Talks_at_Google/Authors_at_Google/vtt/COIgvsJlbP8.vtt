KAREN: So I'm really excited
to have Lauren Leader Chivee

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.810
and Alysia Reiner here
to talk to us today

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.890
about diversity and diversity
in all aspects of media

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.120
and industry.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.680
And this is exciting
for me, because Lauren

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.804
used to be my boss in my
old job before Google.

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:27.720
I know we don't talk
about life before Google,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.370
but I did have a
job before that.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.950
And she was my boss, and
so it's super exciting

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.440
to have her here to talk
about this book, which

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.730
has been something that has
been in discussion for a while.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.035
So with that, I'm going to
welcome Lauren Leader Chivee

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:42.520
up.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.210
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Thank you.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.890
Thank you.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.820
Thank you.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.460
Hi, everyone.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.850
Thank you so much
for being here,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.390
and hi to everyone in
other Google offices

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.524
outside of New York.

00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:54.190
I do really appreciate
that you're here,

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.810
and it feels like a
particularly important time

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.960
to be having this conversation.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.870
I started working on the
book, "Crossing the Thinnest

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.450
Line," well over a year ago.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.400
And when I thought of
started, I did have some sense

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.030
that with the election we might
have a somewhat contentious

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.570
election cycle.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.760
You could sense that there was
stuff brewing in the country,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.980
but I had no idea that
we would be where we are.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.900
I can't say that it's
the happiest place.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.752
It's been incredibly
painful to watch.

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:36.210
I think it's been incredibly
painful for a lot of Americans

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.020
to watch.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.940
And in the middle
of the cold cycle,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.020
as things were
beginning to ratchet up,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.630
in terms of the
noise in the country

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.490
about the election, but
then also the emergence

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.715
of the Black Lives
Matter movement

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:54.200
over the last few
years, the continuing

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.940
intensity around conflicts
around race and gender

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.030
and the breakdown in a way
of the national conversation,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.210
I sat down to try to
write a book about how

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.710
we can do better.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.860
And I will say that having
a book like that come out

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.910
right now is actually
really challenging.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.544
Because it's not what
people want to talk about.

00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:15.960
When you turn on
the news, and I'm

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.220
sure if you had any
channel on last night,

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.720
you saw the kind of
intensity and conflict

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.300
that is just dominating every
minute of the news cycle.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.440
And there's been very little
conversation about the role

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.170
that we all can play
in doing better.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.670
So I'm going to
back up for a second

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.150
and just give you a little
bit about me and about why

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.505
I wrote the book.

00:02:39.505 --> 00:02:41.380
Because I do think it's
important, especially

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.300
because I am the white
privileged woman that I

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.700
am, standing up here to talk
to a very diverse set of Google

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.570
employees and out
there in the world

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.760
talking to a very diverse
country about this topic.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.061
And so I do think and I
felt in writing the book

00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.060
that I needed to say a
little bit about who I am

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.850
and how I got here.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.220
So I grew up in Washington DC.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.869
And Washington DC
has always been

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.410
and remains and one of the most
diverse cities in the nation.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.130
In the 1980s, when I was
growing up, it was over 90%

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.030
African-American.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.160
And my experience
of that childhood

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.410
was-- I'm realizing
now and I've come

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.480
to realize-- pretty unique.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.030
Because most American
don't grow up

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.720
in communities that are anywhere
near as diverse as the one

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.710
that I grew up in.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.170
Now, my immediate neighborhood,
the block where my house was,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.880
was actually almost
entirely white.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.886
And Washington is
actually segregated

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:32.010
in these very strange ways.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.880
It's segregated by
race but it's also

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.557
even segregated by
political party.

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:37.390
We didn't have any
Republicans on our block.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.240
I mean, it was like
all Peace Corps,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.740
ex-Peace Peace Corps volunteers.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.010
So not the most of
our neighborhoods.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.840
But the city itself
was so diverse

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.380
that all my schools
were incredibly diverse.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.787
I always had 30% to
40% of my classmates,

00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:52.870
from kindergarten all the
way through high school,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.870
and I write a lot about
high school in the book,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.820
were at leaves 30% to
40% diverse in some way,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.046
because this city is
also the home of all

00:04:01.046 --> 00:04:02.670
of the embassies for
the United States.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.330
And so there our families from
every corner of the world.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.150
In kindergarten, I probably had
nine different nationalities

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.850
represented.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.750
And that left a
big impact on me.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.380
And I also had a lot of
African-American friends

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.660
with a child.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.769
The thing that I came
to learn, though,

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.149
and I really was, I
think like many kids,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.370
not especially conscious of
the thing that divided us

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.240
as a child, but I was very lucky
because two things happened.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.740
One is that, in about
the seventh grade,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.400
and I write a lot about
this in the book--

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.770
in the seventh grade, I
had this really painful

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.990
personal experience,
which is that I was--

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.946
and this is a very
seventh grade thing,

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:42.570
to put it in context,
because we're all

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.110
a little emotional
and a little awkward

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.597
and sensitive in
the seventh grade.

00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:49.180
But in the seventh grade, I went
to this very exclusive girls'

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.020
school, outside of DC, in
suburban Potomac, Maryland,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.105
which was very conservative,
entirely white.

00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:58.230
By the way, I stayed at
this school only two years,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.415
partly because of this.

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:01.290
And in the seventh grade,
someone in my class

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.350
had a birthday party,
and I was the only one

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.300
in the class not invited.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.590
And it turns out that the
reason that I wasn't invited

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.520
was because the party was being
held at the Chevy Chase Country

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.120
Club, which in 1988, did
not have a single minority

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.620
or Jewish member.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.910
Because we were Jewish,
I was not invited.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.990
My mom, when she explained to
me why I hadn't been invited,

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.190
used it as an opportunity
to recount to me

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.100
all the discrimination that
American Jews have faced.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.150
And it turns out that
my own grandfather

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.870
had changed his
name in the 1950s ad

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.970
from Goldberg to Gilbert,
because in most of America,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.640
he couldn't get a hotel room
with the last name Goldberg.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.580
It's a piece of American
history that most of us

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.170
don't even think about anymore.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.010
But it was true.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.879
Was it the biggest,
most transformational

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.170
personal experience in my life?

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.960
Of course not.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.660
Does it compare in any way
to the kind of exclusion

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.281
and challenges that visible
minorities in this country

00:05:59.281 --> 00:05:59.780
face?

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.980
Of course not.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.640
But something happened for me
at that point in my life, which

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.160
is that I was humiliated,
and angry, and hurt,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.060
and I could not stand
the injustice of it.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.910
It made me crazy.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.800
So to fast forward, I
was lucky enough to go.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.360
I left.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.240
I got out of that school
as soon as I could,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.560
and I went to a
school in Washington

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.018
called Georgetown
Day School, which

00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:24.350
was actually built to
be the first integrated

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.300
school in Washington.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.520
It was established in
the 1940s, at the time

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.920
when DC was a highly segregated
city, which many people don't

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.670
know the history of
Washington and how

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.380
segregated it really was.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.110
But it was in many
ways a microcosm

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.000
of the bias that was
happening in the nation.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.420
But GDS was set up as this
place for diverse communities

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.000
in Washington to get educated.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.730
And so when I got there,
it also turned out

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.460
to be a place where
people talked about race

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.660
and difference all the time.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.660
And the school did
something really amazing,

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.760
which is that in my
freshman year, when

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.280
a bunch of African-American
senior girls

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.240
were feeling angry
and like second class

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.960
citizens in the school, because
they felt they were not being

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.830
treated fairly by some of the
white students, the school,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.890
to their credit, suspended
classes for three days

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.550
in my freshman year
of high school,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.260
and brought in Juan Williams,
who had not long before written

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.050
the book "Eyes on the Prize,"
to facilitate a summit on race

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.210
for a bunch of high school kids.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.376
It was life altering.

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:27.610
But the thing about
that, and the reason

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.940
why I tell that story,
is that part of what

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.930
made me able to relate to and
understand, or at least try

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.280
to understand, the pain that
these amazing African-American

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.480
girls, who were seniors at
the time, who I worshiped

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.780
and thought were the coolest
girls in the whole world,

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.270
part of why I cried
for them was because I

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:52.060
had had some experience
of being an outsider,

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.480
that that experience of having
been excluded for something

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.450
I couldn't control,
that I was Jewish,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.770
helped me understand something
different about them.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.230
So fast forward.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.780
Because I actually happen
to think-- first of all,

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.610
I've come to realize
how lucky I am that I

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.730
had any of those experiences.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.290
Because it has created--
and I am in no way

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.550
left biased than anyone
else in the country.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.150
I am in no way-- I
don't understand it

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.640
in any greater detail
than anybody else,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.020
but it has made me want to try.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.660
And it's made me commit a big
part of my career to trying

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.080
to create the context
and the environment

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.649
and the opportunities
for us all to do better.

00:08:34.649 --> 00:08:36.940
And that's what I committed
to when writing this book--

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.074
could we find a
way to do better?

00:08:39.074 --> 00:08:41.240
Well, one thing that I think
is fundamental to that,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.310
and you can look at what's
happened in North Carolina

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.770
or in Oklahoma or any
of the other places

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.880
around the country now,
where there are now

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.710
these endless streams of
hashtag that in a couple

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.140
letters try to capture the pain
and the complexity of what's

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.930
happening in the
country right now.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.000
We need desperately
for more Americans,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.980
and I absolutely believe
that we especially need

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.440
more white Americans, to have
a deeper appreciation for,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:17.320
empathy for, and understanding
of the experiences that

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.260
non-majority-- although
even that is changing,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.720
so we'll talk about
that in a minute--

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.200
how all Americans are
experiencing our country.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.480
If we cannot get to a
deeper level of empathy

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.960
and understanding, we are doomed
to continue to repeat these

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.680
same cycles over and over again.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.400
I do a lot of media, and I've
been spending a lot of time

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.470
on Fox News.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.914
I've become the progressive
punching bag on Fox News.

00:09:44.914 --> 00:09:47.330
They love having me as often
as I'll come that day so they

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.100
can scream and yell at me.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.300
But I was invited to speak
after one of the major incidents

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.340
a few months ago.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.510
I can't even remember.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.660
Dallas, after Dallas.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.191
There have been so many
the year I lose track.

00:09:58.191 --> 00:09:59.690
But after the Dallas
shooting, I was

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.230
invited on Megyn
Kelly's show to be part

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.070
of this discussion on race.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.690
And I was kind of
optimistic about it.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:07.940
Because I thought, "all right.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:08.700
They're doing it.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.323
It's going to be
nationally televised.

00:10:10.323 --> 00:10:11.250
That's promising."

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.540
And I get to the green
room and it's actually

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.400
a very diverse room.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.862
And I'm kind of like,
"hm, well done, Fox News.

00:10:16.862 --> 00:10:18.330
I'm impressed with who
you've pulled into this room

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.455
to have this conversation."

00:10:19.455 --> 00:10:21.505
And we go in, and we
sit down in the chairs

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:22.630
before the cameras come on.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.590
And the producer
says, "we really need

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.460
a thoughtful and meaningful
conversation about this.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.747
This is a time when the
country is in crisis.

00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:31.330
We want all of you
to bring your best.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.700
Please don't scream.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.120
People will change the channel.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.500
It's not good for
ratings, but it's also not

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.380
good for this conversation."

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:37.260
So I'm feeling great.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.240
I'm like, "yeah,
we're going to have

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.820
this meaningful conversation.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.230
Yay, Fox News."

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.950
I'm sure you can guess that
it didn't quite go that way.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:50.080
So it opened with one guest who
started with the following--

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.467
"Black Lives Matter is
more racist than the KKK."

00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:55.300
That was the opener.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.482
So you can imagine where
it went from there.

00:10:57.482 --> 00:10:59.440
By the way, that was an
African-American person

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.040
who said that.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.990
So I'm not really sure
where they found it.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:05.270
Anyway, and then the
next conversation

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.180
was somebody else who
said, "we should just

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.990
disband the entire
American police force.

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.822
We don't need to
believe anymore."

00:11:11.822 --> 00:11:14.809
So very productive
rational conversation

00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:15.600
that was happening.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.641
And then in between, it
was just people literally

00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:19.159
screaming at the
top of their lungs,

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.450
as loud as they possibly could.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.260
And in between, and
this is the part

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.050
that I think that is
so heartbreaking to me,

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:28.410
in between, Megyn Kelly, who
I really do respect and think

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.900
is an incredibly smart
and gifted person,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.150
Megyn Kelly was thrilled.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.580
And at the commercial break,
she encouraged us to keep at it.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.528
Because it makes
for great ratings.

00:11:39.528 --> 00:11:41.610
So think about that.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.590
Is that really where we
want to be as a country?

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.587
So in the context
of all of this,

00:11:46.587 --> 00:11:48.920
part of what I try to do in
"Crossing the Thinnest Line"

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.450
is paint a picture of
not just what's at stake.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.240
And what's at stake is enormous.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.050
We have a lot at
stake economically.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.070
We certainly have a
lot at stake socially.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.820
It is critically important
to the future of our country

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.150
that we do better in
terms of inclusion

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.750
and this overall approach
that we take to the fact

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.660
that our nation will, in
less than a generation,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.150
be a minority majority nation.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.490
We are seeing the
sort of anxiety

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.630
and the backlash
again that really come

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.110
to the fore in this election.

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:22.484
I think that is
actually probably

00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:26.140
one of the most salient pieces
of what's happening today

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.870
is this discomfort that many,
especially white Americans have

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.450
with the changing
face of our nation.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:33.949
I don't think you
can deny that that

00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:35.900
is a significant
undercurrent here.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.035
But what it takes to
do better, I think,

00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:40.160
and we're going to talk
about one small piece of it

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.580
today, the media and
Hollywood piece of it, which

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.450
might seem like
the least important

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.011
but actually has a role to play.

00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:49.260
In the book, I try to make
the case that it's actually

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.260
a whole bunch of things.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.490
It's not just about
how much better

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.059
do we do on diversity
at a company like Google

00:12:55.059 --> 00:12:57.350
or at any American company,
which is mostly where we're

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.500
talking about diversity today.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.880
We are mostly talking about
it in the corporate context,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.380
right?

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.088
How to get more women
and people of color

00:13:03.088 --> 00:13:05.506
to go into STEM, how our
businesses can do better,

00:13:05.506 --> 00:13:07.256
how to have more women
and people of color

00:13:07.256 --> 00:13:09.330
on corporate boards
and in the C-Suite.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:14.260
That matters, but there's
a whole panoply of factors.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.040
One of them is what's
happening in education

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.314
and I talked about my
own formative experience.

00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:20.980
Unfortunately, the
trends in the country

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:22.520
are not going in the right way.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.910
If you look at
the charts of what

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.020
happened to school
integration since Brown

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.920
vs. Board of education,
it is a bell curve,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.400
and the trend of reversing.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.910
So American public schools
are now becoming less diverse.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.970
And it is actually
the private schools,

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.580
in many ways, so for the
folks who can afford it,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.540
who get to send their
kids to private schools.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.620
The private schools
are working overtime

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.280
to try to make sure
they're diverse.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.030
But our public school
system is becoming

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.420
more segregated than ever.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.480
And I talk a lot about
that in the book.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.920
So we're maybe preparing
the next generation

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.830
to potentially reverse
some of the gains that

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.190
have been made with
Gen Y and Gen Z

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.530
and some of the
younger Americans.

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.071
I don't know.

00:13:56.071 --> 00:13:57.500
It's a question.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.370
We have a challenge
around mass incarceration,

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:02.740
which you absolutely cannot
separate from the larger

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.210
question of how are we doing
on diversity in this country.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.250
We are locking up
an entire generation

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.214
of minority Americans.

00:14:10.214 --> 00:14:11.714
And if we don't
address that and see

00:14:11.714 --> 00:14:14.300
that as part of the overall
picture of diversity

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.660
in the country, we are missing
a very important and significant

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.709
piece.

00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:20.500
Obviously, the business
piece is important.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.390
Immigration continues to be,
especially in this election

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.460
cycle, a really intense
topic of dispute and debate.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.940
But of course--
and I know you all

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:32.240
know this in a company
like Google-- immigrants

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.010
to the country, including, by
the way, those who are here

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.480
who are undocumented,
contribute enormously

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.560
to the American economy.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.020
Undocumented
immigrants pay billions

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.050
of dollars in taxes
every year, which

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.050
is an extraordinary piece
of the picture which

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.880
doesn't get much attention.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.180
And then what I want to
invite Alysia to talk about

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.190
with me in a minute is this
entertainment and media piece,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.889
which seems silly in the
context of talking about some

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:57.930
of the big issues we have
around criminal justice

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:01.880
reform and education
and immigration, right?

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.680
But part of what I argue in
the book is but what we see

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.050
and what we see
intensely all the time

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:13.030
now because of the boundaryless
sources of information

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.110
that come at us, what we see
in the media, in Hollywood,

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.290
on television, maybe
matters more than ever.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.970
And the challenge
is that we have not

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.950
made the kind of
progress in ensuring

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.410
that the images and the
stories that we see actually

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.120
represent our country.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.215
So I'm going to invite up Alysia
Reiner, my dear friend, who

00:15:32.215 --> 00:15:34.270
I'll also introduce to
come up and join me.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.728
We'll have a bit
of a conversation.

00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:38.295
We really want to encourage
you to participate in this.

00:15:38.295 --> 00:15:39.600
This is not just about me.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.510
And fundamentally for us to
make progress as a country,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.350
it takes a lot of conversation.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.725
And then the last
thing I'll just

00:15:46.725 --> 00:15:48.810
say about this is
that I do think--

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.724
and I write a lot about
this in the book-- I do

00:15:51.724 --> 00:15:56.200
believe that white America has
an outsized responsibility.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.580
And white male America
in many instances

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.660
has an outsized responsibility
in solving these issues

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.940
and in finding a
way to understand.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.860
The one point I managed to make
on Megyn Kelly's crazy show

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.880
that day is that, in the end,
it doesn't matter whether or not

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.200
I can understand in a
personal or a deep way

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.692
the experience of what
it's like to drive around

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:21.150
the country as an
African-American.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.910
I will never understand that.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.130
I'm a white person.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.070
I can never fully appreciate
what that feels like.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.600
But I have a responsibility,
and I believe we all

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.560
do, that if any American, if any
American feels that they do not

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.960
have full access to
the American dream,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.940
or that they are in any way
have less than the full rights

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.100
and privileges and equality
of all other American,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.160
then we all have
a responsibility

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.100
to try to make it better,
whether we agree with it

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.604
or relate to it or not.

00:16:51.604 --> 00:16:53.020
And so all the
conversations we're

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.580
having today about "I
believe it's racist,"

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.990
"I don't believe it's racist,"
"I think the cops are racist,"

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.365
"I don't think the cops are
racist,"-- it doesn't matter.

00:16:59.365 --> 00:17:00.590
None of it matters.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.790
Because if any Americans
feel-- if any American feel

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.329
that our country is
not a full meritocracy,

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:10.319
is not fully accessible, that
the American dream is not

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:14.349
accessible to all Americans,
then we all have work to do.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.510
So with that, I want to
invite up Alysia Reiner,

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.630
the amazing and talented.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.084
I know many of you know her.

00:17:20.084 --> 00:17:22.910
I'm very lucky that Alysia and
I have been very dear friends

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:24.150
for a long time.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.401
We're actually neighbors.

00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:27.900
We both live in Harlem and have
lived there for a long time.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.470
Our little girls
are the same age.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.070
And Alysia doesn't meed
a ton of introduction.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.510
I'm sure you have seen her
on the amazing show "Orange

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.050
is the New Black,"
which is one of the few

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.830
shows out there--
it's certainly one

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.170
of the only shows with an
all female cast or a majority

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.130
female cast, one
of the few shows

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.240
that also has really focused
on the mass incarceration issue

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.050
as one of the
themes of the show.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.580
Alysia, along with many of the
cast members and the writers

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.660
have also put a lot of
time into calling attention

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.800
to criminal justice reform and
mass incarceration of women,

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.760
which is important.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.490
And her new movie,
"Equity," which

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.050
she was here at Google when?

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.480
Like a month ago?

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.090
Yeah, a month ago to talk about.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:14.410
It's the first all-female driven
movie, a Wall Street film,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.060
that was written by,
directed by, and starred in

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.680
by-- that's not really
a sentence-- all women.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.010
And I've been talking
with her about that movie

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.730
for a very long time.

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.395
So please join me in
welcoming Alysia Reiner.

00:18:27.395 --> 00:18:29.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.405
Hi.

00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:32.750
ALYSIA REINER: Hi.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.230
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: How are you?

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:34.589
ALYSIA REINER: I'm good.

00:18:34.589 --> 00:18:35.245
Am I on.

00:18:35.245 --> 00:18:36.870
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
I think she's on.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:37.490
Is she on?

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.790
She's not on.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.690
Are we on the screen?

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.570
Can they see us in California?

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:46.830
California, Houston,
are you there?

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.200
So I started to say
that in many ways

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.350
it's hard to think of
Hollywood, or movies, or TV,

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.642
which is fun and fluffy, right?

00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:01.740
Sexy and fun and fluffy,
it's hard to think about that

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.450
as having an important role
to play in the context of all

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.000
the rest of this.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.970
But I know that I
often talk about it

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.860
and I say-- I tell this story in
the book that when I was a kid,

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.720
one of the most influential
women that I saw on television

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.270
was Wonder Woman.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:21.410
And Wonder Woman
was at her height

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.580
of power in my early childhood.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.180
Lynda Carter lived
in Washington.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.450
And that was also a
big thing, and she

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.975
lived in my
neighborhood and I used

00:19:28.975 --> 00:19:30.340
to ride my bike past
her house, always

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.705
trying to get a glimpse
of her because I

00:19:31.705 --> 00:19:32.746
was so obsessed with her.

00:19:32.746 --> 00:19:33.540
I never saw her.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.880
But Wonder Woman kicked ass.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.140
I mean, she was an
absolute feminist icon.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.730
And for me, it made
a big difference.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.797
But it does feel
like in some ways--

00:19:43.797 --> 00:19:45.380
and I think the
numbers bear this out,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.320
and I know you know them really
well-- this sort of early '80s,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.220
late '70s, early '80s, in
many ways was a high point.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.500
We haven't really seen
a substantial increase

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.410
in women role models in the
movies and on TV since then.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.270
ALYSIA REINER: I am here
later today for the Gina Davis

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.670
Symposium, in which
we'll talk about

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.770
not only the actual
statistics but perhaps

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.910
a piece of technology that
Google is involved with

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.770
to look at these statistics.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.770
And I just want to roll
it back for a second

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.350
and say thank you for
everything that you've said.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:30.130
Also as a very
privileged white woman,

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.920
I grew up thinking I
was outrageously lucky.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.750
And I was teased mercilessly.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.390
We now call it bullying.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.400
But I was the fat kid
and teased mercilessly.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.080
And there were this
interesting dichotomy of "oh,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.520
I feel like the outsider.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.910
I feel like crap."

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:56.450
But I went to a very privileged
white fairly diverse school,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:00.370
but was made aware
because it was a very--

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:02.090
it was ethical
culture which makes

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:06.250
you very aware of your
privilege and aware of the world

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:06.880
around you.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.840
And we learned ethics
in first grade.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.730
And I felt very "like how dare
I feel anything but lucky."

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:24.420
That's pretty much
how I grew up and felt

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.860
a similar responsibility to
make change for others, not

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.010
for myself.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.690
So I think coming to a
place where I was really

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:37.680
looking at the statistics
about women in the media

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.170
took me a long time, because
I had this "how dare I"

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.380
mentality.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:48.150
And then I did become
aware of the statistics.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.710
And a lot of it had to do
with becoming a mother for me.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:57.340
Because what you said about
"if you see it, you can be it,"

00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.620
I became the mother of
a girl, of a daughter,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.260
and I wanted her to
see certain things.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:09.106
And I then did some research.

00:22:09.106 --> 00:22:11.400
And Stacey Smith does
some amazing research.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.640
The Gina Davis Institute
does some amazing research.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.260
And what I found out is
77% of the people you

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.480
see in all of media, which
includes film, television,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.680
cartoons-- everything,
75% are male.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.540
So when you're looking
at that as a human being,

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.272
as a female human being, you
feel like a massive minority.

00:22:35.272 --> 00:22:36.720
As I explained it to my--

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.470
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
Which is ridiculous.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.803
ALYSIA REINER: Because it's not.

00:22:39.803 --> 00:22:44.370
And as a male, you feel
like you own the world.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.675
And that is something that
we're seeing every day.

00:22:47.675 --> 00:22:49.050
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: By the way,

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:50.514
one of the most
interesting things

00:22:50.514 --> 00:22:52.430
that I heard someone say
to me about the movie

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.910
"Equity," which I encourage
you to all go see.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.950
First buy my book.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:57.746
Then go see "Equity."

00:22:57.746 --> 00:22:58.838
Sorry, I get to do that.

00:22:58.838 --> 00:22:59.754
ALYSIA REINER: Please.

00:22:59.754 --> 00:23:00.156
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: Her movie's

00:23:00.156 --> 00:23:01.080
been out for a little while.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.230
Mine just came out this week.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.587
My book just came out this week.

00:23:03.587 --> 00:23:05.170
But one of the most
interesting things

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.220
that I heard somebody say
after seeing "Equity,"

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.550
was a friend of mine
went with her husband--

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.070
and if you've not
seen the movie,

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.500
the female characters
really drive the movie.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.740
And it is the story of
women, a very important story

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.740
of women on Wall Street.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.200
It's also a thriller.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.100
It's not overtly about
women in a traditional way,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.920
but it is driven by women.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.275
And one of the things that
my friend's husband said

00:23:26.275 --> 00:23:28.650
to her was "the male
characters are so one

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.712
dimensional and thinly drawn."

00:23:30.712 --> 00:23:31.460
And she's like--

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.660
ALYSIA REINER:
Welcome to our world.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:33.970
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
Yeah, welcome to our world.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:35.970
Because if you look at
movies like "Wall Street"

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.636
or any of these movies,
I mean, I think,

00:23:37.636 --> 00:23:39.890
when I watched it the first
time, I started laughing.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:41.052
Because of course
the first time you

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:42.718
see a woman in "The
Wolf of Wall Street"

00:23:42.718 --> 00:23:45.634
is Margot Robbie naked
in the bubble bath.

00:23:45.634 --> 00:23:47.050
And you're like,
"seriously, guys?

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:48.050
Really?"

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:54.040
And then the next one is the
sniveling, insecure secretary.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.850
Anyway, you get the point.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.270
But the point is that one
of the things that I thought

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.900
was so interesting is
this week with the Emmys

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.090
and of course after the Oscars
so White controversy last year,

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.630
which is, by the way, not over.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.322
So stay tuned for February.

00:24:08.322 --> 00:24:10.405
We'll see if there's any
significant improvements.

00:24:10.405 --> 00:24:12.127
It's unlikely.

00:24:12.127 --> 00:24:13.710
But one thing that's
super interesting

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.640
is that the Emmys this
year were so focused.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.402
There was much
attention on diversity,

00:24:18.402 --> 00:24:19.860
shows like
"Transparent" and others

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.400
that got a lot of attention.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.780
So you might conclude
that TV is doing

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.491
pretty well, that there's
Shondaland and all the things,

00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:28.990
right?

00:24:31.534 --> 00:24:36.370
ALYSIA REINER: It's
disturbing when

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.845
there is information like that.

00:24:38.845 --> 00:24:42.770
Yeah, that makes us feel
like "oh, we're doing great,"

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.550
because statistically
speaking, we're not.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.750
And statistically
speaking, 8% of directors

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:54.700
are women, similar
to 8% of female CEOs.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:01.090
And we do have, I think,
1% or 2% cinematographers.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:06.680
We do have that 77%
gap, even in the extras

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:12.320
you see in the background,
in bizonker crowd scenes.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.185
So how do we change that?

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.929
And "Equity" was a
big piece of that.

00:25:18.929 --> 00:25:20.720
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
So I think part of it

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.690
is too-- you talked
about your daughter

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.440
and I haven't talked
about my kids,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.390
but it is an important
piece of the puzzle which

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:31.110
I didn't mention, which is
that both my daughters are

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:32.510
African-American.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:40.110
And so when I think about what
I want for them, obviously,

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.900
at her age, I'm glad we have
"Doc McStuffins," which,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.220
by the way, just got
cancelled, if you didn't know.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.489
Tragic loss in Disneyland, "Doc
McStuffins" has been cancelled.

00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:50.530
My daughter's devastated.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.350
She's seen every episode
at least 100 times.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.952
But that question of what
an impact it really makes.

00:25:57.952 --> 00:25:59.410
And I talk a little
bit in the book

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:01.610
about the impact
of "The Cosby Show"

00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:04.950
and how groundbreaking that
was for so many Americans.

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.900
And I think now in some
ways "Master of None"

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.340
is breaking that territory
for Asian-Americans.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.000
We've seen so few
Asian-Americans ever

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.770
in his speech at
the Emmys, right?

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.290
ALYSIA REINER:
"Fresh off the Boat."

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:15.580
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
"Fresh off of the Boat."

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.160
I mean, this is
the biggest deal.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.110
I mean, these are huge
segments of American society,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.130
and yet we barely see them.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.750
So Alysia, what's the problem?

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:29.270
Given that there's a good
economic case, certainly

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.362
in Hollywood, the movies and
the shows that do actually

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:33.820
reflect the country
do really well.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.640
I mean, you look at how "Frozen"
became the highest grossing

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.356
animated film of all time.

00:26:39.356 --> 00:26:42.515
So why is it so
hard to make change

00:26:42.515 --> 00:26:48.329
and to see stories in Hollywood
that look like America?

00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:49.870
ALYSIA REINER: In
my experience, it's

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.590
a couple of different things.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.020
One is our unconscious bias.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:57.890
I think there are
so many parts of us

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.650
that we are simply not aware of.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:06.670
And you were talking earlier
about the overresponsibility

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.820
of the white male, and I
really believe that to be true.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.320
Because--

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.320
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
Because they're in power.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.910
ALYSIA REINER: A, they
are in power, and B,

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:21.780
I feel like there are so
many systems in place that

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.190
are habit.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.765
We all have our habits.

00:27:24.765 --> 00:27:25.890
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Yeah.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.570
ALYSIA REINER: And some of
them are good and some of them

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.500
are bad.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:35.320
Hiring our friends is a big
habit a lot of people have.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.160
Hiring people that
look like you,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.360
that feel like you, that
you're comfortable with,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.859
is just a truth that
most of the world does.

00:27:45.859 --> 00:27:47.650
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
I mean, I always make

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.420
the joke that like Karen's
my key demographic, right?

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.575
Nice Jewish girls from a
similar background to me.

00:27:53.575 --> 00:27:56.890
I totally was biased
in my hiring of Karen.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.740
ALYSIA REINER: And I'm going
to talk about it for myself.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.198
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: We all do it.

00:28:01.198 --> 00:28:02.266
We all do it.

00:28:02.266 --> 00:28:04.510
ALYSIA REINER: I was at
a screening of "Equity."

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:09.670
I did a Q&amp;A. And this
girl who looked just

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.670
like one of the
girls I grew up with,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:15.550
looked like in Upper West
Side girl, came up to me

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.130
and started talking to me.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.420
And her daughter
goes to Bank Street.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.200
My daughter goes to Bank Street.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.720
And all of a sudden,
we're friends.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.770
And I don't know if that would
have happened if it was a man.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.120
Probably not, first of
all because I'm married.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:38.180
And I only say that
because if I was a man

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.970
and a woman came up to
me, that's not cool.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:44.302
So I'm not going
to hire that woman,

00:28:44.302 --> 00:28:46.510
or I'm not going to maybe
be friends with that women,

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.520
because what is my
wife going to think?

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.480
And these are these
unconscious biases,

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.480
these stereotypes that we
aren't aware of sometimes,

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.147
that we have to make
ourselves aware of.

00:29:00.147 --> 00:29:02.480
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: I mean,
I'm controversial on this,

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.110
though, because I will say
that I don't actually subscribe

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.630
to it always being unconscious.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.620
And it actually makes
me a little crazy,

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.010
because I often feel like
the constant conversation

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.230
about unconscious bias sometimes
lets people off the hook.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.650
Like, "oh, I just
wasn't conscious.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:17.630
No, no.

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:18.970
It doesn't work that way.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:21.710
You don't get to be unconscious.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.984
By the way, I think sometimes
it is absolutely blatantly

00:29:24.984 --> 00:29:25.920
conscious.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.230
Some of the biases that we are
seeing in this election cycle,

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.200
you can't tell me that people
aren't conscious of the fact

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.220
that we don't ask men
to smile when they're

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:39.300
running for president, and yet
we ask women to smile, right?

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.520
So I get really
fired up about this.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.599
One thing i just wanted to
share is that part of why I--

00:29:45.599 --> 00:29:47.640
and this is not to be a
pain-in-the-ass about it,

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.540
but I do think it's
not an excuse anymore.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.910
Unconscious bias doesn't
get to be an excuse forever.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.470
"Oh, I wasn't conscious,
and so I just-- oops.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.560
My bad."

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.870
We have to got beyond
that as a country.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.500
We have to do better than that.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.474
And one of the reasons why
I called the book "Crossing

00:30:03.474 --> 00:30:04.890
the Thinnest Line,"
and I did want

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.079
to briefly tell this story.

00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:08.120
Alysia knows the story,
but I'll tell it briefly.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.100
It's that I have these
two fabulous colleagues,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.700
these lovely guys who
work with me in Boston.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.084
And they are these central
casting, white, Bostonian,

00:30:18.084 --> 00:30:20.360
Catholic guys.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.000
And you would not
look at them and think

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.690
that they were-- I made
a lot of assumptions

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.970
about them, as we always do
about everyone that we meet.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.540
Well, it turns out that my
colleague, Brian and Shawn,

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.610
are part of the incredible
prison ministry in Boston.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.880
And they, along with a
bunch of other mostly white

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.000
male executives from a
bunch of awesome companies,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.910
are part of a parish that
goes into largely minority--

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.150
because that is who the
prison population is--

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.110
maximum security prisons
around the Boston area

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:57.550
and do these amazing of
collaborative ministries.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:59.500
And the thing that Bryan
said to me about it

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.430
is why I titled the
book the way I did.

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.640
And he blew me away
when he said this.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.260
He said after visiting
these prisons--

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.240
and he was terrified to do it.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.698
He thought "what am I going to
have to say to these people?

00:31:09.698 --> 00:31:11.515
What do I have in
common with them?"

00:31:11.515 --> 00:31:13.652
After the first
visit, he walked out

00:31:13.652 --> 00:31:17.750
and said, "The line
between us is so very thin.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.580
If I had made one different
decision in my life,

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.875
I might be where they are.

00:31:21.875 --> 00:31:23.700
If they had made one
different decision

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.320
or had one different
opportunity in their lives,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.160
they might be where I am."

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.600
And I was so blown away that
he thought of that as a thin,

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.530
that he actually
saw there being so

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.880
little difference between them.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.282
And I thought,
"that's what we need.

00:31:39.282 --> 00:31:40.740
That's what we need
in the country,

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:44.434
is we need more people to
see these lines as thin."

00:31:44.434 --> 00:31:46.610
And so I want to open
it up, because I think

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.860
we should have a conversation.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.640
But Hollywood does have
this amazing ability

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.880
through storytelling
to help people

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.010
relate to other human beings
they might not otherwise

00:31:59.010 --> 00:31:59.960
relate to.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.630
So what are you seeing?

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:03.960
What are your signs of hope?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.000
What do you see changing people?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.350
What do you think is the
possibility for that?

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:11.030
Are we moving?

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.692
The pace is glacial, but are
you optimistic, pessimistic?

00:32:14.692 --> 00:32:16.150
ALYSIA REINER: I'm
very optimistic.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.540
I think I am by
nature an optimist.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:25.080
And when you were talking about
how we make unconscious bias

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.480
and that lets
people off the hook,

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.025
I believe that we're good.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.470
I was at an event
yesterday, and they

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:41.880
were talking about Einstein.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.550
He had this core
question-- do you believe

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:49.060
the world is good or not?

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.850
Do you believe that
we're all trying

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:53.640
to make it better or not?

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.600
And that really is a core
question, because if you do

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.080
believe in the good, then
you act from the good.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.332
And I really believe in good.

00:33:08.332 --> 00:33:13.210
So I believe that we can only
teach with love and compassion

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.670
and empathy and compassion.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:20.580
And so, yes, I believe we
are changing for the good.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.330
I really do.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.470
I think it takes a
lot of conversations

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:31.120
like this and a lot of
talking about the things that

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.900
are really painful
and uncomfortable

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.450
and making art about it.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.140
And I became an
artist because I felt

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:46.270
like that was the leave
where I could reach the most

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:51.990
people with truths that they're
sometimes afraid to talk about

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.615
in other areas.

00:33:52.615 --> 00:33:54.073
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: Have you seen

00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:56.580
people changed through shows
like "Orange is the New Black?"

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:58.538
I know you've had lots
of people come up to you

00:33:58.538 --> 00:33:59.920
and say things to you about it.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.530
ALYSIA REINER: Absolutely.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.880
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: So
would anyone stand out?

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.421
What do you think
has been the change

00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:05.780
that a show like
"Orange" had made?

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.761
ALYSIA REINER: I think it's
simply that thinnest line.

00:34:08.761 --> 00:34:10.969
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: People
relating to those women.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.900
ALYSIA REINER: And feeling
like that could be me.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:14.260
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: Well, that's

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.676
what the show does
so well, right?

00:34:15.676 --> 00:34:19.800
It's the stories of that
Piper's story too, right?

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.370
ALYSIA REINER: And it's true.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:26.719
And how do we tell stories
that create more compassion?

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:30.710
The first movie that
I made as a producer

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:34.280
was a short about
grief and loss.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.659
I had lost my dad really
suddenly to cancer.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.360
He was 55.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.960
And I felt like a pariah.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.370
Everyone was afraid to talk
to me because they were

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.260
so afraid to talk about death.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.009
And they didn't know
how to talk about it,

00:34:47.009 --> 00:34:48.889
so they just wouldn't.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:53.110
And so I made this movie, and I
worked with 10 grief counselors

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.929
and social workers, and we
created basically some art

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.320
therapy with all the
different phases of grieving.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.490
And we created a
discussion guide

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:05.520
and a journal that
went with it as a way

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.020
to help people process.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:10.570
And I do believe deeply in
this healing power of art

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:14.190
or I wouldn't be here.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.840
I think it's hard
in moments like this

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.720
and in what's going
on in the world,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.330
because you almost can't
make the art fast enough

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.390
to really make impact.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:31.500
So then I think for me,
in a moment like this,

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.610
especially as a white,
privileged woman,

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.670
how do I make things happen?

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:39.740
That's the biggest
question I turn over

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.312
to you in these moments.

00:35:43.312 --> 00:35:45.770
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: I want
to open it up to conversation.

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.880
I mentioned my kids,
one of the things

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.412
that I learned, having worked
on diversity for years,

00:35:50.412 --> 00:35:52.620
one of the things I learned
when researching the book

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.460
is how often minority Americans
talk to their children

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.026
about race and how rarely
white Americans do.

00:36:01.961 --> 00:36:04.210
So I had a personal experience
of this, which I really

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.500
had to face, which is that
when my daughter, Stella,

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.310
who's now seven, came home from
preschool when she was three,

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.594
she came home one day and
said, "Mama, I'm brown,"

00:36:11.594 --> 00:36:13.760
and wanted to talk about
the fact that she was brown

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.385
and some of the other
kids in her class

00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:17.919
weren't, and it wasn't probably
as diverse as a preschool

00:36:17.919 --> 00:36:19.460
as I would have
liked for her, but it

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.300
was the one that we picked.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.130
And if she wanted
to talk about it.

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:26.570
And my immediate, visceral-- so
here was my unconscious thing,

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:28.450
thinking I'm so
progressive about it--

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.670
my immediate,
visceral reaction was

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.200
I wanted to change the subject.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.736
And I thought, well, why am I
trying to change the subject?

00:36:35.736 --> 00:36:37.000
It's just an objective truth.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.540
What am I going to do?

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.690
Tell her you're not?

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.080
That's ridiculous.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.800
I have to be able
to talk about this.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.620
And so I had to
take a deep breath

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.164
and face my own discomfort.

00:36:46.164 --> 00:36:48.580
I tell this story because when
I was researching the book,

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.038
one of the things
that I learned is

00:36:50.038 --> 00:36:52.306
that there's been
all this psychology

00:36:52.306 --> 00:36:53.680
and psychological
research that's

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.310
been done about conversations
around race with children.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.330
And it turns out-- and
so much of white America,

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.050
we want to be colorblind, right?

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:02.600
We want to see
everyone as the same.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.808
And that is a big theme in
this election, by the way.

00:37:04.808 --> 00:37:08.270
If you watch five minutes
of conservative news,

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.960
if you watch Fox
for five minutes,

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.080
you will hear guest
after guest after guest

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:15.410
challenge the assumption that
there is racism in the country,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.300
challenge the
assumption that any

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.495
of the big issues that
we're facing are about race.

00:37:20.495 --> 00:37:21.870
And you've got to
listen to that,

00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:24.100
because it's actually
a very significant part

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.362
of the American perspective.

00:37:25.362 --> 00:37:27.320
And if we deny it, we're
missing a whole thing.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.770
But here's the thing about it.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.110
So even the most
well-intentioned

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.440
among us, who think
that by not talking

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:38.240
about race with our kids we
are raving colorblind children.

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.090
Well, it turns out that,
psychologically, it

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:44.920
has the opposite effect, that
in the absence of conversation,

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.340
in the absence of information,
our children actually

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:51.350
draw a negative conclusion.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:55.230
The very thing that so many
white Americans do to try to be

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.590
good citizens-- "we don't
need to talk about that,

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.704
because we're all the same"--
it's exactly the wrong choice.

00:38:00.704 --> 00:38:02.120
Because it's
actually reinforcing.

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.400
Our kids assume that when
we're not talking about it,

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.050
it's because there's
something wrong or bad

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.182
that we're uncomfortable with.

00:38:07.182 --> 00:38:09.020
ALYSIA REINER: I want
to piggyback on that.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.650
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
And then in the media,

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:10.660
we're not talking
about it either.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:11.700
So where are they
going to get it?

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.658
ALYSIA REINER: Correct.

00:38:12.658 --> 00:38:18.920
And I feel like it's so much
better and easier with kids,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.980
because they're
so much more open.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.110
When you guys have
workshops on diversity,

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:28.000
it feels a little
forced sometimes.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.940
And I think with kids, at our
school, sincec first grade,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.210
she's had racial justice
and advocacy classes,

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:40.140
in the first grade.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:47.330
And my favorite part
is they talk regularly.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:51.040
There are four different
kinds-- not kinds of people.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.550
They would hate me saying that.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.610
There are four
different categories

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.280
of human in anything situation.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.150
So in any situation where
there is a conflict,

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.000
there's the mistake-maker,
the target, the bystander,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.660
and the ally.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.390
What I love about
that breakdown is

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.520
that the mistake-maker
and the bystander

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:21.350
are almost neck and neck as
mistake-makers, that if you

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:25.370
are a bystander, that's not OK.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:28.000
And I love that my daughter
goes to a school that

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.110
teaches it is not OK
to be a bystander,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.130
that it is your
job to be an ally.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.870
That is your job in life.

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.370
And that's that
unconscious bias.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:44.705
How do we untrain ourselves and
how do we train our children?

00:39:44.705 --> 00:39:46.580
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
So I want to open it up

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.840
to a conversation in the room.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.654
There's lots of better
perspectives than ours.

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.490
AUDIENCE: Hi, wanted
talk about something

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.956
you mentioned earlier, when
you mentioned the Emmys

00:39:54.956 --> 00:39:56.330
and their push for diversity.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:58.530
So at the Emmys,
Jeffrey Tambor, he

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.326
won an award for "Transparent."

00:40:00.326 --> 00:40:02.200
And in his speech, he
mentioned how important

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.870
it was to let transwomen
actually be on TV

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.330
and control their stories.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.430
But the obvious irony of that is
that Jeffrey Tambor is himself

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.450
a cis-man playing a transwoman.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.670
And so my question
is, how can you

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.440
make sure people in
positions of power

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.270
like that actually
do vacate their spot

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:22.312
and actually do make room
for people who need it?

00:40:22.312 --> 00:40:23.769
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: That's great.

00:40:23.769 --> 00:40:25.150
I love that question.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.638
What do you think?

00:40:27.638 --> 00:40:30.096
ALYSIA REINER: I think they've
got to say no, first of all.

00:40:30.096 --> 00:40:33.115
Yeah, I think a big
piece of it is--

00:40:33.115 --> 00:40:34.490
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: By the way,

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:37.740
also white actresses
playing minority characters

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.482
that they have no
business of doing.

00:40:39.482 --> 00:40:41.470
"Aloha," anyone?

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.020
There's a long list of those,
which I talk about in the book.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.990
They should never have said
yes to this part, right?

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.570
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.980
So I want to start by saying
one of my favorite parts

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.460
is that Jeffrey Tambor
called himself out on it.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.072
That takes a lot of balls.

00:41:01.072 --> 00:41:03.030
You're winning an award
and you're like, "dude,

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.160
this is not OK."

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.220
And I think creating
art that talks about--

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.000
like I love Jill Soloway
so much, because she

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.270
told her story.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.420
She didn't look for
the story that she

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.820
thought would make the
most money or whatever.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.450
She told the story
that needed to be

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.390
told in her heart and the story
that she was afraid to tell,

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:29.120
the story she was probably
most afraid to tell,

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:36.700
because as she's now put
out, it's her family's story.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.900
And I think that's
what we all have to do.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.820
She also said "topple
the patriachy."

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.280
I don't know how to do that.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.890
I've thought about it a lot.

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:55.990
What I know how to do is make
my art and make my own choices.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:59.400
When I made my movie, I
said from the beginning,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.060
before we even
hired the writer, "I

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.440
want to play a woman
married to a woman married

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.840
to a woman of color."

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:07.520
Because if I'm
making this movie,

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.820
I want to create an extra
role for a diverse woman,

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:18.600
a woman from the LGBT
community, and a woman.

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:22.700
So I hit those three checks.

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:28.470
Now, I did hire an actual
African-American woman.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:35.020
It's tricky, then, to
go, "oh, is it OK for me

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.710
to ask people are you gay?"

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:40.960
That's actually discrimination.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.770
when I am casting
that role, I'm not

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.090
allowed to ask
that question, just

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:48.890
like I'm not allowed
to ask their age,

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.600
even though there's incredible
racism and ageism and so

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.380
many isms in Hollywood.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.100
So there's a lot tricky
navigating there.

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.730
Is it OK?

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.330
Here I was an,
actress and producer,

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.220
trying to create
more roles for women,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.500
women of color, LGBT women.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.170
Was it wrong for me to play it?

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.090
Because I played a lesbian?

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:21.070
Should I have hired someone
else to play my own role?

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.010
I don't know.

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:25.790
I've never thought
about it that way.

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:26.550
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Yeah.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:27.966
And that is, I
think, in some ways

00:43:27.966 --> 00:43:32.230
a gray-- I don't know if
other people may disagree.

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.480
There are gray areas on these
issues, but I do think, to me,

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.310
there's no gray area,
no gray area whatsoever

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.420
when we are hiring white actors
to play minority characters.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.920
It's just unacceptable.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.680
This happened in the
"Star Trek" movies.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.150
It happened in
the movie "Aloha."

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.385
We continue to do this.

00:43:47.385 --> 00:43:48.780
It's absolutely unacceptable.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.880
ALYSIA REINER: And I will
say, I just did "23 and Me,"

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.590
so I know exactly what
I am so that I make

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.790
sure not to lie about that.

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:58.790
Do you know what I mean?

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:00.910
I did that exactly
for that reason.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:02.660
Because everyone's
like, "are you Italian?

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.780
Are you Russian?

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:05.500
What are you?

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.930
Are you Armenian?"

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:10.740
And my grandparents
tell me one thing.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.570
And I've played
Armenians, and I believe

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.340
I am, in fact, Armenian.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.090
But I was often
told I was Egyptian,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:22.434
and I'm doing "23 and Me"
to find out if I really am.

00:44:22.434 --> 00:44:23.850
LAUREN LEADER
CHIVEE: Let me know.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:24.140
ALYSIA REINER: OK.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:25.350
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Yeah.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.742
AUDIENCE: I have lived
in Oakland, California,

00:44:27.742 --> 00:44:30.200
for the past several years,
raised both my kids in Oakland.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.990
We are the most progressive
humans on the earth.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.305
And so I find I just get
so pissed at all my friends

00:44:38.305 --> 00:44:40.737
who are less progressive.

00:44:40.737 --> 00:44:43.320
I have some friends that live
in the central part of the state

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.240
of California,
places like Arizona,

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.405
and I just-- I
watch them evolve.

00:44:49.405 --> 00:44:51.660
And you said the
pace is glacial.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.770
And it is glacial.

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:57.970
When they finally get
it, it's like-- I mean,

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.229
I'm super optimistic.

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:00.020
Don't get me wrong.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:03.740
But these people, when
they are so slow to evolve,

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.200
it makes me crazy.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.160
How you have patience?

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.730
And one other thing.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:07.090
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Yeah.

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.140
AUDIENCE: For people
who are people

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:13.540
of color, who deal with
this crap on a daily basis,

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.904
loved ones being
murdered and yet they

00:45:15.904 --> 00:45:17.320
get up there in
front of the press

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:21.360
and they're so lovely, and
articulate, and understanding,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.794
and compassionate, I just
don't know how they do it.

00:45:24.794 --> 00:45:27.210
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: So I
want to say one thing about one

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.586
part of what you said.

00:45:29.586 --> 00:45:30.960
Because there's
a lot there and I

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.495
want to unpack one
thing about it.

00:45:32.495 --> 00:45:34.420
And that is when you
talked about people

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.380
you know who are
less progressive.

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.250
And I'm going to say
something really crazy.

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.500
And I say lot about
this in the book.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.150
One of my biggest lessons
in the last couple years

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:46.370
has been about my own
biases around people's

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.470
political orientation.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:53.587
And I run now a nonpartisan
women's organization.

00:45:53.587 --> 00:45:55.170
It's a women's
political organization,

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.810
which I didn't have
time to talk about.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:59.710
But I established it to be
nonpartisan because I believe

00:45:59.710 --> 00:46:03.140
so much that we need more
women in the political process,

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:05.560
whatever their
political affiliation.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.560
And there's actually
a lot of evidence

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.090
that when women get
into elected office,

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:12.725
women on both sides of the
aisle, Republican and Democrat,

00:46:12.725 --> 00:46:14.850
are actually more
bipartisan, more productive,

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.630
are more likely to put the
interests of the country ahead

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:18.760
of their own.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.810
So I had to actually go out.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:23.050
And I've talked
a lot about this.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:25.600
I didn't know any
conservative women.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.620
I didn't have any
conservative friends.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:29.960
I thought I had nothing
in common with them.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.755
And so I went through a
process of seeking out

00:46:32.755 --> 00:46:35.100
some Republican women who
were very well respected

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.710
in the political world.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.900
And my relationships with
them were life altering,

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.950
life altering.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.580
And I see you shaking your head.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:46.040
I know we don't
agree on everything.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.714
We won't agree on
everything, but the challenge

00:46:48.714 --> 00:46:50.380
that we have in the
country today-- now,

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:58.090
if you ask me do I think that
I want to sit down with someone

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:02.200
in the alt-right or with
a white supremacist,

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.710
or somebody who is a
virulent anti-semite

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.310
and try to have a rational
conversation so that we can

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.620
understand each other better?

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.460
No.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.150
I will say that.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.650
No.

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:12.930
I have nothing in
common with somebody

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.230
who is that hateful about
entire groups of people.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:20.139
I cannot relate to that, and I
wish I was a better person than

00:47:20.139 --> 00:47:21.430
I'd be willing to take that on.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:22.635
I can't.

00:47:22.635 --> 00:47:25.910
But the truth is the vast
majority of Americans

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.770
are nowhere near those
polar ends of the scale.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.070
And it is the dystopian
world of the current media

00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:35.580
cycle that makes us
think that is the case.

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.840
And it means that we're left
likely to have some very

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.610
important conversations.

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:44.030
And there are a lot of common
bonds between people who

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:45.550
have different political views.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.390
And if we can't have
those conversations,

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.280
if we're so
uncomfortable with them,

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.160
it's another piece
of this equation,

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.207
that we have to be able to do
that and find common ground

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.290
and to respect each other.

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.290
And look, I think that
is in some ways happening

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.680
in this election.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.590
The Republicans
who have subscribed

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:08.182
to Never-Trump specifically
because of the racism

00:48:08.182 --> 00:48:12.490
and the misogyny that has
been such a critical part

00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:13.635
of this campaign.

00:48:13.635 --> 00:48:15.510
I may not agree with
them on a lot of things,

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.870
but I thoroughly agree
with them on that.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:21.250
So my only point
is that I think we

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.170
have to see those conversations
across the political divide

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:29.150
as still part of
the same equation.

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.510
It's hard and it's uncomfortable
and we all hate it,

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.799
because of the challenge.

00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:36.090
I don't like watching Fox News.

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:39.730
It makes me mad because I
don't agree, but I do it.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:41.250
And I go on the
show and I do it,

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:44.280
because I don't know how I
understand the country if I'm

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.270
totally tuning it
out, just as I would

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:52.100
want them, more conservatives,
watching MSNBC, right?

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:53.950
So I mean, these are
some of these big,

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:58.220
hard things that we're
going to have to face,

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:00.250
unless we're OK with
where we are today,

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.190
which I think most of
us probably aren't.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:03.815
So it's in no way
meant as a criticism,

00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:06.760
and I think we're
all doing our best

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.900
to try to contribute
to a better discourse,

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.426
but I had just to say
something about that.

00:49:13.426 --> 00:49:17.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
more adding on that.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:20.884
I thought I'll give you
an easier question there.

00:49:20.884 --> 00:49:27.210
I live in Queens, which
is I guess the most

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.025
diverse neighborhood now.

00:49:29.025 --> 00:49:29.900
ALYSIA REINER: It is.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.390
It's true.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.171
AUDIENCE: So I'm lucky on that.

00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:35.462
However, when I was growing
up, I grew in India,

00:49:35.462 --> 00:49:39.020
where I had my own
feelings about that,

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:44.702
that before the '90s, I would
go into each of the neighbors'

00:49:44.702 --> 00:49:47.285
homes, whether they were Hindus
or Muslims, it doesn't matter.

00:49:47.285 --> 00:49:51.844
I would go into a mosque
right away without much issue.

00:49:51.844 --> 00:49:53.510
Suddenly, I realized
something happened.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:54.801
Everybody was talking about it.

00:49:54.801 --> 00:49:56.210
It was like, '91, '92.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.020
And then we stopped going
to each other's houses

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.830
unless they were
the same religion.

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:05.194
We stopped going across
the mosques and temples.

00:50:05.194 --> 00:50:07.360
Something happened, and I
realized, "oh, some mosque

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.740
was demolished in
'91." [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:13.400
And that segregation,
to my surprise

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.800
when I went back a couple of
years ago, is still there.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:16.925
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Yeah.

00:50:16.925 --> 00:50:19.880
AUDIENCE: So now, actually I
thought somehow in my mind,

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.910
"oh, that's temporary.

00:50:20.910 --> 00:50:22.540
It will go away."

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.040
No, across a generation,
it's still there.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.640
So segregations, when they
happen, they just stay.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.044
That's what my take is, unless
you do something about it.

00:50:31.044 --> 00:50:32.210
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Right.

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.869
It doesn't.

00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:34.160
And people ask us all the time.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.070
I get asked all the time.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:35.780
As someone who
works on this stuff,

00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:36.821
I get asked all the time.

00:50:36.821 --> 00:50:40.080
Do you think that
the rise of Gen Y,

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.940
Gen Y in the United States, as
the most of diverse generation

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.880
in history, the most well
educated generation in history,

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.190
that's just going
to change things?

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.470
I don't know that it
does, automatically.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.810
I actually think
it does take work.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:57.250
And I'm glad you mentioned
the religious piece.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:59.360
I wrote a little bit
about that, but that's

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.050
another place where we
make choices every day

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.530
about the kind of churches that
we go to and whether or not

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:09.850
we're choosing churches and
synagogues or mosques that are

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.530
welcoming and inclusive or not.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:16.010
I think in the Christian
community especially,

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:21.255
there's so many different--
there's 1,000 flavors.

00:51:21.255 --> 00:51:23.380
There's that question of
choosing churches that are

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:24.962
more diverse or less diverse.

00:51:24.962 --> 00:51:26.920
And it's another way that
we make those choices

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.948
for our families and
create conversation or not.

00:51:30.948 --> 00:51:32.896
but these are very
closely held beliefs,

00:51:32.896 --> 00:51:34.270
and people get
very uncomfortable

00:51:34.270 --> 00:51:37.860
when their closely held beliefs
are in anyway challenged,

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:39.909
but that's the
plurality of our nation.

00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:40.825
How do we not do that?

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.175
I mean, in the film, there's
been so much-- anyway,

00:51:46.175 --> 00:51:46.570
what were you doing to say?

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.120
ALYSIA REINER: I was
just going to say--

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.694
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Sorry,
did you have something else?

00:51:49.694 --> 00:51:50.186
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I had
a continued question.

00:51:50.186 --> 00:51:51.394
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Please.

00:51:51.394 --> 00:51:53.870
AUDIENCE: So on that round,
I think with four year olds,

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.161
we'd have an easier shot there.

00:51:55.161 --> 00:52:00.600
Because they can keep three
things in their mind, right?

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:05.000
If they decide hey, if they
talk to everybody and chat

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.057
with everybody, then
that's the best start.

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.140
So I have a four year old.

00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.860
And he asks me sometimes
that he wants to be a girl,

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:12.720
or he wants to be this,
he wants to be that.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.386
I say, "oh yeah.

00:52:13.386 --> 00:52:14.140
You can choose.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:15.410
The world has come to this.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:18.360
You can be whatever you
want later on, but not now.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.170
Let's figure out
what you want to be."

00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:24.250
So if he asked me how is
meeting different people

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.560
or different kinds
of people useful,

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:28.990
how is diversity
useful to him, and you

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:31.490
have to say only three things,
because it's a four year old.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:34.240
They can't remember
more than three.

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.370
What would you say?

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:37.340
Why would diversity
be useful to you

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.737
growing up or later in life?

00:52:38.737 --> 00:52:40.862
ALYSIA REINER: To a four
year old or to a grown up?

00:52:40.862 --> 00:52:42.000
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
To a four year old.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:42.530
You're saying to
a four year old.

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:43.071
I don't know.

00:52:43.071 --> 00:52:45.128
What did you say?

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:46.336
AUDIENCE: I'm still thinking.

00:52:46.336 --> 00:52:48.127
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
You're still looking?

00:52:48.127 --> 00:52:49.990
You're still thinking
about the answer.

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:51.620
You do [INAUDIBLE]
four year olds.

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.800
What would yours be?

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.540
I love that question.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:57.660
ALYSIA REINER: So if my
four year old asked me--

00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:58.660
I just want to be clear.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:03.725
If my four year old asked me
why I have diversity important?

00:53:03.725 --> 00:53:05.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, or useful
to them growing up.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:07.801
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah,
useful to them growing up.

00:53:07.801 --> 00:53:10.830
AUDIENCE: Why would [INAUDIBLE]
"Crossing the Thinnest Line"

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:11.496
would be useful.

00:53:15.039 --> 00:53:16.580
ALYSIA REINER: That
my honest answer,

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.855
if she said that right
now-- I'm an actress,

00:53:18.855 --> 00:53:21.610
so I have to imagine that
I'm doing it right now.

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:24.680
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Would
you like me to play Liz?

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.170
ALYSIA REINER: No,
you're too pretty.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:36.290
No, I would say, "baby,
don't you know"--

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:37.345
no, I wouldn't say that.

00:53:37.345 --> 00:53:38.270
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE: Do you
need more time to prepare?

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:39.440
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah, I do.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.910
But I would really say
the more experience

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:52.260
we have of life, the more
we know of the more people

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:57.570
and the more experiences,
the more compassion we have,

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:58.494
the more we can serve.

00:53:58.494 --> 00:54:00.410
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
Yeah, that's a good one.

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.850
ALYSIA REINER: And then I
would give a concrete example.

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.820
Because that's all--

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.680
[MUMBLING]

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:09.850
So what I'm thinking
about right now

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:13.250
is what's the concrete example?

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:20.180
And I would probably get
a book about two kids.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:21.630
And I'm sure they have this.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:23.250
Someone's written
this beautiful book

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.040
about you walk a
mile in my shoes

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.970
and I walk a mile in yours.

00:54:27.970 --> 00:54:32.910
And how do we then appreciate
each other's lives?

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.900
And it really is what
Lauren was talking

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:40.170
about-- make friends with
that super conservative guy

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:41.550
that you don't understand.

00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:45.450
Because if you understand
him, in that process,

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:46.530
he'll understand you.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:49.710
I was actually
thinking I dare anyone

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:50.880
to come make this with me.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.090
I want to make a little
"Saturday Night Live" sketch

00:54:54.090 --> 00:55:01.090
of "befriend your
conservative white male."

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:04.710
Because for me, that's
really hard sometimes.

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:08.260
Because their
opinions are so not

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:13.990
mine and I have my own
unconscious bias about that.

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:18.620
And how do we create
more situations

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.440
where we're in
rooms together where

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:25.200
we're understanding and then can
have compassion for each other.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.899
I'll say my little
wrap-up about--

00:55:26.899 --> 00:55:28.440
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
We're overtime.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.840
ALYSIA REINER: Sorry,
about what I talk about.

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:35.020
And this is a direct
quote from Effie Brown,

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.360
who's an amazing producer.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.140
And she talks about
the three things

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:42.810
you can do to change things
for women are hire, mentor,

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:44.540
and invest.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:50.240
So hire more women,
invest in women.

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.869
And if you can't do
either of those, mentor.

00:55:53.869 --> 00:55:55.660
LAUREN LEADER CHIVEE:
So we're out of time.

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.576
I don't have all the
answers, and I definitely

00:55:57.576 --> 00:56:00.300
didn't write the book because
I had all the answers.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:02.460
I tried to ask some
questions that I hope

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.710
we'll all keep thinking about.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.160
And I would really love for
you to buy the book before you

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.970
leave, but I would
especially love

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.290
for you to continue
this conversation

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:13.120
through social channels and
with your friends and online.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.430
We need this conversation now
maybe more than ever before,

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:18.110
certainly in our lifetime.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:20.930
And we need it thoughtfully
and inclusively,

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:23.660
and we need to bring
her best to it.

00:56:23.660 --> 00:56:26.160
Because these are some of the
most complicated and difficult

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.560
challenges of our time.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.842
And I think it takes all
of us working towards it,

00:56:30.842 --> 00:56:32.800
working towards the
solution to make it better.

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.030
So thank you so much to Karen
and to everyone at Google.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:37.510
Thank you for having us.

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:38.610
KAREN: Thank you.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:41.970
[APPLAUSE]
