REGINA MANZANA-SAWHNEY:
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.390
Thank you for sharing
your afternoon with us.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.250
I have many favorite
things about working here,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.460
but one of my most favorites
is having the opportunity

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.660
to invite people I
admire, such as Chitra,

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.890
to Google to share her work.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.120
Her stories have a magical
way of just immersing you

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.160
in the content.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.280
When you're reading through,
you can literally see, feel,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.840
and taste the experiences.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.150
So thank you for bringing
your work back to Google

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.010
and introducing this book.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.410
Her short story collection
"Arranged Marriage"

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.100
won an American
Book Award in 1995.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.770
And two of her novels, which I'm
sure many of you are familiar

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.590
with-- "The Mistress of Spices"
and "Sister of My Heart"--

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.100
were adapted into the movies.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.470
Today, she joins us to
introduce her new novel,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.730
"Before we Visit
the Goddess," where

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.430
she'll talk about what
makes a woman successful,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.120
and is this something
that changes over time?

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.800
She's an author, poet,
activist, and teacher,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.430
and in 2015, she was chosen
by the "Economic Times"

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.240
as one of the 20 most
influential global Indian

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.380
women.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.605
So thank you for joining
us today, Chitra.

00:01:13.605 --> 00:01:15.847
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:18.180
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: It is
absolutely my pleasure, Regina.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.580
Thank you for inviting me to
speak once again at authors

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.120
at Google.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.160
So it's always a great
pleasure to come to Google.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.170
And I have to start
off my talk by saying

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.780
how much easier Google has
made my life as an author.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.800
First of all, the
search engine-- truly,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.960
I think my books would
take twice as long

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.350
to write if I couldn't
research quickly

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.260
using the search engine.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.330
So thanks to everyone
who's involved with that.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.380
And the second thing is author--
I have to go to many places,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.080
often in different cities.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.490
And I have to drive to locations
that I don't know at all.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.180
So all the Google map devices,
they have changed my life.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.660
They have reduced
my anxiety level

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.270
because I'm kind of
an anxious traveler.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.330
But they really reduced
my anxiety level

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.000
and made it possible.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.820
So again, thanks to everyone
who's involved with that.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.400
It is my great pleasure
today to come and present

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.750
to you my newest novel,
"Before we Visit the Goddess."

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.700
I'm very excited
about this novel

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.030
because it's about
something I've been

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.230
thinking about for a long time.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.770
It is an intergenerational saga.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.190
It is the story of a
grandmother, a mother,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.580
and a daughter.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.710
So it is about three
generations of women's lives

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.910
that crosses continents.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.170
The grandmother, Sabitri,
lives all her life in India.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.860
She's from the Kolkata area.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.980
She's born in a
village, but then she

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.320
lives much of her
life in Kolkata.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.440
Her daughter, Sabitri,
comes to the United States,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.620
but under strange and
difficult conditions,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.410
and can therefore no longer
go back to India after that.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.240
So she spends her
life in America,

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.440
but she kind of spans the two
continents, both geographically

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.610
and culturally.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.270
And then her daughter, Tara,
is born in the United States

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.170
and never goes back to India
and never sees her grandmother,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.710
not face-to-face.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.270
But she will connect
to her grandmother

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.210
in some interesting ways.

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.270
So this is a novel
about what do we pass on

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.860
to our future generations?

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.730
And I now have children
who are-- two boys who

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.570
are in their 20s, early 20s.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.790
My own mother has
passed away now.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.490
But I think of her often.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.010
So I'm very interested in that,
that kind of river of influence

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.660
that comes down the generations.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.080
And I'm sure all of us who
are parents or thinking

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.870
of being parents or have other
people in younger generations--

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.510
like maybe nephews or nieces--
we're all concerned about what

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.120
we are passing on to them.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.000
This becomes especially
resonant if we

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.435
come from another
culture, and we

00:04:13.435 --> 00:04:14.851
are living in a
different country,

00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:17.140
because we want to make
sure we still passing

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.579
on important things
to them, and yet maybe

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.240
not in exactly the form
in which we received them.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.760
We want to make the
heritage that we

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.120
give them appropriate
to their environment.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.330
So that's a question that
all three of these women

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.100
think about-- and, in
fact, four generations,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.370
because Sabitri's mother
passes on some important things

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.470
to her, as well.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.370
So heritage and
mothers and daughters,

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.240
especially, are things that I'm
thinking about in this book,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.360
but also, another question
that has been important to me

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.810
for a long time.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.280
Now, my own mother--
when I was growing up,

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.720
when I was a teenager, my
mother was a single parent.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.320
And for a number of years,
she struggled to bring up

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.170
my brothers and myself.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.760
And she often told me,
I want to make sure

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.030
that when you grow up, you
don't have difficulties

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.470
taking care of the
people in your life that

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.450
are special to you.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.480
I want you to be an
independent woman.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.070
I want you to be a
successful woman.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.010
And I've always
thought about that,

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.910
and I've taken that, kind
of, as my own mantra.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.340
But I'm not sure
that what she meant

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.560
as a successful woman is what
I mean as a successful woman.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.780
So the question the book
asks for the characters,

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.950
as well as for all of the
readers and for myself

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.980
as author, is what
does that mean?

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.090
What does it mean to
be a successful woman?

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.100
Is that something that
changes from era to era,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.820
from country to country?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.010
And even in our lives,
when we are younger,

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.780
does success means something?

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.330
When we are older,
what does success mean?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.040
Is success something
we judge externally?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.450
Is it something we feel
deep in our hearts?

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.140
So these are some of the things
that are special in this book.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:07.350
With this book, I wanted
to set myself a challenge.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.820
With each book, I like setting
myself a different challenge.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.955
And I was talking to some
of you in the audience,

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:14.830
and you were telling me
about different books

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.800
that you've loved.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.900
So with a book like
"Mistress of Spices," which

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.750
was made into a movie, I
set myself the challenge

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.090
of writing a magical
realist tale, a tale which

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.040
is set in the real world,
here in the Bay Area,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.500
but has magical elements.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.640
So the main character,
Tilo, she has the power--

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.150
she works in an Indian grocery.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.930
And if you walked
into that grocery,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.410
she would have the power
to look into your heart

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.600
and know what it is
that you most needed.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.810
And she would take a spice, and
infuse it with special powers,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.630
and give it to you, sometimes
without you knowing it.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.120
So that was one.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.100
Then, in "Palace of
Illusions," the challenge was I

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.730
wanted to take an epic-- the
"Mahabharata" in this case,

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.310
and retell it from a
woman's point of view

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.620
because I felt hearing
it or seeing it

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.820
through a woman's
eyes would change

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.470
the tale in interesting ways.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.600
So the main speaker over
there is Panchaali, Draupadi,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.910
who tells us the story now
as she is experiencing it.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.600
In this, I wanted
a formal challenge.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.490
So this is a book that
is a novel in stories.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.240
Now, I've written
stories before,

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.910
like "Arranged Marriage."

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.860
And I've written novels before.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.950
But this one is stories that
all join up to create a novel.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.770
So this was a
different form for me.

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.610
But I really like
this form because it

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.030
allowed me to move
through, like, three

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.280
generations of women's lives
in a very agile manner.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.210
I didn't have to go through
everything in every life.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.090
I could focus on the
important moments,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.170
the moments that
transformed them,

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.740
the moments that were
emotionally resonant.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.680
And I could also tell
some of the stories

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.630
from the point of
view of men who

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:06.840
are important in their lives.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.130
And these are sometimes
men in their family.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.450
But sometimes,
they are strangers

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.700
who come into their lives
and become connected to them

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.130
in unusual ways.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.730
So one of the other
themes in this book

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.340
is also the question, what
is it that we mean by family?

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.660
Is it blood family?

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.740
Yes, of course.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.890
But are there other
kinds of families?

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:29.800
Are there ways in
which we connect

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.870
to people who become extremely
important, both positively,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.490
sometimes negatively,
in our lives.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.140
So that gives you a little
bit of an idea about the book.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.310
And I'm going to read a
couple of passages to you

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.630
from different voices so you
get a sense of, you know,

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.030
the characters a little bit.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.770
And then I'll be happy to
take some easy questions.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.751
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:57.250
Right.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.500
The first passage I'm
going to read to you

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.980
is in Sabitri's voice.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.880
Now, Sabitri grows up in
the generation before mine.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.430
She's kind of my
mother's generation.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.600
And at that time, you
know, obviously, things

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.935
are very different for
women who want an education.

00:09:14.935 --> 00:09:17.170
And Sabitri really
wants to go to college,

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.430
but she is from a small village.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.530
Her family doesn't
have any money.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.381
But her mother begs a
woman who is well off

00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:27.630
and who has a home in Kolkata.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.610
She says, you know.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.830
And that woman says, OK.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.840
Your daughter can live in
my house and go to college.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.260
But in that house, Sabitri's
not very well treated.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.330
Even the servants-- or, I should
say especially the servants

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.770
treat her badly because
they're like, you know,

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.570
she's like a charity case.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.805
And why is she getting
room and board, and then

00:09:47.805 --> 00:09:50.130
she never works like we do?

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.200
So she's very unhappy.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:51.950
She's very lonely.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.080
And she loves the studying part.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.290
But the rest of it is very hard.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.010
And when she's feeling
especially homesick,

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:04.130
she goes up to the
terrace of this building.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.960
And she just looks
up at the sky,

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.730
and she thinks about her family.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:13.000
And, you know, she
just tries to regroup.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.150
And she's always alone
in this old terrace

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.540
in the back part of the house.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.150
But one night when
she goes up there,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.860
she meets a young man there.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:27.740
And that is Rajiv, who
is the son of the house.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.930
He's the only son
of the house, so you

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.010
can imagine there's a
lot of pressure on him.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.760
And the two of them
become friends.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.750
And they get to
talking about all

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.430
of the pressures in their lives.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.360
And they feel that
they can really

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.100
trust each other
with what they say,

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.860
and they understand each other.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.610
And they begin to
become very close.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.190
So I will read to you a
little bit from that segment.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.870
"Summer had descended upon
Kolkata with epic vengeance."

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.490
Oh, sorry.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:58.690
I'll read you a little
bit before then.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.200
This is when they're
getting to be friends.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.970
"Days passed.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.320
How many?

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.700
It is hard to keep
of such mundanities

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.260
when one is balanced
inside a fairy tale.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.010
After some time, he brought
up an old, red quilt

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.400
so they could sit in
comfort as they spoke.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.080
One moonless night,
he laid down on it

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.690
so he could point out the
constellations to her.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.630
Here is Kalpurush
with his shining.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.430
Here are the seven wise rishis.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.020
She was impressed.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.830
She hadn't thought a city boy
would know the names of stars.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.870
Maybe that was what made
her lie down next to him

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.450
on the worn malmal, though
her mother's warnings buzzed

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.470
in her ears like mosquitoes.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.610
She told him her dreams.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.100
She would dress
in a starched sari

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.750
and teach history
to school children,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.640
stories of conquerors
and despots.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.860
Her students would be obedient.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.930
She would never
need to cane anyone.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.820
She would become a principal
with tortoiseshell glasses,

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.610
the entire school
standing at attention

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:11.040
when she entered
the assembly hall.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.450
He nodded.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.570
She would make a
great principal,

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:16.340
he said with conviction.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.825
He wound a finger
softly around a lock

00:12:18.825 --> 00:12:23.450
of her hair, which he had
persuaded her to unbraid.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.940
That was what made her
fall in love, finally--

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.940
his belief in her
and his gentleness.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.330
But even as she confessed her
dreams, they were changing."

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.100
And you might imagine what
her dreams are becoming,

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.220
that they're falling in
love, and maybe something

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.400
will come out of it.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.580
Because at this time, the
lady of the house, Leelamoyi,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.190
has become very fond of her
suddenly because Sabitri's

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.630
a very good cook.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.750
And one day, she made a
dessert that all of her guests

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.630
just loved.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.020
And now, she has Sabitri making
desserts for her all the time.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.460
And she's given her gifts.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.880
She's given her saris.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.080
So Sabitri's like,
well, maybe this

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.670
is going the way
I want it to go.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.680
But then--

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.590
"Summer had descended upon
Kolkata with epic vengeance.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.490
Sabitri came back from
college bedraggled with sweat,

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.680
craving a bath,
cold water cascading

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.900
over her body in
the maid's bathroom.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.980
But a servant was waiting.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.170
Leelamoyi wanted to see her.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.220
Sabitri was surprised.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.740
Let me drink some water,
she said, change my sari.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.730
The woman scrunched up her
face and shook her head.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.310
Rani Ma's waiting.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.620
Better come right now.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.610
The first thing she
saw when she entered

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.140
the room was the red
quilt from the terrace,

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.620
crumpled on the floor like
the pelt of a dead animal."

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.120
Right?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.040
So they've been meeting
in secret until now.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.010
"The blood rushed to
her head and then away.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.435
She had to hold on
to the door frame.

00:13:59.435 --> 00:14:02.160
When her vision cleared,
she looked around

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.000
for Rajiv, who would defend her.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.150
But there was only
Leelamoyi, and behind her,

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.990
Paro, her special maid,
hands on her hips,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.090
swollen with satisfaction.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.600
From across the years,
Sabitri remembers

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.220
Leelamoyi's contorted mouth
spitting out invectives--

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.320
conniving slut, harlot's
daughter, poisonous

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.410
snake in my bosom.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.830
Her own mouth was
frozen, so that when

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.800
she tried to say she
had done nothing wrong,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.950
the words would not obey.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.130
She learned that Rajiv had
been sent away already,

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.830
to his uncle's house
in another city.

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.400
He would continue
his studies there.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.120
So don't be thinking that
you can sink your witch

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.300
claws into him again.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.960
As for Sabitri, she was to
leave the house right now.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.710
No.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:15:00.640
Leelamoyi didn't care where she
went or what happened to her.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.630
Sabitri stood at the
tram stop for a long time

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.920
in the oppressive dusk, carrying
her small painted trunk.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.770
Finally, she boarded a
tram that would take her

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.230
to the men's college where she
went for her math and science

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.820
classes.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.290
She could think
of no other place.

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.220
She opened her
handbag, so light,

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.660
and looked down at the
frighteningly few rupee notes

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.970
in there.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.870
Her trunk was light, too.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.090
Paro had followed
her to her room

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:35.050
and rummaged through it-- let's
see what you're stealing--

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:37.440
and taken the silk saris.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.630
She'd taken some of
Sabitri's own things,

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:44.050
as well-- a buffalo horn comb
that her mother had given her,

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.790
a tiny bottle of
rose water Sabitri

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.770
had saved up for months to buy.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:53.900
Sabitri had been too
heartsick to protest.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.400
The men's college loomed
eerily in the gloom.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.580
She slipped through
the gate, thankful

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.990
that the gate man wasn't
there to stop her,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.060
and ran up the stairs.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.430
On the second story, at
the end of a corridor,

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:09.300
there was a small
room with a plaque

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.480
on it-- women's common room.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.040
She had gone there once,
exploring with her friends.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.370
It was piled with
dusty furniture

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.710
and smelled of mice droppings.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:25.180
But there was a bolt on the
inside and a small toilet.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.490
She could stay
there for the night.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:33.800
Tomorrow-- she couldn't handle
the thought of tomorrow yet.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:39.700
When she reached it, the door to
the common room was padlocked.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.000
The strength went out of her,
and she slid to the floor,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.570
unable to hold in
her sobs any longer.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:50.430
Terror and rage, but
foremost was the fear

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.610
of what might happen
to her tonight

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.040
when the night watchman came by.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.880
Would he throw her
out on the street?

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.860
Would he do worse?

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.100
Beneath it all roiled
the humiliation.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.770
What would her parents,
her relatives, her village

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.349
say if they knew she had been
kicked out of the Mittir home

00:17:10.349 --> 00:17:11.980
like a dog?

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.960
No one would care that
the love she and Rajiv had

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.809
felt for each other
was pure and beautiful.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.910
She had been weeping too
hard to hear the footsteps.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:26.220
When she felt a hand
on her shoulder,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.770
she flinched and cried
out, throwing up her arms

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.310
to protect herself."

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.490
And I'm going to stop
this passage here.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.830
Yes, very wickedly,
I'm going to stop here.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.640
And I'm going to
move on to Tara.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.980
So we move across
two generations

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.870
and across the world.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:49.250
Tara's living, at this
time, in Houston, Texas,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.670
which is where I now live.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.790
And now I've lived in
Houston long enough

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.660
that I feel comfortable setting
parts of my books in Houston.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:02.360
And Tara has been having
an interesting life.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.000
She is now, for some
important reasons, estranged

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.130
from her mother and her father.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.510
She's kind of cut herself off
from the Indian community.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.350
She's dropped out of school.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.170
She works part-time
in a thrift shop.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:22.740
And she's just moved in, a few
months before this, with a man

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.790
she met.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.520
And he is a massage therapist.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.120
OK, so that's her background.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.900
I'll give you just
a little bit where

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:36.780
she's trying to figure out why
she likes this man so much,

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.720
just a tiny bit.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.950
"I love Robert's hands.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:45.400
I've loved them ever since he
ran them over my naked back

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.120
at our very first meeting.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.880
This is not as
risque as it sounds.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.480
I was at Body Work for
the weekday half-hour

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.570
special, which my friend
Blanca had bought me

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.150
as a birthday gift.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.210
He gave me a full hour, and
then invited me to dinner.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:05.050
Over souvlaki and
ouzo, we discovered

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.560
that we shared a passion
for sci-fi movies.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:14.290
A month later, he asked
if I'd move in with him.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.120
I knew it was too soon.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.700
Plus, I'd never
lived with a man.

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.050
Yes, I said.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:25.220
Oh, yes."

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.880
All right.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.160
But, as I'm sure her
mother would have told her

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.610
if she had asked, there are now
problems, and they're fighting.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.960
And this is about
why they're fighting.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.290
Now, I should
preface-- I think this

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.562
is a funny part of the book.

00:19:42.562 --> 00:19:45.020
So, you know, I'm just telling
you because sometimes people

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.350
feel, you know,
literary readings,

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.640
everyone has to be
intellectual and serious.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.860
But feel free to laugh.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.070
In fact, I'll cue
you by raising my--

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:55.914 --> 00:19:56.840
All right.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.810
"The reason for my fight with
Robert is a stuffed raccoon.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:05.440
He won it from Victor,
his best buddy,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.550
the result of a pool-playing
bet involving something called

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.570
a bank shot with
throw, the intricacies

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.520
of which I failed to grasp.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.640
He installed it on our chest
of drawers two weeks ago.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.710
Apparently, the
raccoon is valuable.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:27.420
More important, Victor had
shot and stuffed it himself,

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.480
and he was terribly cut up
at having to part with it.

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.310
He'd offered to buy it
back from Robert for $200.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.850
And you refused?

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.650
I eyed the creature
with disbelief.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.060
Its upper lip was
lifted in a snarl,

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:49.180
and one front leg was
shorter than the other,

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.500
though that could have been a
result of Victor's taxidermy.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.670
It appeared ready to spring
off the chest of drawers

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.100
and launch itself upon us.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.040
Well, naturally, said
the love of my life.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.010
You should have
seen Victor's face.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.380
He ran his hand over
the raccoon's back.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.590
Feel the fur.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:15.030
It's incredible, soft and
bristly at the same time.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.240
I declined.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.320
The only thing I
found incredible

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.810
was that he expected me
to sleep in the same room

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.940
with this monstrosity.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.790
Want a shower, Robert
offered as a peace gift.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.670
I considered sulking,
but I love showering

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.200
with Robert, his fingers
unbuttoning my clothes,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.400
letting them drop
where they will,

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.710
the way he holds me as he
soaps my back, as though I

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.870
were a child who
might slip and fall.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.750
But afterwards,
I couldn't sleep.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.800
I became aware of a musky odor.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.050
The raccoon?

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.680
Surely it couldn't
smell, except of whatever

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.650
embalment Victor had used.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.380
Was it the scent
of another woman?

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.440
I couldn't stop
myself from imagining

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.980
Robert at work, his hands
caressing female curves.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.770
What did he say to them?

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:18.940
What made him the most popular
massage therapist at Body Work?

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:22.360
In the morning, I asked Robert
to please move the raccoon

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.250
to the living room.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:25.910
He refused.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.050
I claimed he was inconsiderate.

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.330
He accused me of not
caring about what

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.140
was important to him.

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.780
I took to covering the
raccoon with a pillowcase when

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.140
Robert was out of the house.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.880
He took to checking on it
first thing when he returned.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.880
Without a word, he'd
ball up the pillowcase

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.420
and throw it with
vicious accuracy

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.240
into our dirty laundry basket.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.650
I'd rescue it surreptitiously
so I could use it again.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:03.490
It was like a vaudeville
show, except not funny."

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.490
And the thing about
this raccoon is

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.450
when I started
writing this story,

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.110
I had no intentions
for a stuffed raccoon

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.145
to show up and become
an important character,

00:23:14.145 --> 00:23:15.770
as this raccoon will be.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:19.330
This raccoon will, you
know-- what shall I say?--

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:22.360
shape parts of the story.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.360
But that's what
happens sometimes.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.400
You have certain plans
for your stories,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.220
and then the stories
just begin to grow.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.430
And the characters
begin to do things

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.740
that you didn't
think they would.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.880
And that's part of
the magic of writing.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.900
When that happens,
I'm like, wow.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.110
You know?

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.810
Where's all this coming from?

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:43.230
But thank you so much.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:47.300
And now for those
easy questions.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.525
Praise is also acceptable.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.390
AUDIENCE: What's the story about
your sari matching the book

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.890
rover.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.931
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Right.

00:23:55.931 --> 00:23:58.710
As you noticed, the sari
and the book cover match.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.260
And it's really a very
wonderful, serendipitous story.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.260
So we moved to Houston
about 14 years back.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.770
And there is a
beautiful Indian temple

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.930
in Houston, the
Meenakshi Temple.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.580
And my husband, Murthy,
in the audience today,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.960
went to the temple.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.460
And they had offered some
saris to the goddess.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.550
And if you made a donation, you
could get one of those saris.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.740
So he picked out
this sari for me.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.860
Must have been at least
12 years back, right?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.590
And then I put it in my closet.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.570
I wore it a few times.

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.111
It's special.

00:24:29.111 --> 00:24:30.770
It comes from the goddess.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.620
And then, you know,
I forgot about it.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:38.300
And then the publisher
decided to create a cover.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.040
And they sent me this cover.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.450
I had nothing to do
with this cover, right?

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.140
But I liked it.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.810
I said, I like this cover.

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.500
All right.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.800
So here's the cover.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.820
The sari's in my closet.

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.690
I'm a little slow sometimes.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.440
I don't make the connection.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.920
But about a week before my tour,
I'm looking through my closet.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.956
What shall I take?

00:24:56.956 --> 00:24:58.330
What shall I wear
to my readings?

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.010
And I come across this sari.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.060
And it's exactly the same.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:06.320
And this book is titled
"Before we Visit the Goddess."

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.950
And that story in this
book is about Tara

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:13.960
going-- very unwillingly,
under strange circumstances--

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.100
but going to the
same Meenakshi Temple

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.660
that I got this sari from.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.000
So it was like the
universe making

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.610
a perfect, serendipitous cycle.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.930
So now this has become my
book tour sari for those book.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.990
And I also found out--
so the very first time

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.690
I wore it for book tour, someone
came up to me later and said,

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.600
do you know this has
a name, this color?

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.930
And I said, I only
know the English name.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.090
It's some kind of blue.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.440
It's teal in English.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.900
And she says, in
Indian languages,

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:49.260
it's called anandi, which
may be a name you've heard.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.155
And anandi, ananda means joy.

00:25:51.155 --> 00:25:54.890
So I felt this was very
joyful, and it was a blessing.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.990
That's my sari story.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.070
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that the current novel is

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.900
about exploring female success.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.920
And here in Silicon
Valley, we're

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.740
surrounded by "Lean In"
and various philosophies

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.470
on female success.

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:18.974
What's your take?

00:26:18.974 --> 00:26:21.140
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: What's
my take on female success?

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.610
That is a very tough question.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:27.300
But that's a very good question
because it is something

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.285
that the women here are asking.

00:26:29.285 --> 00:26:32.630
And I think-- I really
think, each woman,

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.360
it's very important for us to
create the answer ourselves

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.897
and not look to other people.

00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.730
I think there are
wonderful books out there.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:41.440
There are wonderful role models.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.880
But ultimately, we have to
decide that for ourselves.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.130
So for me, success means
that I'm doing something good

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.390
in the world.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.620
I'm changing the world, in
whatever small way I can,

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.600
for the better, and
not doing the opposite,

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.620
not changing it for the worse.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.130
So as a writer, my
hope is that my books

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.900
will go out into the
world and do something

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.090
for increasing understanding
between human beings.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.080
Sometimes it's people
within my community.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.710
Sometimes it's people of other
communities, other backgrounds.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:17.550
Because one of the
wonderful things of America

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:19.350
is how multicultural we are.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.890
And I think it's
so important for us

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:22.410
to understand each other.

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.920
And books are wonderful
way to do that.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:32.040
I also think success means that
I live according to my values.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.160
If I fall away from
my values, I could

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.090
be so successful in
the outside world.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.080
But in here, I failed.

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.030
And I guess those
are the two things.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:45.330
And three, number three--
I want my children

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:50.080
to look back and think,
oh, Mom was special.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.650
I think that would make
me feel successful.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.560
AUDIENCE: So
congratulations on the book.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.050
It's an amazing book.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.930
When I finished
it two nights ago,

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:00.090
my husband was still awake.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:02.150
And I said, I think I
read a pretty good book.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.210
I don't say that often.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.910
I take a few days to tell
somebody about a book.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.452
And then somehow,
my daughter woke up

00:28:08.452 --> 00:28:09.576
in the middle of the night.

00:28:09.576 --> 00:28:11.150
And I put her back
to bed, came back.

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.150
My husband was still up.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.520
And he's like, you still
think it was a good book?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.520
And I said, it was
a pretty good book.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.540
And by the morning,
it had become--

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:16.720
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Thank you.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.690
That's a great compliment.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.672
AUDIENCE: By the morning it
had become, it's a great book.

00:28:21.672 --> 00:28:22.880
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Thank you.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.450
AUDIENCE: So I reflected
a bit on the book.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:29.810
And here was one of my
interpretations of it.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.460
And I'm curious to know if
this thought crossed your mind

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.180
while you were writing.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:36.690
We haven't changed a
lot from our ancestors

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:38.991
over the past many decades.

00:28:38.991 --> 00:28:39.990
We don't look different.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.020
We don't do different things.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.686
We're just more
dependant on technology.

00:28:42.686 --> 00:28:46.080
Very minute changes have
come into our evolution.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.750
So I think the modern-day
definition of evolution

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:53.130
has to do something with a
message in your book, which

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:59.080
I interpreted as-- you take
your ancestors and your elders.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.950
You evaluate their life.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.540
You reflect on it.

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.460
And you take their shortcomings,
and you take the successes.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.349
You imbibe their successes.

00:29:08.349 --> 00:29:10.140
And then you reflect
on their shortcomings,

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.810
and become better at that.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:15.200
And if you evaluate
your life in terms of,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:20.470
did I become better in
temperament and in spirit

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:22.890
than my ancestors,
then I have evolved.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.307
And that was one lesson that
I took from the book, where--

00:29:25.307 --> 00:29:26.973
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: I
think that's great.

00:29:26.973 --> 00:29:27.710
That's wonderful.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.710
Yes.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.130
AUDIENCE: I'm glad it resonated.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.254
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: I think
that resonates with what

00:29:32.254 --> 00:29:33.730
I was trying to do in the book.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.622
AUDIENCE: It comes
across crystal clear.

00:29:35.622 --> 00:29:36.122
Thanks.

00:29:36.122 --> 00:29:36.994
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Thank you.

00:29:36.994 --> 00:29:37.494
Yeah.

00:29:37.494 --> 00:29:40.065
AUDIENCE: One more comment
on your male characters.

00:29:40.065 --> 00:29:41.685
The female characters
are very strong.

00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:43.310
They've always been,
in all your books.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:45.530
I enjoy that.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.930
But at the end of it,
I felt like almost

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:52.720
every male character in
the book was not strong.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.830
And not in a negative sense,
but if I balance it out, I just

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.210
feel, are they on purpose weak?

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:03.400
Or is that a truth, that
when you have a strong woman

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.324
in the household, it's backed
by not-so-very-strong men?

00:30:07.324 --> 00:30:09.615
I don't know if that-- when
you define your characters,

00:30:09.615 --> 00:30:10.774
did that cross your mind?

00:30:10.774 --> 00:30:11.690
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: No.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:14.660
Actually, when I was looking
at the men, of course,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.040
the bulk of the spotlight
is on the women.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.390
And that's how it is
in most of my stories.

00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.730
I think it's really
important for me

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:25.540
to place the women in
the center of my story.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.780
But actually, in this
book, I think the men

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.610
play a very important role.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.510
And they are all strong in
their own way, differently.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:33.140
OK?

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:38.790
So there is Bipin Bihari, who
is the manager of the store

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.520
that Sabitri finally
manages to set up.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.910
She has a wonderful, very
successful sweet shop.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:51.320
But he is kind of the power,
the wind beneath her wings.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.670
And if it wasn't for his
loyalty over decades,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.160
she couldn't have done it.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.070
So yes, he's in a
supportive role.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.120
But he's very strong in himself.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:03.550
And he has a very
special love for her,

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.060
though she's almost
unaware of it.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.590
So I think his life is
very poignant in that way.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:10.960
So it's a different kind.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.210
It's a quiet strength.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:12.720
OK?

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.097
Sabitri, though, is the one
who will come into the store.

00:31:15.097 --> 00:31:16.430
She will bang the pots and pans.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.590
She'll say, what
are you guys doing?

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.150
She'll say, I have to
create a new sweet now.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.920
But he's the one who's back
there always supporting.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:27.870
So that's the kind of supportive
role that some of the men play.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:31.316
And not always
supportive-- some of them,

00:31:31.316 --> 00:31:34.970
there's some betrayal
roles that the men take on.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.400
But there are also
some roles where

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.030
the men are transformative.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.930
In the title story, Tara's in
a very bad place in her life.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.690
And she's going to meet
this man just one day.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.730
But there'll be
something he'll say,

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:51.230
and that's going
to change her life.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.400
So that's the kind of
role that I saw men play.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.750
It's a symbiosis in some ways.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.310
It's a symphony of voices.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:04.362
But perhaps a little bit
extra love goes to the women.

00:32:04.362 --> 00:32:06.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, there,
Miss Banerjee.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.832
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:32:07.832 --> 00:32:09.540
I've been-- I haven't
read this book yet,

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.380
but I've been reading
your books for decades.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:11.790
And I remember when--

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:12.998
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Thank you.

00:32:12.998 --> 00:32:14.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:16.760
I grew up in the Easy Bay, and I
remember when my mom first gave

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.659
me the "Sister of My Heart."

00:32:19.659 --> 00:32:21.200
And she said, this
is a local author.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.960
And it got me really interested
in different cultures.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.407
And it was just a
wonderful, wonderful book.

00:32:27.407 --> 00:32:29.490
So thank you for being
such a wonderful influence.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:30.550
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: And
thank you because that

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.540
is my hope with my
books, that they

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:35.180
will reach many
different kinds of people

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.320
and pull them into
the world of the book.

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so thank you.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.350
I have a couple questions.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.130
I also really love how you have
such strong female characters

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:45.280
in your books.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.570
So I'm curious to know who
are the women in your life

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:52.510
that inspire you for these
characters that you draw from?

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.490
And another-- maybe this
is the easier question.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.800
It's so hard not to just want
to eat through the entire books

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.615
while reading them because
your descriptions of food

00:33:02.615 --> 00:33:04.930
are so, just, incredible.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.930
I'm just craving Indian
cuisine the entire time.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:12.887
So how do you write such
amazing things about the food?

00:33:12.887 --> 00:33:13.803
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: OK.

00:33:13.803 --> 00:33:14.303
All right.

00:33:14.303 --> 00:33:15.940
I'll answer the
food question first,

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.981
and then I'll have you
repeat the other questions

00:33:17.981 --> 00:33:20.810
and I'll answer it because
that's a more serious question.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:21.310
Yes.

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.150
I think all these local Indian
restaurants should start

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:25.407
giving me, like, commission.

00:33:25.407 --> 00:33:28.269
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.090
But, you know, food has always
been important in my life.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:38.330
Definitely, I love well-cooked,
well-presented, beautiful food

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:42.210
because so much of culture
is passed on through food.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.090
But for me, especially
as an immigrant woman--

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.920
and perhaps for many of
you living in a place

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:52.730
away from where your original
home is-- the food that

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.900
is of our childhood,
is of our culture,

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.530
is something we carry with us.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.490
It gives us a lot of comfort.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:59.940
It gives us resonance.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.100
It brings memories with us.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.030
So food is truly a cultural
construct, and especially

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.610
for immigrants.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.650
For us, you know, food was
one of the few things we

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:15.020
could carry with us, as it were,
and bring into our new lives.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.830
And so it became
a very tactile way

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.044
of carrying our culture
with us, but also

00:34:21.044 --> 00:34:25.140
of passing it on to
the next generation.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.600
And along with
those foods, we pass

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.860
on certain lessons,
some ways of looking

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.070
at life, ways of seeing things.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:38.250
So that's why food is
really important just

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.460
on the level of
ideas in my book.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.580
But this book particularly
is all around food

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.650
because a lot of what the
women consider success

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.400
is built around food, right?

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:54.260
Durga Sweets is the business
that Sabitri builds,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.800
and that helps her
become successful.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:59.050
It's all around food.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:02.430
And she creates sweets, so
it's about creativity, as well.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.440
Bela will take a
whole different path.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.690
She'll be at loggerheads
with her mother

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.310
about what food is
really important.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:13.670
But she will at some point
experiment with fusion cuisine.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:16.280
She'll create a blog.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.820
And Tara will have a whole
other relationship with food.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.960
She is not a bad cook.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.500
But her motto is kind
of like mine, which

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:31.820
is, from cutting board to
dining table, 20 minutes flat.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:37.000
And some of this seeps into
my life because on my website,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.550
I have a blog where I
put up food entries,

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.770
things that I've-- mostly
things that I've made easy,

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.300
original Indian recipes
that I've made easy,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.000
20 minutes flat,
that kind of thing.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.320
So food has always
been important.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.100
For me as a reader, too,
I love reading about food

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.830
because it involves our senses.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.750
And I think whenever we can
involve our senses in writing,

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.720
we pull the readers right in.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.330
And I like to do that.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:05.872
And now tell me your
second question.

00:36:05.872 --> 00:36:07.330
AUDIENCE: Oh, the
second question--

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:08.970
I'm just curious
to know where you

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:12.112
draw your inspiration from for
such strong female characters.

00:36:12.112 --> 00:36:13.070
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Yes.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.159
Well, you know, my own mother
has been and continues,

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:18.700
even though she's
not alive-- and I'm

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.400
sure you feel that, if any of
your parents or grandparents

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.380
have passed away.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.310
The influence continues, right?

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.430
So she's been an inspiration.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:30.050
I was very blessed when I
went to college in Kolkata

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.650
that I volunteered
with Mother Teresa.

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:34.760
And she was a true
inspiration for me.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.210
She was so giving.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.180
She was so loving.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.740
She did, very quietly, so
much for people around her.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.850
So she was an inspiration.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.610
But actually, my characters
come from the imagination.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:47.690
And I have to do this.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:49.940
I have to imagine my characters.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:54.840
Maybe I'll take just a
little kernel from real life.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.730
But I really have to go
into the imaginary realm.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.900
Otherwise, I don't
have the freedom

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.110
to make them do what they
need to do, sometimes

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.170
bad things, bad decisions.

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.400
However-- this is just
a secret between you

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.560
and me-- I never tell my
family and friends this.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.750
Instead, I tell them, you
better be good to me, or else--

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:19.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.110
Yeah.

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.470
Or else.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.200
AUDIENCE: So I wore teal
today entirely on purpose,

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.700
as you can see.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.250
There are few
questions on the Dory.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.840
Whoever is running,
them, you could probably

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.715
check there, as well.

00:37:32.715 --> 00:37:36.870
And since I'm here in person,
I'll ask my question directly.

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.230
There's a lot of talk about
unconscious bias, right?

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:45.160
And I wanted to ask you,
what should straight men

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.880
like myself do in order to
make sure we don't introduce

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:52.490
unconscious bias and
become roadblocks

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.860
in the success of women, or even
people who identify themselves

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.580
with other gender identities.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:02.701
What would your advice be
for men in general, I guess?

00:38:02.701 --> 00:38:03.200
Yeah.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.260
So unconscious bias
is-- so full disclosure.

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.290
I'm a big fan of Sheryl
Sandberg, as well,

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:11.570
my ex-employer and whatnot.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.920
So she talks about
an example where

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.690
in a conference room, if a woman
speaks up and gives an idea,

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.890
it just passes over.

00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:23.940
Five minutes later, a man
picks up the exact same idea,

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.750
says the exact
same words, and oh!

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.490
That makes a lot of sense now.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.970
So this is an unconscious bias.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.210
Often, we are not even
aware that we are doing it.

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:34.690
But it just sneaks in.

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:37.310
That's why even in Google's
screening interviews right now,

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.330
the names are hidden.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.320
We always refer to two
people as the candidate,

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.580
and we don't see him or
her, stuff like that.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.080
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI:
Very interesting.

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.690
AUDIENCE: So what would be
your take on the whole thing,

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:47.190
I guess?

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:48.790
Or the advice for
people like me.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.880
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: I think
that's a great question.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.670
It's a complex question.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:57.970
I'm not sure I have
the definitive answer.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:02.160
But I think for-- and I've been
at the receiving end of that.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.820
I mean, in meetings, exactly the
same thing has happened to me.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.640
So I'm very aware of that.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:14.050
I think the first thing
is to become aware of it.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.020
And certainly, like what
you're doing, becoming aware

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.810
of it is step one.

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:19.930
Right?

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.910
I think along with
becoming aware

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.600
of it, when you see
others who are not

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:26.730
aware of it, we have
to be able to speak up,

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.800
not in some kind of
confrontational way,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.620
but just pointing out, look.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.120
Look, this is what you just did.

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.740
This is what you just said.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.660
So I think a lot
of times-- I mean,

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:43.580
unless it's proved otherwise,
I always start from the premise

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.020
that this person doesn't
necessarily intend ill

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.000
but is just not aware
of what's going on.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.590
Or it's been conditioned so
into him or sometimes her.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.420
I mean, women do this, as well.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:58.530
So they're not aware
of what they're doing

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:01.090
or what they're saying or how
they're putting someone down.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.300
So I think the first thing is
to make people aware of that.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.990
And that's like the
Band-Aid, right?

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:11.180
But I think one of the things
that's really important to me

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.640
is to start with younger
people, with children,

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.170
because their minds
haven't become closed

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.680
in that kind of way.

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:21.940
So if we start with
children, introducing them

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:26.790
to positive ideas about women or
about people who are maybe not

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:31.210
straight, the gay people,
or whatever, wherever

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:35.210
the prejudice are, people of
another community, communities

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:37.550
of color.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:40.660
We put stereotypes into
the heads of children.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.570
They don't come
with any of that.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:45.410
So instead, if we can start
putting positive things.

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:48.270
And a great thing to
do is to introduce them

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.570
to all these ideas
through literature

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:54.520
because literature is a
wonderful and non-threatening

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.520
and inviting way
of bringing people

00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.370
into worlds and experiences
they don't know.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.420
And that begins to
change people's minds.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.430
And so I think reading
multicultural books

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.050
with children is very important.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.160
Discussing these issues
with them is very important.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.980
And in the adult world,
speaking up against it

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.170
when we see prejudice of
this kind is very important.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:25.870
I always try to put some of
those ideas into my books.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:29.020
One of the reasons I want
to show strong women--

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.010
not perfect women, women
who are just human.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:36.290
They have positives and
negatives, but they're strong.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.210
And I want people to understand
where they're coming from.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.870
And I want people
to be compassionate

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.400
towards their problems.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.550
And my hope is that as
people read these books,

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.440
their minds will begin
to change in some ways.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.480
And therefore, I'm really
pleased to see the men

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.950
in the audience
because a lot of women

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:57.920
will naturally gravitate
to the thinking.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.580
But it's always very special
for me when men read the books,

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.790
and they say, oh, you
know, I really related

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.030
to that woman character.

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.680
I can understand her.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.680
Empathy is at the heart
of human experience.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.160
Empathy is at the
heart of human success.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:15.090
If we can't be empathetic,
everything else

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:17.980
we do, you know, it just
falls by the roadside.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.614
So that's a great question.

00:42:19.614 --> 00:42:21.280
AUDIENCE: There's a
question on the Dory

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.220
that I want to
bring to attention.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.660
And yours is on the Dory, so
you've already answered that.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.350
But of them is, how did you
get started as an author

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.852
and what motivates
you to keep writing?

00:42:31.852 --> 00:42:34.060
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: How did
I get started as an author

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.320
and what motivates
me to keep writing?

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.850
Now, you know, I kind
of fell into writing

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.650
in a strange manner.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:45.710
When I was growing
up in India, I never

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:47.470
thought I would become
a writer and really

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:49.030
didn't write anything.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:52.380
I never thought I had a story
worth telling that people would

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.750
be interested in because I
was so immersed in my culture,

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:58.550
I felt, everyone's
life is just like mine.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.330
So it was years after I came to
the US that I became a writer.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.050
And I really think immigration
made me into a writer

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:07.560
for two reasons.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.570
The one thing is when I
was in my home culture,

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.510
I didn't think about it.

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.020
It was just there.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.830
It was when I came
to America, I began

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:20.150
to see my Indian culture,
really, for what it was,

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.650
and I began to see what
I appreciated and missed

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:23.480
about it.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.640
And I began to have some
questions about things

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:31.420
like women's roles and so
forth in Indian culture.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.450
And it wasn't around me.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.360
I missed it.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.580
So I wanted to write
about it, to recreate it

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.140
through books--
stories at that time.

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.680
I didn't know that I
was going to be any good

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:44.820
or if I was going
to publish anything.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.590
I just wrote to
understand for myself.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.760
I think that's really important.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.110
And I wrote to
understand not just

00:43:53.110 --> 00:43:56.320
India but what I was
seeing around me,

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.680
other immigrants like myself.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.800
And immigration was such
an amazing experience.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:06.450
It was at once
transformative and terrifying

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.910
because it was the first
I was living on my own

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:10.450
away from my family.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:13.860
I was living in a culture where
all the rules seemed different.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.347
So, you know, I wanted to figure
things out through writing.

00:44:17.347 --> 00:44:18.930
And I could see other
people around me

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.890
were going through the
same kind of experience.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.300
And that's how I became a
writer, very tentatively.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.720
For years, I was
a closet writer.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.280
Nobody knew I was writing.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.160
I would be teaching
during the day.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.050
Late at night, I would
sit at my desk and write.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.640
And just a-- I
should share this.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.800
Don't tell other people.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.890
When I started,
I was really bad.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.660
I wasn't good.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.260
I was really bad.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.300
But I got better.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.280
And that's the amazing thing
about writing-- and any art,

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:53.780
I think.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.640
If you are sincerely dedicated
to it, and you keep writing,

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.510
and you listen, you get
good feedback from people,

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.590
and you listen, and you
try to get better, you do.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:06.260
That was certainly
the case with--

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.620
AUDIENCE: My question is related
to how we define success,

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:13.570
and especially for women.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.910
And I'm an immigrant like you.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.530
And I grew up-- and my mom
didn't get to go to college.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:20.160
And we were three daughters.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.640
And she said, I want you
guys all to go to college.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:25.530
So my image of who I
would be was always

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.365
about having a career.

00:45:27.365 --> 00:45:30.510
So I got [INAUDIBLE], came
to America, got married,

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.860
and somewhere along, I
became a mother, too.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.112
And to me-- and at
some point in my life,

00:45:36.112 --> 00:45:37.320
I had to decide to quit work.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:39.070
So then it was the
hardest decision for me

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:41.700
because whatever image
I had of me as defined

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.360
as success did not involve
staying home and raising kids

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:47.110
because that's what
my grandmother did.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:51.470
Somehow, I had this message
given to me, not through words.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.362
All that my mom said was, I
want you to have education.

00:45:54.362 --> 00:45:55.570
I want you to be independent.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:45:56.530
Whatever.

00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:00.530
But somehow, I translated
it to being a homemaker

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:02.160
meant it was not success.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.570
But somehow, I did stay
home, raise my kids,

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.340
then now, I'm back at Google.

00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:08.970
And I have a daughter
who's 22 years old now.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.820
And so I've been telling
a lot of things to her,

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.930
same way my mom told me.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:15.450
And there will be
times in her life

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:19.010
she'll be making
decisions which it's not

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:24.450
the exact words I said to her,
but how she understood it.

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:26.860
And not only that, in my
own life, as you said,

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.990
the definition of
success has changed.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.140
And we take on different
roles, and different roles

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.320
needs different levels
of contribution.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.140
And the success
definition changes.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:38.266
And we get messages
from the media

00:46:38.266 --> 00:46:39.890
and the peer group
and everything else,

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:43.410
in addition to what
you heard from home.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.490
And I agree with your principals
about being true to yourself.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.430
And sometimes, what
you heard growing up

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.880
and thinking what is success
could be in contradiction

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.010
with what you feel as
your own value system.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:56.007
And then the conflict--
and so I just

00:46:56.007 --> 00:46:58.340
want you to shed some light,
because it's a topic that's

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.432
interesting to me.

00:46:59.432 --> 00:47:00.390
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Yes.

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:01.820
That's a great topic.

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.620
And, you know, it's not like
I have all the answers here,

00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.140
folks.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.780
I just write books in
which people are always

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.570
messing up their lives.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:17.760
But I think we just do the
best with the intentions

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.450
that we have at that point,
with the information we have

00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:22.550
at that point, and with
the amount of maturity

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.010
we have at that point.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:26.470
And so one of the
lessons that the women

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:29.700
in "Before We Visit the
Goddess," they have to learn--

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.950
and it's a lesson, I
think, I have to learn

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.340
and I hope I'm
learning-- is just

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:38.120
as we forgive other people,
we have to forgive ourselves.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.800
We have to forgive
our ancestors.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.990
They passed on the best message
they knew how to pass on.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.590
Right?

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.200
And we received it the best
way we knew how to receive it.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.920
The intention was always good.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.610
The intention was never bad.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.320
The intention was loving.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.070
And so we did the best we could.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.640
And if it didn't, and
if it wasn't, now I

00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.530
look back-- and
believe me, I look back

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.590
on some of my earlier
decisions, and I'm like, oh.

00:48:03.590 --> 00:48:06.160
But, you know, I have
compassion for the person

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.180
I was at that point.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.300
That person did
the best she could.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:14.200
So I think it's important
to find a balance.

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.190
We want to be
thinking individuals.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.490
I mean, we don't want to
dwell too much upon things

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:22.490
that we are doing because
we're always making mistakes.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.610
Fortunately I think
our children are

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:27.720
smarter than we give
them credit for,

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:30.430
and they will turn
out just fine.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:34.220
In spite of all the mistakes
I made in parenting,

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:38.050
I have hope that my children
will turn out just fine.

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.530
AUDIENCE: The reason I asked
about unconscious bias was

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:42.760
I think I've been subject
to unconscious bias.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.285
But I've also been the one
who caused unconscious bias.

00:48:45.285 --> 00:48:46.910
And I'm going to
share the story, then,

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:49.243
very quickly because I don't
want to take away from you.

00:48:49.243 --> 00:48:53.395
But I think we'd be lying if we
think we're the only ones who

00:48:53.395 --> 00:48:54.680
are subject to it.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.950
So I've had a boss
here at Google.

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:00.570
She was there,
took google public.

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.110
She's left Google since then,
takes all companies public.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.430
I met her for dinner once.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.531
And I said, oh, yeah,
how's Lauren doing.

00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:09.530
She said, yeah, her second
birthday's coming up,

00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:10.970
but I have no idea.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.786
David's organizing
the birthday parties.

00:49:12.786 --> 00:49:14.660
I don't even know anything
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.740
In my mind, I did
say, really, Mona?

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:19.746
Like, you have no idea
about your daughter's

00:49:19.746 --> 00:49:21.620
second birthday, and
your husband's doing it?

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.090
I walked away thinking, I'm
all about women empowerment.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:26.970
I teach the stretch
classes here.

00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:29.300
I council a lot of
women outside Google.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.120
And I was thinking, this is me,
the thing I'm fighting against.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:34.886
A lot of times, when we talk
about unconscious bias--

00:49:34.886 --> 00:49:37.010
and that's why I asked you
that question-- is we're

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:40.094
doing a lot of this to ourselves
and to the women around us.

00:49:40.094 --> 00:49:41.760
So I just thought I'd
share that because

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.970
of the whole thing
about intention

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:45.555
and being aware
of what things we

00:49:45.555 --> 00:49:47.514
are doing so we are
fighting against ourselves.

00:49:47.514 --> 00:49:48.471
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Yes.

00:49:48.471 --> 00:49:49.840
I think that's so important.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.660
But just the fact that
you became aware of that,

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.800
that's a huge growth step.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.530
That's a huge growth step.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:01.890
And, you know, that's why we
have a prayer in our language,

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.030
in Sanskrit, that I say often.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:08.660
And I say, oh, Lord, forgive me
for the bad things I've done,

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.840
some of which I've known, and
a lot of which I don't even

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.190
know that I did it.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.550
So just please help me
become a better person.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:17.260
Because we don't
become aware of it.

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.280
Becoming aware is the first and
perhaps the most important step

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.180
towards change.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.260
So I commend you for
sharing that story.

00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:27.620
AUDIENCE: The thread that
I'm noticing all the way

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:31.340
through our discussion
and your responses

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.930
is that compassion is the
kernel to every woman's success.

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:40.180
And in addition to that--
compassion for yourself,

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.070
compassion to not begrudge
yourself because often,

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:47.620
the male definition of
success is very different.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:50.840
It doesn't require if
you need to balance

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:54.240
being a mother versus being
a father, necessarily.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:56.860
There are different sacrifices
with being a mother.

00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:58.760
Your body's taken
over for 10 months.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.632
There's certain things
that are inevitable.

00:51:00.632 --> 00:51:01.590
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Yes.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.135
And the body continues,
like, many months afterwards.

00:51:04.135 --> 00:51:04.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.910
It's all downhill after
that in many ways,

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.780
but also very uphill
in other ways.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:15.070
But it strikes me that
female compassion is not--

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.030
it's possible only when you have
compassion towards yourself,

00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:22.110
but also only when you have
a compassionate partner that

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:24.610
enables you and encourages you.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:26.780
And that's something
common, also,

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:31.550
to more Western or
less-- more Western

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.200
ideas of what female
success is, too.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:36.090
You know, Sheryl
Sandberg also says

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.390
that you pick a partner
who lets you lean in

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.469
or helps you lean in.

00:51:41.469 --> 00:51:42.510
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI: Right.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:45.840
And to that, I think
those are very good ideas

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:47.820
and very important points.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:53.180
And to that I will say,
that is the ideal situation.

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.700
And then I'll say, you
know, a lot of times,

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:57.760
the situation isn't ideal.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.090
What are we going to do?

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:01.010
We're going to do
the best we can.

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.890
But if I don't have such a
partner, I'm not going to stop.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.620
I'm just going to
do the best I can.

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:06.570
I mean, I'm blessed.

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:09.360
I do have a partner like
that who is very supportive.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:13.890
But if I didn't, I shouldn't
make myself stop short.

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:18.200
I shouldn't shortchange myself
because the people around me

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.680
are not going to support me.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.700
I'm going to say-- Tagore has
this wonderful song, "Ekla

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:24.820
Chalo Re."

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:28.340
It means, walk by yourself,
forward by yourself.

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:30.510
Hopefully, people
will be there to help.

00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:32.324
But ultimately, it's me.

00:52:32.324 --> 00:52:33.490
AUDIENCE: It's your journey.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:35.030
CHITRA DIVAKARUNI:
It's my journey.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:38.570
And I really can't blame other
people for whatever happens.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:42.340
I understand, yes, some people
help, some people don't.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.410
But ultimately, I
believe it's my journey.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:48.260
And it's not even how
much I achieve outside,

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:52.700
but it's my journey in terms
of my attitude inside, right?

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:54.665
Nobody else affects my attitude.

00:52:54.665 --> 00:52:56.930
You know, I read
this some time back,

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.720
and it's really stuck with me--
we sometimes say, so and so

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.590
made me unhappy.

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.360
So and so made me unsuccessful.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.050
So and so did-- no, no, no.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.700
I'm the one who
makes myself unhappy.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.600
And any time I think otherwise,
I'm thinking wrongly.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.050
I'm just passing the buck.

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.970
And I think that's the
greatest success, right?

00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:24.700
Realizing that I'm the
one who makes it happen.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:26.030
That's success.

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:27.910
And there's a
moment when Sabitri

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:30.030
realizes that in her life.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.840
She's thinking about what is
the happiest moment in her life?

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.110
And I won't give it away.

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.680
But it's a moment that
deals with herself, not

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.120
with the people around her.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:42.140
In fact, as long as Sabitri's
waiting for happiness

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:46.320
to happen because of some
external relationship,

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.860
it slips away from her.

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:51.920
And I think it slips
away from all of us, too.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.270
