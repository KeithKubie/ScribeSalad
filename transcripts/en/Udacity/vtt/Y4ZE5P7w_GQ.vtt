00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
There are some other things to consider in customer segments

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
besides jobs to be done and pain and gain, and that is--who's the customer?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Gee, I thought we're just defined the customers, it's the archetype, it's the persona

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but sometimes who's the customer in context is really what we need to know.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In corporations, it's pretty easy to understand that you might have someone who uses the product

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but they might not be the person who pays for the product.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, there might be someone up here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The payer, let's give them a fancy name and call them the economic buyer.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So we might be buying software for accounting to use,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but it might be the chief financial officer who has to sign off for that,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and in between those process, in a large company, you might have people who influence the decisions,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you might have people who actually recommend who the vendors should be,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you might have a decision-maker who's the head of the department

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but he still needs to pass off the final purchase to the chief financial officer,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and surprisingly, if you spend enough time selling to companies, you might have saboteurs

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and saboteurs in the company are individuals or organizations whose jobs feel threatened

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
if they knew piece of software or new process or new organization comes in place.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And so in complicated business to business sales, you really need to know the archetypes

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
for each one of these even though you might think, all I need to know is about my user,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and then you might go okay well then all we need to know is about the buyer.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
As we'll see later, you actually need to understand archetypes for all.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now, if you were kind of rolling your eyes going, well I don't sell to businesses,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I just sell to consumers, this isn't relevant to me.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I want you to think of a case of selling entertainment software to teens.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, think about it. You kind of say, the user, well that's pretty simple.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's the team. How hard can that be?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Well, if they don't have a job, the economic buyer are their parents

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and the influencers and recommenders may be their friends,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and the decision-maker, depending on your family might be mom or dad or the kid,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
or somebody else in between and so when you think about business to consumer sales,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you also need to start thinking about is the user different than the payer.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The last example is a personal one. I was buying a car and I thought how simple could that be.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I was the customer. Well little did I know, having two teenage daughters, that really wasn't the case.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Cause when I started talking about my care or potential car, my daughters said,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
"Dad, you can't buy that type of car. We wouldn't be caught dead on it."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I looked at them and I said, well the car is not for you.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
They said, "Oh, we just won't even be riding in it," and they said,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
"Well, listen if you buy that car, you can't get that color, "

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and this conversation went on for a long time until finally we're able to make a decision

00:02:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and I realized that the final decision-maker in our household was my wife.
