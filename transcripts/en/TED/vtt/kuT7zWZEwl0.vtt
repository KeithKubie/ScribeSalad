00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.695
I teach history

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.960
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.536
On February 14, 2018,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.880
my school experienced one of the worst
mass school shootings in American history.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.456
People want to know what we saw,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.680
what I felt.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.800
I don't remember everything,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.216
but I do remember I went into crisis mode,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.536
mother mode.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.760
There was no emotion.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.896
I lined up the kids,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.816
I held up a sign so they could
follow me through the hall,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.160
just like a fire drill.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.080
I heard shots from one direction.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.000
Luckily, we were already
moving in the opposite direction.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.680
We made it outside.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.120
We made it to safety.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.400
I called my mother.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.536
"I'm OK."

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.040
I called my husband.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.456
"I'm OK."

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.680
Then my daughter called, my voice cracked,
and I knew I had to pull myself together.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.096
I sat alone in my thoughts,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.160
worried about my colleagues and students.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.560
We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day --

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.256
We sat there, only understanding
that somehow, Valentine's Day

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.056
had ended up with our babies dead,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.960
and we didn't know what to do next.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.856
It's been two months,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.696
and every day I still hear the echoes
of the "pop, pop" sound of the gunfire.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.336
I remember the fearful faces
of my students

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.080
when we knew it wasn't a drill.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.880
Still, there's no constant emotion,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.456
except for flashes
of pain, grief and anger

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.336
triggered by the news,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.816
or an insensitive comment,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.080
or just silence.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.736
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School
lost 17 precious lives

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.360
on that horrible day.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.576
After, students asked us, the adults

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.376
the hardest question:

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.520
How can we stop the senseless violence?

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.200
This was the most difficult
question I've been asked.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.256
But it was not the first time
I've been humbled by a student's question.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.976
I've been teaching
in the public schools for 33 years,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.416
so I know you have to admit
what you don't know

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.680
before you can share what you do know.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.096
In fact, there's a method
to being an engaged student,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.040
teacher, citizen.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.600
First, listen closely
to the person asking you a question.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.000
Second, admit your vulnerability.
Admit what you don't know.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.736
Third, do your homework.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.336
Fourth, humbly share your knowledge.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.536
I know all about this process.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.656
My students ask really
thoughtful questions all the time.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.296
They're eager to learn,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.080
and sometimes they're eager
to prove their smarts.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.656
And believe me, they know
when I have no idea of the answer,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.096
so in those instances, I say to them,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.880
"That's a great question.
Let me research that and get back to you."

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.816
So when my students asked,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.416
"How do we stop this senseless violence?"

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.640
I listened,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.360
and then I admitted,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.440
"I don't know."

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.256
And like I always do when I don't know
the answer to one of my questions,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.320
I began doing my homework.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.656
And as a history teacher,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.120
I knew I needed to start
with the Second Amendment and the NRA.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.896
In case it's been a while since
you've been sitting in a history class,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.536
here is what the Second Amendment

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.760
actually says:

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.616
"A well regulated Militia,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.016
being necessary
to the security of a free State,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.896
the right of the people
to keep and bear arms,

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.480
shall not be infringed."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.656
Meaning, the federal government could not
infringe on the rights of citizens

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.040
to participate in well-regulated militias.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.136
The Second Amendment
was ratified 226 years ago.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.896
It was written in a time before
the federal government's armed forces

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.176
were among the most powerful in the world

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.000
and when state militias were viewed
as necessary to protect the states.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.176
Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.536
The American Civil War
had ended a few years prior,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.496
but a couple of Union officers

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.440
had witnessed some pretty shoddy
marksmanship on the battlefield.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.736
So in an attempt to prepare their men
for any future conflicts,

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.776
they founded the National
Rifle Association

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.400
to promote rifle practice.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.416
In short, the Second Amendment
was written to ensure

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.216
that our newly formed and fragile country

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.216
had access to organized state militias.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.960
And the NRA's original mission was
to ensure future soldiers had good aim.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.176
Someone could teach an entire course

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.216
on how the next 150 years influenced
the gun regulation conversations

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.856
we're having in the United States

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.520
and our interpretation
of the Second Amendment.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.296
Almost every pivotal moment
in our nation's history

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.576
in one way or another

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.416
influenced how we as a people

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.920
manufacture, debate,
regulate and feel about guns.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.800
A lot of change has occurred.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.336
As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.376
that the Supreme Court
ruled for the first time

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.776
the Second Amendment protects
an individual right to possess a firearm

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.336
unconnected with service in a militia

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.176
and to use that arm
for traditionally lawful purposes,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.136
such as self-defense within the home.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.000
Within the home.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.176
This change over time is striking to me,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.736
because it reminds us

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.056
that the interpretation
of the Second Amendment

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.896
and cultural attitudes about guns

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.640
have changed over time.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.560
Which gives me hope
they could change again.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.840
(Applause)

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.776
It's an incredibly complex
and dynamic history lesson,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.056
but it's not the lesson
I'm here to teach today,

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.736
because we don't have time.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.336
I'm not talking about time,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.696
the time that I have here
to stand and speak.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.096
I'm talking about the fact
we don't have time to lose.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.216
According to the CDC,

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.496
over the last five years,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:41.176
on average, each day 96 people
are killed by guns in the United States,

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.160
and if we don't figure out how to answer
my students' question soon,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.960
one of us could be next.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.256
So, if the question is,
how do we stop this senseless violence,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.616
the best way I can think to answer

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.776
is to look at multiple choice.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.000
You remember multiple-choice
questions in high school, don't you?

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.480
Let's start.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.176
Choice A: this will end when we
hold gun manufacturers responsible

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.400
for the deadliness of their products.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.256
It might surprise you to learn that we've
actually thought about this before.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.176
Between 1998 and 2000,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.016
30 counties and cities
sued gun manufacturers,

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.696
saying they should
make their products safer

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.400
and do a better job of tracking
where their products are sold.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.696
In response, manufacturers argued

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.560
that they had no direct liability
for how their products were used.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:47.376
They said the stores who sold the guns
and the owners who bought them

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.120
were responsible
should anything bad happen.

00:08:51.559 --> 00:08:54.096
In response to this
and many other lawsuits,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.120
the NRA lobbied
for the passage of the PLCAA,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.976
the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.336
The PLCAA passed
with bipartisan support in 2005

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.896
and entrusts gun manufacturers

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.456
to design guns safely,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.880
stores to sell those guns responsibly

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.640
and someone to own
and use the gun responsibly.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:28.600
And so when 17 students
and faculty die at my school,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.920
no one in this chain
will assume responsibility.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.616
Let's take a look at another option,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.656
Choice B:

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.456
this will end when we
hold ourselves accountable

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:55.216
and regulate the estimated
300 million guns available in America.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.576
Yes, voting is one of the best ways

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.576
to take personal responsibility
for gun violence.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.536
Making sure that our lawmakers
are willing to pass commonsense gun reform

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.560
is one of the most effective ways to get
those 300 million guns under control.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.880
And also, gun owners
can take personal initiative.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:17.736
If you own a gun,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.960
ask yourself:

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920
Do I have an extra gun I don't need?

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.336
Could it fall into the wrong hands?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.800
Have I attended the latest training?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.656
Perhaps as a gun owner,

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.936
you should also ask

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.016
whether you have been
taking care of your mental health?

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.136
When it comes to gun violence,
the mental health argument falls flat

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.616
if we don't acknowledge
our own personal vulnerabilities

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.840
to mental illness.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.976
One in six Americans
will struggle with mental illness.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.816
If we own a gun, we should be
rigorously engaged in the upkeep

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.056
of our emotional well-being

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.016
so we don't pull a trigger

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.400
in times of illness.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.536
Otherwise, we should
seriously ask ourselves

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.400
whether we really have the time
and attention to own a gun.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.376
Perhaps for some of us

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.160
it's time to lay down our arms.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.616
Then we have Choice C:

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.880
this will end when we do a better job
of taking care of each other.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.536
Many social issues affect
why people buy and use guns.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.096
Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.680
between 2012 and 2016 were suicides,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.896
yet we call people maniacs
and psychos, shaming them.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.336
We are creating barriers
for people that need help.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.840
Why are we embarrassing each other?

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.696
Let's make it easier, not harder,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.440
for people to access
better mental health care.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.096
What else? Sexism, racism
and poverty affect gun ownership

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.880
and gun-related fatalities.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:10.296
On average, it's estimated that 50 women
were fatally shot each month

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.936
between 2010 and 2014

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.256
due to domestic violence,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.336
and women are still dying in their homes.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.856
Let's empower women

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.856
and give our young boys a chance to learn

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.040
how to work out their conflicts
and emotions with words, not weapons.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.016
And the "Washington Post"
reported that last year,

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.696
nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.696
by on-duty police officers.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.816
Talk to Black Lives Matter
and the police union about that.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.536
We need to tackle this.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:50.280
(Applause)

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.136
At the end of the day,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.896
perhaps people won't feel the need

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.656
to buy and use a gun

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:04.496
when they all equally feel safe,

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.280
healthy, respected and cared for.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.216
All right, discussion time is over.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.816
It's now time to answer the question.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.896
How do we stop this senseless violence?

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.040
Is it Choice A,

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.000
Choice B,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.200
Choice C?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.736
Now, I know what you're all thinking.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.816
You remember that
multiple-choice questions

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.456
almost never end
with just three possibilities.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.680
There's always that fourth,
Choice D: all of the above.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.440
Maybe that's the answer here.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:48.080
Or maybe "all of the above" is too easy,
and this is not an easy problem.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.336
It requires deep analytical
thinking by all of us.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.776
So instead, I'm asking you
to do your homework,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.976
write your own Choice D

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.376
using supporting detail.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:07.176
And if you're not sure where to start,
look to my students as role models.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.456
They are armed with incredible
communication skills

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.136
and a sense of citizenship
that I find so inspiring.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:17.840
(Applause)

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:29.776
These are public school kids
engaged in the issue of gun regulation,

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.520
and their endeavor has moved our hearts.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.600
And they shouldn't have
to do this on their own.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.976
They're asking you,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.776
they're asking all of us,

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.200
to get involved.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.000
This isn't a spectator sport.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.296
So what's the right answer?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.896
I don't know. Listen,
I'm no gun control expert.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.600
I teach the humanities.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.736
To be human is to learn,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.856
and to be part of a civilization
is to share your knowledge.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.416
This kind of honest,
brave and sincere engagement

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.576
is what I ask of my students,

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.656
what I expect of myself as a teacher

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:13.080
and what I demand of you now.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.096
Every one of you
needs to do your homework.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.336
And then what?

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.736
Humbly share your knowledge
with each other.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.776
Please teach your family,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.216
teach your community,

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:30.056
your city council, your state legislature.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.480
Teach Congress a lesson.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.296
Thank you.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.096
(Applause)

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.576
Thank you. Thank you.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:45.720
(Applause)
