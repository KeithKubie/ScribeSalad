the fastest route it can between the
 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.479
the fastest route it can between the
four players so if you're on a local

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489
four players so if you're on a local
 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.610
four players so if you're on a local
network it will actually choose a route

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:06.329
so what is the experience in terms of
the Google Play Developer console do you

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:06.339
the Google Play Developer console do you
 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.669
the Google Play Developer console do you
get to see how people use your game and

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:08.679
get to see how people use your game and
 

00:06:08.679 --> 00:06:10.709
get to see how people use your game and
the API so you get you get a couple of

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:10.719
the API so you get you get a couple of
 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.029
the API so you get you get a couple of
things one is a you do get some basic

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039
things one is a you do get some basic
 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.559
things one is a you do get some basic
analytics on how people are using your

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569
analytics on how people are using your
 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.219
analytics on how people are using your
game and I mean obviously I always

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229
game and I mean obviously I always
 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.169
game and I mean obviously I always
recommend people put their own analytics

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:19.179
recommend people put their own analytics
 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:20.729
recommend people put their own analytics
in as well but as we roll this out

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:20.739
in as well but as we roll this out
 

00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:22.049
in as well but as we roll this out
further we're gonna have deeper and

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:22.059
further we're gonna have deeper and
 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:23.369
further we're gonna have deeper and
deeper engagement numbers which is

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379
deeper engagement numbers which is
 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.219
deeper engagement numbers which is
exciting what's also cool is actually we

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229
exciting what's also cool is actually we
 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.350
exciting what's also cool is actually we
actually get to see the engagement

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360
actually get to see the engagement
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.149
actually get to see the engagement
numbers as well and this is and I think

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159
numbers as well and this is and I think
 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:31.709
numbers as well and this is and I think
this is exciting because you know we

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719
this is exciting because you know we
 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:34.799
this is exciting because you know we
don't track people's usage on Android so

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:34.809
don't track people's usage on Android so
 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:35.969
don't track people's usage on Android so
we don't know what games they're playing

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979
we don't know what games they're playing
 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:37.559
we don't know what games they're playing
but now they're signing in they're

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569
but now they're signing in they're
 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.569
but now they're signing in they're
saying yes Google you know we want you

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:39.579
saying yes Google you know we want you
 

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.189
saying yes Google you know we want you
to know about what we're doing and that

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199
to know about what we're doing and that
 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.060
to know about what we're doing and that
gives us a much better way

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070
gives us a much better way
 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.010
gives us a much better way
directing people to games that we know

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020
