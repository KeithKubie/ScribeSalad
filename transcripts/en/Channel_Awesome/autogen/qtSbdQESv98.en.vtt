00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:53.350 align:start position:0%
much it why I this sort of thing just as
 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
much it why I this sort of thing just as
a<00:07:53.380><c> it's</c><00:07:53.830><c> like</c><00:07:54.010><c> I'm</c><00:07:54.190><c> used</c><00:07:54.430><c> to</c><00:07:54.580><c> kind</c><00:07:54.820><c> of</c><00:07:54.940><c> seeing</c>

a it's like I'm used to kind of seeing
 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
a it's like I'm used to kind of seeing
this<00:07:55.360><c> even</c><00:07:55.630><c> an</c><00:07:55.750><c> animated</c><00:07:56.230><c> well</c><00:07:56.380><c> I</c><00:07:56.410><c> think</c>

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.530 align:start position:0%
this even an animated well I think
 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.650 align:start position:0%
this even an animated well I think
because<00:07:56.830><c> it's</c><00:07:57.430><c> it's</c><00:07:57.850><c> a</c><00:07:58.030><c> twist</c><00:07:58.420><c> as</c><00:07:58.630><c> a</c>

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:58.660 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a twist as a
 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a twist as a
legitimate<00:07:59.590><c> legal</c><00:07:59.710><c> I</c><00:08:00.490><c> I</c><00:08:00.520><c> think</c><00:08:00.730><c> it's</c>

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:00.970 align:start position:0%
legitimate legal I I think it's
 

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.430 align:start position:0%
legitimate legal I I think it's
something<00:08:01.120><c> even</c><00:08:01.360><c> if</c><00:08:01.570><c> you</c><00:08:01.630><c> put</c><00:08:01.870><c> together</c><00:08:02.050><c> it's</c>

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
something even if you put together it's
 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:19.990 align:start position:0%
know this is the one and seeing how
 

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
know this is the one and seeing how
everybody<00:09:20.290><c> exploded</c><00:09:21.100><c> with</c><00:09:21.370><c> um</c><00:09:21.700><c> with</c><00:09:21.940><c> Korra</c>

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:22.630 align:start position:0%
everybody exploded with um with Korra
 

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.210 align:start position:0%
everybody exploded with um with Korra
and<00:09:22.900><c> the</c><00:09:22.960><c> ending</c><00:09:23.260><c> of</c><00:09:23.350><c> that</c><00:09:23.560><c> that</c><00:09:23.800><c> would</c><00:09:23.920><c> be</c><00:09:24.070><c> my</c>

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:24.220 align:start position:0%
and the ending of that that would be my
 

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:25.810 align:start position:0%
assumption too that this would be that
 

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%

um and again I'm with you it's it's neat
I<00:11:24.490><c> want</c><00:11:24.790><c> to</c><00:11:24.880><c> see</c><00:11:25.000><c> it</c><00:11:25.090><c> explored</c><00:11:25.600><c> more</c><00:11:25.900><c> yeah</c><00:11:26.290><c> and</c>

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
I want to see it explored more yeah and
 

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.990 align:start position:0%
I want to see it explored more yeah and
I<00:11:26.680><c> think</c><00:11:26.980><c> the</c><00:11:27.070><c> reason</c><00:11:27.400><c> it</c><00:11:27.520><c> got</c><00:11:27.670><c> so</c><00:11:27.850><c> much</c>

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
I think the reason it got so much
 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think the reason it got so much
attention<00:11:28.060><c> is</c><00:11:28.810><c> because</c><00:11:29.260><c> a</c><00:11:29.440><c> it</c><00:11:29.710><c> is</c><00:11:29.830><c> a</c><00:11:29.860><c> twist</c><00:11:30.250><c> and</c>

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
attention is because a it is a twist and
 

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
attention is because a it is a twist and
B<00:11:30.820><c> it's</c><00:11:31.180><c> really</c><00:11:32.110><c> the</c><00:11:32.230><c> only</c><00:11:32.350><c> art</c><00:11:32.560><c> time</c><00:11:32.830><c> outside</c>

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.190 align:start position:0%
B it's really the only art time outside
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
B it's really the only art time outside

whatever<00:13:56.300><c> may</c><00:13:56.840><c> they</c><00:13:56.990><c> can</c><00:13:57.140><c> be</c><00:13:57.320><c> they</c><00:13:57.470><c> can't</c><00:13:57.710><c> but</c>

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:57.890 align:start position:0%
whatever may they can be they can't but
 

00:13:57.890 --> 00:13:59.050 align:start position:0%
whatever may they can be they can't but
they<00:13:57.950><c> keep</c><00:13:58.100><c> that's</c><00:13:58.280><c> not</c><00:13:58.520><c> how</c><00:13:58.610><c> they</c><00:13:58.760><c> reproduce</c>

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.060 align:start position:0%
they keep that's not how they reproduce
 

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.450 align:start position:0%
they keep that's not how they reproduce
so<00:13:59.960><c> I</c><00:13:59.990><c> think</c><00:14:00.590><c> it's</c><00:14:00.740><c> something</c><00:14:00.950><c> where</c><00:14:01.280><c> it's</c>

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:01.460 align:start position:0%
so I think it's something where it's
 

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
so I think it's something where it's
like<00:14:01.700><c> the</c><00:14:01.880><c> idea</c><00:14:02.030><c> of</c><00:14:02.300><c> the</c><00:14:02.660><c> two</c><00:14:02.840><c> of</c><00:14:02.870><c> them</c><00:14:03.110><c> being</c>

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:03.290 align:start position:0%
like the idea of the two of them being
 

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
like the idea of the two of them being
in<00:14:03.500><c> love</c><00:14:03.710><c> you</c><00:14:04.100><c> know</c><00:14:04.250><c> and</c><00:14:04.280><c> then</c><00:14:04.700><c> kissing</c><00:14:05.210><c> and</c>

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:07.370 align:start position:0%
all that stuff is not a big deal I think
 

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.010 align:start position:0%
all that stuff is not a big deal I think
the<00:14:07.610><c> fusion</c><00:14:08.090><c> is</c><00:14:08.240><c> probably</c><00:14:08.510><c> like</c><00:14:08.690><c> a</c><00:14:08.720><c> bigger</c>

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.230 align:start position:0%
it just like I said I think it's done
it's<00:15:35.180><c> it's</c><00:15:35.570><c> more</c><00:15:35.840><c> interesting</c><00:15:36.260><c> than</c><00:15:36.530><c> a</c><00:15:37.240><c> corn</c>

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.730 align:start position:0%
ami or korrasami korrasami it's more
interesting<00:15:41.810><c> than</c><00:15:41.870><c> I</c><00:15:42.020><c> said</c><00:15:42.170><c> this</c><00:15:42.410><c> so</c><00:15:42.560><c> I</c>

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:42.740 align:start position:0%
interesting than I said this so I
 

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.490 align:start position:0%
interesting than I said this so I
thought<00:15:42.950><c> korrasami</c><00:15:43.430><c> was</c><00:15:43.730><c> a</c><00:15:43.760><c> bigger</c><00:15:44.000><c> shock</c><00:15:44.500><c> but</c>

thought korrasami was a bigger shock but
 

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
thought korrasami was a bigger shock but
that's<00:15:45.710><c> just</c><00:15:45.950><c> because</c><00:15:46.310><c> a</c><00:15:46.460><c> it</c><00:15:46.790><c> seemed</c><00:15:47.060><c> to</c><00:15:47.150><c> come</c>

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:47.330 align:start position:0%
that's just because a it seemed to come
 

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.350 align:start position:0%

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.130 align:start position:0%
it doesn't tie in but um but no that's
 

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:02.770 align:start position:0%
it doesn't tie in but um but no that's
