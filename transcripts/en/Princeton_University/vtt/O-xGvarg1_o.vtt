[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.070
SARAH-JANE LESLIE: I think
it's fantastic to recognize

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.800
students who are taking
risks with their dissertation

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.330
projects.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.650
Students who are thinking
outside of the box.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.360
And I think that's
one special thing

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.250
that the Jacobus Prize allows
us to recognize at Princeton.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.590
ADAM LERNER: I'm Adam Lerner.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.540
I'm a graduate student
working at the intersection

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.580
of philosophy and
cognitive science.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.700
And my dissertation is on the
role of empathy and ethics.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.450
SARAH-JANE LESLIE: Adam isn't
afraid to stake out positions

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.480
that are challenging to people.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.960
He's not afraid to occupy
controversial areas

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.180
of the intellectual terrain.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.110
And he's also -- never hesitates
to employ the most cutting-edge

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.750
or innovative techniques
in order to test those.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.720
ADAM LERNER: This is a lemon.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.520
And, OK, so probably, if
you're like most people,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.520
when you saw me bite into
that lemon, your mouth

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.710
itself puckered.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.594
You might have even felt some
saliva pooling into your mouth.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:07.010
That may not have
happened to you,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.926
but it happens to lots
of people when they see

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:11.540
another person eating a lemon.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.640
And that is -- you
were simulating

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.800
what it's like to eat
a lemon, automatically.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.130
You didn't have to try;
it was just automatic.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.630
So that's one way in which you
might simulate someone else's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.710
experience.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.250
Another is if you see
someone cutting a lemon,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.770
and they slip and
accidentally cut their finger.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.540
You might withdraw
your own finger

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.994
as if you had cut your
finger and even wince.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.160
You're simulating what it's
like to cut your finger.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.230
It doesn't feel exactly the same
way as cutting your own finger,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.430
but it's a faint echo of
the pain you would feel

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.410
if you cut your own finger.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.090
So that's an
example of, sort of,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.542
automatic mirroring
form of empathy

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:48.500
where you automatically
simulate the experience

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.670
of the other person.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.170
But there are other
forms of empathy

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.460
that are more deliberate.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.650
So you can read a novel
and try to imagine

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.300
what it's like to be someone --

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.960
to be the protagonist.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.150
You can also use
virtual reality devices

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.630
to put yourself in the
shoes of another person,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.419
to imagine what it's like
to be a refugee fleeing

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.320
from war, to imagine what it's
like to be an animal raised

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.670
on a factory farm.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.590
These are all ways you
can empathize deliberately

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.850
with other people, or beings
in general, such as animals.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.280
And these are all different
forms of simulating or sharing

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.484
other people's mental lives.

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:29.150
And, I think, that's
the kind of empathy

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.733
that I investigate
in my dissertation.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.710
