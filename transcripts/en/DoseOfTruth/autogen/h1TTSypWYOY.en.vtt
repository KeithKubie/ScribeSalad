in many communities especially
 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.340
in many communities especially
agricultural communities and there's a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
agricultural communities and there's a
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980

reason all these people were more herds

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
reason all these people were more herds
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170
reason all these people were more herds

lands so one of the ways that the
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.810

traditional communities solve that is

traditional communities solve that is
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580
traditional communities solve that is
they just give them almost everything to

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590
they just give them almost everything to
 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980
they just give them almost everything to
the firstborn and then everyone else

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
the firstborn and then everyone else
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.450
the firstborn and then everyone else
knows well you go out and do whatever

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
knows well you go out and do whatever
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.190
knows well you go out and do whatever
you can and it's kind of arbitrary and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
you can and it's kind of arbitrary and
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
you can and it's kind of arbitrary and
unfair but you know at least it's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
unfair but you know at least it's
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.179
unfair but you know at least it's
predictably arbitrary and unfair

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
predictably arbitrary and unfair
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.630
predictably arbitrary and unfair
instead of doom over for generations you

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
instead of doom over for generations you
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.639
instead of doom over for generations you
know so it actually mattered to be the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
know so it actually mattered to be the
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.219
know so it actually mattered to be the
firstborn and and God generally favors

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229
firstborn and and God generally favors
 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.649
firstborn and and God generally favors
the firstborn and then you might think

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
the firstborn and then you might think
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.450
the firstborn and then you might think
well what is it about being born first

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
well what is it about being born first
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.660
well what is it about being born first
that's so relevant apart from the the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
that's so relevant apart from the the
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.570
that's so relevant apart from the the
cultural practice of more generous

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
cultural practice of more generous
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.190
cultural practice of more generous
inheritance and I would say well the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
inheritance and I would say well the
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.880
inheritance and I would say well the
firstborn is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
firstborn is
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.620
firstborn is
something like the model for the leader

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
something like the model for the leader
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.420
something like the model for the leader
of the family right because the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
of the family right because the
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430
of the family right because the
firstborn child should be if there's a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
firstborn child should be if there's a
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.310
firstborn child should be if there's a
number of siblings they should take care

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320
number of siblings they should take care
 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.570
number of siblings they should take care
of the siblings at least to some degree

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
of the siblings at least to some degree
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.820
of the siblings at least to some degree
but also should be a role model for them

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
but also should be a role model for them
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.500
but also should be a role model for them
so it's like a natural position of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
so it's like a natural position of
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.960
so it's like a natural position of
leadership but there's a sight there's a

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970
leadership but there's a sight there's a
 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.360
leadership but there's a sight there's a
cycle psychologize ation of the idea of

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
cycle psychologize ation of the idea of
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.800
cycle psychologize ation of the idea of
the first board in these stories because

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
the first board in these stories because
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.500
the first board in these stories because
god often passes over the firstborn in

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
god often passes over the firstborn in
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.640
god often passes over the firstborn in
favor of a later born child he seems to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
favor of a later born child he seems to
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.620
favor of a later born child he seems to
do that on the basis of moral character

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
do that on the basis of moral character
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.750
do that on the basis of moral character
essentially and so there's this idea

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
essentially and so there's this idea
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.740
essentially and so there's this idea
that well there's a natural proclivity

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750
that well there's a natural proclivity
 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.880
that well there's a natural proclivity
towards leadership that's just a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890
towards leadership that's just a
 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.010
towards leadership that's just a
biological fact that would be associated

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020
biological fact that would be associated
 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.840
biological fact that would be associated
with being a firstborn but there's a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
with being a firstborn but there's a
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.240
with being a firstborn but there's a
element of characterological development

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
element of characterological development
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.490
element of characterological development
that transcends that and so that you

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500
that transcends that and so that you
 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.380
that transcends that and so that you
it's more important to be spiritually a

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
it's more important to be spiritually a
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.970
it's more important to be spiritually a
firstborn let's say than to be

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
firstborn let's say than to be
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.070
firstborn let's say than to be
biologically a firstborn and God

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
biologically a firstborn and God
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.680
biologically a firstborn and God
recognizes that continually in these

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
recognizes that continually in these
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.960
recognizes that continually in these
stories and inverts the natural order

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
stories and inverts the natural order

and favors a later born who's who's done

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
and favors a later born who's who's done
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.699
and favors a later born who's who's done
more work with regards to

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
more work with regards to
 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.090
more work with regards to
characterological development
