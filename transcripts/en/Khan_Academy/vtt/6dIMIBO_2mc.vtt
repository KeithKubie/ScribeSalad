00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.990
An interesting question has
come from some of the engineers

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.580
here at the Khan Academy while
they were working on the code.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.340
Are there any
quadrilaterals-- And I've

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.740
drawn an arbitrary
quadrilateral right over here.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.000
Quadrilateral ABCD.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.350
But is there any
quadrilateral that if I

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.580
were to draw the diagonals,
so let me draw the diagonals.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.370
So one diagonal is BD.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.712
And then the other diagonal,
I'll draw it right here, is AC.

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:26.900
And the point of intersection
of these two diagonals

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.840
is, let's call that point E.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:46.350
Is there any quadrilateral where
angle AEB is congruent to angle

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.562
ECB is congruent to this
angle right over here?

00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:51.062
ECB.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.650
So I'll let you think
about that for a second.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.370
Is there any quadrilateral
where these two angles

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.620
are going to be
congruent to each other?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.570
Now to think about
whether this is possible,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.550
let's assume that it is.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.120
So let's assume that we do
have a quadrilateral where

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.780
this is indeed the case.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.764
Where AEB, this angle right
over here, is congruent to angle

00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:22.263
ECB.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.910
We're just going to assume
that right from the get-go.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.790
Now let's try to visualize
this whole thing a little bit

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.950
differently.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.870
DB is a segment, but it's
a segment of a larger line.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.200
So we could keep extending
it off like this.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.150
And let's call that
larger line, line l.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.360
Let me draw it like this.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.070
So this right over
here is line l.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.210
DB is a subset of line l.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.511
And CB, which is a segment,
is also a subset of a line.

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.010
And we could call the line, if
we were to keep extending it,

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.070
let's call that line m.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800
So I'll draw it like this.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.350
So line m.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.030
CB is a subset of line m.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.880
And then we also
have the segment AC.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.220
And AC, once again,
is a segment but we

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.420
can view it as a subset
of a larger line.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.600
And we'll call that
larger line, line n.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.760
And so let me draw
a line n like this.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.590
And we see that it intersects
both line l and line m.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.540
So let me draw it like this, so
it looks something like that.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.580
That is line n.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.810
And we've assumed that angle
AEB is congruent to angle ECB.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.080
Well point E is just
where n and l intersect.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.490
So this right over
here is point E.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.350
And point C is where
lines n and m intersect.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.250
So this is point C.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.200
So this assumption
right over here,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.770
that we're assuming
from the get-go,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.600
is saying that this
angle AEB-- I'll

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.300
do it in the same magenta--
AEB is congruent to this angle.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.110
ECB is congruent to that angle.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.320
These angles are these
angles right over here.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.670
Now what does that tell
us about lines m and l?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.400
Well the way we've set it up, we
have two lines, lines l and m.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.000
Line n is a transversal.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.687
And now we have two
corresponding angles

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:29.270
are congruent.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.380
We assumed that from
the get-go that we

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.900
could find two quadrilateral,
where these two

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.160
corresponding angles
are congruent.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.480
But if you have two
corresponding angles congruent

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.610
like this, that means that these
two lines must be parallel.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.240
So this tells us that line
l is parallel to line m.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.780
Line l is parallel to line m.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.540
Which means that they
will never intersect.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.590
But we have a
contradiction showing up.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.130
And I'll let you think about
what that is for a second.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.340
Well the contradiction
that shows up,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.580
is that if line l is
parallel to line m,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.420
then any subset
of those two lines

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.230
have to be parallel
to each other.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.520
So if l is parallel
to m, then that

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.990
tells us that DB,
segment DB, needs

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:28.220
to be parallel to segment CB,
which means that they can never

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.790
intersect with each other.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.320
But that's a contradiction.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.170
They do intersect
with each other.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.940
They intersect right over here.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.330
So if we assume that
there's a quadrilateral,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.510
where this is the case, you
end up with this contradiction,

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.830
something that's not possible.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.780
By definition it
was a quadrilateral.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.580
This diagonal
intersects at point B,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.670
which is where this
side intersects, too.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.200
And so they have to intersect.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.310
These two cannot be parallel in
order for this to actually even

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.130
be a quadrilateral.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.310
And because of that,
it is impossible

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.270
for any quadrilateral
for this angle AEB

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.910
to be congruent
with this angle ECB.
