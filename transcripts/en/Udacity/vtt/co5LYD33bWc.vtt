00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.392
So we just spent a lot of time talking about domain, range, and all sorts of

00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:08.996
functions. I'd like to do a sort of review quiz over what a function really is

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:14.475
conceptually. We've talked about this in a lot of different contexts. Solving

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:18.105
this would be a good way to bridge the many different things that you're learned

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:22.626
about functions. So which of these choices correctly describe functions? You can

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.590
check off as many as you like. Does a function map each element of the domain to

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.676
at least one element of the range? Does it map each element of the domain to

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:35.460
exactly one element of the range? Does it relate a set of inputs to a set of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.159
outputs? Does it have to have a defined value for any real number that we want

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.856
to use as input? And is a function the same as any equation with two variables?
