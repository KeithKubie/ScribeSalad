00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.339
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.870
In the video today, we’re looking at why
Yankee Doodle called the feather in his cap

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.370
macaroni and the origin of the song.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.349
As with a lot of older songs, the tune and
music that we today associate with “Yankee

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.259
Doodle” was actually written much earlier
than the 18th century.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.060
The melody may have been heard as early as
the 1500s in Holland, with rather nonsensical

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.349
lyrics about the harvest and farmers receiving
their wage in buttermilk.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.970
Over the next two centuries, that particularly
melody bounced around Europe and was re-appropriated

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.579
for various other little jingles - like describing
the struggles of English Puritans or used

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:40.660
in nursery rhymes.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.340
(For instance, “Lucy Locket lost her pocket,
Kitty Fisher found it, nothing in it, nothing

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.109
in it, but the binding round it”- a rhyme
that may or may not have been written before

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.969
the tune started being used for Yankee Doodle).

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.640
Another theory is the Hessians were the ones
who originally brought the tune to the colonies

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
from Germany, where it was being used in a
drinking song.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.860
(Incidentally, the tune for the Star Spangled
Banner was also originally used in a popular

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.439
drinking song.)

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.020
Much like the origin of the melody, where
the well-known lyrics came from is also not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.460
definitively known.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.880
One popular theory is that similar lyrics
were first used to make fun of Oliver Cromwell,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.689
the 17th century English political and military
leader, for fancying himself a fashionable

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:23.689
person.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.310
The purported lyrics are sometimes said to
have begun “Yankee doodle come to town,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.720
upon on a Kentish pony.”

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.399
However, this seems unlikely considering the
word “Yankee” didn’t come along until

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.310
years after Cromwell, with the first known
documented instance appearing in 1683- used

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.250
by Dutch settlers in New Amsterdam (today’s
New York) to disparage their English colonist

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.930
neighbors in Connecticut.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.470
Stemming from the Dutch “Janke” meaning
“Little John,” "Yankee" was definitely

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.560
intended as a belittling remark and became
the European way to describe all American

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.830
colonists, more or less being the equivalent
of calling someone a "country bumpkin", "redneck,"

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.640
or "dumb hick" today.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.350
(Jaywalker is another term that originally
has derogatory connotations- deriving from

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.750
the insult "jay," meaning more or less "dumb
hillbilly.")

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.480
The first known documented instance of the
tune and the words “Yankee" and "doodle

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.470
dandy” being put together in the same song,
it seems, was around the 1750s during the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.120
French and Indian War.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.010
Prior to fighting for their independence against
the British, the colonists were, of course,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.340
subjects of the English.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.819
Therefore, when the French and Brits went
to war over territories in the New World in

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.740
1753, the colonists were recruited to join
in on the English side.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.370
Legend has it, whether true or not is anybody's
guess as no known hard, direct documented

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.810
evidence has survived supporting this oft-told
story, that a British army surgeon named Dr.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.190
Richard Shuckburg (who is known to have existed)
saw the colonist recruits amble up to join

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.739
the regular soldiers.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.540
Compared to the well-assembled and well-manicured
English army, the colonists were a mess.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.530
Wearing “fashions that hadn’t been seen
in England in a hundred years” and holding

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.440
every weapon except those “familiar to the
fresh, well-drilled British troops,” Dr.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.680
Shuckburg couldn’t help but laugh... and
write a song.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.599
While not exactly the song we’ve come to
know, the song that supposedly inspired Yankee

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.940
Doodle, whether actually written by Dr. Shuckburg
or not, went like this:

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.959
Brother Ephraim sold his cow
And bought him a commission

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.600
And then he went to Canada
To fight for the nation;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.519
But when Ephraim,
he came home

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.091
He proved an arrant coward,
He wouldn’t fight the

00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:37.510
Frenchmen there
For fear of being devoured.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:45.010
Sheep’s head and vinegar
Buttermilk and tansy

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:57.159
Boston Is a Yankee town,
Sing “Hey, doodle dandy!”

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.500
The original sheet music for this noted that
the song should be sung "through the nose,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.599
&amp; in the West Country drawl &amp; dialect."

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.140
In other words, it was meant to not only be
mocking in lyrics, but tone.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.780
As for "Brother Ephraim," this is thought
to refer to Colonel Ephraim Williams of the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.060
Massachusetts militia, who ultimately was
killed at the Battle of Lake George during

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.900
the French and Indian War.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.790
Upon completing the lyrics, purportedly Dr.
Shuckburg gave it over to the Continental

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.790
marching band who played “amid shouts of
laughter in the English ranks.”

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.620
Whoever really wrote it, by 1768, the Boston
Journal of the Times noted that the British

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.010
were playing "that 'Yankee Doodle' song,"
though the Times didn't elaborate on what

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.850
the lyrics were to this version.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.150
At this point, the song was constantly being
remixed with slightly different lyrics, tunes

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.270
and meanings, as was common for pretty much
all popular songs at the time.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.400
What united many of the earliest versions
of this song was the not-so-subtle mocking

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.060
of colonists as nothing more than moronic,
unsophisticated, country yokels.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.270
For instance, after George Washington was
made commander of the rebel armies, some unknown

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.980
individual wrote the following lyrics,
Then Congress sent great Washington,

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:07.410
All clothed in power and breeches,
To meet old Britain's warlike sons

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.670
And make some rebel speeches
Yet another version included the lines,

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.200
Yankee Doodle came to town,
For to buy a firelock, (a musket)

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.600
We will tar and feather him,
And so we will John Hancock.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.380
A slightly more familiar version to those
of us today is also one of the earlier known

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.700
versions, generally credited to Harvard sophomore
and American Minuteman Edward Bangs:

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.490
Father and I went down to camp,
Along with Captain Gooding,

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.260
And there we saw the men and boys
As thick as hasty pudding.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.191
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy,

00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:55.620
Mind the music and the step,
And with the girls be handy

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.320
Continuing to turn the lyrics around, with
the colonists variously either taking pride

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.060
in the song and/or directly mocking the British,
we have lyrics like

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.150
Yankee Doodle is the tune
That we all delight in;

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:16.370
It suits for feasts, it suits for fun,
And just as well for fightin’.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.690
Historians aren’t completely sure when the
verse about sticking "a feather in his hat

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.090
and calling it macaroni" came to be.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.150
The oldest known print version of this didn't
appear until all the way in 1842, published

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.620
in London in the book The Nursery Rhymes of
England by James Orchard Halliwell, though

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.440
this particular lyric is obviously thought
to date back to the American Revolution, partially

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.940
due to the term being used here, which dates
it somewhat, and how mocking the use of it

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.960
was.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.630
Stepping back a little to a term related to
"macaroni," there’s an interesting side

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.600
tale about the evolution of the word “doodle”
to one that’s more used today - “dude.”

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.240
According to esteemed etymologists Barry Popik
and Gerald Cohen, “dude” was first used

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.970
in the 1880s as a way to describe young New
York City men who had an affinity for being

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:05.390
flamboyantly well-dressed, well-manicured
and overly pretentious - in other words, a

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.390
“dandy.”

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.720
Using the very words that were used to mock
colonists a hundred years earlier - "doodle

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.860
dandy" - people started to call these 19th
century men that as well, as a means to essentially

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.770
call them pretentious fools.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.910
Later, this got shortened to "doodles," then
to "doods."

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.630
Eventually, the spelling was changed to “dude.”

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.430
(And if you're curious, the original female
equivalent was dudine.)

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.410
Back to the related term "macaroni"- this
term pertains to the habit of rich 18th century

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.480
English men going on so-called “Grand Tours.”

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.010
Sort of like the more modern “gap year,”
young adult men who could afford it would

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.790
take long trips around Europe, learning about
the culture, art and history of neighboring

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.790
countries.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.000
Particularly those from "new money" would
sometimes come back with more refined tastes

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.860
- like an appreciation for French art, fancy
exotic clothes and Italian food.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.420
These individuals' often over the top attempts
at trying to appear refined upon their return-

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.390
speaking a mix of Latin and English and wearing
foppish attire complete with massive "Macaroni"

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.230
wigs and not one, but two pocket watches-
were occasionally mocked for this.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.440
One of the nicknames they were given at this
time was “macaronis.”

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.031
The individuals were also considered to be
part of the informal "Macaroni Club" and would

00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:16.940
refer to flamboyant fashion and the like as
"very macaroni."

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.520
As for the origin of the term itself, it is
presumed to originally derive from the fact

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.880
that macaroni was a relatively exotic food
for the British and must have been something

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.890
at least some of these individuals raved about
upon their return to England.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:35.230
The Oxford Magazine described the so-called
Macaroni Club members in 1770 as follows:

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:40.159
“There is indeed a kind of animal, neither
male nor female, a thing of the neuter gender,

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.849
lately started up among us.

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:43.400
It is called a macaroni.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.010
It talks without meaning, it smiles without
pleasantry, it eats without appetite, it rides

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.780
without exercise, it wenches without passion.”

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.690
In other words, when the particular lyrics
"stuck a feather in his cap and called it

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.580
macaroni" were added to the Yankee Doodle
song, the author was essentially saying that

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.210
colonists were such low class, moronic fools
that they thought by sticking a simple feather

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.930
in their hat, they were being extremely refined
and fashionable.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.360
In the end, there were possibly even hundreds
of versions of Yankee Doodle in popular circulation

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.060
during the American Revolution, some initially
used by the British to mock their rebellious

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.060
subjects.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.070
In turn, the Americans embraced the song,
creating countless versions of their own and

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.300
other times simply taking pride in the lyrics
which were supposed to be mocking.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.950
This brings us to October 19, 1781 when General
Cornwallis formally surrendered to American

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.320
and French forces at Yorktown, Virginia.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.300
Legend has it that, as a way to mock the defeated
troops, famed French commandeer and hero of

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.240
the American Revolution Marquis de Lafayette
ordered the band to play “Yankee Doodle,"

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.550
with the victorious soldiers singing along.
