floating by me getting ruined,

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.535
my comedy partner,
Corinne Fisher and I,

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:12.638

Thank you so much.

And we started
interviewing a guy

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.148
that one of us has fucked.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.483
And in an attempt to kinda

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.284
learn more about ourselves,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.720

shed the shame

about their own sexuality.

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.061
And we kinda each went
into the podcast

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.296
having a person in our lives
that causes

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.565
a lot of emotional turmoil.

For Corinne, it was
her ex-boyfriend

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.037
who dumped her
out of the blue

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.639
and left her heartbroken.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:53.212
For me, it was
a famous porn star named Stoya

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.680
who dated my boyfriend
for two years

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:57.550

dating him.

But she's not what you think of

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.691
when people, like, think of
a typical porn star.

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.093
This girl is stunning.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:09.529
Like, she has the face
of Megan Fox

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:13.199
and the body of Meagan Fox.

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:14.767

she'll publish

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.941
You know, and when I first
met Stephen,

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:24.210
they were dating, it was on the
set of a music video

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:25.845
that he was directing

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.614
and I remember we were
on set one day and he--

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.217
yeah, my girlfriend's
a famous porn star name Stoya

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.954
and I was like, oh, word?!

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:38.191
Tell me everything!

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.692
And I just egged him on
to tell me

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.194
all these stories
about their sex life

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:42.628
and it was fascinating.

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.897
And a year later,
she dumps him,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.432
leaves him heartbroken.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:50.570
Seven days after that,
I start dating him.

if anybody in here

It's gonna put you in a weird
place for a couple years

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:15.928
uh, turns out.

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:17.663
Yeah, then you're gonna do a
podcast where you interview

00:03:17.696 --> 00:03:19.265
every guy you've
ever slept with

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.833
because you feel
femasculated.

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:23.402
That's what happens
when that happens.

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:25.471
Yeah, that's not a real word.

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.740
Uh, there's no word
in the English language

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:30.443
that is the female equivalent
of emasculated.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.111
Which is fuckin'
insane to me.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:34.447
Because that is the only
way I could begin to describe

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.783
how it feels to immediately
follow a girl

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.186
who, as part of her job,
she'll just walk on stage--

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.456
a stage exactly like this--

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.191
in front of a group of
strangers, right,

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.627
she'll just take off all her
clothes and come everywhere.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.262
And then everyone's like, this
is the best day of my life!

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.964
I'll never forget this!

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:54.133
But then, for my job,
I walk on stage

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.301
in front of a group
of strangers--

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.003
fully clothed the whole time--

00:03:57.036 --> 00:03:59.272
and then I'm just like,
hey,

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.474
does anybody wanna
hear a riddle? Or--no.

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.476
You guys wanna--
you wanna hear a riddle?

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:04.777
What do you do? You a teacher?
Oh, you're gonna

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.312
jerk off
to that girl's vagina?

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:07.546
Okay, that's fine.
No problem.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.148
I'll keep my riddle right here.

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.483
Come to me when you're done.

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:11.550
Get it? Come?
[blows raspberry]

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.386
I don't know, whatever.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.954
It was hard.

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:16.522
It was hard 'cause he was still
telling me

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.224
all these things
that I didn't wanna hear.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:19.558
Like, one of the worst things
he told me

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.661
when we started dating was
he said,

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.697
sometimes Stoya, she would
take my hand

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.367
and put it up her skirt to let
me know how wet I made her

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.704
in public.

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:37.877
And I was like, ugh, God.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.315
Do I gotta do that or--

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.317
I don't think I can do that.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.152
[grumbles]

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.987
And I started
to notice things.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.922
Like, I started to notice
that every porn store

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.224
in New York City,
they all have the same poster

00:04:52.257 --> 00:04:53.526
hanging in front of their door.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.328
And it's just all these chicks,

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.396
like, hot chicks with,
like, pirate outfits on.

00:04:57.429 --> 00:04:58.731
One of 'em had an eye patch,

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:00.032
but she somehow,
like, made it hot.

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:01.534
It was very confusing.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.502
And then one of the women
on the poster was Stoya.

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:05.204
And then she would
just stare at me

00:05:05.237 --> 00:05:09.375
as I walked by like, my pussy's
better than yours, ha.

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:12.645
And I have an acting credit,
so fuck you.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.948
A couple months in,
I was dating

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:17.350
I was at his apartment
in Brooklyn

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:18.617
where she used to live.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.219
They broke up,
she moved out.

00:05:20.252 --> 00:05:21.354
And I went to change
his sheets,

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.922
'cause it had been a while

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.924
and I removed the fitted sheet
off of his bed,

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:29.395
and I noticed
this large puddle stain

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:31.130
on his mattress.

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:32.531
And I was like, hey, Stephen,

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.066
can you come here
real quick? What--

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.601
Did you spill a gallon
of iced tea in your bed?

00:05:35.634 --> 00:05:38.771
What the fuck is that?

00:05:38.804 --> 00:05:40.573
And he's like, oh--
[inhales sharply]

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:44.477
uh--[laughs] Stoya,
when she has an orgasm,

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.213
she just squirts everywhere
and, you know--

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:49.115
Oh, she does?
Oh, that's great.

00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:51.751
Cool, cool, cool.

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:54.720
Hey, would you be a dear,
get a new mattress pad, please?

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:56.789
Thank you.

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:00.659
When I first went into
his apartment,

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:02.161
I noticed the top of his
closet in his room,

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.296
he had all these boxes
on the top of his shelf

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:06.098
and they had
a naked lady on them.

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.733
And for the longest time,
I was like, I don't wanna know.

00:06:07.766 --> 00:06:09.335
But then after
the jizz sheet thing,

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:11.604
I was like, eh, maybe
I wanna know.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.639
And I took a closer look
and I noticed that

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:15.908
that naked lady was Stoya.

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:18.477
And I was like, hm,
Stephen? Question.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.447
Quick question.
Uh, what the fuck are those?

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.283
And he was like, oh, uhh--

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:25.918
Those are Stoya's Fleshlights.

00:06:25.951 --> 00:06:27.953
She forgot to take them
before she moved out.

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:31.757
I'm like, I'm sorry,
what's a Fleshlight?

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.360
Uh, if you don't know--
you know.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:39.765
Uh, you look like
you've had a couple.

00:06:39.798 --> 00:06:43.102
If you don't know, a Fleshlight
is a sex toy for a guy, okay?

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:45.004
It looks like a giant,
plastic flashlight.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.640
You unscrew the cap,
and it's a pussy

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:49.208
that you stick
your penis in.

00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:50.943
Or a butthole or a mouth.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:54.380
And all the big porn stars
have a line of Fleshlights

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:55.981
that are molded off of
their actual

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:57.983
buttholes and vaginas
and mouths.

00:06:58.016 --> 00:07:01.854
And he had 12 of them
up there on the shelf.

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:05.691
I was like, I don't think
you need any of those, right?

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.460
Isn't that, like,
the etiquette?

00:07:07.493 --> 00:07:10.863
Like, you move on
from one girl to a new girl.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:14.867
Right? You throw the old girl's
vagina in the trash.

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.736
It's, like,
the nice thing to do, right?

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.206
It's, like, polite.
It's, like, manners.

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:22.308
And he's like, oh, sorry,
I'll throw them out.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.578
Thank you.
Uh, you know.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.513
Very shortly after that,

00:07:27.546 --> 00:07:29.682
Stoya's face appeared
on the cover of

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.884
the "Village Voice,"
which is a free newspaper

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.085
in New York City.

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:34.320
It's on every street corner

00:07:34.353 --> 00:07:35.855
in a little, plastic kiosk.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.823
Her face was on the cover
and the headline read,

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:42.395
"The Prettiest Girl in New York
is a Porn Star."

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.401
And it was on every fucking
corner that we went to!

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.036
And, like, my life--
there was a point

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:53.072
where my life just became
this horrible

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.573
nightmare fun house.

00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:56.175
And instead of--
when I looked in the mirror,

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:57.743
instead of, like, seeing, like,
a 300 pound

00:07:57.776 --> 00:07:59.345
version of myself
staring back at me,

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.947
it was just--
it was just Stoya.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.716
Like, I would wake up
in his bed

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.451
in a pile of her stale jizz,

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:06.452
I'm like, all right,
that's fine.

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:07.453
Oh, whatever.

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:08.554
Just brush it off,

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:09.788
the past is the past.

00:08:09.821 --> 00:08:11.357
And then I would
go to get dressed

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.225
and I'm just staring at a shelf

00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:14.860
of her best-selling orifices.

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:16.695
And I'm like, all right,
cool, I'm gonna go out

00:08:16.728 --> 00:08:19.064
and get a walk,
go for fresh air.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:20.733
And then I would walk outside
and there she was,

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.268
hanging on the front
of a porn store

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.036
with a fuckin' pirate
outfit on like, ha,

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:26.472
I'm better
at sex than you, whatever, ehh.

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:28.073
Acting credit.
And then I would

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.609
literally walk ten feet
to any corner

00:08:30.642 --> 00:08:34.947
and there she was again like,
and I'm prettier than you, so--

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.316
And this whole time, I was
building her up in my head

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:39.418
to be this huge bully.

00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:40.986
It was tormenting me.

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:43.756
And sometimes I would
respond back out loud.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.924
And I'd be like,
you're not better than me!

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:46.792
You're not prettier than me!

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:48.460
No, you're a fuckin' whore.
You're just

00:08:48.493 --> 00:08:49.828
a fuckin' sex worker.

00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:52.131
That's what you are.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.999
Yeah, and there was
a couple times

00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:55.834
where I debated like,
maybe I should just end it

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:57.937
and escape this shit
and never talk to him again

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.638
and I wouldn't feel this way.

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:01.941
But I couldn't because
as bad as that was,

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:05.811
it didn't compare to how good
it felt to hold Stephen's hand.

00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:08.314
Or sit across
from him at dinner.

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:11.784
So I couldn't.
And I decided, you know what?

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:13.185
I gotta change my strategy.

00:09:13.218 --> 00:09:15.120
I gotta change
what I'm doing here.

00:09:15.153 --> 00:09:18.791
And I took a long, hard look
at all of my insecurities.

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:22.294
And I scooped 'em up
and I shoved 'em deep down

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:24.630
into a dark hole.

00:09:24.663 --> 00:09:26.198
And I'm like,
I know what I gotta do.

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:29.168
I gotta one-up this bitch.

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.772
Don't ever try
to one-up a porn star.

00:09:33.805 --> 00:09:37.209
It's not gonna work out well.

00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:40.479
The first time that I went
to the ER for a sex injury

00:09:40.512 --> 00:09:45.684
was Christmas of 2012.

00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:47.186
It was our first
Christmas together.

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:48.554
I was so excited.

00:09:48.587 --> 00:09:49.989
He got me the most
amazing gifts.

00:09:50.022 --> 00:09:52.157
He got me this beautiful
vintage coat.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.526
And I'm obsessed with pop corn.
I eat it every day.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:56.295
And he got me
this giant suitcase

00:09:56.328 --> 00:09:59.198
and I open it and it was filled
with 30 boxes of popcorn.

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:02.568
I was like, oh, my God.
You know me so well.

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.169
And then his parents
left the room

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:06.238
and he gave me another gift
and I unwrapped it

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:09.041
and it was the biggest dildo

00:10:09.074 --> 00:10:11.744
that I have ever seen
in my entire life.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.146
Didn't even know
they made 'em that big.

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:16.048
And, you know,
I had been bragging to him

00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:18.584
this whole time about
sexual things that I didn't do,

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.586
but I said I did 'em.

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.355
And so out loud I was like,
oh, yeah.

00:10:23.388 --> 00:10:26.058
This is a good size, yeah.

00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:26.992
This is great.

00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:28.360
But inside, I was like,

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:31.864
that's not gonna fit in there.

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:36.068
I don't think I can
fit that in my mouth, uh--

00:10:36.101 --> 00:10:37.836
But I was really trying
to keep this ruse up.

00:10:37.869 --> 00:10:41.373
So I was like,
we should use it tonight!

00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:43.342
So we go back
to his apartment in Brooklyn.

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.411
And before I go into the bed,
I go in his bathroom

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.413
and I look in the mirror and I
give myself a little pep talk.

00:10:47.446 --> 00:10:50.949
I'm like, Krystyna,
women have been pushing babies

00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:52.851
out of their vaginas since
the beginning of time.

00:10:52.884 --> 00:10:54.887
Okay, you were born--
you were born for this shit.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.055
Okay? You're gonna go in there,

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:57.389
you're gonna take that dildo

00:10:57.422 --> 00:10:58.891
like a grown-ass woman,

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:01.260
and you're not gonna
let him see you cry.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:02.895
And then I burst
into the bedroom.

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:04.596
I'm like, where is it?
Ahh, I can't wait.

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:07.533
So excited, so wet.

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:10.436
And I purposely position
myself so that he was behind me

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:14.039
and he couldn't see me go,
like-- [laughs]

00:11:14.072 --> 00:11:15.974
[crying]

00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:19.011
Who's got an acting credit now,
bitch?

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:21.814
And the whole time,
I was like,

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:23.315
[inhales sharply]
Ooh, all right.

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:26.752
This is new, but, uh,
maybe this is what

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:29.088
I'm supposed to love.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.291
We had sex and we went to bed.
It was okay.

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:34.059
But then in the middle
of the night, I woke up

00:11:34.092 --> 00:11:36.829
with excruciating pain
in my lower abdomen.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:38.263
And I woke Stephen up.
I was like, Stephen,

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:39.631
I don't know what
the fuck's happening,

00:11:39.664 --> 00:11:40.833
but we need to go to the ER.

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:41.967
I don't know what's going on.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.235
We get there and there was

00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:44.770
no gynecologist on site.

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:47.639
And so they had to get
this very reluctant,

00:11:47.672 --> 00:11:51.844
old, male doctor
to stick his fingers up me

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.512
and give me an exam.

00:11:53.545 --> 00:11:55.614
And I was crying
because it hurt.

00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:57.850
I was in so much pain,
but it also felt kinda rapey.

00:11:57.883 --> 00:12:01.086
Like, I didn't
want him to do it.

00:12:01.119 --> 00:12:03.856
He didn't wanna do it.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:07.526
But it kinda had to get done.

00:12:07.559 --> 00:12:10.028
And I was hold--Stephen was
squeezing my hand really tight

00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:12.097
and I looked up at him
and he had a tear rolling

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:14.967
down his face and he was so sad
that I was in so much pain.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.037
And it was this weird,
connected, beautiful moment.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.039
And the doctor, he's like,
oh, you had

00:12:21.072 --> 00:12:23.842
two cysts on your ovaries
burst.

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:25.644
And right as I was
about to say,

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:30.182
I took a bigger dildo than I
could handle, Doc, I'm sorry.

00:12:30.215 --> 00:12:32.317
He cut me off, he's like, oh,
this happens to a lot of women,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:33.819
and sometimes it happens
out of nowhere.

00:12:33.852 --> 00:12:34.987
I'm like, oh, God,
thank God.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.822
Praise the Lord. Okay, good.

00:12:36.855 --> 00:12:39.658
Cool.

00:12:39.691 --> 00:12:41.627
And then the second time
I went to the ER

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.364
for a sex injury, uh--

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:50.035
Uh, it was from butt stuff
gone awry, um--

00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:52.070
I was just pretending
to love anal

00:12:52.103 --> 00:12:53.972
and there was a lot
of bleeding involved.

00:12:54.005 --> 00:12:56.041
And I wish I could say I
learned some beautiful lesson

00:12:56.074 --> 00:12:58.010
from that story,
but it's just that

00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.077
I had to eat more fiber.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.380
That was all that was.

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:04.349
Yeah, that's all that was.

00:13:04.382 --> 00:13:06.251
But, uh--

00:13:06.284 --> 00:13:08.053
but shortly after that,
we moved in together.

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:09.555
And I never lived
with a boyfriend before.

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:11.156
I was so excited.

00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:13.192
And about six months
into us living together,

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.360
Hurricane Sandy
hits New York City.

00:13:15.393 --> 00:13:18.363
And our apartment is situated
in a flood A zone.

00:13:18.396 --> 00:13:22.768
And if you don't know,
that is the floodiest zone.

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.670
That is the get the fuck
out of here zone.

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:26.038
But we stayed.
We were like,

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.240
ah, hurricane, schmurricane,
whatever.

00:13:28.273 --> 00:13:30.075
And our apartment is a duplex.

00:13:30.108 --> 00:13:31.944
The bottom level is in the
basement of the building.

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:33.879
And when Hurricane Sandy
was at its peak,

00:13:33.912 --> 00:13:35.714
that basement level
ended up flooding

00:13:35.747 --> 00:13:37.950
with three feet of
sewage water.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.452
Which I didn't even know
was possible.

00:13:40.485 --> 00:13:43.055
And it came up from the toilet
and the tub and the sink.

00:13:43.088 --> 00:13:45.023
The lights were
flickering on and off.

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:46.792
I was like, holy shit,
this is Armageddon.

00:13:46.825 --> 00:13:49.561
And, uh, and all of our shit
was getting ruined downstairs.

00:13:49.594 --> 00:13:52.231
And we're running everything
upstairs as fast as we could.

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.032
And I go in the closet
of his office,

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:55.734
I go to grab a box,
I'm like, oh, my God.

00:13:55.767 --> 00:14:00.739
A flashlight. Perfect.
And I grab it.

00:14:00.772 --> 00:14:02.274
I grab it,
I couldn't really see.

00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:06.312
And I unscrew the cap
and I was like oh, word.

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:12.050
There was no light bulb.

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:13.552
And I just stood there

00:14:13.585 --> 00:14:15.254
in three feet of sewage water

00:14:15.287 --> 00:14:17.923
as my shit was, like,
floating by me getting ruined,

00:14:17.956 --> 00:14:21.760
and I just stared into the eye

00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:25.331
of my boyfriend's
ex-girlfriend's butthole.

00:14:27.365 --> 00:14:30.335
And all those insecurities
that I had shoved

00:14:30.368 --> 00:14:32.137
deep, deep down
in that fuckin' hole

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.172
came bubbling right back up.

00:14:34.205 --> 00:14:37.242
And I ran upstairs with her
butthole in my left hand

00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:39.344
and I fuckin' let him have it.

00:14:39.377 --> 00:14:40.679
I screamed at him.

00:14:40.712 --> 00:14:42.180
Everything
that I had ever felt

00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:44.116
about her came out onto him.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.817
I wouldn't even let him talk.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.452
And I was like, you said you
would throw these away.

00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:49.121
You told me you would
throw these away.

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.456
And he goes I--I did.
I threw 'em away.

00:14:51.489 --> 00:14:53.191
I kept one 'cause
I thought it was funny.

00:14:53.224 --> 00:14:54.793
It's like how often
do you date somebody

00:14:54.826 --> 00:14:57.496
with a bestselling butthole?

00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:02.968
But that's when I knew,
oh-- [sighs]

00:15:03.001 --> 00:15:06.471
You're over her.
I'm not.

00:15:06.504 --> 00:15:09.474
And I still really--
it had been four years

00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:11.176
since I'd been
feeling that way.

00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:12.778
And I wanted so desperately
to get rid of it.

00:15:12.811 --> 00:15:14.179
And we had been debating
interviewing her

00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:16.114
on my podcast
for a long time.

00:15:16.147 --> 00:15:17.816
And he would always go,
are you sure?

00:15:17.849 --> 00:15:19.651
And then I would say
some sideways comment about her

00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:21.453
or something shitty and he
would go, I'm not gonna

00:15:21.486 --> 00:15:23.388
do that, I'm not gonna
put her in that position.

00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:26.392
But that night, I was like,
oh, we're interviewing her!

00:15:28.159 --> 00:15:30.128
And he was like,
okay, I'll ask her.

00:15:30.161 --> 00:15:31.463
And the next day
she said, okay.

00:15:31.496 --> 00:15:32.864
I'm like, oh,
she said, okay?

00:15:32.897 --> 00:15:33.966
Okay, cool.
Um, that's fine.

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:35.334
It's fine. No, I'm glad.

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.135
And the morning
of the interview,

00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:38.837
I remember I was at the studio,
I showed up

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.405
an hour early to smoke a pack
of cigarettes outside.

00:15:40.438 --> 00:15:41.807
I was like,
she's not better than me.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.874
She's not better--fuck her.

00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:44.343
She's not better than me.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.978
And she rounded the corner
and she had

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:47.346
this big, giant sweater on

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:48.981
and the fancy Starbucks up.

00:15:49.014 --> 00:15:51.183
And she was like hey,
oh, this is

00:15:51.216 --> 00:15:52.584
the weirdest day ever, right?

00:15:52.617 --> 00:15:56.822
And I was like,
ohh, I love you. Ew.

00:15:56.855 --> 00:15:58.190
Fuck!

00:15:58.223 --> 00:15:59.391
And we interviewed her.

00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:01.093
We interviewed her
and, uh,

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:02.527
and she began to tell me
all these stories

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.831
about people in her life
that think they know her

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.033
and they kinda treat her
like a second-class citizen

00:16:08.066 --> 00:16:09.534
because of it.

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:11.236
Like, she can't get
an apartment in the city.

00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:13.105
Like, nine times out of ten,
the landlord

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.374
will make her pay a year's
worth of rent up front.

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:17.509
So she can't get
a place to stay.

00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:20.779
She has had bank accounts
get shut down on her

00:16:20.812 --> 00:16:22.347
by multiple banks
and so have

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.383
all of her porn star friends
for no reason,

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:27.285
but, you know,
we know the reason.

00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:30.922
And she's had men
say these foul things

00:16:30.955 --> 00:16:33.225
to her on the street.

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:34.893
But one of the things
that she said

00:16:34.926 --> 00:16:36.428
that really resonated with me

00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:39.364
she goes, it feels like
I'm standing on top

00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:43.268
of a pedestal
inside of a garbage can.

00:16:44.936 --> 00:16:48.907
I was like, fuck.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.275
But I was so upset with myself

00:16:50.308 --> 00:16:52.477
'cause I realized ah, shit.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.280
I'm a part of
the garbage can.

00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:57.716
And I hated it.
But ever since that interview,

00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:59.584
everything with Stephen and I,
it's like,

00:16:59.617 --> 00:17:02.421
20,000 pounds of weight
lifted off of my shoulders,

00:17:02.454 --> 00:17:05.257
and our relationship
has been amazing ever since.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.060
I can be vulnerable with him.
I can be honest with him.

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:10.629
I'm sexually explorative
because I want to be.

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:14.433
But the best takeaway that I
got from interviewing her

00:17:14.466 --> 00:17:17.803
was, you know, in terms of my
relationship with myself--

00:17:17.836 --> 00:17:20.906
and especially with my
relationship with other women,

00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:22.841
I don't wanna add
to the garbage.

00:17:22.874 --> 00:17:24.676
I wanna be the pedestal.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:27.646
[cheers and applause]

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:29.347
Thank you.
