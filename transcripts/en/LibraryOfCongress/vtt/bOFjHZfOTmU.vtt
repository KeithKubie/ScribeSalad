00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; Announcer 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.050
&gt;&gt; Announcer 2: Welcome Kate
the great, otherwise known

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.510
as Kate DeCamillo to the stage.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:21.960
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.250
&gt;&gt; Kate: How are y'all doing?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:33.420
I have a speech, but a speech
always makes me feel kind

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.240
of like I'm lecturing
people, and what I love

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.930
to do is to talk with y'all.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.240
So a couple of years ago I came
to the National Book Festival,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.820
and I threatened everybody
with a speech, and then I said,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.420
"How many of y'all want
to hear the speech?"

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.170
And like two hands went up, and
so I'm going to do that again.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.390
How many people want
to hear the speech?

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.690
Well, that's better than two.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.220
It makes me feel a
little bit better,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.930
and how many-we don't have a ton
of time, so how many people would

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.650
like to do a Q&amp;A, which--
and who has questions?

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.010
The other thing that we
can do in our short amount

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.600
of time is I can read to y'all,
and I don't do-[applause] Yeah,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.610
so that would be kind of fun.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.820
The only thing is I would need
to borrow somebody's book.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.120
So, oh, what have you got?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.090 position:56%
You want to do "Raymie Nightingale?"

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.030
Has anybody read "Raymie
Nightingale?"

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.920
You have. That's good.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.880 position:56%
Okay, I'm going to borrow your book.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.180
Thank you very much.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.480
What's your name?

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.780
&gt;&gt; Riley: Riley.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.080
&gt;&gt; Kate: Riley.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.380
Is it R-i-l-e-y?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.680
&gt;&gt; Riley: Yes.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.980
&gt;&gt; Kate: Thank you, Riley.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.280
I'll give it back probably.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.680
So "Raymie Nightingale" is my most
recent novel, and it takes place

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.980
in central Florida in the mid-70s,
and I grew up in central Florida

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.900 position:56%
in the mid-70s, and when I was doing
all the pre-publicity before this

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.290
book came out, one of the very
first interviews that I did,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.580
the person said, "So
this is, it's mid-70s.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.360
So it's historical fiction, right?"

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.860
And I'm like, "Yeah, I guess
it is historical fiction."

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.370
So I'm going to read
to you from a book

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.650
of historical fiction,
and this is Chapter 1.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.110
"There were three of
them, three girls.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.980
They were standing side by side.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.880
They were standing at attention.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.510 position:56%
And then the girl in the pink dress,
the one who was standing right next

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.190
to Raymie, let out a sob
and said, 'The more I think

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.120
about it, the more terrified I am.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.380
I'm too terrified to go on.'

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.000
The girl clutched her baton to her
chest and dropped to her knees.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.990
Raymie stared at her in
wonder and admiration.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.780
She herself often felt
too terrified to go on,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.560
but she had never admitted
it out loud.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.720
The girl in the pink dress
moaned and toppled over sideways.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.240
Her eyes fluttered closed.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.540
She was silent.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.240
And then she opened
her eyes very wide

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.550
and shouted, 'Archie, I'm sorry.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.830
I'm sorry I betrayed you.'

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.770
She closed her eyes again.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.600
Her mouth fell open.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.080
Raymie had never seen or
heard anything like it.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.760
'I'm sorry,' Raymie whispered.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.330
'I betrayed you.'

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.120
For some reason, the words
seemed worth repeating.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.880
'Stop this nonsense
immediately,' said Ida Nee.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.400
Ida Nee was the baton-twirling
instructor.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.950
Even though she was old-over fifty

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.730
at least-her hair was an
extremely bright yellow.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.010
She wore white boots that came
all the way up to her knees.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.690
'I'm not kidding,' said Ida Nee.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.180
Raymie believed her.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.130
Ida Nee didn't seem
like much of a kidder.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.760
The sun was way, way up in the
sky, and the whole thing was

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.860
like high noon in a Western.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.770
But it was not a Western; it
was baton-twirling lessons

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.210
at Ida Nee's house in
Ida Nee's backyard.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.950
It was the summer of 1975.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.380
It was the fifth day of June.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.180
And two days before, on
the third day of June,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.960
Raymie Clark's father had run
away from home with a woman

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.950
who was a dental hygienist.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.940
Hey, diddle, diddle, the
dish ran away with the spoon.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.240
Those were the words that went

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.870
through Raymie's head every time
she thought about her father

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.700
and the dental hygienist.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.940
But she did not say the
words out loud anymore

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.080
because Raymie's mother was very
upset, and talking about dishes

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.210
and spoons running away
together was not appropriate.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.320
It was actually a great
tragedy, what had happened.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.310
That was what Raymie's mother said.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.650
'This is a great tragedy,'
said Raymie's mother.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.880
'Quit reciting nursery rhymes.'

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.180
It was a great tragedy

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.090
because Raymie's father
had disgraced himself.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.250
It was also a great tragedy
because Raymie was now fatherless.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.690
The thought of that-the fact
of it-that she, Raymie Clarke,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.300
was without a father, made
a small, sharp pain shoot

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.330
through Raymie's heart every
time she considered it.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.550 position:56%
Sometimes the pain in her heart hade
her feel too terrified to go on.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.080
Sometimes it made her
want to drop to her knees.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.860
But then she would remember
that she had a plan."

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.850
I'm going to read you
about the plan.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.150
Chapter Two.

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.250
"'Get up,' said Ida Nee to
the girl in the pink dress.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.890
'She fainted,' said the
other baton-twirling student,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.790
a girl named Beverly Tapinski,
whose father was a cop.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.060
Raymie knew the girl's name
and what her father did

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.500
because Beverly had
made an announcement

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.180
at the beginning of the lesson.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.420
She stared straight ahead, not
looking at anybody in particular,

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.910
and said, 'My name is Beverly
Tapinski and my father is a cop,

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.870
so I don't think that
you should mess with me.'

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.470
Raymie, for one, had no
intention of messing with her.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.360
'I've seen a lot of people
faint,' said Beverly now.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.740
'That's what happens when
you're the daughter of a cop.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.040
You see everything.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.340
You see it all.'

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.400
'Shut up, Tapinski,' said Ida Nee.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.410
The sun was very high in the sky.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.760
It hadn't moved.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.580
It seemed like someone
had stuck it up there

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.020
and then walked away and left it.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.700
'I'm sorry,' whispered Raymie.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.430
'I betrayed you.'

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.680
Beverly Tapinski knelt down and
put her hands on either side

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.640
of the fainting girl's face.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.940
'What do you think you're doing?'

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.240
said Ida Nee.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.710
The pine trees above them
swayed back and forth.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.550
The lake, Lake Clara-where someone
named Clara Wingtip had managed

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.210
to drown herself a hundred
years ago-gleamed and glittered.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.900
The lake looked hungry.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.180
Maybe it was hoping for
another Clara Wingtip.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.520
Raymie felt a wave of despair.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.830
There wasn't time for
people fainting.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.060
She had to learn how to twirl a
baton, and she had to learn fast

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.560
because if she learned
how to twirl a baton,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.640
then she stood a good chance
Little Miss Central Florida Tire,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.080
and if she became Little
Miss Central Florida Tire,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.340
her father would see her picture
in the paper and come home.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.780
That was Raymie's plan."

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.260
Riley, thank you for
letting me borrow

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.640
that [applause] very, very much.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:03.940
I appreciate that.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.790
I'm going to forward here.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.830
Who-does anybody have a copy
of "Because of Winn Dixie,"

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.320
which is the first
book that I wrote?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.620
[Inaudible] That's your favorite.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.070
What if I just, it's kind of
like a way to bookend things.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.850
That was the most recent
book I wrote was "Raymie,

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.620
and the first one was
"Because of Winn Dixie."

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.550
What if we read the first chapter
of "Because of Winn Dixie?"

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.810
Yeah, so can I borrow
somebody's book again?

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.620
I was talking to a group of
first graders not that long ago,

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.400 position:56%
and I got into an argument with one
of the first graders about something

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.070
that happened in this book.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.370
Thank you.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.670
What's your name?

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:41.970
[Inaudible] Thank you.

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.160
And I was wrong, and this
first grader was right.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.150
So all of which is to say I don't
remember it as well as I should.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:59.350
This book came out in 2000, and
I was working at a bookstore

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.080
when it was published, and
before that I had worked

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.600
at a book warehouse, and so
I had a very realistic goal

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.690
for what would happen
with a middle grade novel

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.920
from a first time novelist.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.530
I thought if I'm really,
really lucky,

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.160
5000 copies of this book will
sell, which will then let me earn

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.880
out my advance and maybe I'll be
luck enough to write another book,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.100
and whatever didn't sell I
hoped would be like remaindered

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.810
in Guatemala where I wouldn't
have to see it every day at work,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.910
you know, and so what has
happened with "Because

00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.270
of Winn Dixie" defied the
biggest dreams I'd have ever had

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.050
in the world, and so many of
you I know know this book.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:45.420
So I just want to say thank you
because this book was passed

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.980
from hand to hand, and all of
y'all let me get to stand up here

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.170
and do this, and it's like
the best job in the world.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.830
So-[applause].

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.010
Okay, Chapter 1.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:02.520
"My name is India Opal Buloni, and
last summer my daddy, the preacher,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.280
sent me to the store for a
box of macaroni-and-cheese,

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.490
some white rice, and two tomatoes
and I came back with a dog.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:13.150
This is what happened: I
walked into the produce section

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.360
of the Winn-Dixie grocery store
to pick out my two tomatoes

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.130
and I almost bumped right
into the store manager.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.670
He was standing there
all red-faced, screaming

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.000
and waving his arms around.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.420
'Who let a dog in here?'

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.720
he kept on shouting.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.220
'Who let a dirty dog in here?'

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.160
At first, I didn't see a dog.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.940
There were just a lot of vegetables
rolling around on the floor,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.630
tomatoes and onions
and green peppers.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.930
And there was what
seemed like a whole army

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.800
of Winn-Dixie employees running

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.510
around waving their arms just the
same way the store manager was

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.450
waving his.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.630
And then the dog came
running around the corner.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.390
He was a big dog.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.540
And ugly. And he looked like
he was having a real good time.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.040
His tongue was hanging out
and he was wagging his tail.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.890
He skidded to a stop
and smiled right at me.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.600 position:56%
I had never before in my life seen a
dog smile, but that is what he did.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.860
He pulled back his lips and
showed me all his teeth.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.510
Then he wagged his tail so hard

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.890
that he knocked some
oranges off a display,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.650
and they went rolling everywhere,
mixing in with the tomatoes

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.730
and onions and green peppers.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.650
The manager screamed,
'Somebody grab that dog.'

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.710
The dog went running
over to the manager,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.890
wagging his tail and smiling.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.750
He stood up on his hind legs.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.030
You could tell that all he
wanted to do was get face to face

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.280
with the manager and thank him
for the good time he was having

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.220
in the produce department,
but somehow he ended

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.180
up knocking the manager over.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.450
And the manager must have
been having a bad day,

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.020
because lying there on
the floor, right in front

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.060
of everybody, he started to cry.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.770
The dog leaned over him, real
concerned, and licked his face.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.070
'Please,' said the manager.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.200
'Somebody call the pound.'

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.910
'Wait a minute,' I hollered.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.210
'That's my dog.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.710
Don't call the pound.'

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.500
All the Winn-Dixie employees
turned around and looked at me,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.030 position:56%
and I knew I had done something big.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.820
And maybe stupid, too.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.310
But I couldn't help it.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.570
I couldn't let that
dog to go the pound.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.980
'Here, boy,' I said.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.950
The dog stopped licking the
manager's face and put his ears

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.560
up in the air and looked
at me, like he was trying

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.880
to remember where he knew me from.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.130
'Here, boy,' I said again.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:26.300
And then I figured that the dog was
probably just like everybody else

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.550
in the world, that he would
want to get called by a name,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.440
only I didn't know
what his name was,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.830
so I just said the first
thing that came into my head.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.980
I said, 'Here, Winn-Dixie.'

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.450
And that dog came trotting
over to me just

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.820
like he had been doing
it, his whole life.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.750
The manager sat up and
gave me a hard stare,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:45.360
like maybe I was making fun of him.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.660
'It's his name,' I said.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.130
Honest.' The manager
said, 'Don't you know not

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.820
to bring a dog into
a grocery store?'

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.120
'Yes, sir,' I told him.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.490
'He got in by mistake.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.790
I'm sorry.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.090
It won't happen again.'

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.140
'Come on, Winn Dixie,'
I said to the dog.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.860
I started walking and he
followed along behind me as I went

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.450
out of the produce department
and found the cereal aisle

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.820
and passed all the
cashiers out the door.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.180
Once we were safe outside, I
checked him over real careful

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.240
and he didn't look that good.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.580
He was big but skinny.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.650
You could see his ribs, and
there were bald patches all

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.120
over him-places where he
didn't have any fur at all.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.690
Mostly he looked like a big
piece of old brown carpet

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.890
that had been left out in the rain.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.750
'You're a mess,' I told him.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.710 position:56%
'I bet you don't belong to anybody.'

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.390
He smiled at me.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.670
He did that thing again
where he pulled back his lips

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.360
and showed me his teeth.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.280
He smiled so big that
it made him sneeze.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.980
It was like he was saying,
'I know I am a mess.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.640
Isn't it funny?'

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.490
It's hard not to immediately
fall in love with a dog

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.350
who has a good sense of humor.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:52.650
'Come on,' I told him.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.300
'Let's see what the preacher
has to say about you.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:00.040
And the two of us, me and Winn
Dixie, started walking home."

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.340
[Applause] Where are you?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:06.020
You're a very helpful person.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.320
Thank you.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.180
Okay, who's going to
ask me questions?

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.540
Thank you so much.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.360
Yes. [Inaudible] What inspired me
to write "Because of Winn Dixie?"

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.690
So I grew up in central Florida,
and when I was 30 years old I moved

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:30.090
to Minneapolis, Minnesota,
and do you know kind

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.610
of like what winters are like
in Minneapolis, Minnesota?

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:39.490
Any idea? The second winter that
I was there, the high temperature

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.380
for three days in a row
was 37 degrees below zero.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.330
So if you're a girl who
grew up in central Florida

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.270
and it's 37 degrees below zero,
where would you like to be?

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.470
Well, in the library, yes,
but I wanted to go home.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.480
I wanted to go back to Florida.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.640
I could not afford to go back home,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.530
but I could write a book
that would take me home.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:08.610
Also it was the first time in my
life that I'd been without a dog,

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.650
and I was experiencing
what I call dog withdrawal.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.750
So like if I was in a car and there
was a dog in the car next to me,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.210
I would beep my horn
and wave at the dog.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.730
I couldn't have a dog in the
apartment where I was living,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.940
so I just made up the best
dog that I could think of,

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.640
and that was Winn Dixie, and so
that's where the book came from,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.780 position:56%
although I didn't know at the time
that I just knew that I needed a dog

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.760
and I knew I wanted to go
home, so those two things.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.380 position:56%
So, should we move to the mikes now?

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.680
Do you want to do that?

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.490
Yes.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.160
&gt;&gt; Audience: What inspired Ulysses
to be sucked up by a vacuum?

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.460
&gt;&gt; Kate: [Laughter] So "Flora

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.890
and Ulysses" is-anybody
know that book, the story?

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.530
Oh, [applause] that's great.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.910
Okay, so it's the story
of a girl and a squirrel

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.360
and also a vacuum cleaner.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.950
So where do did the inspiration to
get-because the squirrel was sucked

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.350
up into a vacuum cleaner
and turned into a superhero.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:06.670
It's a true story.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.710
So where did I get the inspiration?

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.910
This is-unfortunately there's
no fast way to do this,

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.570
but I'll try to do it quickly.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:21.220
My mother passed away in 2009,
and she had a vacuum cleaner,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.950
an Electrolux vacuum cleaner, that
she thought was the best thing

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.760
in the world, and in the last
year of her life, she would turn

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.680
to me periodically and say,
"What's going to happen

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.740
to the vacuum cleaner
when I'm gone?"

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:33.660
And I would always say, "I'll
take the vacuum cleaner.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.480
Don't worry about the
vacuum cleaner."

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.790
So my mom passed away.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.090
I did as I promised.

00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.660
I took the vacuum cleaner,
but my mom had a cat,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:47.540
the world's most evil cat named
Mildew, and I am allergic to cats,

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.200
and so when I got the
vacuum cleaner,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.030
it was filled with Mildew hair,
and so I couldn't bring it

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.710
into the house, and I put it in
the garage, and every time I pulled

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.500
into the garage, there
was the vacuum cleaner,

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.800
and it made my heart hurt.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.520
It made me miss my mother.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.220
So the spring after my mother
died there was a squirrel who was

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.240
on the front steps of my house
who was clearly in some distress,

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.780
and I didn't know what
to do for him.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.040
He was draped dramatically over
the steps, and he wouldn't move

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.150
when I got close to him, but he was
still breathing, and I called one

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.290
of my best friends who lives a
block and a half away from me,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:28.160
and who's asked me to never say
her name when I tell this story,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.520
but she really truly is the kindest
and gentlest of all my friends,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.820
but when I called her and said

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.300
"There's a squirrel
dying on my front steps.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.860
What should I do?"

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.160
Carla said, "Do you have a shovel?"

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.060
And I said, "Sure I have a shovel."

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.360
She said, "Get an old t-shirt.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.660
Get the shovel.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.910
I will come over there and
whack him over the head."

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.390
[Laughter] That's what she said.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.020
I was on the cell phone.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.870
I was very close to the squirrel.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.310
I didn't want him to
overhear the bloody words

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.390
that she had just spoken,
so I'm like backing

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.690
up away from the squirrel.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.500
I go in the side door,
look out the front door.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.800
Guess what?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.100
The squirrel's gone.

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.990
He's like, "Oh, no, not me.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.930
I'll find a different way to die."

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:16.390 position:56%
And so, but the whole incident made
me think about an E. B. White essay,

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:23.610
"The Death of a Pig," and E.
B. White said when he wrote

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:27.160
"Charlotte's Web" he was thinking
about ways to save a pig's life.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.140
So I started to think about ways
to save the squirrel's life,

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.550
and I combined it with
that vacuum cleaner,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.690
and not only did I save
the squirrel's life,

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.290
but I had the squirrel sucked up
into the vacuum cleaner and turned

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.730
into a superhero who
could write poetry,

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.750
and that's where that came from.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:45.100
So, whew. [Applause] I wish
it were shorter, but it's not.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.090
Okay, over here, please.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.020
&gt;&gt; Audience: Where did-how
did you get the inspiration

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.870
for the title "Raymie Nightingale?"

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.310
&gt;&gt; Kate: Where did I
get the inspiration

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.070
for the title "Raymie Nightingale?"

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.940
Well, I don't want to totally say
it because it gives away something

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:11.830
that happens at the very end of the
book where Raymie does something

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.280
that she didn't think
that she could do,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.610
and so it's like the title
is a combination-it kind

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.710
of like captures the idea of that
thing that there's something.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.560
There's a power inside all of
us that we don't know is there,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.260
and so that's what I
wanted in the title.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.690
Did you have some thoughts
on the title?

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.370
&gt;&gt; Audience: I think it
was a really good title.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.600
&gt;&gt; Kate: That's exactly the
kind of thought I love to hear.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.900
[Laughter] Yes.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.200
That's great.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.500
Thank you.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:40.800
Okay, yes.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.190
&gt;&gt; Audience: In "Because of
Winn Dixie," that mike's on?

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.490
&gt;&gt; Kate: You're good.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.950
Yeah. It just makes you sound
powerful like the Wizard of Oz.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.250
Yes.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.810
&gt;&gt; Audience: In "Because of
Winn Dixie," there's this candy

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.570
that makes people sad, and
that part almost made me cry,

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.220
but is that an actual candy?

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.370
&gt;&gt; Kate: So in "Because of Winn
Dixie," there's the litmus lozenges

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:05.240
that make you feel kind of sad and
happy at the same time-melancholy.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.960
Do they actually exist?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.700
They do not, and I would like
you to imagine the last person

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.470
that I talked to in line
at a bookstore in Michigan

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.650
who was the parent of a child who
was doing a report on "Because

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.880
of Winn Dixie," and
she was like "I need

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.180
to find these candies immediately
for this child's report"

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.560
and is like, "Where are they?"

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.300
And it's like, "They don't exist,"
and she was not happy with me,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.910
but that's the great thing
about writing stories is

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.230
that you can-anything can happen.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.530
You can make things up.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.830
Yes.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.130
&gt;&gt; Audience: So we're together.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.550
&gt;&gt; Kate: Okay, and is
it one question or two?

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:42.850
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.150
&gt;&gt; Kate: Yes, okay.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:45.450
[Laughter]

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.680
&gt;&gt; Audience: So we really
like reading "Winn Dixie."

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.070
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah,
and we were wondering

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.400
which one did you have
the most fun writing?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Kate: Oh, that's a good question.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.070
So they really like
reading "Winn Dixie."

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.930
Which one did I have
the most fun writing?

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.630
Can I tell you something?

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.930
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.010
&gt;&gt; Kate: Writing is so hard for me.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:06.350
The word "fun" is not really
appended to it ever for me.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:11.590
There's a great writer, Dorothy
Parker, who said, "I hate writing.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.370
I love having written."

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.060
Does that make sense to you?

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:18.150
So it's always like I always kind
of have to force myself to do it.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.430
I'm always kind of
afraid, and I don't-a lot

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.860
of times I don't know how the
story is going to work out.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.400
Usually I don't, but probably
the easiest one for me

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.750
to write was a book called

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.260
"The Miraculous Journey
of Edward Tulane."

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.600 position:56%
So raise your hand if you know that.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:41.810
That's great, and that book kind of
wrote itself, and I did it-usually

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.100
when I write a novel,
it's eight or nine drafts.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.800
I did that one in four drafts.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.470
It just wrote itself.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.180
Adults, y'all can ask
questions, too.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.060
You don't have to-yes.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.500
&gt;&gt; Audience: What inspired "Flora?"

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.270
&gt;&gt; Kate: What inspired "Flora?"

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.480
Well I have to say-so,
Flora in "Flora

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.320
and Ulysses" is a comic
book reading cynical child,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.580
and I loved to read
everything including comic books

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.210
when I was a kid and still as
an adult, and I am what a friend

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:19.790
of mine once called
me a perky curmudgeon.

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:24.350
So I think that that
cynicism of Flora's is mine,

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.080
but there's a wonderful
saying about cynics.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.390
You scratch the surface,

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.010
and you find a romantic
underneath of a cynic.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.310
So, yes.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.610
&gt;&gt; Audience: Um.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.910
&gt;&gt; Kate: Don't panic.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:40.070
&gt;&gt; Audience: How did you get the
idea for "Tale of Despereaux?"

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.090
&gt;&gt; Kate: "Tale of Despereaux?"

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.080
So raise your hand if you know
the story of a mouse who--

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.790
You guys are a well-read crowd.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.140
I tell you what.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.430
So where did the idea come
from for "Tale of Despereaux?"

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:57.160
So I had written "Because of
Winn Dixie," and as I said,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.150
what happened with that
book surprised me mightily,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:07.690
and it had just been published, and
there it was-a book with my name

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.220
on the spine and on the cover
and went to see my best friend.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.440
She was living in Saint Louis
at the time, and her son,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.080
his name is Luke Bailey, he was
eight years old, a huge reader.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.130
He had never been impressed with
me before, but all of a sudden,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.220
here I was with my name on a book.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.070
So everywhere I went that
visit, Luke followed me around,

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.680 position:56%
and at the end of the visit he asked

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.570
if he could have a private
word with me in his room.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.650
So we went into his room,
and I sat down, and he said,

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.420
"I've got an excellent idea for a
book," and I said, "What is it?"

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.550
He said, "It's the story
of an unlikely hero

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.620
with exceptionally large ears," and
I said, "What happens to the hero?"

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.930
and he said, "I don't know.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:55.860
That's why I want you
to write the book."

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.200
And so, he didn't say a mouse,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.370
but I thought a mouse was the most
unlikely hero I could think of,

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:08.040 position:56%
and by the time the book was
published and then won the Newberry,

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.680
Luke was 14-years-old, and I
made him come to this banquet

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.980
where they present the award.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.320
It's 1000 librarians.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.720
It's fabulous.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.760
I made Luke come to that
during wearing a tie.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.070
I made him stand up in front of all
those people, and everybody said,

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.960
"Oh, you must be so
proud and excited,

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.710
Luke," and he was 14-years-old.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.700
So, not really, but he's
a history teacher now,

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.000
and he's working on a novel.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.810
So, yeah. Luke Bailey.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:35.840
Yes. I only have two minutes.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.170
Okay, yes, over here.

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:39.470
Yes.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:40.900
&gt;&gt; Audience: What was your
favorite book as a kid?

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.140
&gt;&gt; Kate: My favorite book as a kid?

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.390
One favorite book?

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.540
Wait, y'all have to answer it.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.010
What's your favorite book?

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.310
&gt;&gt; Audience: Ah.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.610
&gt;&gt; Kate: See?

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.910
[Laughter] Imagine like
standing up on a stage

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.290
and having somebody ask
you something like that?

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.590
It's like-can you do it?

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.890
&gt;&gt; Audience: "Because
of Winn Dixie."

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.200
&gt;&gt; Kate: Well, that's a very,

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.460
very diplomatically
brilliant answer I would say.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.280
Yeah. And you?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.580
&gt;&gt; Audience: Harry Potter.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.500
&gt;&gt; Kate: Harry Potter is
a very good answer, too.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.470
I can never pick just
one favorite book, ever,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.370
not as an adult, not as a kid.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.670
I loved to read as a kid.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.730
I love to read as an adult.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.960
If you force me, I will
say "Charlotte's Web"

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.230
by E. B. White even though I didn't
read it as a kid because I read

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.690
"Black Beauty" as a kid, and
after that I would never check

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.060
out another book with an animal
on the cover, and I would look

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.680
at Wilbur's face in the
spin rack at the library

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.610
and think, "Oh, no, not me.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.100
Something terrible is going
to happen to that pig."

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.690
So I didn't read it until I
was an adult, but to my mind,

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.250
that is one of the most
perfect books ever written.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.070
How many of y'all have
read "Charlotte's Web?"

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:51.460
[Applause] Yeah, how many
teachers in the audience?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.230
How many of you teachers
read out loud

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.750
to your kids during-Can
we have a round

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.050
of applause for-[Applause] Oops,

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:05.510
I cannot-I cannot tell
you-Oh, wrap it up.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.570
I've got to wrap it up.

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.490
I cannot tell you how
much that matters.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.090
I was a kid who grew up in a house
filled with books with a mother

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.020
who read to me, bought me
books, took me to the library.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:19.760
I lived for Mrs. Boyette
to read aloud for me,

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.190
and every day after lunch,

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.210
"Island of the Blue Dolphins,"
I will never forget it.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.670
You're changing lives
when you read out loud.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:27.980
Thank you all for being here.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:30.210
Thank you for believing
in the power of stories.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:36.050
I'm so grateful.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.350
Thank you.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.650
