00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.710
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.170
Congratulations for braving it
through what's now become a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.780
weekly snow disaster.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.650
This week's maybe three
of them or something.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.920
My name's John Gabrieli.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.910
This is Introductory to
Psychology, 9.00.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.280
This is a course about you.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.720
The entire course is what do we
understand in a scientific

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.320
way about human nature--

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.230
how people's minds work, how
people's brains work that

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.335
supports their mind.

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:57.990
This entire course is about
what's a scientific way to

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.210
understanding how people feel,
think, and act in the world.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.260
And so we're trying to say that
we constantly think you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.520
must in your everyday life think
about why do you have

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.280
your preferences,
your desires?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.110
What's easy for you?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.890
What's hard for you?

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.610
What's delightful for you?

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.955
Why do other people behave
the way they do?

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:19.870
How do they think?

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.470
How do they feel?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.760
And so there's a lot of realms
of this that are tough to get

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.650
to by science.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.630
But what we're going to focus on
this semester is where the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.860
scientific approach has shed
light in the way that we used

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.840
to think about experiments
and evidence,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.970
about how humans tick.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.640
And as we go through this
semester, we'll talk about the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.890
brain, we'll talk a fair bit
about chapters from this book,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.860
The Man Who Mistook His Wife for
a Hat, from Oliver Sacks.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.870
It was a bestseller even when it
wasn't [? a ScienceWare ?]

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:49.130
course.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.790
It's a great book.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.060
You'll enjoy it.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.590
Short, really fun chapters.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.640
We'll talk about how we perceive
the world; how we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.840
see; especially, a little bit,
how we hear; how we think; how

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.440
we feel; personality; how we
differ from one to the other;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.550
and what we're sort of like;
and how we behave in the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.320
world; development from
childhood and infancy through

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.520
adolescence, through young
adulthood, where you are

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.700
mostly, through getting older,
where I am; social

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.950
interaction, how we behave in
groups and think about other

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.740
people; and variation in
the mental health or

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.780
psychopathology.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.580
And increasingly, we understand
that there's a huge

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.010
number of people who, at some
moment in their life or

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.280
another, struggle with some
aspect of mental health.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.860
And then we'll focus a lot on,
not only the psychological

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.150
aspects of what we study in
terms of behavior, but also

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.590
the brain basis of that, and
think a little bit about to

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.330
what extent the mind is what the
brain does, to what extent

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.800
the mind is what
the brain does.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.940
And so for every dimension of
being a human being that we'll

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.800
talk about, we'll also talk
about what we understand

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.150
currently from the
neurological and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.660
neuroscientific literature
about how the human brain

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.360
supports and contributes
to different

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.150
aspects of being a person.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.200
OK.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.540
So everybody who works in a
certain field thinks that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.400
their field is really, really,
really special, right?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.180
So here's why psychology
is really,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.700
really, really special.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.500
So it's really, really special,
I think, most of all,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.460
because every endeavor that we
undertake at a university or

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.250
in society as a whole--

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.600
it's about people, right, except
for when we think about

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.340
the rest of nature.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.600
But people study biology,
chemistry, and physics.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.260
And they think, right, that the
sun orbits the earth for

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.700
some period of time.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.170
And then they think
it's the other way

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.980
around currently, right?

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.390
OK, so people come up with
these conclusions.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.740
Even though we're trying to
understand nature, it's people

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.510
who make certain investments
in economics or behave in a

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.020
certain way or vote
in a certain way.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.570
It's people who make music and
appreciate music, make art and

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.616
appreciate art, read and write
literature, right?

00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:00.150
So in all these dimensions,
there's something very

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.600
fundamental about what it is
about the human mind that

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.560
gives birth to these areas of
inquiry and how those areas,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.960
domains of human experience,
are enacted.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.960
So my only goal today is to
try to convince you in a

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.490
number of different ways that
we're not simple video camera

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.019
in our minds between our ears,
recording the world in some

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.850
objective, simple way, that
even the simplest, most

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.150
obvious things are
interpretations of the world

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.990
around us at many different
levels of thought and feeling

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.190
and perception.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.650
And then our minds, the way
our minds are constructed,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.610
determines the world that we
experience, that we see, that

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.900
we act upon.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.930
And even very simple things
that we think are pretty

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.370
objective and simple, right
in front of our eyes, are

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.660
determined by inferences and
deductions that our mind

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.560
makes, weighing sources of
evidence in the world and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.150
coming to conclusions about
what's around us, what we

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.970
hear, what we see,
and how we think.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.460
So let's start with seeing.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.080
If your vision is reasonable,
we say we see something, we

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.180
believe it, right?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.150
So let's start with something
very simple--

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.200
these lines.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.680
So one of the tough things about
psychology is ever since

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.550
the Internet came into
existence, people know every

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.080
cool thing there is
to know, right?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.170
OK.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.120
I can tell you when I began
teaching, people said, oh my

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.510
gosh, I've never seen
such a thing.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.810
It's unbelievable!

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.760
And then now, it's like two
thirds of the class is like,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.640
yeah, I've got that on
my computer at home.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.180
We did that in third
grade or whatever.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.450
So all I'm saying is enjoy the
ones you haven't seen before,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.330
don't ruin it for your neighbors
today, because it's

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.880
harder and harder to
surprise the world

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.070
in a nice way, right?

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.540
OK, but let's look at these
lines for a moment here.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.670
And perhaps you'll have the
sense, and maybe-- is it

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.910
glaring up there, sir?

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.160
Let's see.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.680
OK, is that better?

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.880
OK.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.120
Maybe not.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:55.820
So you might have the sense that
this line is a different

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.480
length than this line.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.280
And this might be somewhere
intermediate, right?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.690
Now you know, because of
psychology, it's all a trick.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.010
But what's simpler than
the length of a line?

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:07.650
What's more objective
in some sense than

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.370
the length of a line?

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.710
But if we look at the actual
lengths, they're

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.390
all literally identical.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.160
But that center part
looks different.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.210
So what does it mean for
it to look different?

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.800
It means our minds are
determining as simple a thing

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.300
as how long a line is depending
on the other

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.680
information surrounding it.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.780
It's an interpretation
in context.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.100
If we're simply looking, the
lines will look the same.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.730
Let's try another one.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.122
It's remarkable that those two
lines are identical in length.

00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:36.046
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:36.046 --> 00:06:39.005
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:41.460
It's OK to test the limits
of the credibility of the

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.900
audience, right?

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.370
All right.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.870
Yeah.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.940
Of course, if our visual system
were ludicrously off,

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.220
we'd be constantly walking into
walls and falling out

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.000
windows and things like that,
right, if we were

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.530
misestimating at that length.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.570
So the idea where we have visual
illusions-- and I'll

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.000
show you some more that I think
you'll be impressed by--

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.470
it's not that our visual system
is messed up or that

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.920
psychologists think it's
hilarious to trick us.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.100
It's that lots of things our
visual system is a brilliant

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.010
at, but it's brilliant by
having certain laws or

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.000
principles that it follows.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.060
And we can show this following
those principles by seeing

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.380
that when we mess with the
typical circumstances, those

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.210
principles calculate
the wrong answer.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.600
So here's another one.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.850
So, to most people, which line
looks bigger, the one in the

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.970
middle or the one on the side?

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.420
I know you know it's
all a trick, right?

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.490
OK.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.480
What could be more obvious
than that this is longer?

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.480
It's just a simple line, but if
we draw red lines on top of

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.940
it then move them over here,
they're dead identical.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.980
The central circle--

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.540
does one of them, the
middle circle, look

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.160
larger than the other?

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.380
Now you already know,
intellectually, that it will

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.915
turn out those two circles in
the middle will be the same.

00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:52.840
But you have to convince
yourself that it still looks

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.830
like they're different.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.610
Here there in red.

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:55.800
Here they are next
to each other.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.690
They're identical.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.170
Again, this is evidence that,
even for a simple thing like

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.210
the size of a circle, your mind
is making inferences.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.110
And there are principles and
laws that it's following that

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.090
determine what it is you
think that you see.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.140
Here is two monsters
chasing each other.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.990
But in fact, they're
identical in size.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.890
The perspective cues make
the more distant

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.860
one look much bigger.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.910
This is from Ted Adelson.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.150
This is a beautiful
demonstration of an illusion.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.560
Ted Adelson's in the psychology
department.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.280
There's a letter A here.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.810
And believe it or not, there's
a letter B there.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.440
Let's see if this looks any
better when it goes like this.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.440
It doesn't.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.120
All right.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.700
So one of the important things
about illusions,

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.500
demonstrations in this class--
and you will learn this as we

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.010
go along-- is occasionally they
fail, and we come back

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.780
and discover what the
lesson of that is.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.110
So I'm just telling you
it's showing you on my

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:48.070
monitor much brighter.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.910
It always has before.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:51.450
We'll adjust that.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.060
So I'm going to skip this, but
I'll show you another time,

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.360
because it's so good.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.060
And I'm going to feel
bad about this.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.050
OK.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.480
Now, let's see.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.730
This'll work.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.035
All the same shade
of grey, right?

00:09:28.312 --> 00:09:29.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.070
PROFESSOR: Did that work
reasonably from where you sat?

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.150
We'll try a few more.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.400
Maybe.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.180
For some reason,
my connection's

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.430
always like this, sorry.

00:10:05.956 --> 00:10:07.940
Does that one look lighter
than that one that way?

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.190
Yeah.

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:38.000
Now they look radically
different, right?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.870
It's the same grey constantly.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.720
But again, the context is hugely
determining how to

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.980
bright you see that grey.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.230
There it is.

00:11:09.026 --> 00:11:11.516
Two boxes equal grey.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.400
So things as simple as how
bright something is or how

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:34.380
long something is depend
on interpretation.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.430
Here's an illusion from
Roger Shepard.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.460
It's kind of great.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:40.990
So here's two kind of different

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.580
looking tables, right?

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.840
But they're not that
different.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.800
And watch.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.050
There goes one tabletop.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.490
You're not impressed that those
are identical tables?

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.000
OK.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.250
Want me to do it again?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.480
That's the identical tabletop.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.590
To me, the one on the left looks
pretty rectangular and

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.990
the one on the right looks
pretty square-ish.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.880
You're not easy to
impress, are you?

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.220
PROFESSOR: You see that those
two bars are moving together

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.990
at the same time.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.670
Does it look like they're
little steps?

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.890
It'll show you.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.140
All right, fine.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.750
It's just like that, but
now you add those bars.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:37.800
Does it look like little steps?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.340
PROFESSOR: One more
of this kind.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.590
This is kind of fun.

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.500
You see the way that the
mask is turning?

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.920
It always looks like it's
towards you, even though I'm--

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.480
one of the rotations-- it's
because of the way you're

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.840
interpreting the light is
influencing how you

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.890
interpreting what's--

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:10.570
OK.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.000
So that's simply a consequence,
as far as people

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.030
understand that, that the source
of the illumination is

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.790
not where you're used to, so
you're misinterpreting where

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.120
the illumination is coming
from for the depth of the

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.260
face, what's front and what's
back, whether the nose is

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:26.510
sticking in or sticking out.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:31.100
OK.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.600
So again, the point in these
illusions is, even for very

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.410
simple things our, minds make
certain assumptions about how

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.040
we interpret the world.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.230
And that drives everything that
we see and how we act

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.640
upon what we see.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.530
So at a slightly higher
or more conceptual

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.930
level, I need your help.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.040
Now, there's lots of these
things we'll do this semester

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.610
where you get to participate.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.660
The fun thing about--

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.410
I said this course was about
you-- when you could have

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:00.970
thought that was a bit
rhetorical, it's not.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.730
It's truly about you.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:05.140
So you get to be your
own laboratory.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.120
We get to share a laboratory
sitting here.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.270
And what I'm going to do is ask
for you to participate.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.790
You don't have to do any of
these things sitting at your

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.590
seat, but I think it's usually
fun to do them.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.020
So what's going to happen
is I'm going

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.270
to show you a drawing.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.230
If the people to my left--

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.850
so about in the middle, but you
can decide for yourself--

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.920
about this way, let's have you
be Group A if you're willing

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.170
to be that way.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.090
All right.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.520
Because of that, I
can't call you--

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.930
I was going to call you guys
Group B, but I already see

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.130
that's getting me in trouble.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.190
So we'll call it Group B, but
that really means equals A.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.070
But I'll just call it B, OK?

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.300
So A and B, OK?

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.741
So what I need is Group B--

00:14:53.741 --> 00:14:56.500
B for best, A for awesome, OK.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:58.132 --> 00:15:01.860
PROFESSOR: --Group B to close
your eyes for a moment.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.320
Group B, if you want to have fun
with this, close your eyes

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.010
for a moment.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.930
Group A, you're gonna see some
instructions, and read them

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.180
silently to yourself.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.155
And then I'll ask you a question
about the picture.

00:15:14.155 --> 00:15:15.670
OK, Group A, you're
now reading.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:16.680
Group B has your eyes closed.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.210
So read the instructions
silently to yourself.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.680
OK?

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.340
Now Group A, close your eyes.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.520
Everybody has their eyes
closed for a moment.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.720
Everybody has their
eyes closed.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.105
Now Group B, look at
your instructions.

00:15:33.105 --> 00:15:36.665
So A has their eyes closed,
B is reading instructions.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.990
OK?

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.630
Everybody's eyes are open now.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.570
Everybody's eyes are open.

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:48.270
Here's your picture.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.190
Take it in and I'm going
to ask you a few

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:49.740
questions about it.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.370
Look at it for a moment
and inspect it.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.120
OK, here we go, ready?

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.820
So just out loud--

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.760
was there an automobile
in the picture?

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.526
AUDIENCE: No.

00:15:58.526 --> 00:15:58.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.140
See, this is a smart class.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.850
We're gonna have a--

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.460
Was there a man in
the picture?

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.020
PROFESSOR: Was there a
woman in the picture?

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.425
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:07.425 --> 00:16:08.140
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.477
This side again, woman
in the picture?

00:16:11.477 --> 00:16:12.820
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.070
PROFESSOR: All right,
all right.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.590
OK, a child?

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.400
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.460
PROFESSOR: An animal?

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:20.950
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.930
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:22.420
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.180
OK.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.110
And now it gets a little wild.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.700
OK?

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.790
A whip?

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.280
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.200
A sword?

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.880
PROFESSOR: All right,
a man's hat?

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.860
PROFESSOR: A ball?

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.950
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.970
PROFESSOR: A fish?

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:36.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.030
PROFESSOR: All right, so
there's disagreement.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.090
And that's--

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.740
we're a democracy, right?

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.310
So all these things are
big setups, right?

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.470
So here's what happened.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.000
Group A was told they were gonna
look at a picture of a

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.160
trained seal act.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.370
And Group B got the identical
instructions, but they were

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.330
told you're gonna look
at a costume ball.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.000
So you had an expectation of
what you were going to see.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.410
That expectation drives your
interpretation of the very

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.398
thing you see next, which
is this picture.

00:17:05.398 --> 00:17:05.882
OK?

00:17:05.882 --> 00:17:06.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:18.490
[CHATTER]

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.530
PROFESSOR: OK, is
that all right?

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.752
All right.

00:17:22.752 --> 00:17:25.000
And this is just
for fun, right?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.640
It's a set up.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.619
You're participating nicely.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:32.530
But in the world, when groups
that are arguing with each

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:36.500
other about things like peace
settlements, read a document,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.690
or make a statement, how much
do you think the perspective

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.680
they start with guides the
interpretation of what they

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.950
read or what they hear?

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.510
Because you didn't have
big stakes in this.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:49.200
You weren't going, I believe in
fish and if I don't see a

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.060
fish, I know things aren't just
and my group will be not

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.640
treated fairly.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.280
You're not emotionally invested
in, probably, whether

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.960
there was a fish present.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.360
So your interpretation, your
beliefs guide tremendously

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.210
what you think you see and how
you interpret the situation--

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.330
for complicated things
or even easy things

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.090
like lines or squares.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.160
And here's another kind of an
example where you would

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.135
interpret that as a
B for "baker" or

00:18:16.135 --> 00:18:17.070
13 if it's in numbers.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.700
Again, the context is driving
a lot of the interpretation.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:22.900
OK.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.620
Now this is one of those
examples that, again, when--

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.710
some number of years ago,
it was a huge hit.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.690
And now, mostly people say,
can't you come up with

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.790
something better
that we haven't

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.590
all seen on the internet?

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.560
So if you know this, don't
ruin it for the other

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.810
individuals.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.570
But what I need is a
few volunteers--

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.620
you'll be facing me
this way-- who are

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.070
willing to count something.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.310
And it's MIT, we're pretty
good at counting.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.080
So what's the message of that?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.380
The message is--

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.930
we've talked about what we
perceive, what we see by

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.650
expectations in context.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.860
But it's also we have very
limited what psychologists

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.310
call attentional resources.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.960
We can pay attention
to a limited number

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.240
of things at a time.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.040
And even when those things can
be right in front of us, if

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.170
our attention is focused or
occupied by something else,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.400
like counting the passes
in a difficult scene--

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.060
it wouldn't work if there was
one or two passes only,

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.400
because you would notice it.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:42.610
But when your mind is focused on
identifying all the passes

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.065
among the players-- and the
white shirts are moving,

00:19:44.065 --> 00:19:47.360
they're weaving with the other
players and so on--

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.920
then your attention is absorbed
by that, and some of

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.390
it is not left over to notice
what's right in front of you.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.750
And we'll talk more
about that.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.650
But it's a huge thing with
humans that we can pay

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.550
attention pretty well, on
average, to a thing at a time

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.980
under many circumstances.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.340
And the other things escape us
completely, even if they're

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.830
obviously present if we were
looking at them or paying

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.470
attention to them.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.490
So here's another example of how
our minds make our world--

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.880
what we see and what we don't
see, what we pay attention to

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.710
and what we don't pay
attention to.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.695
And that's something to
do with how we hear.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.330
OK, so I'm going
to replay this.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.980
So listen to what the
guy is saying.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.730
Take a look, and
just tell he--

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.360
he's saying some letters,
OK, just not a word.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.610
What is it?

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:58.990
OK, most people think he's
saying "da." "Da da, da da, da

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.490
da." Now let's try that again.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.520
I'm going to turn off the
sound and I'm going to

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.770
run the same film.

00:21:09.874 --> 00:21:12.330
What does his mouth look
like it's saying?

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.960
"Ga ga." OK?

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.250
But now we'll do one more thing,
which is turn the sound

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.950
back on, have you close
your eyes, and listen

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.200
to what he's saying.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.310
What's he saying?

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:29.030
AUDIENCE: "Ba."

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:29.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:33.220
So it doesn't work for
everybody every time.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.010
But the basic idea is most
people think they hear the

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:40.160
word "da" coming from
the speaker.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.840
And in fact, in their mind they
do because that's how

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.530
they interpret what
they're hearing.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:47.910
But in reality, the film clip
is a film clip of the person

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:53.120
saying "ba ba ba." And then an
audio recording of the person

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.650
saying "ga ga ga." Your mind
intertwines across modalities

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.380
what you hear and what you see,
integrates them in some

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.820
way below your level
of consciousness.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.510
You're not thinking about it.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.690
And you come up with a different
interpretation of

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.370
what you hear.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:09.880
Right?

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.130
So what you see would
be this one thing.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.240
What you hear is
another thing.

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.200
When your eyes are open and your
ears are open, they meld

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.660
together and produce
something--

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.250
a third thing that's
entirely different.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.100
Again, your mind interpreted
what you hear, not your ear

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.380
interpreting what you hear,
in a simple sense.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.390
OK.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.520
How about things that we know?

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.910
So let's think about this.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.020
If somebody were to ask you
which is farther east, closer

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:35.840
to the Atlantic--

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.210
San Diego, California,
or Reno, Nevada?

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.330
Who likes San Diego as
being farther east?

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:44.190
A few hands.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.470
Who likes Reno as being
farther east?

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.350
OK.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:52.680
So, here's the mental map most
people have-- the mental map--

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.320
which is we know California's
right next to the ocean with

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.760
Arnold Schwarzenegger protecting
us on that side of

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.800
the country, right?

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.020
And then Nevada's a little bit
more towards Boston, right?

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:05.570
OK.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.280
That's a mental map that
most people have.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.330
And that's how the
hands went up.

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.870
This is the actual map.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:13.440
And the only actual map you've
ever seen, ever-- on a globe,

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.680
on a map, anything.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.340
Because California takes a big
turn on the south, San Diego's

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.890
further east than Reno.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.610
Why do we imagine, and most
people do, that Reno is

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:31.000
further east, when you've never
seen a map or globe

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.700
that's shown you that?

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.490
Never ever, ever.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:35.740
Yeah.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.040
PROFESSOR: Because it's farther
from the ocean,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.120
because in our mind we go,
California's way out there.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.240
There's nothing--

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.840
Hawaii is the only one out there
further west, right?

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.480
So our mind makes this
answer despite that.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.610
And that's what we think
we might know.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.990
Now, we might not be
totally certain.

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.960
We might not bet the
farm on that.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.360
Which is farther north--

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.820
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
or Rome, Italy?

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.600
So start to think-- how would
you think about that?

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.610
It's not something you know.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.000
Nobody memorizes it, right?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.200
But how would you begin
to think which is

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.300
probably more northern?

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:11.020
What's your first gut?

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.210
How many people like
Philadelphia being more north?

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:16.740
How many people like Rome
being more north?

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.210
There's kind of a mixture
of hands.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:25.650
The answer is that Rome is
north of Philadelphia.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.510
Mostly people will answer that
Philadelphia is north.

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.830
Why they do that is they think
the US and Europe, they're

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.420
both sort of above the equator,
below Antarctica,

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.430
kind of a aligned, even
historically, culturally.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:40.840
So they think, well, Rome is
pretty south in Europe.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.220
And it is.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.240
It's in Italy.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.440
Philadelphia's reasonably
north in the US.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.230
It gets winters and all
that kinds of stuff.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:50.190
So a northern city in the US
has got to be north of a

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:51.840
southern city in Europe.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.680
But in fact, Europe is-- the
whole continent is shifted up

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.270
compared to the US.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.720
So you won't-- wait until get
your mind around this.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.345
Which is further north,
Atlanta or Chicago?

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:06.023
PROFESSOR: All right,
all right.

00:25:06.023 --> 00:25:06.930
Sorry.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.180
It's sort of a joke.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.170
Because sometimes when you do
this, people go like, wait a

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.850
minute, all my assumptions
are off.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:14.840
Like, where am I?

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.440
What's reality?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.220
Here's one more-- two more.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.490
Which is further north,
Portland or Toronto?

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.570
Now you are already learning
the lesson go opposite.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.180
Whatever I thought, go
opposite, right?

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.100
But why do you think most
people will answer that

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.400
Toronto is further north?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.560
Canada is up there, US is
below it, but in fact--

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.980
that's the mental map
in the colors.

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.272
But in fact, Portland
in Oregon is

00:25:38.272 --> 00:25:40.720
actually north of Toronto.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.420
We'll do one last one.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.250
Which is further west?

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.780
Which is further west, Miami,
Florida-- which that's all the

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.020
way towards the Atlantic
Ocean--

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.910
or Santiago, Chili-- which is
towards the Pacific Ocean.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.820
Further west.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.260
So most people have a mental
map that North America and

00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:01.170
South America are kind of
lined up like that.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.890
And so you say well, Miami is
further east and Santiago's

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.540
farther west.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.830
But in fact, South America is
fairly shifted compared to

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.020
North America.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:14.140
And Santiago is actually more
eastern or Miami is more

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:16.750
western, one relative
to the other.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.750
Because in our head, we kind
of think, North and South

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:21.660
America-- they're kind of lined
up even though we never

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.060
saw a global map like that.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.410
So again, some of our knowledge
guides how we think

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.870
about the world and what
we believe we know.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.740
So what's the point of this?

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.290
It's what used to be called
telephone, right?

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.630
Their story keeps changing.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.510
And it's hard to remember
details in a story.

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:48.040
People remember a nugget, or
what we call a gist in

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.980
psychology, a little point.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.440
And second, what you take as a
point is how you then tell the

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.140
next person, the way you
interpret the story,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.720
something like that.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.494
Thanks very much,
that was good.

00:26:59.494 --> 00:27:02.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.560
PROFESSOR: Again, two things--
our memory for precise details

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.200
is surprisingly modest.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.970
And how we interpret things
matter changes things a lot.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.870
So now, you had four brave
students demonstrating some of

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.430
the limits and properties
of memory.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.640
So now, here's an exercise you
can do in your own seat.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.280
OK, you're just knowing
yourself how you

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.050
did, but here we go.

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.115
I'm going to read
you some words.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.880
And then just give you-- don't
have to write anything down.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.990
If you write it down,
it's no good.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.420
And then I'm going to ask you on
a recognition test, whether

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.480
you heard a word or not.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.860
Ready?

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:42.830
So here's the list.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.540
So just listen and then
I'll test your memory

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.540
for it right after.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.780
Here's the list.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:56.260
Sour, candy, sugar, bitter,
good, taste, tooth, nice,

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:04.460
honey, soda, chocolate, heart,
cake, tart, pie.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.880
OK?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.350
All right, how many
people heard the

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.800
word "sour?" All right.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.150
Yeah, excellent, thank you.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:14.050
"Chair." "Candy." Hey.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:19.740
"Honey." "Building." "Sweet."
Every hand up there, you have

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:20.920
a false memory.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.670
PROFESSOR: Now, it's
a set up OK?

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.350
Because here's the way they make
these lists, it's a set

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.790
up, but there's a huge lesson.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.350
And in fact, you may hear
debates about what are real

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.710
memories, what are false
memories, in court cases, in

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.530
clinical cases.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.880
This is a laboratory experiment
that's been the

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.950
testing ground for lots of ideas
about how we make real

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.450
memories and how we end up
with false memories.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:46.330
So here's the way they
made the list.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.310
They took the word "sour." And
they took a lot of students

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:51.430
basically like you and said,
what's the first word you

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.000
think of that goes with sour?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.820
And people came up with
this kind of a list.

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.490
Candy, sugar, bitter, good,
taste, tooth, nice, honey,

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.160
soda, chocolate, heart,
cake, tart, pie.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.710
But they left out one
word that people

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.380
came up with a lot.

00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.470
The word "sweet." OK?

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.780
So your mind interpreted
the list.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.760
You said, hey, this is all about
things that are related

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.690
to sweet things in one way or
another-- sweet sugar, sweet

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:22.760
candy, sweet and sour, honey is
sweet, chocolate is sweet.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.520
So your mind imagined it heard
the word "sweet." And the

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.320
majority of you put your hand up
that you actually heard the

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.520
word "sweet." Your mind imagined
it was there because

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.420
that was generally what
was going on.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.760
That was the gist of
the experience, OK?

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.550
So this idea is it's very
easy, because of the way

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:45.680
memory works, we remember the
gist of things because that's

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.750
what's the important part.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:48.850
It's hard to remember
the details.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.330
But that gist is an
interpreted gist.

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.350
The gist was it's
sweet things.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.730
So the word "sweet" feels like
it was part of the memory.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.740
And we'll come back to that
later on in the course.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.410
So one of the themes we'll talk
about a lot in the course

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.280
is both an amazing power of the
human mind and an amazing

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.770
peril of the human mind.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.250
And it's what psychologists
call automaticity.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.430
It's that our mind, in order
to be efficient and quick,

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.940
does things automatically
without thought, without

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.860
consciousness.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.470
It lets us walk without
thinking a lot about

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:19.220
where our feet are.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:22.230
It lets us speak quickly without
thinking about the

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.180
syntax and the vocabulary,
right?

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.700
It lets us do a lot of things.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:28.690
So that's the power of it.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.940
The peril is when something
becomes automatic, we lose

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.460
control of it within
ourselves.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.460
So I need somebody at their
seat who's willing to read

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.380
aloud something as fast as they
can when they see it on

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.170
the computer monitor.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.800
If I can get a volunteer
at your seat.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.050
OK, all the way back
there, OK.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.490
And then I'll come to you
for the second one.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:48.800
Ready?

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.570
Here it comes.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.990
As fast as you can, go.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.360
AUDIENCE: One way
not do enter.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.340
PROFESSOR: OK, then,
you got it.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:54.840
I couldn't trick you.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.680
OK.

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.060
But you might imagine a person
might mistake that, right?

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.410
Was there another one?

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:00.650
Was it you?

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.300
OK, ready?

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:01.820
Here we go.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.770
Go.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:03.744
AUDIENCE: Paris in spring.

00:31:03.744 --> 00:31:04.231
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:31:04.231 --> 00:31:06.179
I got you on that.

00:31:06.179 --> 00:31:10.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.590
PROFESSOR: Because your mind
is automatically reading.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.160
We have lots of evidence in
psychology that you're barely

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.000
looking at words like
"the." You're

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.380
assuming over those things.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.680
They're almost invisible to you
there even though they're

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:22.830
physically present, because your
mind is looking for the

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.040
big content, right?

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.800
Who cares about the word "the?"
Your mind is going for

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.990
the essential information, and
it becomes literally blind to

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:31.680
what's in front of you, because
it knows what it's

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.800
looking for.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.650
Here's a fun one.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:35.990
You've seen things like
this before, but it's

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.850
always fun to try.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.870
It's the same principle.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.990
How many letter F's do you
find in this display?

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.312
Can I get some numbers?

00:32:00.312 --> 00:32:00.748
AUDIENCE: 6.

00:32:00.748 --> 00:32:01.184
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:32:01.184 --> 00:32:01.620
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.870
PROFESSOR: 4, 5, 6.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.830
Those are all good.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:06.080
We're not an exact science.

00:32:11.049 --> 00:32:18.790
[CLAMORING]

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.320
PROFESSOR: Some of you may have
missed one or two F's.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.805
Again, it's because your
mind is automatically--

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:29.610
typical readers read at
spectacular speeds.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:32.140
And the way you read at a
spectacular speed is you don't

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.160
look for little details.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.570
You get the big words and the
big ideas and you zoom through

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:37.050
for the big meaning.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.060
And you're leaving behind what
you consider to be details.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:39.470
Yeah.

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:41.770
AUDIENCE: So if you ask this
question to a society that

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.504
pronounces "of" just
like "off,"

00:32:43.504 --> 00:32:46.290
would that change anything?

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.970
PROFESSOR: The question was if
we asked a society that didn't

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.610
pronounce F's or something
like that.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:51.981
AUDIENCE: That didn't pronounce
F's as F's.

00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:53.352
In America, we pronounce
it "of."

00:32:53.352 --> 00:32:55.440
PROFESSOR: "Of," you mean
like a "v" sound or

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.060
something like that.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:56.910
Does that matter for this?

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:57.880
Yes.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.550
It also matters a lot that words
like "of" are little

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.160
preposition words that we
don't think much about.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.660
So this is a set up.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.720
Like "finish," most
people get.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.280
Or the beginning of a word
you're more likely to get.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.200
I think the pronunciation
probably matters.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.900
I don't know that for sure.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.840
That's a very good thought.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.680
And certainly, hiding it in
words that seem low in content

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.230
for interpreting a sentence is
about the best way we did it.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.250
That's why the second "the"
disappeared too.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.060
It's sort of a low
content word for

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.060
processing a sentence.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.540
OK.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.370
This is an example that you
know, but it's a nice example

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.890
and we can come back to
it a couple times.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.305
So let me think about
this for one second.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.220
Maybe we'll do it this way--
that we'll ask somebody at

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.840
their seat who has typical
color vision.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.410
If you're color blind, this one
is not a good one for you.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:51.970
Some percentage are.

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.910
Is somebody willing at their
seat to read aloud stuff they

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.160
see on a monitor?

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.200
OK, thank you.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:00.650
Here we go.

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.860
So you're gonna see words
that are printed

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.170
in different colors.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:12.159
Your job is to name aloud the
color of the ink that it's

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:12.860
printed in.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.850
Does that make sense?

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:16.610
So like on this F, you
would say it's red on

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.270
that F. Is that OK?

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.679
Here we go.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.022
So start here and just go.

00:34:22.022 --> 00:34:23.990
AUDIENCE: Red, orange.

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.958
PROFESSOR: As fast as you
can, just keep going.

00:34:25.958 --> 00:34:30.889
AUDIENCE: Green, brown, pink,
green, blue, yellow, red.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:32.040
PROFESSOR: Great, excellent.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.719
Same thing.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:34.989
Read the color of the ink
exactly like you were doing.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:36.947
Go.

00:34:36.947 --> 00:34:41.440
AUDIENCE: Green, blue, red,
blue, red, yellow, red.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.360
PROFESSOR: Ah, you're
pretty good.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:43.750
OK.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.639
It's supposed to slow you down
when you get the ink in the

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.360
wrong colors.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:49.070
And it usually does.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.268
But you were very good.

00:34:54.642 --> 00:34:55.606
All right.

00:34:55.606 --> 00:34:57.570
Again, if you know this from
courses and the internet,

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.060
don't ruin it for others, but
think about it for yourself.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.220
So now we're gonna
turn to thought.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.930
There's 30 people in a room.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.070
Just imagine you sat-- there'
just groups of 30 here.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.440
You get the month and date of
each person's birthday.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.640
So it's not the year they were
born, but it could be December

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.630
1 or February 5 or something
like that.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.130
What is the approximate
probability that two people

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.310
will have the exact
same birthday?

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.280
I can tell you the vast majority
of people under

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.640
slightly less suspicious
circumstances of this will

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.980
answer about 10%.

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.050
That's the vast majority.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.550
The correct answer is--

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.380
OK?

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:41.490
Why do you think--

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.120
this is work from Kahneman
and Tversky.

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.070
We'll come back to this.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.650
Why do you think people tend
to answer 10%, some 30%?

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.490
Very few people give you
the mathematically

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.430
correct answer of 70%.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:52.680
Why do they do that?

00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:00.100
Because they tend to think, how
often have I met somebody

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.660
who has my exact birthday?

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.820
And you go, not that often.

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.320
It's not like every 30 people
I meet, somebody says, you

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.590
were born on March 3.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:08.910
I was born in March 3.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.690
And then you go have lunch
and you go, hey, I was

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:11.350
born on March 3.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.280
And you go have dinner with
another group and they go, I

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.480
was born on March 3.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.640
It's not something that
happens a lot, right?

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.380
So you go, well, in real
life it doesn't seem

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.050
to happen very often.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.010
That's what we call a
heuristic-- a simple way to

00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.780
think about it.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.430
Because your experience
is kind of like that.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.690
But why is that incorrect

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.760
mathematically for this question?

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.050
Because the math depends on
not that's exactly your

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.790
birthday, but any pair of
birthdays among the 30 people.

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.060
And then it goes way up.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.310
In fact, it goes to 70%.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:43.380
And if it's 24 people,
it's 50%.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.860
If you're a group of 36 people,
there's a 90% chance,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.190
just mathematically, that
two people will

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.840
share the same birthday.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.070
Because when we face things that
are hard to think about,

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.190
because there's no easy answer,
humans tend to take

00:36:56.190 --> 00:37:00.180
shortcuts and say, what's the
gist of my experience, and

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.430
that's what I think
the answer is.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.700
Even when a calculable
answer is available.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.580
It's human nature to make a
shortcut based on your sense

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.830
of your experience.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.560
So there's a very interesting
line of work--

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.040
Dan Gilbert of Harvard
is a leading figure--

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.910
about this idea of thinking
about your future.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.780
Now, thinking about our future
is a big thing, right?

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.580
We're thinking about what's it
like in this course, what's it

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.090
like in college, what's our
friendship like, relations

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:32.790
with parents, what's our future
career paths, what kind

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.670
of life will we lead, right?

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.690
Our future is something that's
hugely on our mind, I think,

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.860
very powerfully when you're
a college student

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.530
or a graduate student.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.110
What's my future?

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.680
And a big question that people
have is what will make me

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.170
happy in a deep sense?

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.270
What will make me happy
in a deep sense?

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.010
Because that's the life
I want to lead--

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.620
the values I want to have, the
kind of career choices and

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:55.950
personal choices I want to make,
where I will devote my

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.340
time on this earth.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.820
So most people, first of all,
tend to think about good

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.550
things, positive things.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.430
Actually, I can tell you what
comes later in the course.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:07.660
It's good to think that lots of

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.640
positive things are happening.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.050
It's kind of a nice place
to be in terms of

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.230
being a happy person.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:17.350
But it turns out that people
have done studies like this.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.380
So now this is particularly
sensitive for a faculty

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:22.880
member, but it could work for
any sports team you've tried

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.090
out or anything you've tried
out for in your life.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.010
So what happens when we get
reviewed for tenure?

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.410
And you hear a bit about that.

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.340
This was an easy study for
a psychologist to do.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.190
What they did is they called up
people in the fall who were

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:36.260
being reviewed for tenure.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.670
And you get tenure
or you don't.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.935
And it's a bit of a sad process
if you don't, right,

00:38:40.935 --> 00:38:43.150
because you don't get tenure,
and then you don't feel happy

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.690
about that.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.230
And you have to call your
parents and say, I didn't get

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.220
tenure, and your parents go,
come on, if you just slept

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.340
better, you would've
gotten tenure.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:54.570
PROFESSOR: Remember the piano
lessons you didn't take.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.220
So it's a bit of a
nuisance, right?

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.290
On top of that--

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.420
because weirdly, in academics,
we tend to be super

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.940
specialized-- you have
to move out of town.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.500
You don't have to, but
typically, a person who

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.500
doesn't get tenure will get
a job somewhere else.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.620
There's plenty of stories of
people who don't get tenure at

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.690
awesome places who were
geniuses in history.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.600
The tenure decisions
are often wrong.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.520
But still, you'd rather
get it than not.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.660
You'd rather get into the
medical school than not.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.970
You'd rather make a sports
team you want

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.210
to be on than not.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:22.410
So here's what they found out.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.900
If they asked them what happens
if you don't get

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.400
tenure, everybody says, oh,
it's gonna be awful.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.335
It's gonna be miserable.

00:39:27.335 --> 00:39:29.440
I'm gonna be such an
unhappy person.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:33.570
Two years later, the average
happiness of people who didn't

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:36.200
get tenure was equal to the
average happiness of people

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.220
who did get tenure.

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:39.970
So you can say, well,
tenure-- only

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.420
professors care about tenure.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:43.530
Well, how about winning
the lottery?

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.510
What if I won hundreds of
thousands of dollars?

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.470
There' been a lot of psychology
on this, actually.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:52.360
In about a year to two, the
average happiness of a lottery

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.560
winner who won a substantial
amount of money is rated the

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.670
same by him or her as it was
the population as a whole.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.050
Yeah?

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:00.394
AUDIENCE: How did they go about

00:40:00.394 --> 00:40:01.740
measuring average happiness?

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:03.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so we'll
come back to this,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:04.860
but I'll tell you.

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:06.870
You can like this or
not like this.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.820
In some parts of psychology,
we measure things like

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.220
reaction time to the
millisecond.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.410
That's good data, right?

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.930
Our brain activation,
that's good data.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.480
When you ask a person how happy
they are, the only thing

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.670
we can do is have you basically
fill a scale from

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.360
one to seven.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.250
How happy are you?

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:24.190
And you could go, well I'm a
little worried about that,

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.650
because sometimes people say, I
hope that it makes you happy

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:27.820
or something.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.290
So you could say, how
much can we trust

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:31.780
subjective reports of happiness?

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.290
And that's a very
good question.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.150
On the other hand, it's hard
to know what would

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.660
be better than that.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.080
If we measure your
pulse, is that a

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.840
better measure of happiness?

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.830
Your pulse could be racing
because you're sad or happy,

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.650
scared or enthusiastic.

00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:48.280
So we don't have a better one
that we can think of.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.330
But psychologists do worry that
sometimes people will

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:51.990
just say what they're
supposed to say.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.350
Or they'll pretend they're happy
or things like that.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.890
We have to worry about
those things.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.890
So you could worry deep down,
but a year or two later,

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.260
people who win huge amounts of
money don't report themselves

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:05.930
as any happier than people
around them.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.050
And kind of amazingly--

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:10.120
but I think it's deep
about life--

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.460
accidents leading to
quadriplegia or paraplegia,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.260
accidents that, before you had
such an accident you would

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.220
imagine that it would be
something extremely difficult.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.670
And it can be in many ways.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:26.370
But by self report, ratings of
happiness return to typical

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.170
average populations
of the same age

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:29.940
in about three months.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.860
So what's a huge lesson here
in happiness research--

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.610
a huge surprise.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.970
It's two things.

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.670
We're kind of bad at predicting
what will make us

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:40.330
happy or sad, which is
kind of weird, right?

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.260
We're kind of bad at
predicting it.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.220
Here's all these things where
we think they would make us

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.920
happy or make us not so happy.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.810
It turns out we're wrong when
this is studied at all

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:52.570
scientifically.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:54.840
So we'll come back to that later
on, because it's a very

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:56.810
deep thing about
being a human--

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.660
what makes you happy and
your wrong guesses

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.300
sometimes about what does.

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.390
So let me end with a
last experiment.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.610
So we've really haven't done
experiments until right now.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.210
And this is now a sensitive and
difficult issue, which is

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:13.230
problems we have in dealing
with racism.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.250
And here's a study that
did the following.

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:18.140
It said, well, in North America,
certainly, Canada,

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.590
the US-- a study was
done in Canada--

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:24.370
racism is widely condemned,
as I think most of us

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.440
believe it should be.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.070
But examples of blatant
racism still occurred.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.330
One recent poll said that
about a third of white

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:34.760
individuals reported hearing
anti-black slurs in the

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.830
workplace in the last
couple years--

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.000
to pick one thing.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.730
So how does this happen in a
society that speaks so much

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:45.010
about not being racist, about
treating everybody equally and

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.370
fairly and kindly?

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.800
How does it happen that
we still struggle.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.380
And it's such a very deep,
difficult question about human

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.660
nature and the world
we live in.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.910
But here's something again
that's a hint about why it's

00:42:55.910 --> 00:43:00.150
hard to get society to change
some of its behaviors.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.590
So here's the experiment--

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.110
so it's an actual experiment.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.160
So they took two groups of
college undergraduates and

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.890
randomly assigned one to be
in the forecaster group.

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.890
That's a group that tells you
how they think they would feel

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.280
and how they think they would
act under certain

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.380
circumstances.

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.320
And then an experiencer
group--

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.640
that's a group who actually
undergoes an experience, and

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.080
I'll tell you what
that is now.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.550
So in the experiencer group,
pretend you were their

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:27.350
research participant.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:31.010
You walk into a room, and you
see in that room a black male

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:31.630
and a white male.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.770
Now those two are what
psychologists, for some

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:36.300
reason, have called
confederates.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.460
Those are role players.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.530
They know what they're doing.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:41.830
They have a plan of what
they're going to do.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.640
They're going to put on
a little show for you.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.030
But you don't know that.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.930
And the black male stands up and
leaves the room to get his

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.770
cell phone, and he gently bumps
the white male's knee.

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.810
This is all set up.

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:55.120
You're just sitting there and
you see that little bump.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.460
And now, there's three
different groups.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.550
One group, that's it.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.490
Nothing else happens--

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.860
A small bump, and the
person leaves.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.790
A second group--

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.620
as you sit there, the black
individual leaves the room and

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.530
the white individual says,
quote, "Typical, I hate it

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:12.710
when black people do that."
It's meant to be obviously

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:14.900
provocative and racist.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.530
And then what they consider
an extreme slur--

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:20.370
the white person in the room
playing this role uses the

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.380
derogatory word that's meant
to be an extreme slur.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.950
So there's one more thing
you need to know.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:30.750
Now, you're sitting there, and
you're either in the control

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:33.730
group where there's been the
slight bump, or there's been a

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:37.340
moderate slur, or an extreme
slur in their words.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:38.360
The black male returns.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.660
Don't forget, he's in on it,
and so is that white male.

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:41.470
But you're not in on it.

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.680
You just think there was a bump,
and something else may

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.480
have happened, depending on
which condition you're in.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:48.680
And the experimenter then gives
you a survey about how

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.650
you feel right now.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.110
Sort of like the happiness,
but it's not that.

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.860
It's like, how do you
feel right now?

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.720
And then asks you to pick
between those two people a

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.110
partner for an anagram
experiment that

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:01.220
you're about to do.

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.970
So they're going to ask you--

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.770
this is sort of this
question you have.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.810
What's the difference or
similarity between what you

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.650
say you're feeling is and
what you really do?

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.600
Both things are important,
but do they line up, do

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.720
they not line up?

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.300
So here's the results.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.080
Here's a graph.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.690
And here's how this works.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.650
Negative emotional distress the
higher the bar, the more

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.900
you say, I feel really bad about
what's just happened.

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:26.300
I just heard this comment
or no comment.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.000
So let's take a look,
the higher the bar.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.390
If you heard no comment,
here's how you begin.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.800
So let's start with
the forecasters.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.555
All of you are forecasters,
because you're pretending

00:45:35.555 --> 00:45:38.210
you're in the situation
but you're not in it.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:40.250
So here is there was
no comments.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.910
That's sort of average
or something.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.440
And then you said if you
heard a racial slur

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.554
you would feel terrible.

00:45:46.554 --> 00:45:49.920
You would feel terrible.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.480
But look at the other students
who are randomly picked.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.720
So we don't think it's a
difference among students.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.500
Look at these grey bars.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.950
They're pretty flat.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.560
The person on the spot is
somehow not processing this.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.140
And they're filling out,
I feel average.

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.030
You see the split--

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.310
the split between the values
that the person thinks they

00:46:11.310 --> 00:46:14.200
would have, and the values that
are responded to on the

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.370
spot in the moment.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.410
And what we'll talk about later
on in social psychology

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:23.860
is there's a tough gap, often,
between the values we espouse

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.500
and how we act when there's
especially unexpected,

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.900
difficult things.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.340
And very often--

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.130
if you've had any experience
like this-- afterwards, you

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:32.890
go, oh, what I should
have done is this.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.730
Or I wish I would've
said that.

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:37.040
But that moment is not happening
at that moment,

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.250
probably because you're
kind of weirded out

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:38.910
by the whole thing.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:39.670
What's going on?

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.810
Why would the person say this?

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:42.620
Something doesn't seem right.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.330
I can't sort it out.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.900
And so people tend to shrink
in terms of making a strong

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.060
conclusion of what's going on
if something seems unusually

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.140
provocative.

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.010
And you could say, well, OK,
that's their attitudes.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:53.860
But how about their action?

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.670
Who do they pick to
be their partner?

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.340
And again, the people
forecasting said, if I was in

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:04.550
this situation, I would never
pick that racist white person

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.570
to be my partner, because
that person stinks--

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:10.120
if I was in that situation.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.720
But if the people are
in the situation--

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.180
look at the grey bars--

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.440
pretty flat.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.620
It's a if on the spot, in the
moment, they can't quite

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:22.730
process the values they
feel and the action

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:24.130
they're going to take.

00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.260
And we'll talk about that.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.870
And it's very hard, often,
in part, to be brave

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:29.810
and stand up to things.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:31.670
It turns out there's a lot
of evidence for this.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.900
It's a human nature thing.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.090
It's very hard to be brave and
stand up to things when things

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.140
are kind of weird, because
almost everybody at first

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:40.180
thinks, I don't want to
make a fool of myself.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.830
I don't want make trouble.

00:47:41.830 --> 00:47:43.880
Maybe I'm not getting the
whole picture on this.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.080
And we shrink back from acting
in a way that aligns with the

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.900
values that are clearly
shown here.

00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:53.520
So this, again, is something
about human

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:54.610
nature that's very weird.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.260
And it's powerful to come
into social psychology.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.050
And that's why it's very hard
to stand up to things like

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.210
oppression and bias.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:04.240
It's very hard to do, because
we tend to not act on our

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.910
values when we're
in complicated

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.730
situations on the spot.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.920
And there's a tremendous amount
of evidence for that.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.990
So again, how we interpret
the situation--

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.880
very different in our mind when
we imagine we're there,

00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:17.890
and when we actually
sit there.

00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:20.710
And so what these researchers
say is this is partly why it's

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:25.350
been hard to eradicate some
vestiges of stereotypes and

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:29.160
racism, because people have a
hard time clamping down on it

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.410
in the moment.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:35.580
So that's a tough topic, but we
know we want to deal both

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.650
with things that are less
controversial but also things

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.580
that touch people's lives
in the real world

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:41.480
that we live in.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.320
So we talked about a
scientific study

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.490
of the human nature--

00:48:44.490 --> 00:48:45.770
mind and behavior--

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:50.740
how what we see and hear is
determined so much but how our

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.240
mind interprets the world around
us; how we remember

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.330
things like word lists or
stories, that's hugely

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:58.800
influenced by what we expect to
see, like in the picture;

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.670
how we think we know things like
where Reno is compared to

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:04.450
San Francisco; how we think
about things like the

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.990
probability that somebody else
will have the same birthday,

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.150
that somebody else will in a
group; and the relationship

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.390
between how we feel
and how we act.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.530
The very feelings we have are
often disconnected for actions

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.900
in the moment.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.980
And sometimes that has a sort
of a difficult consequence.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.100
And so we'll explore all these
things through the semester,

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.005
all the different facets that we
could possibly get through

00:49:24.005 --> 00:49:26.680
in one semester of what it is to
be human, and where science

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.710
has showed us something about
human nature, the

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:29.960
mind, and the brain.
