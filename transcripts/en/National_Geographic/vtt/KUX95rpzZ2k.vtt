00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.300
The cameras aren't
working, and it's

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.467
getting super frustrating.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.000
This is what it's like
on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.467
The camera's already
down, tough conditions all

00:00:11.467 --> 00:00:14.133
around to film in.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.367
WOMAN 1: No heat, no
power, no anything.

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:19.400
Ah, it won't even turn on.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.834
WOMAN 2: I've fallen
too many times.

00:00:22.834 --> 00:00:24.266
We have bad winds.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:28.033
It's just a typical
day in the Arctic.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.400
MAN: Making best of what we got.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:38.934
BEN MULLIN: The
challenging environment

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:41.100
that we deal with
up here in Alaska

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.333
for getting the cool shots that
you see on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.533
And we're out in the
middle of nowhere.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.300
AGNES HAILSTONE:
Today, Cutin and I

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.166
are gonna be getting some wood.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:52.467
I have a grandbaby coming in.

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:55.600
And I want to try
to keep my grandson

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.767
nice, comfortable, and warm.

00:00:56.767 --> 00:01:00.400
Idi just had a baby,
so she's bringing him

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.734
to meet the rest of the crew.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.600
So this looks like
a pretty good spot

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.934
to launch our drone, which is
one of my personal favorites

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.033
things to do on the show.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:16.133
And shooting drone is super fun.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.333
I love doing it.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.333
But it comes with a bunch
of different challenges

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:22.767
that are hard to overcome,
especially when it's cold.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:24.467
And most of them are
related to the cold.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:28.066
The monitor that
I use is an iPad.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.000
And I use this heating
blanket with a battery

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.600
to keep the iPad warm.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.166
And then when I'm shooting
the drone, because it's cold

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.367
and my hands are
pretty stationary,

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:38.734
and I can't take
them off in the cold

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:41.934
to shove them in my pocket, I
use these fingerless gloves.

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:45.900
You need to have fingertip
dexterity in order

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.233
to do the controls
and especially

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.533
to touch the monitor because
it's a touch screen monitor.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:52.400
I certainly can't be
taking on or off gloves.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.033
And I also can't
have my hands freeze.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:01:57.133
Here are my batteries,
which each have

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:00.300
a hand warmer attached to
them to keep them warm.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.734
I put my monitor in
it's monitor frame.

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:04.867
I'm trying to do
all of this stuff

00:02:04.867 --> 00:02:06.934
as quickly as I
can so that stuff

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:08.433
doesn't start
freezing, literally,

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:09.934
while I'm putting it together.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.900
I bring, believe it or not, it's
a regular, standard bath mat

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.300
that you probably use
in your own bathroom.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.300
It's got a fuzzy side, and
it's got a rubberized side that

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.567
usually goes down on the floor.

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.567
Well, this rubberized side,
it can take off and land

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:23.834
on it with no problems.

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.200
About half the time,
we get to this point,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.567
and the drone just
decides it doesn't

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:29.433
want to fly in
zero-degree temperatures,

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.734
which is what it is today.

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:33.233
So hopefully, it flies, and
we'll get some good shots.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.967
If something does go wrong,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:44.667
And we might not be able
to get another drone.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.033
We can't go down to the corner
store and buy another one

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.033
or get it fixed, even if we have
other technical difficulties.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.600
And so we've just got to
figure it out on the fly.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.867
So the drone itself is a really
amazing and unique device

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:08.567
for us to get really cool
footage for the show,

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:10.533
especially because
the terrain in Alaska

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.367
is so amazing and vast.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:17.667
It really is useful to show
the place of a teeny human

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:19.367
in this giant background.

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.367
Alaska is amazing,
and it doesn't

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:26.867
get any less amazing
from 300 feet in the air.

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:28.567
CROFTON DIACK: Snow tomorrow,
so I'm not sure we're

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:30.000
going to make it into Kavik.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.567
We're going to give
it a hell of a try,

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:32.700
but we're ready for anything.

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:38.233
SUE AIKENS: The
buildings look intact.

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:40.734
I can see some
pretty big tracks.

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:44.934
And also, I'll just
have to walk up.

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:47.033
We're going into Kavik
for the first time.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:49.533
And Sue's been away
for a couple of months.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.533
So it's sort of a big deal.

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:55.100
And we have to figure out,
one, and always first,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.934
the safety of the mission.

00:03:56.934 --> 00:04:00.500
And so we're flying
in with a ski plane.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.500
And we want to document our
arrival and our departure.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.500
So tonight, everybody's
putting cameras up and figuring

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.734
out where to put the camera.

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:11.166
We're trying to
rig up this plane

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:16.300
and put these GoPros on it and
try to figure out our angles.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.567
I'm trying to rig
up a GoPro, trying

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.066
to find a good spot for
it here inside the plane

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:23.300
so that when Sue is traveling,
we get some good shots of her

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.166
and get shots of what
she's flying over.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:28.600
We have to put these little
cameras, these GoPros,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.800
in weird places.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.333
And we can't always see
what's on them, so we have

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:36.734
to connect to it on
a phone to figure

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.000
out just what we're shooting.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.633
All this takes longer than we
think to get the right angle,

00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:46.600
to get the proper little clamp
that the machinist is making.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.633
It's good we came tonight
and got it sorted.

00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:58.967
PILOT: Good, clean snow here.
