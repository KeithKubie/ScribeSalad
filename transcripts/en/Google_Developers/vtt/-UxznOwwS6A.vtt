WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi,
I'm Wayne Piekarski,

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.170
and welcome to Google I/O 2019.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.195
We're here at
Shoreline Amphitheater

00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:15.820
where there's a bunch of really
cool demos and exhibits and fun

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.470
things to do.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.970
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.095
to take you on a live guided
tour of all the really

00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:21.010
cool stuff here.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.220
So, let's go and get started.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.480
Oh wow.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.710
Look.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.800
So you can see all these
augmented reality flowers

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.552
on here.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.050
Oh wow.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.550
Look.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.600
I got augmented reality
glasses and hair.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.245
We got Flutter running on iOS
and Android devices and tablets

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:39.870
and everything.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.495
It looks great.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:42.144
And I got a free snack.

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:44.564
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.080
OK.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.430
Let's try this one here.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.950
What's the temperature outside?

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.610
A perfect day.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.193
Exactly.

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:57.860
It's always like that
at I/O. All right.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.790
Let's go.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.700
Guess I should see what the
latest news is from my bosses

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.200
here.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.867
So it's really cool, because you
can use either a remote control

00:01:04.867 --> 00:01:05.900
or a game controller.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.300
And you can control Android
TV to play games, watch

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.140
YouTube videos, and
see what's going on.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.645
Experiments with Google.

00:01:13.645 --> 00:01:15.020
So what we're
doing here is we've

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.853
got a machine learning
algorithm that's been

00:01:16.853 --> 00:01:18.300
trained with animal sounds.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.240
And the more accurately
you can make them,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.307
the faster your little tractor
drives around the track here.

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:24.140
This is so much fun.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.600
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.010
How was your experiment?

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.580
Awesome.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.080
All right.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.570
So here we're in the
gaming area where

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.880
we're seeing lots of
demos, interesting things.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.380
These are all
targeted at developers

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.888
who actually make games for
Android and web and so forth.

00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:42.180
So there's a lot of really
interesting news and updates

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.040
for them.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.420
But what we should
do now is let's

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.590
go and check out what Stadia
has to offer for a demo.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.400
And let's check it out.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.900
So here we have
Stadia, which allows

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.860
us to play games on the cloud.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.210
So what do we have here?

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.500
SPEAKER 1: This is a developer
tool demo that we have.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.140
So what you see here is
we've taken this 2D image.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.810
And we've trained a machine
learning model offline.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
And we can apply it directly
in the game at runtime.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.780
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Oh, I
want to see it walk around.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.363
Can I play it?

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:09.488
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, of course.

00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:11.238
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: So
this is using Shaders?

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:11.760
Or--

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.802
SPEAKER 1: It's using
machine learning technology

00:02:13.802 --> 00:02:14.520
with Shaders.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.850
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Wow.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.683
This is really cool.

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:16.450
Thanks very much.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.950
All right.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.992
Let's get out of here and
see what else there is.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.890
Watch.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.276
I can do this.

00:02:26.276 --> 00:02:27.740
Oh, come on.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.170
Oh, I can't do this one.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.140
Well, I got something.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.650
This thing is insanely accurate.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.025
All right, you can check out
my poses on the screen here.

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:37.590
Look at this.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.860
What a superstar.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.360
OK.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.240
So this is the Android
Auto area where we have

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.083
Android that runs in vehicles.

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.500
So what we see here is that
we've got actually a head unit

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.510
from a vehicle mounted here.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.460
And then the phone is
projecting onto the screen.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.810
And so the phone can allow
us to run Google Maps,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.732
make phone calls,
play music, whatever.

00:02:56.732 --> 00:02:59.190
It's really neat, because you
can do all the same functions

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.990
from your phone, but you
can do it in a nice head

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.260
unit mounted in your vehicle.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.352
Let's go see if we can get
a sneak peek inside one

00:03:04.352 --> 00:03:05.310
of the cars themselves.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.340
Come on, let's go.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.450
All right.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.307
Here we have an
Android Auto car.

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:12.140
So this is exciting.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.470
So we've got Google Maps.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.770
We've got our phone.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.050
And we can make calls with
it and listen to our music.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.380
So yeah.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.230
Let's get ready to take a drive.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.830
So the Android Auto people
wouldn't let me take their car.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.140
So instead I thought I'd
come over here and try out

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.670
this virtual moped
ride where I get

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.530
to ride through the
streets of Jakarta

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.542
watching a 360 video on these
virtual reality glasses here.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:33.250
It's really cool.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.052
You can do it on a 360 video.

00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:36.510
When you're sitting
on a motorcycle

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.976
it feels so
incredibly realistic.

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:42.510
[GROAN]

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.020
All right.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.430
Well, that was an amazing
whirlwind tour in Jakarta

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.480
on a 360-degree YouTube video.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.710
And this is also a great tour
of the sandboxes at Google I/O

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.308
2019.

00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:54.600
I hope you had as much fun
as I did watching everything

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.840
that's going on here.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.280
And I'll see you next time.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.630
