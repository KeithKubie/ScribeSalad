00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:03.291
(soft music)

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.900
- My name is Andrew Szeri.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.631
I'm dean of the Graduate Division.

00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.113
We're pleased along with
the Graduate Council

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:42.500
to present, Amory Lovins,
this year's speaker

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.253
in the Barbara Weinstock
Memorial Lecture Series.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.340
In 1902, Harris Weinstock,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.810
a well-known businessman
of Sacramento, California,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.570
presented the University
of California with a fund

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.706
to support an annual public
lecture on the morals of trade,

00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:00.833
on behalf of his wife Barbara.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.940
Weinstock was fundamentally committed

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.420
to the economic and moral
progress of humankind.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.099
He wrote many newspaper columns,

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:11.470
and gave numerous lectures on topics

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.921
ranging from Napoleon to socialism.

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:17.260
Inspired by Spencer and Newton's essays

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.690
on the the morals of trade,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.230
which lamented the state of morals

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.690
in the mid 19th century business world

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.740
he argued that a man does not profit

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.653
if he gains the whole
world and loses his soul.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.458
Harris Weinstock hoped
that this lectureship

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.000
would lead to a better life

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.220
for those who spend their
lives in commercial pursuits.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.177
He said, "Let men and women the world over

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:42.957
"worship character rather than wealth.

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.886
"Let them do homage to the
high-minded and pure-minded

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:49.067
"rather than to the
merely rich and powerful,

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.971
"and the ideal age will be at hand

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.903
"when trade will carry
with it the badge of honor,

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:56.525
"and the successful men of
business will take the place

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.728
"hitherto confined to the patriot,

00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:02.444
"and the faithful servant of mankind."

00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:05.090
Past lecturers have included Ralph Nader,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.129
Neil Kinnock, and Nobel
Laureate, Amartya Sen,

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.530
and they have delivered

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.270
the Barbara Weinstock Memorial Lectures

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.963
on the morals of trade.

00:02:14.842 --> 00:02:16.010
Now it's my pleasure

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.930
to welcome to the podium, Karlene Roberts,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.450
chair of the Weinstock
Lectureship Committee

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.143
who will introduce our speaker.

00:02:26.887 --> 00:02:29.137
(applause)

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.870
- Amory Lovins is co-founder,
chair and chief scientist

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.528
of the Rocky Mountain Institute.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:45.870
RMI and Dr. Lovins work
to foster efficient,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.450
and restorative views of resources
to make the world secure,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.740
just prosperous and life sustaining.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.581
He is also active in
creating policy in energy,

00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:00.560
resource environmental development,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.560
and security around the world.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.272
Dr. Lovins has written 29 books
and several hundred papers.

00:03:08.272 --> 00:03:12.600
Among his most recent books
is Winning the Oil Endgame:

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.533
Innovation for Profit, Jobs and Security.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.720
Dr. Lovins dropped out
of Harvard and Oxford,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.060
and then went onto be
awarded doctorate degrees

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.300
from 10 United States and UK universities.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.940
He has receive numerous awards including

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.591
Time Magazine's Hero of
the Planet Award in 2000.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:40.479
In 2007 he received the Blue Planet Prize,

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.116
the Volvo Environmental Prize,

00:03:43.116 --> 00:03:47.230
and the Popular Mechanics
Breakthrough Leadership Award.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.680
It gives me a great deal of pleasure

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.006
to welcome Dr. Lovins to Berkeley.

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.256
(applause)

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.373
- Thank you, and thanks to
those who made today possible.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.590
I was thinking about the morals of trade,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.820
and how trade typically occurs

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.580
within the context of capitalism,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.260
so it seemed a natural opportunity

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.980
to introduce a new way of doing business

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.330
as if nature, and people
were properly valued,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.330
but without needing to
determine or signal their value.

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.540
Capitalism is conventionally defined

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.081
as the productive use of
and reinvestment in capital,

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:43.210
but what's capital?

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.450
Normally, we only talk about four kinds,

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.710
and industrial capitalism
only deals seriously with two,

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.210
namely, money and goods,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.950
but there are two other
kinds that are more valuable

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.640
that it typically ignores
and often just liquidates,

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.292
namely people and nature.

00:05:01.292 --> 00:05:04.157
Of course, without people
there's no economy,

00:05:04.157 --> 00:05:06.880
and without nature there are no people,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.693
so this is a material omission.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.920
It turns out if you play with a full deck,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.110
and you productively

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.840
use and reinvest in all four
kinds of capital not just two,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.043
you make more money, have
more fun, and do more good.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.960
Now when our co-author of
the book Natural Capitalism

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.593
in '99 chose that title,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.913
Paul Hawken,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.890
I think he had in mind

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.210
not just that this is a form of capitalism

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.910
that takes natural capital seriously,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.590
not just physical and financial,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.910
but, also, that capitalism
as we know it today,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.280
and as we see daily

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.010
illustrated in the headlines is unnatural,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.810
is a temporary aberration

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.575
not because it's capitalist,

00:06:01.575 --> 00:06:06.130
but because it liquidates
and doesn't value

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.210
its most valuable forms of capital,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.250
and, therefore, violates its own precepts.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.183
It's internally inconsistent.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.830
The value of the ecosystem services

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.060
we get for free from
nature becomes obvious

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.250
whenever something like
Katrina comes around

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.853
the ability to stabilize
climate is an important service,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.770
the ability to recycle nutrients,

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.130
to metabolize wastes,

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.840
to neutralize toxins,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.695
and we don't know how
to do any of that stuff,

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:47.944
although, we have a little
idea how to pollinate.

00:06:47.944 --> 00:06:49.710
You will find, though,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.840
if you try hand pollinating the planet

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.250
it quickly becomes tedious, though,

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.033
it's nice to have all these
little helpers when we do.

00:07:02.847 --> 00:07:07.847
If we lack these services we
feel the lack very acutely,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.430
and perhaps at our peril.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.220
In fact, as ecosystems
everywhere come under stress

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.160
the limits to the human
prospect are increasingly set

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.791
not by how many fish there are, excuse me,

00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:25.110
not by how many boats and nets we have,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.960
but by how many fish are in the sea.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.200
Not by chainsaws, but by forests.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.163
Not by irrigation pumps,
but by fertile land.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.000
Now this sort of scarcity

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.210
imposing constraint is not new.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.640
In fact, it was the basis of
the first Industrial Revolution

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.130
when to oversimplify a bit

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.800
there weren't enough
weavers to make enough cloth

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.100
for most people to afford,

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.970
but if you had come into
parliament around 1750,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.870
and said, oh, don't worry,
I have a solution to that

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.310
we'll just make weavers
100 times more productive

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.330
nobody would have understood the concept,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.133
let alone thought it was possible,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.970
but it did happen when
profit maximizing capitalists

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.030
supported technological
innovators and vice versa,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:20.980
and soon a Lancashire spinner
could produce the cloth

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.483
that had previously
required about 200 weavers,

00:08:26.184 --> 00:08:27.990
not just in textiles,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.360
but spreading throughout the economy

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.110
we had this proliferation
of affordable mass goods,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.050
purchasing power, middle class,

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:40.080
all the artifacts that we see around us,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.231
and identify as the hallmarks

00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:45.890
of an advanced industrial civilization.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.700
Now the logic of that
Industrial Revolution

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.100
was very clear and correct that at a time

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.315
when a relative scarcity of
people was limiting progress

00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:59.289
in exploiting seemingly boundless nature

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.440
the obvious solution was to make people

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.750
100 times more productive and we did.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.140
Economics is good at this

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.020
it teaches to economize
on our scarcest resource,

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.800
but as Herman Daly points out,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.103
although the logic
remains perennially true

00:09:16.103 --> 00:09:19.790
the pattern of scarcity
has quietly reversed.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.550
In the next Industrial Revolution
now getting well underway

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.590
we have abundant people and scarce nature,

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.420
not the other way around,

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.100
so now it's no longer people,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.810
but nature that we need to be using

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.310
four, 10, 100 times more productivity

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.380
bringing far more work out of the energy,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.010
water, minerals, topsoil,

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.993
everything we borrow from the planet.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.600
So that radical increase
in resource productivity

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.793
is the first of four
interlinked principles

00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:54.665
of operating as a natural capitalist,

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:58.250
but there are three others
also very important.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.410
One is to make things the way nature does

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.443
to produce in closed loops with
no waste, with no toxicity.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:09.560
Then there's a principle about

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.410
adopting a business model

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.880
that rewards the first
two shifts by rewarding

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.282
both the customer and the
provider for the same thing

00:10:19.282 --> 00:10:21.930
as I'll describe later.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.040
Then what do you do with
the resulting profits

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.520
from getting rid of all this waste?

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.780
Well, how about
reinvesting it productively

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.213
into the kind of capital we're
shortest of namely nature.

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:37.710
I want to dwell on each of these,

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.660
but emphasize mainly the first one

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.903
is the easiest to get started with.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.550
Since many of the world's
tensions and problems

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.031
come from actual or perceived scarcity

00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:52.190
it would be a really good idea

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.563
to create abundance by design.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.403
Now just a word, though, about
how this relates to trade.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.091
There has been a longstanding argument

00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:08.321
as globalization has
initially gained force

00:11:08.321 --> 00:11:12.650
that increased trade lifts all boats,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.290
and this might be true if
we only were talking about

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.923
financial and physical capital,

00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:22.570
but, actually,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.490
since true wealth comes
from productively using,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:28.660
and reinvesting in four kinds of capital,

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.660
not just two we have to pay
attention to all four of them,

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.168
and it turns out that people and nature

00:11:36.168 --> 00:11:38.762
have very different trade attributes

00:11:38.762 --> 00:11:42.410
then the relatively portable and fungible

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.783
capital of goods and money.

00:11:48.288 --> 00:11:52.433
Therefore, the ideology
of trade is incomplete.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.470
Trade in money and goods
can increase wealth,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.780
although, whether it does so equitably

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.963
depends on the policy framework.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.730
Trade, however, does
not necessarily enhance,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.050
and may degrade human and natural capital

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.670
because people are rooted
in a place, in a culture.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.936
Nature is rooted in a place in a biome,

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:22.178
and if you try to move them around

00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:25.543
you may degrade them or even destroy them.

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:30.340
So I think what are commonly regarded as

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.326
the labor and environmental issues

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:38.290
in the globalization controversy
simply reflect the absence

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.641
of two of the four forms of capital

00:12:40.641 --> 00:12:43.660
from the ideology of trade.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.420
If we're going to be good capitalists,

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.590
and try to create wealth
by productively using,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.840
and reinvesting in capital

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.969
we're going to have to pay attention

00:12:52.969 --> 00:12:55.201
to all four kinds of capital,

00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:59.790
and to differentiate their
divergent trade attributes.

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.480
It's a very simple idea,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.653
but one that one doesn't
often hear expressed.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.760
Now let me dig a bit into
initially the first principle

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.423
of natural capitalism radical
resource productivity.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.200
Since I usually talk about energy

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.550
let's go to materials instead.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.510
It turns out that the flow of stuff

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.700
that we extract from the planet,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.590
and process, move around,
use and throw away

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.730
is about 20 times your body weight

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.470
per person per day in this country,

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.570
and not very different in
other industrial countries.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.680
That only counts the flow
of water returned dirty,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.513
not water returned clean.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.689
It's a huge mass flow very
destructive to the planet,

00:13:48.689 --> 00:13:53.689
and one way of thinking about
it is if you scale it globally

00:13:54.234 --> 00:13:57.947
it's getting on for a
half trillion tons a year

00:13:57.947 --> 00:13:59.730
of stuff moving around,

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.940
and yet only one percent of it

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.750
actually ends up in durable products,

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.453
and is still there six months later,

00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:12.480
so what's the other 99 percent?

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.520
It's waste, also known as a
vast business opportunity,

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.723
more on that later.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.400
Energy is similar we've saved
well over $400 billion a year

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.320
by reducing energy intensity
in the past 30 years or so,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:33.320
but we're still wasting nearly
that much just, for example,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.920
the efficiency of converting
fuel at a power plant

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.950
into incandescent light in the
room is about three percent.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.320
The power plant waste
heat that we throw away

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.020
is more energy than Japan
uses for everything,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.963
or about 2/3 of what
China uses for everything.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.130
China actually has purchasing power parity

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.788
on the order of nine times
the energy intensity of Japan,

00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:01.730
which is not even a
tenth as energy-efficient

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.010
as the laws of physics permit,

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.020
but in practice Japanese
government recently found ways

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:12.020
to triple Japanese energy
efficiency at a profit,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.200
and that's without counting
most of the efficiency tricks

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.050
that I'll sketch for you in a minute.

00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:21.288
We have very well-known ways

00:15:21.288 --> 00:15:25.910
to make old buildings several
fold more energy efficient,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.220
new buildings in order of
magnitude more efficient,

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.630
but typically at lower cost.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:32.873
We give you a few little examples.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.380
I'll do this in written metric units,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.453
and spoken Burmese units in
case anybody needs those.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.640
You know, we're moving
toward the metric system

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.223
inch by inch in this country.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.239
So let's go to my house and
indoor farm and research center

00:15:55.239 --> 00:15:58.310
near Aspen in the Colorado Rockies

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.260
where it can go to -47F on occasion,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.210
at 7,100 feet elevation.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.210
You can get frost any day of the year.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.455
You can get 39 days of
continuous midwinter cloud,

00:16:10.455 --> 00:16:14.560
and yet if you come in
out of the snowstorm

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.530
to the central atrium there
you are in the banana jungle

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.777
where I've so far harvested
28 crops with no furnace.

00:16:22.777 --> 00:16:24.120
Why don't I have a furnace?

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.720
Well, I didn't need one,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:30.186
and it was cheaper upfront
not to put one in, huh?

00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:33.804
Well, if you ask most engineers,

00:16:33.804 --> 00:16:36.847
or look at any engineering textbook

00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:40.570
you'll find that the
right amount of insulation

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.830
to use in your house

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.100
is supposedly the amount
that will pay for itself

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.870
over the years from
the saved heating bill,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.990
which sounds perfectly reasonable.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.390
You don't want to pay more
than it's worth do you?

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.780
But this is methodologically
wrong because it leaves out,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.910
among other things the capital
cost of the heating system,

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:05.406
and it turned out it was
1,100 bucks cheaper upfront

00:17:05.406 --> 00:17:07.870
not to have a heating system,

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.220
but to put in so much insulation
and such good windows,

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.877
and ventilation and
heating recovery and so on

00:17:12.877 --> 00:17:15.570
that I wouldn't need a heating system.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:19.792
I then took the saved
$1,100 in 1983 or so,

00:17:19.792 --> 00:17:24.792
and invested that plus
another $7,100 so $6,000 net,

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:27.860
$1.50 a square foot,

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:32.010
to save, also, 99 percent
of the water heating energy,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.820
half the water, 90 percent
of the household electricity,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.420
which would cost five bucks a month

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.322
if I didn't make it with solar,

00:17:39.322 --> 00:17:41.560
and all of those savings together

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.150
paid for themselves in 10
months with 1983 technology.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.200
Today we can do a lot better and cheaper.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:53.210
Let's try Davis, California,
where it goes to 113,

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:57.530
and later we did the
same at 115 Fahrenheit

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.580
in Stanford Ranch.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.130
Here's an ordinary looking tract house

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.661
with the obligatory stupid dark roof,

00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:07.113
and the big garage in front
that says cars live here.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.745
As part of PG&amp;E's ACT2 experiment

00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:16.770
that Art Rosenfeld, and
I, and Ralph Cavanagh,

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:21.690
and Carl Weinberg cooked
up this was one of about,

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.690
oh, nine or so experimental projects done

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.240
showing that if this house
were built in quantity

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.780
not as a one-off experiment

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:33.680
it would cost about $1,800
less than normal to build,

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.790
$1,600 less present value to maintain

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.980
because it has no heating
or cooling equipment,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.130
and yet it is comfortable

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.120
with no air-conditioner at up to 115,

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.367
and it's designed to use
about a fifth of the energy

00:18:49.367 --> 00:18:52.089
then allowed by the strictest
code in the country,

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:56.526
and a tenth of the normal U.S. amount,

00:18:56.526 --> 00:18:59.316
or here's a house in steamy Bangkok

00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:01.850
that provides superior comfort

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:04.450
with a tenth of normal
air-conditioning energy,

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.983
and has exactly normal construction cost.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.880
Now I've used houses for my example both

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.980
because they're familiar,

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.291
and because they have a
big surface to volume ratio

00:19:14.291 --> 00:19:17.460
which makes it difficult
to stay comfortable inside

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.400
while it's having such
a huge range outside,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.940
a range spanning the extent
of the earth's climate

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.521
pretty much at least where anybody lives,

00:19:27.521 --> 00:19:31.410
and yet these houses
all tell the same story

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.630
that if you optimize the house as a system

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.610
you can make very large
energy savings cheaper

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.733
than small or no savings.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.232
This goes against an economic dogma

00:19:44.232 --> 00:19:47.960
called diminishing returns
which says that in general

00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:52.560
as you save more of a resource

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.810
the cost of the next unit of savings

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.880
goes up more and more steeply

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.270
until it gets too expensive
and you have to stop.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:04.800
Well, some components like
insulation work that way.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.007
Some others like motors don't
or pumps or rooftop chillers,

00:20:09.007 --> 00:20:11.709
but what's really interesting

00:20:11.709 --> 00:20:15.296
is when you put the
pieces together properly

00:20:15.296 --> 00:20:17.220
something quite different happens.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.260
A different part of the curve pops up.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.010
As I add more insulation
to my house in the Rockies

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.260
at first I experienced diminishing returns

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.467
because that's how insulation works,

00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:30.086
but if I add so much of
it that I no longer need

00:20:30.086 --> 00:20:32.903
the furnace, pipes, pumps, ducts,

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.950
fans, wires, controls and
fuel supply arrangements

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.758
then the cost comes down
even more $1,100 cheaper

00:20:41.758 --> 00:20:43.970
then if I set out to
save little or nothing,

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.790
and yet I'm saving 99 percent
of the heating energy,

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.160
and why should I get
there the long way around

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.120
when I can tunnel through the cost barrier

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:55.266
directly to this design
destination by asking

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:57.560
is there a sensible way
to design this house

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.130
with no mechanical systems?

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.960
Well, as usual there is,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.163
so we just go straight for the prize.

00:21:04.653 --> 00:21:07.490
By the way, if you want
to know how to do this

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:10.226
please visit RMI.org/Stanford

00:21:10.226 --> 00:21:14.560
where you'll find my five
public lectures of March 2007

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.011
on how to do this sort of thing,

00:21:16.011 --> 00:21:18.400
this tunneling through the cost barrier

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.910
in buildings, industry, and transport.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.995
The same thinking applies in industry.

00:21:25.995 --> 00:21:28.300
I'll do a motor example

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:31.366
because they use 3/5 of
the world's electricity,

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:33.080
and a pumping example

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.158
because that's the biggest use of motors.

00:21:36.158 --> 00:21:40.180
In fact, half of motor
energy goes to pumps and fans

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.210
which have the same physics,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.230
and we needed a pumping loop to move some

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:48.557
heat transfer oil around it in a circle,

00:21:48.557 --> 00:21:51.870
and the system had been optimized to use

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:54.730
95 horsepower pumping power,

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:57.630
but a Dutch colleague with
some ideas we brought in

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.730
was able to cut it to seven horsepower

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.100
that is 92 percent less.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.390
It worked better, it cost less to build

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.760
not because of changes
in the pumps, controls,

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.966
or process, or motors,

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:15.540
but because of two changes
in the design mentality

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:18.170
so we ended up using
fat short straight pipes

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.750
instead of skinny long crooked pipes.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.660
This is not rocked science.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.540
This is good Victorian
engineering rediscovered.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.860
Then we found we'd messed
up we left seven or eight

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.870
benefits out that we should have counted,

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.780
and if we'd counted them

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.785
we would have saved more like 98 percent,

00:22:36.785 --> 00:22:38.530
and it would have cost even less,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.600
so sorry we left a
factor four on the table

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.420
we'll do better next time.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.933
If you apply this sort
of integrative design

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:49.240
across all uses you end
up saving at least 3/4

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.160
of all the electricity in the country,

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.530
cheaper than just running
a coal or nuclear plant

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.930
even if building it costs nothing,

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.620
and we know that from just looking at

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.540
the measured cost and performance data

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.790
of about 1,000 technologies
for saving electricity.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:06.010
An important principle,

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.176
which we also have not
found in the textbooks

00:23:08.176 --> 00:23:11.560
is to start your savings downstream.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:16.560
I can feed here 100 units
of coal into a power plant,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.910
lose about 2/3 of the energy on the way,

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.940
lose more on the grid,

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.900
and there are all these compounding losses

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.722
going through the motor
and pumping system,

00:23:23.722 --> 00:23:25.757
and only a tenth of my initial fuel

00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:29.140
actually comes out as flow.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.300
Turn it around backwards and
every unit of flow or friction

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.104
I can save downstream in
the pipe will save 10 units

00:23:37.104 --> 00:23:41.700
of fuel, cost, pollution
and global weirding

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.760
back at the power plant,

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.970
and it will also make
my upstream equipment

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.870
smaller, simpler and cheaper,

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.815
so I'll save the most energy
and the most capital cost

00:23:50.815 --> 00:23:54.233
by starting my savings
all the way downstream,

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.210
and it's often surprisingly simple.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:01.239
Often in a building or a
factory we see a big pump

00:24:01.239 --> 00:24:04.230
that's designed to send
something up a pipe.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:08.220
Next to it is an identical
in place spare pump,

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.840
or a helper pump and
they're drawn like this,

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.690
and then they're built like this,

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.690
so all the time the flow has to go through

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:19.070
two right angle bends
and usually two valves.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.690
Why don't we plumb it this way
so it goes through no bends,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.610
less friction, and no
valves, or one valve?

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.269
Well, because we don't
normally do it that way,

00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:31.537
but, you know, if you
tell the pipe fitters

00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:35.890
to lay out the supply pipes
as if they were drains

00:24:36.854 --> 00:24:39.340
there's another part of
their brain that knows

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.680
that if drains have bends they clog,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.680
and then you end up with
this kind of plumbing.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.207
Peter Rumsey did this one right
here at the Oakland Museum,

00:24:48.207 --> 00:24:52.620
and he was able to save 3/4 of the energy

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.594
used to pump the condenser
water with these wye bends,

00:24:55.594 --> 00:24:59.170
and big pipes and small pumps

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:03.070
instead of small pipes and
big pumps, add a sweep bend,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.270
and imagine a pipe running
diagonally through the air

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.360
what awful workmanship, you know,

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.470
pipes are supposed to
be at neat right angles.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.730
Well, if it looks pretty
it won't save money.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.840
Actually, in this case he
also eliminated 15 pumps

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.710
that will never again waste
energy and maintenance.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.153
Nega-pumps are a good kind.

00:25:22.026 --> 00:25:25.510
Now we've been applying
these principles lately

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.510
in over $30 billion worth
of redesigns in 29 sectors.

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:33.170
We typically have found about

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.255
30 to 60 percent energy savings

00:25:35.255 --> 00:25:38.470
fixing up old factories and so on

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.280
with two or three year typical paybacks.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.810
In new ones we save more,

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.070
typically more like 40 to 90 percent,

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.356
and the capital cost
almost always goes down

00:25:48.356 --> 00:25:53.350
tunneling through the cost
barrier in a replicable way.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:57.170
Of course, these kinds of
results wouldn't be possible

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:58.922
if the systems had been designed properly

00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:00.190
in the first place,

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.350
and I'm getting pretty
tired of redesigning stuff

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.581
that wasn't designed right

00:26:03.581 --> 00:26:06.740
so we're hatching a plot
for the nonviolent overthrow

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:10.664
of bad engineering called
10XE: Factor Ten Engineering,

00:26:10.664 --> 00:26:15.664
and we are on the prowl for
great cases and practitioners

00:26:16.209 --> 00:26:20.090
to add to next summers
casebook writing project.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.310
Just as a few examples
to give you the flavor

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.802
there are 35 things you
can do to motor systems

00:26:24.802 --> 00:26:27.600
to save about half their energy

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.160
without counting the downstream
pump, pipe and so on,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.543
stuff you should do first.

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.810
The reason you get your money back

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.680
at about a year from this retrofit

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.795
is you only pay for seven
of the improvements.

00:26:38.795 --> 00:26:41.930
The other 28 are free byproducts.

00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.710
We've gotten similarly fast
paybacks saving often upwards

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.820
of half the energy used
to make chilled water,

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.834
and clean air in chip-fabs.

00:26:50.834 --> 00:26:55.834
We showed how to retrofit for
a 42 percent energy saving

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.663
in the most efficient refinery in Europe

00:26:58.663 --> 00:27:01.830
with an excellent payback.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.190
Similarly how to save half the electricity

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.570
used on a North Sea oil platform,

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.550
and get the other half from
stuff they're throwing away.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.710
43 percent savings in the
world's biggest platinum mine

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:15.010
with a three year payback.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.518
Then when it gets into new
stuff just for example,

00:27:17.518 --> 00:27:20.516
the famous Texas Instruments Fab

00:27:20.516 --> 00:27:23.900
was built in Richardson,
Texas not in China

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.260
because they're able
to cut out 30 percent,

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.232
or $230 million of capital cost together

00:27:30.232 --> 00:27:32.900
while saving a good deal
of energy and water.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.170
By the way, the two biggest
energy saving measures

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.390
were deferred for the next plant

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.678
that's why we only saved a fifth,

00:27:38.678 --> 00:27:40.600
but our latest fab design saves about

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.120
2/3 of the electricity
and half the capital cost,

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.913
and eliminates all
22,000 tons of chillers.

00:27:48.057 --> 00:27:51.660
about a billion dollar saving
on a big gas-to-liquids plant

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.810
saving over 60 percent
of the energy in carbon.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:56.712
Depending on what you start
with a new supermarket

00:27:56.712 --> 00:27:59.770
should save about 70 to 90
percent, probably gets cheaper.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.199
You certainly get better
merchandising and food safety.

00:28:03.199 --> 00:28:05.840
Besides normal stuff in a chemical plant

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.682
we had a fun example recently with NREL

00:28:08.682 --> 00:28:12.043
showing how to take a corn
stove or ethanol plant

00:28:12.043 --> 00:28:14.380
supposedly good new design,

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.220
and save half the steam and
60 percent of the electricity,

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.800
and 30 percent of the capital cost.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.810
Normally in a new big office
building we expect to save

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.827
about 80 or 90 percent of the energy,

00:28:24.827 --> 00:28:27.660
and a few percent of the capital cost.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.370
One of my favorite cases is

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:34.400
a big 200,000 square foot

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.610
curtain wall office building near Chicago,

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.490
so it's both hot and cold,

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.030
and if you retrofit it at the time

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.120
when in any case you're
replacing the glazing

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.090
whose edge seals have
failed after 20 years

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:51.750
you can put in super windows

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.140
that are about perfect in
letting in light without heat,

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.760
deep day lighting, efficient lights,

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:57.930
efficient office equipment,

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:00.590
and save 3/4 of the peak cooling load.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.990
Then you can take the mechanical system

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.160
the air-conditioners that you need

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:09.840
to replace anyway for agent CFCs,

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.450
and make them four times more efficient

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.450
while you're making
them four times smaller,

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.240
and save enough money on the downsizing

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.850
to pay for everything else,

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:22.395
so you end up saving 3/4 of the energy

00:29:22.395 --> 00:29:24.730
at a slightly lower cost

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.760
than the regular 20 year
renovation that saves nothing

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.913
just by coordinating with
stuff you're gonna do anyway.

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.730
How does this all apply to saving oil?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.880
Well, four years ago my team published

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.350
an independent study nobody's arguing with

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:44.300
co-sponsored mainly by the Pentagon called

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.770
Winning the Oil Endgame

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.720
written for business and military leaders,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.760
and built around competitive

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.180
strategy business cases for five sectors.

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:56.191
You can get it all free at
our Oil Endgame website.

00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:59.930
It's a roadmap for getting
the U.S. completely off oil

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:04.920
by the 2040s led by business for-profit,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.600
and with a much stronger economy.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.977
The transition could
look something like this.

00:30:09.977 --> 00:30:12.040
The oil use and oil imports

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.490
instead of heading steeply
toward the northeast corner,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.500
as usually projected,

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.831
could be turned down
along these green curves

00:30:18.831 --> 00:30:22.663
by redoubling the efficiency of using oil.

00:30:22.663 --> 00:30:25.600
We've already more than
doubled it since 1975.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.620
We can double it again
and the average cost

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:32.620
of saving a barrel is
about $12 in your $2,000.

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:36.750
Then we could go down more
steeply along the blue curves

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.173
by replacing the other half of the oil

00:30:39.173 --> 00:30:44.173
with a mixture of saved natural
gas and advanced biofuels

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.167
unrelated to the food system

00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:49.118
at an average cost of 18 bucks a barrel,

00:30:49.118 --> 00:30:53.466
so let's see the average
of 12 and 18 is 15,

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:55.860
so I don't really care
what the oil price does

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.287
this is all still going to
make sense and make money.

00:30:58.287 --> 00:31:01.010
Actually, we know it works in principle

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:02.480
because we did it once before.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.370
Notice what happened back here.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:05.370
That was the last time

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:10.000
our country paid attention
to oil 1977 to '85.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.970
In those eight years GDP grew 27 percent,

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.270
oil use went down 17 percent,

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.410
oil imports fell by half,

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:22.077
imports from the Persian
Gulf fell 87 percent,

00:31:22.077 --> 00:31:23.140
and they would have been gone

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.355
in one more year if we'd continued.

00:31:25.355 --> 00:31:29.740
Indeed, OPEC's exports
were slashed by half,

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.540
and it broke their
pricing power for a decade

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.370
because we customers,
especially, in America,

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.500
the Saudi Arabia of nega-barrels

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.353
we had more market power
than the supply cartel

00:31:40.353 --> 00:31:44.300
because we could save oil faster

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.260
than they could
conveniently sell less oil.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.050
Much the same seems to be happening

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.241
in the market at this moment.

00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:55.300
Well, that was then, this
is now, you are here,

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.130
and after this practice run, of course,

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.930
we could rerun that old play
all over again a lot better,

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.480
but let's be more ambitious.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.311
Suppose that we invest about $180 billion

00:32:05.311 --> 00:32:09.610
half of it to retool the car,
truck, and plane industries,

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:12.194
which seem to need it.

00:32:12.194 --> 00:32:16.290
Half of it to build a
modern biofuels industry

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.670
that will actually increase

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.003
agricultural and forest sustainability,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.784
and suppose that this was so successful

00:32:27.784 --> 00:32:31.510
that it crashed the oil price
back to 26 bucks a barrel,

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:33.902
which was the official forecast for 2025

00:32:33.902 --> 00:32:36.610
when we did this study four years ago.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.760
Well, against $26 oil that
$180 billion investment

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.500
would yield a gross return
of $155 billion a year,

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.270
a net return of $70 billion a
year, a very handsome return.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.180
As a free byproduct we'd save a quarter

00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:52.571
of the carbon emissions,

00:32:52.571 --> 00:32:55.794
and we would create a million new jobs,

00:32:55.794 --> 00:32:58.870
3/4 of them in rural
and small town America,

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.136
and we would get to save a million jobs

00:33:01.136 --> 00:33:04.586
now palpably at risk,
mainly in the car industry,

00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:07.442
where we need to decide
whether we're going to

00:33:07.442 --> 00:33:11.240
continue importing efficient
cars to replace oil,

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.490
or make efficient cars,

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.930
and import neither the oil nor the cars

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.400
that somehow sounds smarter,

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.890
and because the spread
between the $15 average cost

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.900
of saving or displacing
a barrel by these means,

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.670
and whatever the price is is
such an enormous incentive

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:33.372
that can go to the solution providers

00:33:33.372 --> 00:33:36.931
the business logic is very compelling,

00:33:36.931 --> 00:33:41.931
although, we do propose some
innovative public policies

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.300
in the book that can support,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.950
and not distort that business logic

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.920
it's really driven by business for profit,

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:52.150
and implementation,
therefore, does not require

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:57.050
new fuel taxes, subsidies,
mandates, new federal laws,

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.570
or anything else that either party

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.663
doesn't like or could mess up.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.260
Technologically, the key
is, of course, transport.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:09.240
Buildings and industry have
similarly big opportunities

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.420
for 30 percent of the oil that they use,

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.940
but 70 percent moves things around,

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.180
and it turns out there's a common recipe

00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.030
for making cars, trucks and planes

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.480
three times more efficient
with improved safety,

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.220
and no compromise of
comfort or performance

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:29.040
by making them lighter, more slippery,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.630
and moving through the
air and along the road,

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:32.880
and giving them advanced propulsion.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.960
So it's equivalent, for
example, in cars to being able

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.833
to buy gasoline for 57 cents a gallon,

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.313
even cheaper for truck diesel and Jet A.

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:47.641
Often with improved
performance, for example,

00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:52.168
this diesel hybrid sports car from Opel

00:34:52.168 --> 00:34:57.168
can get 155 miles an hour
and 94 miles a gallon,

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.803
although, not at the same instant.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.410
The surprise to many is that

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.150
the ultra lighting that
doubles the efficiency

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:08.320
of these carbon fiber concept cars

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.310
does not increase their production cost

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:16.090
because the lighter more
exotic materials are paid for

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:17.967
by simpler automaking,

00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:21.971
and a smaller, two or threefold
smaller propulsion system.

00:35:21.971 --> 00:35:24.330
To understand how this works

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:27.083
you just need to think
about the physics of a car,

00:35:27.083 --> 00:35:31.160
which typically uses every day
about 100 times it's weight

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.220
in ancient plants very
inefficiently converted into oil.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:37.040
Where does that energy go?

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.880
Well, once you put your
gasoline in the tank,

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.260
7/8 of its energy never
gets to the wheels.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.480
It's lost first in the engine, idling,

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.900
drive line and accessories.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.834
Of the 1/8 that reaches the wheels

00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:50.450
half of that either
heats the tires and road,

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.020
or heats the air that
the car pushes aside,

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.680
and only the last six percent
actually accelerates the car,

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.530
and then heats the brakes when you stop,

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.940
but since only a 20th of the mass

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.088
you're accelerating is you,

00:36:05.088 --> 00:36:08.170
19/20 is the heavy steel car,

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.500
only five percent of that six percent,

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.440
or 0.3 percent of the fuel energy

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.380
ends up moving the driver.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.710
After 120 some years of
devoted engineering effort

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.750
this is not very gratifying.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.490
However, the good news is
that 3/4 of the energy needed

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.130
to move the car is caused by its weight,

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.580
and every unit of energy
we can save at the wheels

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.690
saves an additional seven units.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.650
We don't need to waste
getting it to the wheel,

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.370
so there's huge leverage

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.620
in making the car
radically lighter weight,

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.584
whether through aluminum
or ultra light steel,

00:36:44.584 --> 00:36:46.760
or carbon fiber composites,

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.132
which is what we used eight years ago

00:36:50.132 --> 00:36:54.790
with a couple of European
tier one firms to design

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.001
this uncompromised mid-sized
suburban assault vehicle

00:36:58.001 --> 00:37:02.217
that will take five adults in comfort,

00:37:02.217 --> 00:37:05.310
69 cubic feet of cargo.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.130
It can carry a half-ton
up of 44 percent grade.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.940
It has quite brisk acceleration,

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:13.550
zero to 60 in seven or eight seconds,

00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:16.910
and it gets about 114
miles a gallon on hydrogen,

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.983
or 67 with a Prius like gasoline hybrid

00:37:19.983 --> 00:37:24.560
whose extra sticker price in mid-volume

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.577
would be about 2-1/2 thousand dollars,

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:28.530
and that extra is because it's hybrid,

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.843
not because it's ultralight
that part is free.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.790
The reason we know what it
would cost is we put out

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:37.110
almost a 500 line item bill of materials

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.880
to anonymous bid by the supply chain.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.380
Now the reason that the costlier materials

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.480
don't increase production
cost shows up here.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.701
There are only 14 parts in that SUV body,

00:37:49.701 --> 00:37:51.660
and you notice they're suspended

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:52.990
from rings like an air frame

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.570
rather than built up from a tub,

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:58.266
which is our horse and buggy
legacy in the car business.

00:37:58.266 --> 00:38:00.883
Each of these 14 parts can be lifted

00:38:00.883 --> 00:38:02.800
with one hand and no hoist.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.490
In fact, the biggest part on the side here

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:07.010
I can briefly lift with one finger.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:12.010
Each of the parts is made
with one low pressure die set.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:16.114
Now a steel SUV has 10 or 20
times more parts than this

00:38:16.114 --> 00:38:19.480
each made with an average
of four progressive

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.220
steel stamping die sets,
a billion dollars worth,

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.550
a football field worth full of tooling,

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.853
and we just saved about 99
percent of that tooling cost.

00:38:32.028 --> 00:38:34.700
Then these plastic parts snap together

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.480
like a kid's toy for bonding

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.773
without needing the
jigs, robots, and welders

00:38:38.773 --> 00:38:40.850
of the body shop,

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.410
and if we lay color in the mold

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:43.760
there's no paint shop either.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.920
Those are the two hardest
and costliest parts

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.390
of making the car,

00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:51.050
so at least 2/5 of the
capital intensity went away

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.490
compared to the leanest
plant in the industry.

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:56.880
I brought along my carbon cap today.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.520
This is a few year old test
piece for some military helmets

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.080
being shipped by a little company

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.993
I used to chair that we spun off.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.160
You can tell from the sound,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.123
and we can pass this around
as long as I get it back.

00:39:15.481 --> 00:39:18.960
Don't worry about dropping it
it's tougher than titanium.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.650
You can tell from the sound that plastics

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.673
have really changed since The Graduate.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.760
If you make cars and
trucks out of this stuff

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:32.010
half the weight and half
the fuel use go away.

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.060
It gets safer because this can absorb

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.470
12 times as much crash
energy per pound as steel,

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.630
and yet the car costs the same to make

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.050
for the reason I described here,

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:43.643
and because the powertrain
is three times smaller,

00:39:44.793 --> 00:39:47.700
so it's nice that we now have technology

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.320
that when matured and
scaled makes it possible

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.112
to make these advanced
composite structures

00:39:53.112 --> 00:39:55.000
with aerospace performance,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.040
but automotive cost and speed.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.560
It's just like finding a
Saudi Arabia under Detroit,

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.710
so my wildcatters have been busy drilling

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.783
this really prospective play
in the Detroit formation.

00:40:07.808 --> 00:40:12.323
Altogether we found over
14 million barrels a day

00:40:12.323 --> 00:40:16.380
of nega-barrels in the U.S. economy

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.990
at 12 bucks a barrel,

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.010
so, gee, if you go to
the ends of the Earth

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.620
to drill for very expensive oil

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.930
that might not even be there,

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.610
and somebody else found all
that cheap oil under Detroit

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:32.330
wouldn't you be embarrassed
and maybe bankrupt?

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.310
So let's drill the most
prospective place first.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.130
We were just drilling
in all the wrong places.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.309
Lest you think this is fanciful

00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:44.440
here's a concept car that Toyota showed

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.700
a year and two days ago called the 1/X.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.810
Why do they call it that?

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:53.530
Well, because it has the
interior volume of the Prius,

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:57.490
but 1/2 the fuel use and 1/3 the weight.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.790
In fact, if you take out the
20 kilos of extra batteries

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.970
that make it a plug-in hybrid

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:07.320
then it has exactly the
same curb weight 400 kilos

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.560
that I suggested in '91,

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:13.140
a good four-seat carbon car should have

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.960
to much polarity from the
industry as you can imagine.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.252
This is so light that the
little half liter engine

00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:22.391
tucks under the rear seat.

00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:25.990
Now this concept car like most,

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.890
might be dismissed as a brag
that will never get to market

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.781
except that the previous day
by arrangement it turns out

00:41:31.781 --> 00:41:34.893
the world's biggest maker
of carbon fiber, Toray,

00:41:34.893 --> 00:41:38.160
had announced a $.3
billion plant in Nagoya

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.610
to mass-produce carbon
fiber car parts for Toyota.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.400
Clearly, therefore, this
was not done for amusement.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.250
This is a statement of strategic intent

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:50.067
as they have since confirmed,

00:41:50.067 --> 00:41:54.783
and a few months ago Honda
and Nissan did a similar deal.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:59.610
Meanwhile, other makers
like Ford and Nissan,

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.557
and the whole Chinese car
industry are embarked on

00:42:03.557 --> 00:42:05.600
very substantial lightweighting

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.955
perhaps based on more familiar materials

00:42:07.955 --> 00:42:09.727
that they're very good at,

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:13.510
so this highest leverage
thing we can do to cars,

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.030
lightweighting, is
actually off and running,

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.540
and the next big shoe to drop

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.300
the electrification of traction

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:23.763
is coming along very rapidly.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:29.650
So here's how the automotive
revolution could unfold.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.580
If you take a good hybrid like
a Prius and drive it properly

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.729
not the way Consumer Report says to

00:42:34.729 --> 00:42:38.440
you'll get doubled efficiency
even without clean diesels

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.150
which are emerging.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.614
If you then make it
ultralight and slippery

00:42:42.614 --> 00:42:45.410
you redouble its efficiency.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:49.180
If you then run it on sustainably
grown cellulosic-ethanol

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.340
from woody, weedy stuff like switchgrass

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.850
you can save 3/4 of the remaining oil.

00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.840
Now your using a 16th of the oil

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.061
that you started with per mile,

00:42:59.061 --> 00:43:02.490
and you can pay farmers for
taking carbon out of the air,

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.370
and putting it back in
topsoil where it belongs.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:09.040
If you then do a good plug-in hybrid

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.067
such as Toyota is getting
out over the next year or two

00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:16.109
you can redouble fuel efficiency,

00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:21.109
so now you're down to three
percent of the oil per mile

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.190
that you started with.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.710
By the way, your second
biggest household asset,

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.510
currently 96 percent idle

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:31.080
can now turn into a
profit center when parked

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.300
selling stored or generated
onboard electricity

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.600
back to the grid when and
where it's most valuable.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.660
The first couple of
million people to do that

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.679
will probably earn back
the whole cost of the car,

00:43:42.679 --> 00:43:44.770
and for the rest it will still be

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:46.543
a significant profit center.

00:43:47.682 --> 00:43:51.230
The car fleet even at tripled efficiency

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.309
will then have six to 12
times as much capacity

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:58.056
as the whole power system has now,

00:43:58.056 --> 00:44:00.430
so it doesn't take very many of us

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.700
liking these new value
propositions from the smart garage

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.140
with let the car, utility, and building

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.493
talk to each other intelligently

00:44:07.493 --> 00:44:12.010
to put the coal and nuclear
plants out of business,

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:14.010
and I haven't even
talked yet about hydrogen

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:16.392
which actually does make
sense and make money

00:44:16.392 --> 00:44:20.053
when the car gets this efficient.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.600
Now you might wonder whether

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.754
these kinds of efficiency breakthroughs

00:44:25.754 --> 00:44:30.120
can create a new competitive
strategy and the answer is yes

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.210
because Boeing just
showed us how to do this.

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.853
In 1997 Boeing was in
about as much trouble

00:44:35.853 --> 00:44:39.115
as Detroit was a decade later.

00:44:39.115 --> 00:44:42.760
They had rot away costs which
they brought under control

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.827
with Toyota Production System and so on,

00:44:44.827 --> 00:44:47.176
a lot of wrenching change,

00:44:47.176 --> 00:44:50.330
but there wasn't a whole lot
of innovation in the pipeline,

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.920
and Airbus was pulling ahead,
and some folks were starting

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.840
to doubt Boeing's staying power.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.570
Well, Boeing's bold repost in 2004

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:02.106
is what was renamed
then the 787 Dreamliner

00:45:02.106 --> 00:45:06.240
saving a fifth of the
fuel at no extra cost,

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.000
half carbon fiber by weight
up from nine percent,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.618
many advantages for the
maker, for the builder,

00:45:12.618 --> 00:45:16.330
and they're now closing in
on their thousandth order.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.560
They're sold out well into 2018.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.089
It's the faster order takeoff
of any jet in history,

00:45:22.089 --> 00:45:25.100
and now they're rolling out that suite

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.760
of radical advances to
every plane they make

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.120
before Airbus can steer
itself out of the ditch.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.040
So starting with advanced materials

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.730
manufacturing for ultra lighting,

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:39.430
and better aerodynamics and
engines, and design integration

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.080
they got this big jump in efficiency,

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.340
and then translated that

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.290
into breakthrough competitive advantage,

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.898
and flipped the sector in
about three to five years.

00:45:48.898 --> 00:45:53.160
This is a complex product with
a couple of million parts,

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.810
and very highly regulated, not bad.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.930
Well, with that in mind
my team has been busy

00:46:00.930 --> 00:46:03.668
implementing the oil endgame

00:46:03.668 --> 00:46:07.287
through what we call
institutional acupuncture,

00:46:07.287 --> 00:46:11.020
that is we figure out where the
business logic is congested,

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:12.520
not flowing properly,

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.350
and we stick needles in
carefully selected sites

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:16.393
to get it flowing.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:19.070
This is very effective,

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:21.723
and it's as much fun as you
can have with clothes on.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.900
We really need to shift what's happening

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.920
in six main sectors,

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.980
and we don't need to
worry much about aviation

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.450
because Boeing already did it,

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:34.600
although, if you wanted
to help legacy airlines

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:35.770
get out of their cost hole

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:37.757
you could offer them
federal loan guarantees,

00:46:37.757 --> 00:46:42.290
specifically, to buy
super efficient planes,

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:44.500
offset the loan guarantees
with equity warrants

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.630
so there's no net cost to treasury,

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:48.770
and then for every plane you so finance

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.418
you scrap one of the
inefficient old planes

00:46:50.418 --> 00:46:51.780
parked in the desert,

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.769
so nobody will ever fly it again.

00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:55.620
It's worth more dead than alive

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.020
let's take it out back and shoot it.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.940
Boeing likes this idea.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:03.800
Now in the case of heavy
trucks based on our analysis

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.073
Walmart has insisted on getting

00:47:06.073 --> 00:47:09.070
doubled efficiency trucks
from its suppliers.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:10.700
They've already saved
a quarter of the fuel,

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.332
and now they're headed for half

00:47:12.332 --> 00:47:15.450
to turn over their fleet by 2015.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:18.360
That will save them billions
of dollars net present value,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.853
so they're highly motivated.

00:47:19.853 --> 00:47:22.875
Basically, we're using the demand pull

00:47:22.875 --> 00:47:25.400
of giant partners like Walmart

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.490
to drag these trucks into the market soon

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.033
so everybody can buy them.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.758
The Pentagon, the world's
biggest buyer of oil,

00:47:32.758 --> 00:47:36.930
and of renewable energy
emerged 13 February this year

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.680
as the leader within our government

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.500
in getting the nation off oil,

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.000
so they won't need to fight over oil.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.130
They have a little
different, more specific,

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.737
and immediate reason for
being worried about oil,

00:47:48.737 --> 00:47:53.330
and that is they have to
deliver it to the platform

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.610
in theater in wartime with
people shooting at them,

00:47:56.610 --> 00:47:58.158
and trying to blow them up.

00:47:58.158 --> 00:48:01.410
It turns out that half the
casualties in theater now

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.010
are associated with convoys.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:07.020
70 percent of what they haul
is fuel mostly than wasted

00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:10.600
because when requiring,
designing, and buying

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.510
the platforms that use the fuel

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.070
the Pentagon had always assumed that

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.250
fuel delivery is free, and invulnerable,

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.700
even though they have
whole divisions of people

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.359
moving fuel around and trying
to guard the movement of fuel.

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:27.890
Well, in April '07 we
finally persuaded them

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.560
to change the policy so that
saved fuel will be valued

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.800
one or two orders of magnitude typically,

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.955
more than it was before

00:48:35.955 --> 00:48:38.860
because they'll count
the fully burdened cost

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:40.447
of fuel delivered,

00:48:40.447 --> 00:48:43.716
and that which is now written into law

00:48:43.716 --> 00:48:47.420
that requirement is going
to drive huge innovation

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.870
because when the prime
contractors start fighting over

00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:52.785
who can make the most efficient tanks,

00:48:52.785 --> 00:48:55.612
planes, ships and so on,

00:48:55.612 --> 00:48:57.990
that innovation that they come up with

00:48:57.990 --> 00:49:00.373
is going to spin back
to the civilian sector

00:49:00.373 --> 00:49:03.160
much as military R&amp;D already gave us,

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:05.563
little things you might have
heard of like the Internet,

00:49:05.563 --> 00:49:09.070
and the chip industry and
the jet engine industry,

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:11.310
and the global positioning system,

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:14.400
so that will further speed
up the tripled efficiency

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.000
cars, trucks and planes,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.540
and as you can imagine the
war fighters really like

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:21.040
the notion of neg emissions in the Gulf,

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.370
mission unnecessary.

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:27.070
There's a huge amount of
activity in advanced biofuels

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.490
including now algal oils,

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:32.390
and in finance the private capital sector

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.933
put $148 billion of new capital

00:49:34.933 --> 00:49:39.330
into the clean energy
space last year worldwide.

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:40.810
We always knew the toughest sector

00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:43.420
would be cars and light trucks,

00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:47.110
but in '04 when Boeing was
suggesting its new strategy

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:50.730
we suggested in our book that
Detroit try the same thing.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:52.640
It seemed like a good idea.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.750
So it was gratifying two years later

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.250
to see Ford Motor Company

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:00.310
hiring the head of Boeing
commercial airplanes to run Ford.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:03.200
He's now in Dearborn with
transformational intent.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.270
The UAW and the dealers are
very keen for basic innovation

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.336
to save their industry as this tsunami

00:50:08.336 --> 00:50:11.980
of creative destruction sweeps
over them opening minds,

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:16.980
further opened by new
competitors like India and China,

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.430
20 venture funded car
start-ups in the U.S.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.923
we just spun off another one,

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.260
and over 100 entrants for
the Automotive X Prize.

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.923
Things are starting to move real fast,

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.017
and now there are new policy instruments

00:50:35.017 --> 00:50:37.201
like the feebates we've been promoting

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.329
that will make more
profit for the automakers,

00:50:39.329 --> 00:50:41.510
and greatly speed this kind of innovation,

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.750
so the competition is now at a pace

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.920
we haven't seen since the 1920s,

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.420
and it's going to change
the managers or their minds,

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.240
whichever comes first,

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.590
so our job is just to
accelerate that change,

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.152
maximize competition which is lots of fun.

00:50:56.152 --> 00:50:59.170
Well, it's obvious from all of this

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.840
that protecting the climate is profitable

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:07.840
because it's cheaper to
save fuel than to buy fuel.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.480
Efficiency is cheaper than fuel.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.610
Somehow the economists who talk about

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.490
the cost of climate protection

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.290
overlooked this obvious point,

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.610
and talk about costs when
they got the sign wrong,

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:21.940
and should be talking about profits.

00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:24.190
Here are some of the firms
that have figured this out

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:26.850
whether they worry about climate or not

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:31.410
they are leading profitable
climate protection.

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:32.968
Some of our biggest chip makers

00:51:32.968 --> 00:51:36.061
are cutting carbon
emission six percent a year

00:51:36.061 --> 00:51:38.400
with two or three year paybacks

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.000
just by making their
plants more efficient.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.850
DuPont set a goal that by 2010
by six percent a year gain

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:47.344
in energy productivity,
and some renewables

00:51:47.344 --> 00:51:49.810
they would have cut their
greenhouse gas emissions

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:52.483
to 60 percent less than they were in 1990.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.360
Guess what, they were 80 percent down

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.400
even a couple of years ago.

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.703
30 percent more output, $3 billion richer.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.640
Dow made even a bigger profit

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.200
substituting efficiency for fuel.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.130
BP made two million bucks on that deal

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.720
meeting their carbon
goals eight years early.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.610
GE is boosting its energy
efficiency 30 percent

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:17.690
to build shareholder value.

00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:20.370
United Technologies just
started paying attention,

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:24.400
and cut energy intensity by
45 percent in five years,

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.090
and they're just getting started.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:27.905
Maybe the record holder is Interface,

00:52:27.905 --> 00:52:31.094
82 percent less greenhouse gas emission

00:52:31.094 --> 00:52:34.530
over an 11 year period
while growing the business,

00:52:34.530 --> 00:52:35.719
and making hundreds of millions of dollars

00:52:35.719 --> 00:52:37.360
profit on the deal,

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:40.740
so politicians keep
debating theoretical costs,

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.640
but the smart companies are
racing to pocket the profits

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.517
before their competitors do,

00:52:45.517 --> 00:52:47.489
and once more of our leaders understand

00:52:47.489 --> 00:52:51.220
that this is a highly profitable activity

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.220
I think any remaining
resistance to doing it

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.990
will melt faster than the glaciers.

00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:59.490
How fast do we need to do that?

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:03.250
Well, economic theorists
normally assume that

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.810
global energy intensity,

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.740
primary energy consumed
per dollar of real GDP

00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.750
will keep falling,

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:11.697
just drifting down gradually
one percent a year,

00:53:11.697 --> 00:53:14.220
but if we could make
that two percent a year

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.057
we could stabilize carbon emissions,

00:53:16.057 --> 00:53:19.510
rather than tripling
them so we're all toast.

00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:22.186
If we could make it three
or four percent a year

00:53:22.186 --> 00:53:25.130
we could decrease those
emissions fast enough

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:27.100
to stabilize climate to the extent that

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.625
irreversible changes
aren't already underway.

00:53:30.625 --> 00:53:32.060
Can we imagine

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.570
three or four percent a year
drop in energy intensity?

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:36.000
Well, the U.S. routinely does it

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.375
without even paying attention,

00:53:37.375 --> 00:53:39.456
and we've done it for a long time

00:53:39.456 --> 00:53:43.023
with stagnant light vehicle
efficiency for 26 years,

00:53:43.023 --> 00:53:47.430
and rewarding utilities in
48 states, but not this one,

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.250
for selling you more energy,

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.280
and penalizing them for cutting your bill,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.343
which is just as dumb as it sounds.

00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.320
California has been saving
energy a percentage point faster

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.640
than the country as a whole,

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.670
thus saving each Californian

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.920
a couple of hundred bucks a year by now.

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.560
China about one percentage
point faster than that

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:12.270
other than a glitch in 2002 to '06,

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.483
which they now pretty well fixed.

00:54:14.483 --> 00:54:17.930
Now it turns out that at
least half the oil and gas

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:20.170
in the country and 3/4 of the electricity

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.320
can be saved at an 8th of the
price we're paying for them.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.607
That sounds like a pretty good deal

00:54:24.607 --> 00:54:27.395
along with 2/3 of Japanese energy,

00:54:27.395 --> 00:54:30.045
and they're several times
more efficient than we are.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.910
There are really two stories about

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.976
profitable climate protection,

00:54:35.976 --> 00:54:39.840
and you see that the rates
of implementation required

00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.530
are a lot less than say
attentive companies achieve.

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.700
They do about six to 15 percent a year.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.570
Everybody who does this makes money at it

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:49.950
so why should three or four
percent a year be hard,

00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:52.210
and why should it be costly?

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:57.210
Well, 2/5 of the opportunity
is in burning oil,

00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:59.160
and 2/5 in making electricity,

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.452
which is largely a coal story,

00:55:01.452 --> 00:55:03.990
and I've told you the oil story already.

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:05.427
Here's a bigger version of it.

00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:09.390
Here's a supply curve
happens to be BP data,

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:11.530
but I think the industry
pretty well agrees on this,

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:14.470
for roughly how many
trillion barrels of oil

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.210
can ultimately be extracted
besides the one trillion

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:18.363
we've already done,

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:22.363
at what free market
price assuming no OPEC,

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.360
so this is just actual production cost

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:27.430
plus a reasonable profit.

00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:28.790
The OPEC Middle East countries say

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.600
they've got another trillion
barrels of cheap oil,

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.926
which is about what the world's
projected to need to 2030.

00:55:34.926 --> 00:55:37.850
A lot of companies wanting to avoid

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.740
OPEC Middle East if they can

00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.595
are already into expensive
frontier hydrocarbons,

00:55:42.595 --> 00:55:46.561
and thinking about tar sands,
oil shells, coal-to-liquids,

00:55:46.561 --> 00:55:50.304
very expensive stuff
and this doesn't count

00:55:50.304 --> 00:55:54.080
inflationary cost escalation pressures

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.340
that have put these numbers
now much, much higher.

00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.550
In fact, the tar sands need now about

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:01.375
90 or 100 bucks a barrel to break even.

00:56:01.375 --> 00:56:05.450
Now let's splice into
this graph a conservative

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:08.820
scaling to the world of the
oil endgame opportunities

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.650
we found on the supply and demand side

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:14.100
then everything slides three
trillion barrels to the right,

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:17.500
and if that means that you
avoid this very expensive

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.680
carbon intensive stuff here

00:56:20.803 --> 00:56:24.590
multiply in quantity
times carbon intensity

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.250
let's say you stop at this point

00:56:26.250 --> 00:56:28.136
it means your carbon
emissions will go down

00:56:28.136 --> 00:56:31.016
by at least a trillion tons,

00:56:31.016 --> 00:56:34.530
and you'll save tens
of trillions of dollars

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:36.010
plus whatever monopoly rent

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.760
you would have been paying to OPEC.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:40.550
That's a pretty good deal,

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.800
and you'll notice I haven't talked about

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.927
the peak oil argument about
how much oil is in the ground.

00:56:45.927 --> 00:56:48.320
That's because nobody can
know who's right about

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.521
how much is in the ground

00:56:49.521 --> 00:56:52.210
because about 94 percent of the reserves

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.110
are owned by governments which don't know,

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.510
or won't honestly tell
you what they've got,

00:56:56.510 --> 00:57:00.290
but it doesn't matter who's
right about what's in the ground

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.090
because we ought to do
the same things anyway

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:05.200
just to make money or
improve our security,

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.810
or protect the climate.

00:57:06.810 --> 00:57:09.840
Any one or more of those is
a perfectly solid reason,

00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:12.570
and I don't need a fourth
indeterminate reason,

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:15.530
so I think this is kind of a distraction.

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:19.890
Now electricity I mentioned
that each Californian

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:22.890
is saving about 200 bucks
a year what I mean by that

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:25.364
is that the per capita use of electricity

00:57:25.364 --> 00:57:28.320
has been flat for 30 years in this state

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.020
while it's gone up in
the rest of the country,

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.720
and up steeply in places like Texas.

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:34.406
The reason we've saved money on the deal

00:57:34.406 --> 00:57:36.580
is not just making the electricity,

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:39.430
but we've avoided about
$100 billion of investment

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.740
to make and deliver it,

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.403
and that could be more
productively used elsewhere.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:47.090
So per capital real income
during those 30 years

00:57:47.090 --> 00:57:49.097
has gone up 79 percent in this state

00:57:49.097 --> 00:57:52.595
yet without increasing
the use of electricity,

00:57:52.595 --> 00:57:56.480
and equally important in
achieving that were efficiencies,

00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:00.290
standards in buildings and appliances,

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:03.090
and rewarding utilities
for cutting your bill

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:04.190
not selling you more energy,

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.980
so they got enthusiastic
about making this happen,

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.550
and that reform is now starting
to spread pretty quickly.

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:13.212
It's adopted now or being
considered in half the states,

00:58:13.212 --> 00:58:16.564
but we can go a lot further
back in the late 80s

00:58:16.564 --> 00:58:19.124
my colleagues and I looked at the data

00:58:19.124 --> 00:58:21.680
for about 1,000 technologies,

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:23.590
and concluded that you could save

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.764
about 3/4 of U.S. electricity

00:58:25.764 --> 00:58:29.060
if you fully deployed them
wherever they would fit,

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:30.620
make sense, make money,

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.540
and the average cost
of doing that would be

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.920
in today's dollars about
one cent a kilowatt hour.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.060
There were similar findings

00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.420
in other more efficient countries.

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:42.174
The utilities think tank found
a somewhat smaller potential,

00:58:42.174 --> 00:58:44.930
only 40 to 60 percent savings

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:46.210
at a few cents a kilowatt hour,

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:49.890
but still cheaper than
just making and delivering

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.519
power from a power plant
that cost nothing to build.

00:58:53.519 --> 00:58:56.210
Of course, the savings
keep getting bigger,

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:58.206
and cheaper faster than we use them up,

00:58:58.206 --> 00:59:00.700
so this is an ever
bigger cheaper resource.

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:02.760
It's as if the low-hanging fruit

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.720
were mushing up deeper around our ankles,

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.120
and spilling it over our boots
while the innovation tree

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:09.753
keeps dumping more fruit on our head.

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.370
There's an equal shock happening

00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.351
on the supply side of electricity.

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:18.230
The upper graph shows

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:21.090
the amount of electricity
worldwide produced,

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:24.482
and the lower graph the
capacity installed worldwide

00:59:24.482 --> 00:59:28.620
for what the Economist
Magazine calls micropower,

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:29.660
and there are two kinds.

00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.360
The bigger tan wedge here

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.160
is cogeneration that is

00:59:36.212 --> 00:59:40.490
producing both electricity and useful heat

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.950
together in buildings or factories,

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:47.950
thereby, saving at least half
of the cost, fuel and carbon.

00:59:48.443 --> 00:59:50.970
Then the colored wedges underneath

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:55.903
are renewable sources
other than big hydro.

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.720
Well, together, micro
power is now producing

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.300
as of 2006 a sixth of
the world's electricity,

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.910
slightly more than nuclear,

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:09.423
a 3rd of the world's new electricity,

01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:12.050
a sixth to over half of all electricity

01:00:12.050 --> 01:00:14.490
in a dozen industrial countries.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.040
This doesn't even count electric savings,

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.280
which are not as well tracked,

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.490
but are probably also really big,

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:22.380
which means that central power plants,

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.660
which we are told are indispensable

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.651
are probably now producing
less than half the world's

01:00:26.651 --> 01:00:30.103
new electrical services
because they cost too much,

01:00:30.103 --> 01:00:32.525
and have too much financial risk,

01:00:32.525 --> 01:00:35.713
so in 2006 the last full data we have

01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:39.840
these lower no-carbon power sources

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:43.007
added six times as much output,

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:47.330
and 30 or 40 times as much
capacity as nuclear added

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.017
that's the essentially flat line here.

01:00:50.017 --> 01:00:53.510
In fact, nuclear added less
capacity than photovoltaics did,

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.000
or a tenth what wind power added.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.300
Last year China or Spain or the U.S.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.540
each added more wind power

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.280
than the world added nuclear capacity,

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.820
and the U.S. added more wind capacity

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.720
than its added coal capacity

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.513
the past five years put together.

01:01:09.450 --> 01:01:11.540
I'm not sure what part
of the story anybody

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.530
who takes markets seriously doesn't get,

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.529
but it's pretty clear,

01:01:14.529 --> 01:01:17.519
and in the U.S. even
before the capital collapse

01:01:17.519 --> 01:01:21.709
there was not any investment
capital available.

01:01:21.709 --> 01:01:25.660
Nobody put a penny into
proposed new nuclear plants

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.901
despite 100 plus percent new subsidies.

01:01:28.901 --> 01:01:31.841
Now this is all a good thing for climate

01:01:31.841 --> 01:01:36.250
because here's roughly
how many cents it costs

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:40.010
to make and deliver a new
kilowatt hour from nuclear coal,

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:42.470
combined-cycle gas, firmed wind,

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:45.470
three flavors of
cogeneration or efficiency

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:48.400
according to the latest
empirical data for the U.S.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.170
from the last year or two.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:53.110
We used to think that
making and delivering,

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:54.610
which is the red part,

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.623
a nuclear kilowatt hour
would cost about 11 cents,

01:01:57.623 --> 01:02:00.270
but then the Keystone Study showed

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:03.067
the fuel was going to be a lot
more expensive in the future,

01:02:03.067 --> 01:02:06.272
and the capital costs were going rapidly,

01:02:06.272 --> 01:02:08.241
and now they've gone up even more,

01:02:08.241 --> 01:02:13.241
so the latest numbers are
somewhere up around here from say

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:17.359
Moody's 18 cents a kilowatt hour or so,

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:22.359
and there's been a little
more escalation in coal,

01:02:23.727 --> 01:02:27.910
actually, wind has gone
down a little bit last year,

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:31.810
but at any rate nuclear
is extremely expensive.

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:36.810
Now if you take these cents
per kilowatt hour cost,

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.330
and turn them upside
down take the reciprocal

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:41.630
you get how many kilowatt
hours you can get

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:43.580
by investing a dollar in different ways

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:46.270
of providing electrical services.

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:48.741
If you then correct for
the carbon emissions

01:02:48.741 --> 01:02:52.909
of the several sources that
actually emit some carbon

01:02:52.909 --> 01:02:57.280
then you can get how many
kilograms of carbon emission,

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.170
CO2, actually, you can displace

01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:02.820
by spending a dollar in different ways,

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.730
so in a nuclear plant at the latest cost

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:06.830
would probably be down around

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:09.963
five kilograms C02 displaced per dollar,

01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:15.352
but you can get about
2-1/2 times that much

01:03:15.352 --> 01:03:18.310
with a firm power from a wind farm.

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:20.540
Coal gen is about similar.

01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.390
Recovered waste heat coal gen better.

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:25.320
Efficiency at the average
cost actually observed,

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.353
which is two cents a kilowatt hour,

01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:31.230
is right up in the top of the chart here,

01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:33.360
and well designed efficiency,

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.074
which is less than half that
cost is way up in the ceiling.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:38.323
In other words,

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.340
a new nuclear plant will save you about

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.010
two to 11 or more times less carbon,

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:48.188
and do so about 20 to 40 times slower

01:03:48.188 --> 01:03:51.320
then if you spent the same money

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:55.970
buying efficiency and
micropower, the market winners.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:57.980
In fact, if you bought a new nuclear plant

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.326
instead of efficiency

01:04:00.326 --> 01:04:04.350
the result would be the
release of more extra carbon

01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:07.620
then if you had spent the same
money building a coal plant.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.630
So it's not good enough
just to be carbon free.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.730
You also have to be cheap and fast.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.797
If climates a problem we need
the most solution per dollar,

01:04:16.797 --> 01:04:18.470
and the most solution per year,

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:22.160
and we need to invest
judiciously not indiscriminately,

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.700
otherwise, we're just making things worse

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.700
reducing and retarding climate protection.

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.950
There are a lot of conservatisms
in what I just showed you

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:34.950
including that I'm not counting
over 200 hidden benefits

01:04:34.997 --> 01:04:38.022
of decentralized power
production that we wrote up

01:04:38.022 --> 01:04:40.956
in an economist book of
the year six years ago,

01:04:40.956 --> 01:04:43.390
and that typically increase economic value

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:46.147
by about a factor 10, for example,

01:04:46.147 --> 01:04:49.780
because there's less
financial risk in building

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:55.100
small fast modular plants
than big slow lumpy ones,

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.720
or renewables give more valuable energy

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.960
because it doesn't have
a volatile fuel price

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.523
so you're hedged against
that financial risk.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.253
As the market

01:05:08.761 --> 01:05:12.244
starts to recognize these benefits more

01:05:12.244 --> 01:05:16.530
it's going to further
accelerate distributed power,

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:17.670
decentralized power,

01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:19.208
but even without doing that

01:05:19.208 --> 01:05:20.990
you can make a good case right now

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:24.631
that even photovoltaics have
already passed cost crossover.

01:05:24.631 --> 01:05:28.280
Tom Dinwiddie the founder
of Sun Power has done this.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.716
He's shown that if you start building

01:05:29.716 --> 01:05:31.557
a coal plant right now,

01:05:31.557 --> 01:05:36.070
and right next to it in New
Jersey a photovoltaic plant

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:38.354
by the time the coal plant is done,

01:05:38.354 --> 01:05:40.420
a photovoltaic plant big enough

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.350
to produce the same annual electricity

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.735
will be producing four
times as much peak output

01:05:44.735 --> 01:05:47.480
at lower lifetime cost

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.430
because it has positive
cashflow from year one.

01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.623
It's actually producing power and revenue.

01:05:54.642 --> 01:05:57.361
It's much more peak
coincident in its output,

01:05:57.361 --> 01:06:00.563
and you're riding the cost
curve down as you build it.

01:06:01.502 --> 01:06:03.720
This is without counting
on any breakthroughs,

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.513
but just what's already baked in.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.330
Okay, that's way too
much on principle one.

01:06:10.330 --> 01:06:12.210
Let me run you quickly through

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:13.850
principles two, three and four,

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.230
and show how they fit together.

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.330
Okay, at the University of Zurich,

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:19.623
not Etihad the other one,

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:25.580
in the chem lab every year
they were turning lots of pure,

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:30.160
simple reagents into very
expensive toxic wastes,

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.410
until Professor Hanns Fischer said,

01:06:32.410 --> 01:06:33.990
hey, why don't we turn
this around backwards,

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.602
and teach the same lab techniques

01:06:36.602 --> 01:06:39.410
separating the toxic waste we just made

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:41.943
into the pure simple
reagents we started with?

01:06:42.967 --> 01:06:45.720
The students really loved this.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.100
They stayed nights and weekends

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:50.365
separating waste back
into starting reagents,

01:06:50.365 --> 01:06:53.440
and waste went down 99 percent,

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:56.847
cost went down $20,000 a year.

01:06:56.847 --> 01:07:01.847
By closing the loops and
designing out the toxicity

01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:05.060
those students were making
themselves very much in demand,

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.810
and now they can go out and
save the chemical industry.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:12.180
Or an example from the green
architect, Bill McDonough

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.920
about closed loops and
designing out toxicity

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.674
producing stuff the way nature does.

01:07:17.674 --> 01:07:20.832
A division of Steelcase asked
him to look at the design

01:07:20.832 --> 01:07:24.437
of a textile to cover office chairs

01:07:24.437 --> 01:07:27.008
because the fabric that was being used

01:07:27.008 --> 01:07:30.060
had edge trimmings that
had just been declared

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.300
by the Swiss government
to be a toxic waste

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.200
because of heavy metals
and other bad stuff

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.620
used in treating and dyeing the cloth.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.030
Now we know why it's called dyeing.

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:40.280
So it kind of makes you wonder

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.980
what's the middle of the
cloth that you're sitting on.

01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:47.470
So Bill and his German chemist colleague,

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:48.690
Dr. Michael Braungart,

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:51.640
reported that they tested 8,000 chemicals

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.860
used in the cloth business,

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.580
and only found 38 that didn't
cause cancer, mutations,

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.793
birth defects, endocrine
disruption, or bioaccumulation.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.470
Well, then they took the 38 safe ones,

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:06.718
and showed that from those
you could make any color,

01:08:06.718 --> 01:08:11.350
and you would end up making
cloth that would last longer,

01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:12.900
feel better in your hand,

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.894
and cost 20 percent less to produce

01:08:14.894 --> 01:08:17.060
partly because you didn't have to have

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:20.280
those embarrassing conversations
anymore with OSHA and EPA

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.033
because there was nothing in your process

01:08:22.033 --> 01:08:24.417
that would hurt the
workers or the neighbors.

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:27.475
You know, you can take off your masks now.

01:08:27.475 --> 01:08:31.226
When the inspectors came to
the plant using the new process

01:08:31.226 --> 01:08:34.950
they found that the
water leaving the plant

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:37.740
was a little cleaner than the
Swiss drinking water going in

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.521
they thought their apparatus was broken,

01:08:39.521 --> 01:08:41.890
but this was actually the correct result

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.900
because the cloth product was acting

01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:45.585
as an additional filter,

01:08:45.585 --> 01:08:48.020
a nice example of what happens Bill says,

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.810
when you take the
filters out of the pipes,

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:52.690
and put them where they
belong in the designers' heads

01:08:52.690 --> 01:08:55.480
designing out everything
that shouldn't be there,

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:58.284
and as he points out this is
also a nice closed-loop system

01:08:58.284 --> 01:09:00.940
because when you're done with the cloth

01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.770
you can compost it in your veggie garden,

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:05.193
or if you have fiber
deficiency you can eat it.

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:11.170
Now what this is partly about I mentioned

01:09:11.170 --> 01:09:13.287
is designing stuff the way nature does.

01:09:13.287 --> 01:09:17.097
There's 3.8 billion years
of design genius out there

01:09:17.097 --> 01:09:22.070
in which the 99 or so percent
of products and designs

01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:25.200
that didn't work all got
recalled by the manufacturer,

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.630
and from the one percent that did work

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:30.700
we can learn a great deal about design.

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.660
My friend, Janine Benyus, has
beautifully shown all this

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:36.645
in a book called Biomimicry:
Innovation Inspired by Nature.

01:09:36.645 --> 01:09:40.092
She asks things like how
do spiders make silk,

01:09:40.092 --> 01:09:44.870
you know, tougher than the
Kevlar in bulletproof vests,

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:46.320
stronger than steel.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.420
If we want to make Kevlar we
need boiling sulfuric acid,

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.380
and high pressure extruders.

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:52.470
Spiders don't do that,

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:54.803
they make this stuff in their
bellies out of digested bugs,

01:09:54.803 --> 01:09:56.340
how do they do that?

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:59.230
Let's figure out and
try to do it ourselves.

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:02.737
There's actually three levels
at which biomimicry works

01:10:02.737 --> 01:10:05.323
that are being applied now to products

01:10:05.323 --> 01:10:08.180
like how does the thing work?

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.750
Self-cleaning paint like a lotus petal

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:13.010
rising brilliantly right out of the muck.

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:17.620
Adhesives using gecko
foot nano-hair technology.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.620
Biomimetic rotors based on the
Fibonacci spirals of nature,

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.900
and producing much more
efficient fans and pumps.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:28.290
Here's a big building the
biggest commercial building

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:33.290
in Harare based on the
architecture of termite mounds

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:36.570
to do passive cooling and air handling.

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:38.430
Then there are other kinds of innovations

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:39.990
about how is the thing made

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:43.590
like the inner shell of
abalone has to withstand

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:46.390
being pounded on by a rock
on the chest of an otter

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:48.240
that wants to eat the abalone.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.530
If you get eaten you
don't get to reproduce,

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:52.240
so there's a very strong incentive

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.493
to have immensely tough inner shell,

01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:57.250
and it turns out the abalone knows

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:00.730
how to make a material that
is about twice as tough

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:02.760
as our best missile nose cone ceramics,

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:05.290
but it's self-assembled at four degrees C

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.860
in seawater with no waste,

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.220
and now we figured out how to do that.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.529
There are other levels
of biomimicry as well,

01:11:11.529 --> 01:11:14.913
and when we put these in
an open public database

01:11:14.913 --> 01:11:18.940
then the wisdom of all those organisms

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.820
that know how to do these
things will be available to us

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.070
for our design solutions.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:27.280
Where this is taking us is a world where

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.201
the natural capitalist businesses,

01:11:30.201 --> 01:11:34.030
the successful businesses are
those that take their values

01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:36.530
from their customers,
their designs from nature,

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:38.910
and their discipline from the marketplace,

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:41.820
exactly the opposite of
what the biotech industry

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.540
tried to do with genetically
modified organisms,

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:49.540
and they have met the expected reception.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.640
Also, this is a world where
conventional environmental

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.377
regulation starts to
become pretty anachronistic

01:11:56.377 --> 01:11:58.410
because the companies that most need it

01:11:58.410 --> 01:12:00.340
will probably by then be out of business

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:02.070
having spent too much time and money

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:04.512
making things that nobody wants,

01:12:04.512 --> 01:12:06.830
making things that in the 20th century

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:09.860
we used to call wastes and emissions.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:12.874
Now we have a better term we
call them unsalable production

01:12:12.874 --> 01:12:15.270
because this focuses our minds on

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:18.381
why are we producing stuff
nobody wants let's design it out,

01:12:18.381 --> 01:12:21.380
and then you get into
really serious innovation,

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.330
and competitive advantage.

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:26.319
Well, a very good way to do that

01:12:26.319 --> 01:12:30.420
is cybernetics the signals
we get from the market

01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:33.790
which depends on our business
model how do we make money?

01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:37.190
For example, how clean
would you make your car

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:40.060
if its tailpipe instead of
being aimed at pedestrians

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:43.300
were just plumbed back into
the passenger compartment?

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.142
Probably real clean.

01:12:45.142 --> 01:12:48.230
How safe would you make
your explosives factory

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.770
if you built your house next to it?

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:53.280
Very safe, that's what Mr. DuPont did.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.803
They've led in industrial
safety ever since

01:12:55.803 --> 01:12:57.350
called safety culture.

01:12:57.350 --> 01:13:01.570
Do you know how Admiral
Rickover got really high quality

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:04.583
hull welds on the first
nuclear submarines?

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.660
He just told the welders and their CEOs

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.960
that they would be aboard
for the maiden dive.

01:13:12.483 --> 01:13:15.250
Feedback is really powerful.

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:18.223
Systems without feedback
are stupid by definition,

01:13:19.546 --> 01:13:22.850
therefore, if you change
the business model

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:26.820
to give the right feedback you
get a very powerful result.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.930
Principle three of natural capitalism,

01:13:28.930 --> 01:13:32.550
which we call the solutions
economy business model

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.610
in which both the
provider and the customer

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.580
get rewarded for the same thing

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.960
namely doing more and
better with less for longer.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:43.930
So, Schindler, for example,
experimented successfully

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:46.130
with not selling you an elevator,

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.790
but leasing you a vertical
transportation service.

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:50.250
You didn't want to own a bunch of metal,

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:51.504
you wanted to be moved up and down,

01:13:51.504 --> 01:13:55.092
and if they owned it they
would get the savings

01:13:55.092 --> 01:13:57.360
from its being they felt more efficient,

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.650
and more reliable than competing ones,

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:01.350
and the more efficient
and reliable it was,

01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:03.079
the more money you'd both make.

01:14:03.079 --> 01:14:06.100
Dow instead of selling you a solvent

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.960
would rather lease you
a dissolving service.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.020
They bring the solvent
it does the dissolving.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.120
You never own it, that's good.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.330
They take it away again and repurify it,

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:15.980
and the more loops they can put it through

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.880
with more customers,

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.410
and the less they lose each time,

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:20.900
the cheaper the dissolving
gets, the less they charge you,

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:23.840
the more market share they
get, the more profit they make,

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:25.563
everybody comes out ahead.

01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:30.327
We're starting to see these
business models pop up

01:14:30.327 --> 01:14:33.680
like in the ZipCar, Flexcar model

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:37.092
where, you know, your 96 percent idle car

01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:39.880
doesn't have to belong to you.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.078
It can belong to a company
that provides it by the hour,

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:46.110
and if you want to haul
drywall on Wednesday,

01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:49.501
and pick up your hunny in
a sports car on Saturday

01:14:49.501 --> 01:14:54.150
you could do both and you
don't need to own either one.

01:14:54.150 --> 01:14:55.950
It turns out vehicle
miles traveled go down

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:58.640
by about half under this system.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.540
Imagine if you're a car
company or an oil company,

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.060
and somebody else does this first

01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:04.760
that could be pretty embarrassing.

01:15:07.141 --> 01:15:09.320
The same thing in chemicals.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.081
There are many interesting examples

01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:14.303
where people are following the Dow example

01:15:14.303 --> 01:15:17.690
starting to provide the
services of a chemical

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:20.460
without your having to
own the chemical itself.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:22.466
The more productively it can be used,

01:15:22.466 --> 01:15:26.110
or the more you can design it
out by changing the process

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:27.870
the more money you both make,

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:31.590
so this is a great way to
encourage principles one and two.

01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:33.613
So let me tie this together.

01:15:33.613 --> 01:15:37.530
Every year millions of tons of
carpet generally made of oil

01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:41.518
go to landfill where they
sit for 10 or 20,000 years

01:15:41.518 --> 01:15:46.518
because we use broadloom carpet
which this appears to be.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.860
It comes in a big roll,

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.180
and after 10 or 20 years it
starts to look pretty ratty

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:55.030
so you have to shut down your operation,

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.750
move everybody out, roll
up the partly worn carpet,

01:15:57.750 --> 01:16:01.495
send it to landfill, lay down
a new carpet made of more oil,

01:16:01.495 --> 01:16:04.080
move back in, hope you don't get poisoned

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.913
by the fumes in the carpet
glue and resume operations.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.090
This sounds pretty dumb, actually,

01:16:10.090 --> 01:16:11.959
it seemed to Ray Anderson.

01:16:11.959 --> 01:16:15.819
Now he'd already got
serious starting in '94

01:16:15.819 --> 01:16:18.970
about resource efficiency,

01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:23.140
and made hundreds of millions
of dollars bringing out waste

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:26.700
providing 2/5 of his
firms operating profit,

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.600
but then he got to thinking
about closed-loop production,

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.860
and they came up with
an experimental carpet,

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.640
which turned out to have a few issues,

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.560
but the basic concept is sound.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.580
It's non-toxic, no
chlorine, climate neutral.

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.070
You can wash it with a garden hose.

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.436
It doesn't stain, doesn't
mildew, looks good, feels good.

01:16:43.436 --> 01:16:47.405
Four times longer life
with a third less material,

01:16:47.405 --> 01:16:50.030
and then you can completely

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:52.806
remanufacture it into the same stuff,

01:16:52.806 --> 01:16:54.798
but then Ray said, well, wait a minute,

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:56.880
you don't really want to own a carpet

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.580
you want to walk on it and look at it.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:01.840
Let's think about a solutions
economy business model

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.310
where instead of selling you a carpet

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:05.503
we lease you a floor covering service,

01:17:05.503 --> 01:17:09.360
so every month the little
elves come in the night,

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.170
and replace only the worn carpet tiles,

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.820
which is about a fifth of them,

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.860
the other 4/5 are places
where you're not walking,

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.314
so they don't wear out.

01:17:17.314 --> 01:17:21.320
Then you send the worn ones
back for remanufacturing,

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.590
replace them with fresh ones,

01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:24.400
no disruption to your operation,

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.870
and Interface captures
the durability value,

01:17:26.870 --> 01:17:30.360
another factor five here,

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:34.740
and you get better service
at lower cost as a customer

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:38.064
with 97 percent less material,

01:17:38.064 --> 01:17:41.960
and with manufacturing
99.9 percent material.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.830
Imagine competing with somebody who uses

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:47.200
a tenth the capital and a
thousandth of material you do

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:49.810
you aren't going to be very happy.

01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:52.900
By the way, this is a tax
deductible net operating lease,

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.690
so it's a tax advantage financial product

01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:57.570
not an idle balance sheet item,

01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:01.111
and you employ more people
for delivering the service

01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.663
than you lost jobs making less carpet.

01:18:05.230 --> 01:18:07.970
Then the next step which
they're well ahead on

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:12.563
is to make the carpet out of
corn stover grown organically,

01:18:13.467 --> 01:18:17.270
and normally in traditional
black farming communities

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:19.701
in the deep south in ways
that actually enrich,

01:18:19.701 --> 01:18:23.870
tilth and rural culture
while protecting the climate

01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:26.753
so that's a reinvestment in
human and natural capital.

01:18:28.179 --> 01:18:31.030
As you can expect people at Interface

01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:32.823
are really jazzed about this.

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:36.560
Anybody who runs a natural
capitalist firm will tell you

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.630
it's the most exciting place to work,

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:41.190
and anybody who runs any
kind of a green company

01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:43.410
will tell you that it's a huge help

01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.020
in recruiting, retaining and
motivating the best people

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:48.450
which is what competition
is ultimately about.

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.710
By the way, just the first
four years on this path

01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:51.980
they more than doubled revenues,

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.520
more than tripled operating profits,

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.130
and nearly doubled employment

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.930
all at the same time not a bad deal.

01:18:58.027 --> 01:19:01.180
So that leads me finally to principle four

01:19:01.180 --> 01:19:05.100
that you reinvest to save
money into natural capital.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.044
This is the easiest principle to follow

01:19:07.044 --> 01:19:09.750
because nature does the production.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:12.400
You just need to treat
nature with proper respect,

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:16.323
get out of the way,
stop messing things up.

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:22.560
This principle shows up
first in sectors like

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.640
raising trees, or crops, or
livestock, or catching fish,

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.680
things where your success depends on

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.470
the health of the ecosystem around you

01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:34.340
so you get real direct
feedback about that.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:38.640
Allan Savory, for example,
showed huge increases

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.219
in carrying capacity even on

01:19:41.219 --> 01:19:45.160
very arid land highly degraded,

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.840
but it turned out it was
degraded not by overgrazing,

01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.400
but my undergrazing and
grazing the wrong way

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.789
not following the grazing model

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:55.113
of the ungulates that used to live there

01:19:55.113 --> 01:19:58.023
that would circulate around in huge herds.

01:20:00.036 --> 01:20:03.840
Or in California 30 percent
of the rice growing area

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.386
switched over from burning
the straw after harvest

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:12.007
to flooding and inviting in
millions of ducks and geese

01:20:12.007 --> 01:20:14.560
that would provide fertilizer,

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.440
and dig up little crustaceans and so on,

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.760
provide lucrative hunting licenses,

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.420
and you'd get the high silica straw

01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:24.220
that used to cause lung problems downwind,

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.517
and now you use it for straw bale building

01:20:27.517 --> 01:20:29.750
because bugs don't like to eat it,

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.300
you'd recharge the groundwater.

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.298
You're still a rice farmer,

01:20:32.298 --> 01:20:34.610
but you got lots of other benefits,

01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:35.923
and make a lot more money.

01:20:36.790 --> 01:20:40.170
Or here's one I just saw in Borneo in May.

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:44.620
Dr. Willie Smits has
turned 19 square kilometers

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:49.620
of devastated grassland
that used to be forest

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.779
back into a lush rainforest
in just six or seven years,

01:20:53.779 --> 01:20:57.130
and the whole model is built on

01:20:57.130 --> 01:20:59.852
the welfare of the local Dayak people,

01:20:59.852 --> 01:21:02.470
so if you come try to steal the wood

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:05.430
with the corrupt police
the Dayaks will kill you,

01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:07.970
and they were recently
blowpipe headhunters,

01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:09.570
so this is a credible threat,

01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:13.240
and it makes the forest
self-protecting despite

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:15.483
the breakdown of rule of law.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.783
So this little guy then
has some applied hope.

01:21:21.393 --> 01:21:25.263
Even the zen apes this one's
meditating on a pineapple.

01:21:27.736 --> 01:21:32.558
To tie it all together in
the U.S. at the moment,

01:21:32.558 --> 01:21:36.240
or, recently, remember
that flow that's 20 times

01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.432
your body weight per person per day,

01:21:38.432 --> 01:21:41.810
well, that flow is what we
extract from the planet.

01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:45.710
It's about 83 percent
mined, 17 percent grown,

01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:47.330
but all that extracted flow,

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:51.060
well, 93 percent of it's actually wasted

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:52.770
in extraction and manufacturing,

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:56.340
so only seven percent ends
up in products that we ship,

01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:58.713
and 6/7 of those are consumer ephemerals

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:01.965
that get thrown away
after one use or no uses,

01:22:01.965 --> 01:22:05.076
so only one percent of what
we start with in the ground

01:22:05.076 --> 01:22:07.500
ends up as durables.

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.980
What do we do with that when it's done?

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:12.300
Two percent of it gets remanufactured,

01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:14.470
or recycled or composted.

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.750
98 percent is thrown away.

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:21.360
So the system the first order
is 99.98 percent pure waste.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:23.310
What a business opportunity.

01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.110
By the way, a lot of the waste is toxic

01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:26.687
so when it comes back into nature

01:22:26.687 --> 01:22:29.549
it poisons the ability of the ecosystem

01:22:29.549 --> 01:22:32.706
to keep producing the
food and fiber we need,

01:22:32.706 --> 01:22:35.230
and the ecosystem services
we can't live without,

01:22:35.230 --> 01:22:38.610
so this is a really stupid
design let's change it.

01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:43.590
In a natural capitalist system
we grow more, mine less,

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:47.010
and extract a great deal
less of what we need

01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:50.840
through comprehensive
systematic resource efficiency

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.120
that affects how we
harvest, how we manufacture,

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.929
how we use, how long things last,

01:22:57.929 --> 01:22:59.279
how they're dematerialized,

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:05.820
and then we close the loops in
manufacturing and after use,

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:09.549
so we almost eliminate what's thrown away.

01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:12.858
These changes are all
encouraged by the shift

01:23:12.858 --> 01:23:16.385
or the solutions economy business model,

01:23:16.385 --> 01:23:18.850
and then we also design out toxicity,

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:21.120
so the little bit that comes back

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.099
does not harm nature's
regenerative capacity,

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:27.640
and, in fact, we
systematically increase that

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.488
by reinvesting money
made by waste elimination

01:23:30.488 --> 01:23:33.710
back into natural capital

01:23:33.710 --> 01:23:37.833
that's how all the pieces fit together.

01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:42.838
This works even in a city
in difficult circumstances.

01:23:42.838 --> 01:23:46.360
Our 14th chapter in the book
is the story of Curitiba,

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.841
a city the size of Houston or Philadelphia

01:23:48.841 --> 01:23:52.009
that had quadrupled
population in 20 years.

01:23:52.009 --> 01:23:54.506
It was a relatively poor city,

01:23:54.506 --> 01:23:58.420
and yet by treating
its formidable, social,

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:01.370
economic, ecological needs
not as competing priorities

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.550
to be traded off in budget fights,

01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:05.320
but as integrated design elements

01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:07.650
with synergies to be captured.

01:24:07.650 --> 01:24:10.490
A brilliant design process
led largely by architects,

01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:11.410
largely by women,

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:15.190
made it one of the world's
great cities by design.

01:24:15.190 --> 01:24:19.920
They integrated from the
start waste to nutrient flows,

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.020
transport and land use,
participation dignity,

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.560
education and health.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.670
They never did just one thing.

01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:29.050
They tried to solve
lots of problems at once

01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:30.190
without making new ones,

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.060
and they treated their citizens

01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:36.390
as their most precious resource
reinvesting a lot in people,

01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:38.523
individuals, culture, and community.

01:24:39.922 --> 01:24:43.700
That, of course, is really necessary

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.833
to have a harmonious society
and become better people.

01:24:47.846 --> 01:24:51.060
Now most of the heavy lifting

01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:52.650
was done by the private sector,

01:24:52.650 --> 01:24:54.760
but government believing
it should steer, not row,

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.720
got the rules right,

01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:00.500
so in the famous surface
rapid transit bus system,

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.800
maybe the world's best
public transport system now,

01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:05.020
imitated in 84 cities,

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.300
the 10 competing companies
that run that are paid

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.240
not for how many people they carry,

01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:11.060
but for how much route they serve,

01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.410
so they spread out and
serve everybody equally.

01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:18.810
Private sector leadership
is really important

01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:22.320
in a world where over
half of the 100 or 200

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.623
top economic entities are not
countries they're companies.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:31.500
This may be perhaps
other than the military

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.235
the only really effective
institution we have

01:25:34.235 --> 01:25:38.791
with what it takes to solve
tough problems quickly at scale,

01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:41.747
and that depends on integrative design,

01:25:41.747 --> 01:25:44.646
and on how we deal with each other,

01:25:44.646 --> 01:25:47.330
but the only adopters
of these four principles

01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:50.475
are finding stunning
competitive advantage.

01:25:50.475 --> 01:25:53.360
They're finding, as Ed Woolard
said, when he chaired DuPont,

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.020
that companies that take
such opportunities seriously

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.400
will do very well, while he added,

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.210
those that don't won't be a problem

01:26:01.210 --> 01:26:03.910
because ultimately they won't be around.

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:05.940
So maybe the real problem with capitalism

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:10.284
this extraordinarily powerful
engine of wealth creation

01:26:10.284 --> 01:26:15.284
involving the productive use
of and reinvestment in capital

01:26:16.410 --> 01:26:18.770
all four forms of capital

01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:21.120
is that we haven't really tried it yet,

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.520
but the early returns are encouraging.

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.390
I would urge you to take a
look at the website natcap.org

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:30.310
where you can download the
book for free in English,

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.360
and it's also in lots of other languages.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.609
We will soon post a bunch of updates,

01:26:35.609 --> 01:26:38.300
and things that got pruned out of the book

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.053
in late slash-and-burn editing.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.290
I would like to add more cases,

01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:49.180
so I hope any entrepreneurs in the house

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.814
will let us know how you're doing.

01:26:51.814 --> 01:26:54.610
If anything I've said
seems too good to be true

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:57.164
just remember the Marshall McLuhan remark

01:26:57.164 --> 01:27:00.096
that only puny secrets need protection.

01:27:00.096 --> 01:27:04.687
Big discoveries are protected
by public incredulity.

01:27:04.687 --> 01:27:06.602
Thank you for your kind attention.

01:27:06.602 --> 01:27:08.749
(applause)

01:27:08.749 --> 01:27:11.166
(soft music)
