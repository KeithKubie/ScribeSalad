00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.900
I'm Uta Francke, I'm a human geneticist originally from

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.840
Germany as you can hear. And I'm Emeritus Professor here

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.600
at Stanford and also Senior Medical Director at 23

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.570
and Me. You know there were early estimates of the

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.230
size of the genome simply by the, measuring the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.830
amount of DNA in a cell. People could do that

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.988
a long time ago. And so the estimate was

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:25.186
in that range of 3 billion base pairs, but the

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:28.056
idea to actually sequence it was, came up

00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:31.254
in the mid 80s when capillary sequencing was

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:34.288
developed, and many people thought it was a

00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:37.650
absolutely crazy idea because it's so huge, so

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.803
much information. The other thing to know about

00:00:40.803 --> 00:00:43.572
the Human Genome Project, when it finally got

00:00:43.572 --> 00:00:46.696
started around 1990, the first five years were

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:49.869
devoted to just mapping the chromosomes. You know,

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:52.473
people heard about chromosomes, and we know that

00:00:52.473 --> 00:00:55.015
DNA runs in chromosomes from one end to another,

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:57.433
so it would make sense, logical sense to start

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.046
sequencing at one end and then go through. But

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:03.117
instead what people did they made maps of the

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:06.290
chromosomes. And then you could focus in on specific

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.520
regions and do the sequencing there. And also to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.040
find genes that are located in specific chromosomal regions.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.040
&gt;&gt; I see. So instead of having to, sort of like you say,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.650
sequence from one end to the other you could have many starting

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.010
places in the middle of a chromosome and read out from there?

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.150
&gt;&gt; Right. And you could relate

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.000
the sequence to the chromosomal features because

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.650
chromosomes when they are treated with

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.480
a certain agents display banding patterns that

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.780
are very unique. Therefore we can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.760
identify each chromosome individually. Which is something

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.040
you cannot do when they are uniformly stained. And also we can see within

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.330
each chromosome there are certain regions. And now

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.270
we can find out in which region certain genes

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.150
are located. And all of this physical mapping as

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.350
it's called, was done before the sequencing even started.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.840
&gt;&gt; So what happened when the sequencing project

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.230
started? You mentioned it was an international collaboration

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.360
Was this really countries all over the world

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.490
or were they more from one region or another?

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.680
&gt;&gt; Well they were countries who had developed

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.080
infrastructure to take on such a big project. And

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.990
in Europe it was predominantly the U.K., France,

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.890
and Germany, and Canada was a player, as well

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.880
as Japan and China. And all of these

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.840
people got together under the chairmanship, so to say,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.220
of Francis Collins, who is now the director of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.560
the NIH. He was organizing this big international thing.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.480
And made sure there wasn't too much waste and duplication. They were dividing up

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.190
the chromosome. Sarka, you do chromosome 21.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.560
Okay, that's where we are focusing on.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.450
And then they had regular meetings, they

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.640
exchanged information. All the results were immediately

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.230
shared and put online, and therefore because

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.050
of this international effort. this led to success.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.860
&gt;&gt; Where are we now with sequencing the human

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.945
genome or many human genomes? Are we multiple

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:02.710
drafts beyond and are we reaching out to many

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.940
people. The international effort had many different people

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.000
involved. So the genome is a composite of sequences

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.370
of many individuals. And that's called the reference

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.740
genome. But what you really want to know is,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.510
what is different between the genomes of different

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.250
people who live in different parts of the world.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.530
And that was the next effort, and to really sequence individuals

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.860
with known ethnic background and find out what are the variations

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.230
between humans, and that's when it really became interesting, and that

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.300
took another ten years to become really useful to have that information.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.800
&gt;&gt; What does the size of the genome mean? Does it mean anything at all?

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.870
&gt;&gt; Well, there were some organisms with huge

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.450
genomes, like the salamanders, you know? And what is

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.290
all that sequence? It probably has no informational content.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.810
Sometimes genomes get big because viruses get in, and

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.030
they replicate, they make copies of themselves, and

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.225
that has no useful function. So there was only

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:07.360
a smaller part of the genome that is really

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.290
important because it has function and this is something

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.253
we are still working on, unraveling the functions.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.260
&gt;&gt; You also mentioned repetitive DNA when you were talking about some of, I

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.670
guess the historical context of the genome and even once we sequence it if

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.480
anyone does any research on their own, they might find that there is a

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.390
still lot of repetitive region. What do we know about those in the genome?

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.630
&gt;&gt; In most of them are just remnants, I

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.580
mean there were copies made of some early viral

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.550
intruder and now they are degenerated that bits and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.630
pieces of them, but there are still some active

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.170
copies and what they can do, they can still

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.480
make copies of themselves. And they can jump around, and

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.630
insert somewhere else in the genome, and actually cause

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.544
problems. They can cause disease, by inserting into an important

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.940
protein coding gene. So, we are not done with

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.180
dealing with all of these repetitive sequences. They're still changing.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.180
And that means there was huge variability from one person to another as well.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.660
&gt;&gt; I think that's an amazing concept too, to think about our

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.890
genomes. We sort of them as, okay, we have this static genome.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.980
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.870
&gt;&gt; And it may interact with itself to create a protein or

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.360
regulation, but the genome itself is changing even today, like you said

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.100
&gt;&gt; Quite

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.028
&gt;&gt; Moving elements.

00:05:22.028 --> 00:05:22.961
&gt;&gt; It's still evolving.
