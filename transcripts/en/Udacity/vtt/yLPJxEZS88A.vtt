00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.540
Okay, Mikey, you got answers for me?

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; sure.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:04.420
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.340
&gt;&gt; Wait, should I, do need to make any assumption, or

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.471
can I make any assumptions I want about the non-blue states?

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.986
&gt;&gt; No. It doesn't matter. [LAUGH] Actually. [LAUGH]

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:13.230
&gt;&gt; So the answer is no.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; Maybe it does.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.740
&gt;&gt; The answer is no. But it

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.300
doesn't actually matter because Remember, it's all

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.220
very stationary and Marcovian. So the only thing that matters is where you are.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.270
&gt;&gt; You're stationary Marcovian. Alright, so I think,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.080
okay. So let's, let's do the first one, then.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.030
&gt;&gt; So, so this is, this is pretty cool.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.450
So by changing the reward the way that you

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.320
did, it is now, it's not a hot beach

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.480
anymore. It's like. You know like, super awesome money beach.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.130
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's like a beach made of bacon.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.720
&gt;&gt; Sure. Okay. Let's think of it that way.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.260
Although neither of us is eating bacon at the moment.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.840
&gt;&gt; At the moment.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.530
&gt;&gt; But. [CROSSTALK]

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.560
&gt;&gt; Great, because, because then our mouths

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.560
would be full and it would be very difficult to give

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.880
this lecture. Alright so, no, no, no,no, no I mean like, even.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.570
Alright, never mind. The point is that it's awesome, and there's like

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.030
diamonds. I don't know, I just saw The Hobbit movie, and there

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.930
is a room filled entirely with treasures. And so, this is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.400
kind of like that. And so now the question is, what should

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.110
I be doing, like I should never go to the plus 1

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.690
or the minus 1, because that ends my treasure gathering. I should

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.760
just continue to stay in states that aren't those states.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.390
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.190
&gt;&gt; So I would say left for the, for the top state.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.000
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Let's say left for the bottom state.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.840
&gt;&gt; This one?

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.914
&gt;&gt; The, yes, uh-huh.

00:01:27.914 --> 00:01:28.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.530
&gt;&gt; And the other two, I need to think about for a moment.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.050
So I feel like I'd like to get away from the minus 1.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.593
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:40.810
&gt;&gt; So, like, you know, to go up.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.130
But then that would give me some chance of slipping, wouldn't it?

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.690
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. let's see, I don't want to go to the right. I don't

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.270
want to go down. I don't want to go. I'm going to go to the left.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.595
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:51.570
&gt;&gt; I'm going to bash my head against the wall, because then I get money.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.880
&gt;&gt; That's weird. There's really no pain for running into the wall?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.990
&gt;&gt; No. You just stay where you are.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.300
&gt;&gt; Alright and for the bottom one, I feel

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.620
like it's the same kind of thing. I don't

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.190
want to go to the right or to the left,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.640
cause then there's a probability that I'll slip and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.800
end up ending my game. So I'm going to go down.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.550
&gt;&gt; yeah. I like that. So most of these are

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.330
right, and one of them is wrong. Or, it's not

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.980
that it's wrong, it's just that's not as right as

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.760
it could be. Which one do you think that is?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.910
&gt;&gt; I think they're right. But if, if

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.880
there's one that I could imagine you not being

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.730
so happy with, which is the bottom one,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.960
There are two bottom ones. You mean this one?

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What would I like?

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.760
&gt;&gt; I think

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.760
you might prefer if I bash my head against the wall.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.490
&gt;&gt; No, actually, it turns out that this is

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.650
a correct answer so all four of these are correct.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.120
But in this particular state, it actually doesn't matter which

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.630
way you go. Oh, I see. A more complete answer.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.970
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.490
&gt;&gt; Would be, doesn't matter.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270
&gt;&gt; And is that true of any of the other ones? No. I guess,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.370
I guess you're right. The other ones, you have to go in the direction indicated.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.660
&gt;&gt; Right. So, by the way, just like

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.910
here, it doesn't matter which direction you go in.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.200
It's actually true for all of the other

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.410
states as well. It doesn't matter where you go

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.620
because In these three states, these are the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.750
only states where you can accidentally, you could end

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.560
the game. And in each of them, you

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.230
can take an action that guarantees that you don't

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.880
end the game. So it really doesn't matter

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.310
about where you do it in the other states.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.130
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.850
&gt;&gt; Right? So that's a good argument. This makes

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.150
a lot of sense. So at the end of the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.320
day, basically, because the reward is positive. And you're just

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.590
accumulating reward or diamonds and treasure, as you put it.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.200
You just never want to leave, so you always want to avoid either

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.937
of these states. It doesn't matter that there's a +1 here

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.740
and a -1 here. If I can stay here forever, then

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.870
I just accumulate positive reward forever. Okay, so what's the next one?

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.410
&gt;&gt; So, interesting. So now, now the beach

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.330
is really, really hot. It's minus 2, so.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.660
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. I want to get off here as quickly as I can. So definitely the top

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.940
one, I would go to the right. Just try to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.780
get, get that +1 and get out of, get outta here.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.190
&gt;&gt; Alright, so then, let's think about the bottom right.

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.330
&gt;&gt; So, in the best of all possible worlds

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.570
I go around and dump into the +1. And that

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.480
would take me again if, if I don't slip

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.950
at all one, two, three, four steps to do that

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.833
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.090
&gt;&gt; Actually wait one, two, three, three steps one

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.800
the hot sand.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.760
&gt;&gt; Yup

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.728
&gt;&gt; And I'm getting and -2 for each of those. So that's like minus 6.

00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:21.197
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:23.070
&gt;&gt; So I could get that plus 1 at the end, and that

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.330
makes it only minus 5. But I think I'd rather just get off the

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.750
beach. So I'm going to say in the bottom right to actually dive into

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.810
the pit of pain, because it can't be as bad as where I am.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.490
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.650
&gt;&gt; So, okay, so then the, the one next

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.750
to it on the left is a little trickier.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.800
If I go up to the plus 1, I get a minus 2 Followed by a +1 which is also -1.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.265
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:47.265 --> 00:04:49.770
&gt;&gt; So okay. I'm not so sure about that one.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.050
&gt;&gt; Well remember you'll always have some

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.010
probablitly of ending up back where you started

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.070
&gt;&gt; Is that true? Oh because, if I. Well no,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.535
no, that's not true if I dive straight into the

00:04:57.535 --> 00:05:00.355
-1. Then I have 0.8 chance of going to the

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:04.155
-1. 0.2 of going up. To the arrow that's labeled,

00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:06.810
0.2 going down to the blue box that's not labeled

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.143
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:08.143 --> 00:05:09.370
&gt;&gt; Wait, 0.2? No, 0.1

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.620
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.038
&gt;&gt; Whereas if I go up, right, I might stay where I am.

00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:17.860
And accrue -2, like, yeah I feel like I need a calculator for this.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but you're, I think your intuition

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.160
is right, though. Just think about it as

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.580
How much, I mean what do you think

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.650
has the best chance of most quickly ending things?

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.420
&gt;&gt; Well certainly jumping

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.310
into the -1.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.570
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.640
&gt;&gt; I think that's going to be marginally

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.880
better because there's only one chance of slippage

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.320
and delay. Where as if I take additional

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.020
step, there's two chances of slippage and delay.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.860
&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's exactly the right kind of argument to make

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.130
and, and because the -2 is so big. You're you're going to, you're

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.150
just better off ending it even if you ended in pain, in

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.190
the same way that you were in the bottom right hand corner.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.580
&gt;&gt; And so bottom left I would say the cleanest thing

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.390
would be to jump into the -1. So to go to the

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.460
right so that I can go up and get into the -1.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.120
&gt;&gt; And what's nice about that move is that is that you either end up in the

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.440
bottom right hand corner. Or you end up

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.170
staying where you are, or you end up moving

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.980
up. But in either case, you are always

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.610
sort of, you know, you never get farther away,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.220
right? Whereas if you try to go up,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.110
there's a chance that you will get farther away.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.920
&gt;&gt; Interesting. Is there a way to be sure about these?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.444
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just have to do the math.

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:23.520
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.310
Do we know how to do the math?

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you just start, you just do expectations. You

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.700
can basically just say, well what's the expected time. Since

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.030
you know what you're trying to do here is to

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.010
get to the end. You can just, you can calculate the

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.200
expected length of time it'll take you to get there.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.620
And then just, you know, multiply by all the rewards you're

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.660
going to get in the meantime. If it helps, though, I

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.110
will tell you that for any value where the reward is

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.220
less than minus 1.6284.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.935
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:54.040
&gt;&gt; This is the right thing to do.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.260
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.910
&gt;&gt; Just so you know.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.560
&gt;&gt; Alright, so you're saying you actually do know that

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.110
this is the optimum. The thing that we have here.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, I know that this is the optimum.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.360
&gt;&gt; Alright. Let me just draw out the rest of it for

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.110
you. So it's, it's I think interesting to compare this one. The bottom

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.260
right one, where you have given me negative rewards to encourage

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.640
me to end the game. With our main one up here in

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.560
the upper left. Where you have also given me some negative reward

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.110
to encourage me to end the game. If you look carefully you'll

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.110
notice that in this one, you're encouraged to end the game.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.860
But you're really encouraged to end the game at a plus 1.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.400
Here the reward is so strongly negative, you just need to end

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.600
the game. And so you end up with a different response, here.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.630
Because this is, is just as quick to get to

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.950
the minus 1 and into pain as to, take this extra

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.350
step and try to get to the plus 1. And you

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.350
end up with a different response here. Here, here, and here.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.780
&gt;&gt; That's really interesting.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is. And so, these changes matter. They matter a great deal.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.140
&gt;&gt; So, how am I suppose to choose my rewards?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.300
&gt;&gt; Carefully and with some forethought.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.780
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.640
&gt;&gt; But, you know,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.880
again There's lots of ways to think about this. So the way we've been sort of

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.820
talking about MDPs is kind of the way

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.050
we've been talking about we talked in the first

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.040
part of the course. When we talked

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.180
about having teachers and learners. You can think

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.870
of your reward as sort of the teaching

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.010
signal. Sort of the teacher telling you what

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.970
you ought to do, and what you ought not to do. But another way of thinking

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.440
about this is that because the rewards define

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.490
the MDP The rewards are our domain knowledge.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.780
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.130
&gt;&gt; So if you're going to design an MDP to

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.330
capture some world. Then you want to think carefully about how

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.010
you set the rewards in order to get the behavior that you wish.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.159
&gt;&gt; That's fair. I mean, it seems a little bit like

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.640
a cop out, but I think it seems like a necessary one.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, there's really, I mean, again. No matter what

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.140
you do, you've gotta be able to inject domain knowledge somehow. Otherwise,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.620
there's no learning to do. And in this case, the reward basaiclly

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.660
is telling you how important it is to get to the end.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.530
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.670
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright. Let's move on.
