NICHOLAS STERN

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.850
NICHOLAS: The world faces two very big challenges
in 2009. One is the world economy, which is

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.869
slowing down and in many places quite a strong
recession. We have to work on the recovery

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.270
and that means big spending and big tax cuts
in quite a few countries in the world in order

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.820
to get it back going again and many of thing
that it's going to be 2010 before some of

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.410
the rich countries really starts to move and
grow positively once more, including, I think

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.680
the UK and then the USA. That's one of our
big challenges. Second is that we have to

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.170
come to an agreement as a world on climate
change and a whole global [INAUDIBLE] setting

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.829
out what we're all going to do on climate
change by December 2009, December this year

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.890
in Copenhagen. And those are the two big challenges.
And those two big challenges in my view are

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.610
linked. A difficult time when people need
to be, need to get back to work. Is a time

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.110
when we can think about how to do things differently,
and how to do them in a much greener way.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.880
And many of the green things actually need
job quickly and are more labor intensive and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.860
energy efficiency, better insulated houses,
those are clear examples of that. So we have

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.440
an opportunity as we push for our green, as
we push for our recovery, to make that recovery

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.010
green. And, at the same time, lay the foundations
for a very strong agreement in Copenhagen

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.240
on how to cut greenhouse emissions at the
end of this year. So let's take these two

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.490
crises, the economic crisis and the politic
crisis, and put them together. It would be

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.310
great to hear what you think about how we
can handle these two crises and these are

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.580
the subjects [INAUDIBLE] World Economic Forum,
where I am now, and they're going to be the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.860
subjects when the G-20 gets together, that's
the Presidents and Prime Ministers of the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.921
most important countries in the world, the
20 biggest as it were countries in the world

00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:04.150
in terms of economics. They're getting together
in April 1st and 2nd in London and this is

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.829
the time when we need to grapple with those
decisions and your views on how we tackle

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.890
the economic crisis and the climate crisis
at the same time would be extremely valuable.
