00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000
from Duquesne Light
 

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.450
from Duquesne Light
I dared describe me as visionary I

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:24.460
I dared describe me as visionary I
 

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.190
I dared describe me as visionary I
actually would describe myself as being

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:26.200
actually would describe myself as being
 

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.740
actually would describe myself as being
scared I was so excited about the

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:31.750
scared I was so excited about the
 

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.810
scared I was so excited about the
economic opportunities for the region

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:33.820
economic opportunities for the region
 

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.940
economic opportunities for the region
and to be able to play a part in that as

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:35.950
and to be able to play a part in that as
 

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.330
and to be able to play a part in that as
a utility the biggest fear I had is that

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:39.340
a utility the biggest fear I had is that
 

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.190
a utility the biggest fear I had is that
I would screw it up and that my company

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:41.200
I would screw it up and that my company
 

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.510
I would screw it up and that my company
would screw it up under my leadership

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:42.520
would screw it up under my leadership
 

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.720
would screw it up under my leadership
and so one of the first things we did

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:45.730
and so one of the first things we did
 

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.230
and so one of the first things we did
was we reached out as I tell folks to

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240
was we reached out as I tell folks to
 

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.480
was we reached out as I tell folks to
the smartest people I know which are the

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:51.490
the smartest people I know which are the
 

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.860
the smartest people I know which are the
folks here at Carnegie Mellon University

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:52.870

knew I mean I knew the issues of having
 

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.400
knew I mean I knew the issues of having
old infrastructure having been at

we also have old water and gas lines

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:34.840
we also have old water and gas lines
 

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.150
we also have old water and gas lines
underground that we don't think about

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160
underground that we don't think about
 

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:41.180
underground that we don't think about
and so for us we began immediately

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:41.190
and so for us we began immediately
 

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.170
and so for us we began immediately
accelerating the replacement of that old

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:43.180
accelerating the replacement of that old
 

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.630
accelerating the replacement of that old
pipe and X and replacing it as quickly

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:45.640
pipe and X and replacing it as quickly
 

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.550
pipe and X and replacing it as quickly
as we could as fast as we could manage

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560
as we could as fast as we could manage
 

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.610
as we could as fast as we could manage
it but we really didn't have our hands

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:50.620
it but we really didn't have our hands
 

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.620
it but we really didn't have our hands
around what were those environmental

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:52.630
around what were those environmental
 

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.810
around what were those environmental
issues from having all this old pipe and

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:54.820
issues from having all this old pipe and

issues from having all this old pipe and
so through a partnership with Carnegie

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.370
so through a partnership with Carnegie
 

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.790
so through a partnership with Carnegie
Mellon University we've literally been

00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800
Mellon University we've literally been
 

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.790
Mellon University we've literally been
over the last couple years been going up

over the last couple years been going up
 

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.820
over the last couple years been going up
and down the streets of Pittsburgh

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:04.830

measuring the methane emissions coming
 

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.920
measuring the methane emissions coming
from our old pipes and that was really

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:10.930
from our old pipes and that was really
 

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.950
from our old pipes and that was really
important for us to understand one this

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:13.960
important for us to understand one this
 

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.440
important for us to understand one this
is a real issue it's an important issue

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:16.450
is a real issue it's an important issue
 

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.240

and if we didn't address it and take

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:21.850
and if we didn't address it and take
 

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.300
and if we didn't address it and take
ownership of it there's a strong

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:24.310
ownership of it there's a strong
 

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:25.590
ownership of it there's a strong
likelihood we're gonna screw this

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600
likelihood we're gonna screw this
 

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.980
likelihood we're gonna screw this
opportunity up and so the folks at CMU

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:28.990
opportunity up and so the folks at CMU
 

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.560

we've really integrated them into what

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:31.570
we've really integrated them into what
 

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.960
we've really integrated them into what
we call our risk management process

based purely on reliability trying to
 

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.660
based purely on reliability trying to
make sure we're reliable getting people

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:42.670
make sure we're reliable getting people
 

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:45.420
make sure we're reliable getting people
their gas we began anew prior

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:45.430
their gas we began anew prior
 

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.130
their gas we began anew prior
which overlaid that with the

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:47.140
which overlaid that with the
 

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.680
which overlaid that with the
environmental issues so where we had

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:49.690
environmental issues so where we had
 

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.170
environmental issues so where we had
significant environmental issues all of

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:52.180
significant environmental issues all of
 

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.510
significant environmental issues all of
a sudden a piece of pipe went high up on

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:54.520
a sudden a piece of pipe went high up on
 

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.210
a sudden a piece of pipe went high up on
the the pecking order for replacing that

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.220
the the pecking order for replacing that
 

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:00.660
the the pecking order for replacing that
pipe we also had the folks from CMU

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:00.670
pipe we also had the folks from CMU
 

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:03.810

that were breathing from the pipeline

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440
that were breathing from the pipeline
 

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.230
that were breathing from the pipeline
replacement so it was really a before

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240
replacement so it was really a before
 

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.500
replacement so it was really a before
and after and so we're at the point now

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:10.510
and after and so we're at the point now
 

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.990
and after and so we're at the point now
where we're going to begin literally

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000
where we're going to begin literally
 

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.600
where we're going to begin literally
describing to the communities that we're

serving one the issues that were causing
 

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.790
serving one the issues that were causing
by having these old pipes and then the

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:20.800
by having these old pipes and then the
 

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.650
by having these old pipes and then the
benefits of the pipe line replacement on

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:22.660
benefits of the pipe line replacement on
 

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.890
benefits of the pipe line replacement on
the air that we're breathing the the

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:25.900
the air that we're breathing the the
 

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.840
the air that we're breathing the the
next phase which the folks from seeing

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:27.850
next phase which the folks from seeing
 

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.220
next phase which the folks from seeing
you I think from the beginning were

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:29.230
you I think from the beginning were
 

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.570
you I think from the beginning were
anxious to do was not just to help us

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580
anxious to do was not just to help us
 

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.090
anxious to do was not just to help us
prioritize the old pipe based on leakage

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:36.100
prioritize the old pipe based on leakage
 

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.940
prioritize the old pipe based on leakage
but actually be able to predict before

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:38.950
but actually be able to predict before
 

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.310
but actually be able to predict before
we had leakage the replacement of those

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320
we had leakage the replacement of those
 

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.930
we had leakage the replacement of those
pipes and so that's really the next

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:42.940
pipes and so that's really the next
 

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.420
pipes and so that's really the next
phase of our partnership which is really

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:45.430
phase of our partnership which is really
 

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.850
phase of our partnership which is really
exciting so this is not fixing

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:47.860
exciting so this is not fixing
 

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.980
exciting so this is not fixing
environmental issues but avoiding those

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:49.990
environmental issues but avoiding those
 

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.910
environmental issues but avoiding those
environmental issues and so we're I

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:52.920
environmental issues and so we're I
 

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.290
environmental issues and so we're I
don't think it's visionary and I think

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:55.300
don't think it's visionary and I think
 

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.420
don't think it's visionary and I think
it's fear of screwing up everything

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:57.430
it's fear of screwing up everything
 

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.480
it's fear of screwing up everything
these folks are talking about but it's

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.490
these folks are talking about but it's
 

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.970
these folks are talking about but it's
been incredibly enlightening to people

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:02.980
been incredibly enlightening to people
 

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.670
been incredibly enlightening to people
in my industry and my the people that

we're doing things a little bit

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:16.510
we're doing things a little bit
 

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.840
we're doing things a little bit
differently where we're innovating to

offer an environmental benefit to the
 

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.910
offer an environmental benefit to the
region and ultimately we believe an

region and ultimately we believe an
 

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.360
region and ultimately we believe an
economic benefit to us as well so

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.370
economic benefit to us as well so
 

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.820
economic benefit to us as well so

operational upset to relieve pressure
 

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.030
operational upset to relieve pressure
from that operational upset you send a

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:39.040
from that operational upset you send a
 

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.380
from that operational upset you send a
stream of gas or some mode of product up

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:43.390

situation it's occurring literally at
 

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.840
situation it's occurring literally at
the ground level and most of the

the ground level and most of the
 

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.340
the ground level and most of the
emissions but not all most of the

emissions but not all most of the
 

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.370
emissions but not all most of the
emissions are burned off at the flare so

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:56.380
emissions are burned off at the flare so
 

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.210
emissions are burned off at the flare so
and and 98 99 % when I say most but

and and 98 99 % when I say most but
 

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.770

are typically pretty large so what we

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:12.770
are typically pretty large so what we
 

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.550
are typically pretty large so what we
did at this plant was we developed sort

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:15.560
did at this plant was we developed sort
 

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.670
did at this plant was we developed sort
of an internal pipeline network where we

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:18.680
of an internal pipeline network where we
 

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.710
of an internal pipeline network where we
will circulate the ethane if we have an

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720
will circulate the ethane if we have an
 

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.960
will circulate the ethane if we have an
upset and and we'll be able to do this

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:22.970
upset and and we'll be able to do this
 

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.330
upset and and we'll be able to do this
for approximately 24 hours so if you

for approximately 24 hours so if you
 

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.210
for approximately 24 hours so if you
have a situation in a plant where in

within a shift or a shift or two they're
 

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.100
within a shift or a shift or two they're
typically on 12-hour shifts you could

you could fix the whatever the issue was
 

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.200
you could fix the whatever the issue was
that was causing the upset we will have

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:38.210
that was causing the upset we will have
 

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.120
that was causing the upset we will have
circulated the ethane not have all the

the emissions that would have been
 

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.470
the emissions that would have been
reported and well there's an upfront

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480
reported and well there's an upfront
 

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.310
reported and well there's an upfront
cost for us to build that on the backend

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:47.320
cost for us to build that on the backend
 

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.960

after years of operating there'll be a

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:49.970
after years of operating there'll be a
 

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.550
after years of operating there'll be a
benefit cuz we wouldn't have wasted all

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:51.560
benefit cuz we wouldn't have wasted all
 

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.860

the bad thing that we will have had to
 

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.900
the bad thing that we will have had to
send addition to the flare so that's not

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:55.910
send addition to the flare so that's not
 

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.880

is a way we've looked at things
 

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.300
is a way we've looked at things
differently and see how we can offer

differently and see how we can offer
 

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:16.840

happen and in the Gulf Coast storage is
 

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.060
happen and in the Gulf Coast storage is
there and easy for people to use and we

there and easy for people to use and we
 

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.590

it is a an ongoing significant effort
 

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:20.530
it is a an ongoing significant effort
and if that is accomplished I think that

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:20.540
and if that is accomplished I think that
 

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.169
and if that is accomplished I think that
that'll certainly be a turning of the

to go through permitting on this but the
piping is underground the storage

00:26:41.749 --> 00:26:41.759
piping is underground the storage
 

00:26:41.759 --> 00:26:43.639
piping is underground the storage
facilities are also underground it's not

00:26:43.639 --> 00:26:43.649
facilities are also underground it's not
 

00:26:43.649 --> 00:26:46.730
facilities are also underground it's not
a it's not a noticeable piece of

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740
a it's not a noticeable piece of
 

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.320
a it's not a noticeable piece of
infrastructure for the most part but it

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:48.330
infrastructure for the most part but it
 

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.669
infrastructure for the most part but it
is critical you've got to be able to

00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679
is critical you've got to be able to
 

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:52.369
is critical you've got to be able to
move the the NGOs around the region so

00:26:52.369 --> 00:26:52.379
move the the NGOs around the region so
 

00:26:52.379 --> 00:26:53.960
move the the NGOs around the region so
that manufacturing can take place in

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:53.970
that manufacturing can take place in
 

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.090
that manufacturing can take place in
different locations but I think the

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100
different locations but I think the
 

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.840
different locations but I think the
there is interest in there is a storage

00:26:59.840 --> 00:26:59.850
there is interest in there is a storage
 

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.789
there is interest in there is a storage
facility in Ohio that Goldman Sachs has

00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799
facility in Ohio that Goldman Sachs has
 

00:27:01.799 --> 00:27:03.739
facility in Ohio that Goldman Sachs has
an interest in so I think that the

00:27:03.739 --> 00:27:03.749
an interest in so I think that the
 

00:27:03.749 --> 00:27:05.119
an interest in so I think that the
potential is there for the private

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:05.129
potential is there for the private
 

00:27:05.129 --> 00:27:06.769
potential is there for the private
sector to get engaged at the right level

00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779
sector to get engaged at the right level
 

00:27:06.779 --> 00:27:09.739
sector to get engaged at the right level
but at this point it's still an effort

00:27:09.739 --> 00:27:09.749
but at this point it's still an effort
 

00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:13.909
but at this point it's still an effort
to develop the engineering to show how

00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919
to develop the engineering to show how
 

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:17.450
to develop the engineering to show how
best to do stasi forging the future

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460
best to do stasi forging the future
 

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.359
best to do stasi forging the future
report there were there specific

00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:19.369
report there were there specific
 

00:27:19.369 --> 00:27:21.230
report there were there specific
recommendations in terms of what

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240
recommendations in terms of what
 

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.720
recommendations in terms of what
government or anybody else ought to be

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:23.730
government or anybody else ought to be
 

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.350
government or anybody else ought to be
doing to realize the benefits yes excuse

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360
doing to realize the benefits yes excuse
 

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.560
doing to realize the benefits yes excuse
me there were specific recommendations

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:29.570
me there were specific recommendations
 

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:32.299
me there were specific recommendations
again you have this huge supply but the

00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:32.309
again you have this huge supply but the
 

00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:34.909
again you have this huge supply but the
regional demand is really really low and

00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919
regional demand is really really low and
 

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.489
regional demand is really really low and
so the key question was how can you

00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:37.499
so the key question was how can you
 

00:27:37.499 --> 00:27:39.649
so the key question was how can you
build regional demand more regional

00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659
build regional demand more regional
 

00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:42.039
build regional demand more regional
demand so that the region really

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:42.049
demand so that the region really
 

00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:45.200
demand so that the region really
benefits from the economic potential so

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.210
benefits from the economic potential so
 

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.149
benefits from the economic potential so
one of the strategies was what Morgan

00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159
one of the strategies was what Morgan
 

00:27:47.159 --> 00:27:49.580
one of the strategies was what Morgan
said just getting more natural gas into

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:49.590
said just getting more natural gas into
 

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:52.700
said just getting more natural gas into
homes the second strategy was around how

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:52.710
homes the second strategy was around how
 

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.659
homes the second strategy was around how
to develop economic clusters that where

00:27:56.659 --> 00:27:56.669
to develop economic clusters that where
 

00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:58.759
to develop economic clusters that where
you can get let's say advanced

00:27:58.759 --> 00:27:58.769
you can get let's say advanced
 

00:27:58.769 --> 00:28:03.739
you can get let's say advanced
manufacturing data centers users of a

00:28:03.739 --> 00:28:03.749
manufacturing data centers users of a
 

00:28:03.749 --> 00:28:06.230
manufacturing data centers users of a
lot of natural gas that would want

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240
lot of natural gas that would want
 

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.100
lot of natural gas that would want
low-cost natural gas to come and develop

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.110
low-cost natural gas to come and develop
 

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.039
low-cost natural gas to come and develop
these economic clusters and that plays

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:13.049
these economic clusters and that plays
 

00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:15.789
these economic clusters and that plays
right into this region strength which is

00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799
right into this region strength which is
 

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:19.369
right into this region strength which is
robotics innovation manufacturing and so

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:19.379
robotics innovation manufacturing and so
 

00:28:19.379 --> 00:28:21.230
robotics innovation manufacturing and so
that was this the second strategy was

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240
that was this the second strategy was
 

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.749
that was this the second strategy was
around those clusters the third strategy

00:28:23.749 --> 00:28:23.759
around those clusters the third strategy
 

00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:26.029
around those clusters the third strategy
was actually around advancing the

00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039
was actually around advancing the
 

00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:27.529
was actually around advancing the
infrastructure to export

00:28:27.529 --> 00:28:27.539
infrastructure to export
 

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.989
infrastructure to export
some of the gas so there is so much gas

00:28:29.989 --> 00:28:29.999
some of the gas so there is so much gas
 

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:32.180
some of the gas so there is so much gas
here that probably you could never use

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:32.190
here that probably you could never use
 

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.789
here that probably you could never use
it here even if you had a lot of data

00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799
it here even if you had a lot of data
 

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:37.639
it here even if you had a lot of data
centers and more crackers so getting

00:28:37.639 --> 00:28:37.649
centers and more crackers so getting
 

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.769
centers and more crackers so getting
some of this gas to the Gulf Coast's

00:28:39.769 --> 00:28:39.779
some of this gas to the Gulf Coast's
 

00:28:39.779 --> 00:28:42.139
some of this gas to the Gulf Coast's
which can link it into global markets is

00:28:42.139 --> 00:28:42.149
which can link it into global markets is
 

00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:48.169

so Stacey the question for you is so why

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820
so Stacey the question for you is so why
 

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.950
so Stacey the question for you is so why
would Chevron participate in it it needs

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960
would Chevron participate in it it needs
 

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.560
would Chevron participate in it it needs
to be said that there's standards

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:54.570
to be said that there's standards
 

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.169
to be said that there's standards
created by this Center or in every case

00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179
created by this Center or in every case
 

00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:59.269
created by this Center or in every case
at least as stringent and in most cases

00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279
at least as stringent and in most cases
 

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:02.479
at least as stringent and in most cases
more stringent than the state standards

00:30:02.479 --> 00:30:02.489
more stringent than the state standards
 

00:30:02.489 --> 00:30:04.940
more stringent than the state standards
in any state in which Chevron was

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:04.950
in any state in which Chevron was
 

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:06.889
in any state in which Chevron was
working and true for the other companies

on that and we can declare a success I
think Jerry in that like you said that

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200
think Jerry in that like you said that
 

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.279
think Jerry in that like you said that
we have raised the standard actually the

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:31.289
we have raised the standard actually the
 

00:30:31.289 --> 00:30:33.889
we have raised the standard actually the
regulatory standard because it makes

00:30:33.889 --> 00:30:33.899
regulatory standard because it makes
 

00:30:33.899 --> 00:30:36.470
regulatory standard because it makes
sense for all of us to operate to the

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480
sense for all of us to operate to the
 

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.190
sense for all of us to operate to the
highest economic

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:38.200
highest economic
 

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.130
highest economic
standard environmental standard it and

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:41.140
standard environmental standard it and
 

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.810
standard environmental standard it and
y'all touched on this as well right

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:42.820
y'all touched on this as well right
 

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:46.560
y'all touched on this as well right
I mean emissions accidents pollution is

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:46.570
I mean emissions accidents pollution is
 

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.020
I mean emissions accidents pollution is
not good for any of us and it's not good

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:49.030
not good for any of us and it's not good
 

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.730
not good for any of us and it's not good
for our industry and so I think you'll

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:50.740
for our industry and so I think you'll
 

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.190
for our industry and so I think you'll
find globally anywhere that Chevron

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200
find globally anywhere that Chevron
 

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.320

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:57.870
played in and and since that time you
 

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.069
played in and and since that time you
know we now have

00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079
know we now have
 

00:34:59.079 --> 00:35:02.549
know we now have

flying devices that actually are
 

00:35:05.849 --> 00:35:09.059
flying devices that actually are
basically flying along the bridges in

00:35:09.059 --> 00:35:09.069
basically flying along the bridges in
 

00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:11.009
basically flying along the bridges in
western Pennsylvania that we have quite

00:35:11.009 --> 00:35:11.019
western Pennsylvania that we have quite
 

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:12.900
western Pennsylvania that we have quite
a few of and a lot of them have gas

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:12.910
a few of and a lot of them have gas
 

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.509
a few of and a lot of them have gas
lines underneath and typically

00:35:14.509 --> 00:35:14.519
lines underneath and typically
 

00:35:14.519 --> 00:35:18.140
lines underneath and typically
historically we would have folks

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:18.150
historically we would have folks
 

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.309
historically we would have folks
underneath those bridges checking those

underneath those bridges checking those
 

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:23.759
underneath those bridges checking those
pipes these drones now go flying through

pipes these drones now go flying through
 

00:35:23.769 --> 00:35:26.130
pipes these drones now go flying through
the air and give us better better data

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:26.140
the air and give us better better data
 

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.309
the air and give us better better data
and it's obviously much safer we've also

00:35:29.309 --> 00:35:29.319
and it's obviously much safer we've also
 

00:35:29.319 --> 00:35:31.920

been introduced to a robotics strategy

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:31.930
been introduced to a robotics strategy

00:35:40.319 --> 00:35:40.329
and literally take photos of the inside
 

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:43.049
and literally take photos of the inside
of the pipe to give us a real real-time

00:35:43.049 --> 00:35:43.059
of the pipe to give us a real real-time
 

00:35:43.059 --> 00:35:45.449

traditional industries like mine can can

00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:07.059
traditional industries like mine can can
 

00:37:07.059 --> 00:37:09.390
traditional industries like mine can can
embrace and really partner with some of

these really smart young people
 

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.760
these really smart young people
and I so I think it's we're just at the

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:13.770
and I so I think it's we're just at the
 

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:15.440
and I so I think it's we're just at the
beginning of it and I think it's gonna

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.450
beginning of it and I think it's gonna
 

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.110
beginning of it and I think it's gonna
be dramatically probably more quickly

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:18.120
be dramatically probably more quickly
 

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.540
be dramatically probably more quickly
than anything make us so much more

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:20.550
than anything make us so much more
 

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:22.970
than anything make us so much more
responsible and that fear that I started

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980
responsible and that fear that I started
 

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.960
responsible and that fear that I started
with not only put that to ease but also

help you and people that we serve come

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:29.610
help you and people that we serve come
 

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.180
help you and people that we serve come
up with environmental answers that make

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:32.190
up with environmental answers that make
 

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.220
up with environmental answers that make
economic sense that take advantage of

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.230
economic sense that take advantage of
 

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.650
economic sense that take advantage of
this and as you say that those always

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:36.660
this and as you say that those always
 

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.930

some environmental impacts but taking

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940
some environmental impacts but taking
 

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.970
some environmental impacts but taking
those next steps I think there's a lot

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980
those next steps I think there's a lot
 

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.760
those next steps I think there's a lot
of opportunities for traditional ways

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:43.770
of opportunities for traditional ways
 

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:45.830
of opportunities for traditional ways
changing and making it a much much

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:45.840

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.890
changing and making it a much much
better path forward thank you Anna

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:48.900
better path forward thank you Anna

better path forward thank you Anna
time for one more we have a question is

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:56.610
time for one more we have a question is
 

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.970
time for one more we have a question is
the increasing share of natural gas for

00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980

your priority for replacement and
 

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.220
your priority for replacement and
upgrade of old infrastructure I think

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:07.230
upgrade of old infrastructure I think
 

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.860
upgrade of old infrastructure I think
that's for uh no it's I guess it's for

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:09.870
that's for uh no it's I guess it's for
 

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:15.410
that's for uh no it's I guess it's for
me I would say what's really you know we

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420
me I would say what's really you know we
 

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:17.810
me I would say what's really you know we
have changed our infrastructure strategy

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820
have changed our infrastructure strategy
 

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.990
have changed our infrastructure strategy
almost completely around the

almost completely around the
 

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.730
almost completely around the
environmental impacts I would say that

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740
environmental impacts I would say that
 

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.190
environmental impacts I would say that
nothing more has more impact on how we

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200
nothing more has more impact on how we
 

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.900
nothing more has more impact on how we
were and how we would have done it

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:26.910
were and how we would have done it
 

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.580
were and how we would have done it
versus how we're doing it

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:28.590
versus how we're doing it
 

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.640
versus how we're doing it
what pipes were replacing those old

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:31.650
what pipes were replacing those old
 

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:33.770
what pipes were replacing those old
pipes with and the ability to

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780
pipes with and the ability to
 

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.590
pipes with and the ability to
potentially serve more gas to our

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:36.600
potentially serve more gas to our
 

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.080
potentially serve more gas to our
customers and bring more gas in I think

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.090
customers and bring more gas in I think
 

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.910
customers and bring more gas in I think
is is probably an answer to that

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920
is is probably an answer to that
 

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.640
is is probably an answer to that

of this region not the past how we used
it so we've got building capacity to

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:49.170
it so we've got building capacity to
 

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.660
it so we've got building capacity to
serve rural communities building

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:50.670
serve rural communities building

we're not replacing pipe for pipe we're
 

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.670
we're not replacing pipe for pipe we're
actually looking at what the future of

actually looking at what the future of
 

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.040
actually looking at what the future of
this region looks like and we want

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:07.050
this region looks like and we want
 

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.860
this region looks like and we want
infrastructure to be in place so that as

at mine that's right so there's a couple
 

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.239
at mine that's right so there's a couple
of questions related to pipelines okay

00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:53.249
of questions related to pipelines okay
 

00:39:53.249 --> 00:39:57.079

and the export of this fuel resource so

00:39:57.079 --> 00:39:57.089
and the export of this fuel resource so
 

00:39:57.089 --> 00:39:59.660
and the export of this fuel resource so
are there any plans on thinking about

00:39:59.660 --> 00:39:59.670
are there any plans on thinking about
 

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.779
are there any plans on thinking about
keeping that resource here for both

00:40:02.779 --> 00:40:02.789
keeping that resource here for both
 

00:40:02.789 --> 00:40:07.809
keeping that resource here for both
people and workforce and productivity

00:40:07.809 --> 00:40:07.819
 

00:40:07.819 --> 00:40:12.709
good stays to restate my earlier comment

00:40:12.709 --> 00:40:12.719
good stays to restate my earlier comment
 

00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:19.249
good stays to restate my earlier comment
around how large the resource is the

00:40:19.249 --> 00:40:19.259
around how large the resource is the
 

00:40:19.259 --> 00:40:22.729
around how large the resource is the
McKinsey study that we worked on did not

00:40:22.729 --> 00:40:22.739
McKinsey study that we worked on did not
 

00:40:22.739 --> 00:40:24.769
McKinsey study that we worked on did not
model that it was possible to use all

00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:24.779
model that it was possible to use all
 

00:40:24.779 --> 00:40:28.099
model that it was possible to use all
that gas here and so it makes economic

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:28.109
that gas here and so it makes economic
 

00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:33.079
that gas here and so it makes economic
sense to export it out of the region and

00:40:33.079 --> 00:40:33.089
sense to export it out of the region and
 

00:40:33.089 --> 00:40:36.650
sense to export it out of the region and
if you can get it to the Gulf Coast

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660
if you can get it to the Gulf Coast
 

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.289
if you can get it to the Gulf Coast
the gas can be liquefied it can go on a

00:40:39.289 --> 00:40:39.299
the gas can be liquefied it can go on a
 

00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:41.719
the gas can be liquefied it can go on a
barge and it can go to any demand center

00:40:41.719 --> 00:40:41.729
barge and it can go to any demand center
 

00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:45.140
barge and it can go to any demand center
anywhere in the world and so you know I

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:45.150
anywhere in the world and so you know I
 

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.680
anywhere in the world and so you know I
think it's better to capture as most

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:48.690
think it's better to capture as most
 

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.319
think it's better to capture as most
economic value as you can in this region

00:40:51.319 --> 00:40:51.329
economic value as you can in this region
 

00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:52.910
economic value as you can in this region
and that's what if these strategies are

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920
and that's what if these strategies are
 

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.450
and that's what if these strategies are
successful but it's actually you can't

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460
successful but it's actually you can't
 

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.640
successful but it's actually you can't
use all the gas here it's so big is what

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:58.650
use all the gas here it's so big is what
 

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:00.979
use all the gas here it's so big is what
the study found yeah I think one of the

00:41:00.979 --> 00:41:00.989
the study found yeah I think one of the
 

00:41:00.989 --> 00:41:05.059
the study found yeah I think one of the
statistics that we saw and I use this if

00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:05.069
statistics that we saw and I use this if
 

00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:07.370
statistics that we saw and I use this if
I'm talking to Governor wolf or anybody

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380
I'm talking to Governor wolf or anybody
 

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.259
I'm talking to Governor wolf or anybody
and this is the fence of the

00:41:09.259 --> 00:41:09.269
and this is the fence of the
 

00:41:09.269 --> 00:41:11.870
and this is the fence of the
regionalization that you've created but

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880
regionalization that you've created but
 

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.279
regionalization that you've created but
if you just look at what's in

00:41:13.279 --> 00:41:13.289
if you just look at what's in
 

00:41:13.289 --> 00:41:16.219
if you just look at what's in
Pennsylvania of the Marcellus and Utica

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:16.229
Pennsylvania of the Marcellus and Utica
 

00:41:16.229 --> 00:41:18.559
Pennsylvania of the Marcellus and Utica
in just in Pennsylvania it's enough to

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:18.569
in just in Pennsylvania it's enough to
 

00:41:18.569 --> 00:41:20.630
in just in Pennsylvania it's enough to
power to provide the United States its

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640
power to provide the United States its
 

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.370
power to provide the United States its
entire energy needs so if there were no

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380
entire energy needs so if there were no
 

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.350
entire energy needs so if there were no
other energy source

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:23.360
other energy source
 

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.980
other energy source
other than this like the next 15 years

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:25.990
other than this like the next 15 years
 

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.990
other than this like the next 15 years
and so there's a lot of gas here and

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000
and so there's a lot of gas here and
 

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.930
and so there's a lot of gas here and
we're never gonna be able to utilize all

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:31.940
we're never gonna be able to utilize all
 

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.280
we're never gonna be able to utilize all
of it here and I think that's the

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:33.290
of it here and I think that's the
 

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.590
of it here and I think that's the
obvious and I would just add from an

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:35.600
obvious and I would just add from an
 

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.330
obvious and I would just add from an
economic development standpoint I said

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:37.340
economic development standpoint I said
 

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.800
economic development standpoint I said
we're particularly interested in natural

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:38.810
we're particularly interested in natural
 

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:41.140
we're particularly interested in natural
gas liquids our job is to bring more

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:41.150
gas liquids our job is to bring more
 

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.240
gas liquids our job is to bring more
crackers and more propane facilities to

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.250
crackers and more propane facilities to
 

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.090
crackers and more propane facilities to
the region to use this NGLs the problem

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:46.100
the region to use this NGLs the problem
 

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.590
the region to use this NGLs the problem
is it all comes out of the ground

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:47.600
is it all comes out of the ground
 

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.270
is it all comes out of the ground
together so if we want the natural gas

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280
together so if we want the natural gas
 

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.310
together so if we want the natural gas
liquids to turn into plastics to build

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:51.320
liquids to turn into plastics to build
 

00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.440
liquids to turn into plastics to build
manufacturing facilities we need to

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:53.450
manufacturing facilities we need to
 

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:55.540
manufacturing facilities we need to
bring the methane out with it and we

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:55.550
bring the methane out with it and we
 

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.070
bring the methane out with it and we
can't use it all here so we're going to

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.080
can't use it all here so we're going to
 

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.710
can't use it all here so we're going to
have to export at least some of it so

00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720
have to export at least some of it so
 

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.420
have to export at least some of it so
let me just close this by saying
