00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 60.9 degrees.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We get that by saying, well, the opposite and the adjacent side,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so we know that the tan β is equal to opposite over adjacent--18/10.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But we want to know what β is itself.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We actually have to look at the arctangent of 18/10.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If we look at the arctangent of 18/10, we get 60.9 degrees.
