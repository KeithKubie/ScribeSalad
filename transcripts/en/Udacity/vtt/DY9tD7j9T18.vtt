00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.235
So I mean--that's an area we can probably use a lot more computation

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:06.040
and use it profitably and actually see the difference,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.037
so one of the questions I always ask my students when I'm teaching is,

00:00:09.037 --> 00:00:11.634
"What are you going to do with 100 times more compute power?"

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:15.046
So how about in the more high performance computing area?

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:17.437
What are people going to do with 100 times more flops?

00:00:17.437 --> 00:00:21.521
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well there are some problems which have limitless amounts of computational need--

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.119
things like understanding disease.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.118
The work being done by folks like Vijay Pande at Stanford,

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:33.114
where you're trying to simulate the actual progression of a cell

00:00:33.114 --> 00:00:35.246
as it gets attacked in the disease.

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:37.495
He's got a project working on Alzheimer's

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:43.693
where he's trying to actually witness a nerve cell and watch a nerve cell die at the atomic level,

00:00:43.693 --> 00:00:47.494
simulating every gene and protein and cell membrane

00:00:47.494 --> 00:00:51.912
as it gets infected and eventually deteriorates.

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:55.869
Just think how many atoms are in a cell and simulating that in real time

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:02.450
or at least in a timeline where you can actually understand disease down to the actual chemical level.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.200
It's really going to provide a cool breakthrough for how we treat those things

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.578
and understand the very complicated pathways

00:01:08.578 --> 00:01:14.411
and then design the right kind of drug that can get in there and stop it at the right point and keep people healthy.

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:18.217
I think that's one of the cooler things we are going to be doing in computers.
