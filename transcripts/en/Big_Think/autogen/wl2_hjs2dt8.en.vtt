problems in this country for years has
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.910

been through classroom based education

education and so on and and if you look
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.900
education and so on and and if you look
at these programs and you look at

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
at these programs and you look at
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.819
at these programs and you look at
evaluations of those programs you can't

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
evaluations of those programs you can't
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.369

help but come away disappointed and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379
help but come away disappointed and
 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349

which is all over the country doesn't
work at all and we know that from good

education I learned recently doesn't

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
education I learned recently doesn't
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.219
education I learned recently doesn't
work I'm so educating kids about

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229
work I'm so educating kids about
 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.219
work I'm so educating kids about
avoiding risky or harmful situations or

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
avoiding risky or harmful situations or
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.920
avoiding risky or harmful situations or
substances doesn't seem to make much of

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
substances doesn't seem to make much of
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.990
substances doesn't seem to make much of
a difference and and I think that if you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
a difference and and I think that if you
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.590
a difference and and I think that if you
look at basic social psychology that's

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
look at basic social psychology that's
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.510
look at basic social psychology that's
not surprising because what most studies

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
not surprising because what most studies
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.420
not surprising because what most studies
show is that it's not hard to change

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
show is that it's not hard to change
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069
show is that it's not hard to change
people's attitudes and knowledge but

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
people's attitudes and knowledge but
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.630
people's attitudes and knowledge but
it's really hard to change their

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
it's really hard to change their
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.630
it's really hard to change their
behavior and so in our work

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
behavior and so in our work
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730
behavior and so in our work
we've asked well why is it that kids

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
we've asked well why is it that kids
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.580
we've asked well why is it that kids
know that these things are risky know

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
know that these things are risky know
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.200
know that these things are risky know
that these things are harmful and still

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
that these things are harmful and still
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.920
that these things are harmful and still
do them anyway I mean you know huge

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
do them anyway I mean you know huge
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.899
do them anyway I mean you know huge
proportionate kids have sex without

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
proportionate kids have sex without
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.330
proportionate kids have sex without
using condoms I mean they've been told

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
using condoms I mean they've been told
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490
using condoms I mean they've been told
over and over and over again that that's

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
over and over and over again that that's
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.200
over and over and over again that that's
dangerous a large force to kids become

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
dangerous a large force to kids become
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.209
dangerous a large force to kids become
cigarette smokers regular smokers

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
cigarette smokers regular smokers
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.709
cigarette smokers regular smokers
they've been told over and over again

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719
they've been told over and over again
 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.199
they've been told over and over again
that that's dangerous why do they do

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
that that's dangerous why do they do
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.150
that that's dangerous why do they do
these things and my argument is is not

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160
these things and my argument is is not
 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.000
these things and my argument is is not
that we should stop telling them the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010
that we should stop telling them the
 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.930
that we should stop telling them the
facts about risky behavior but that we

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940
facts about risky behavior but that we
 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.010
facts about risky behavior but that we
need to understand

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020
need to understand
 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.740
need to understand
that kids engage in a lot of us taking

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
that kids engage in a lot of us taking
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.030
that kids engage in a lot of us taking
behavior for reasons that have nothing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040
behavior for reasons that have nothing
 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.410
behavior for reasons that have nothing
to do with their knowledge or beliefs

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
to do with their knowledge or beliefs
 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.740
to do with their knowledge or beliefs
they have to do with something that I

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750
they have to do with something that I
 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.840
they have to do with something that I
talked about earlier which has to do

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850
talked about earlier which has to do
 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.030
talked about earlier which has to do
with this increase in sensation seeking

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040
with this increase in sensation seeking
 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.040
with this increase in sensation seeking
and thrill seeking that occurs during

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050
and thrill seeking that occurs during
 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.570
and thrill seeking that occurs during
early adolescence that has to do with

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
early adolescence that has to do with
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.480
early adolescence that has to do with
changes in the brain and it has to do

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490
changes in the brain and it has to do
 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.780
changes in the brain and it has to do
with the still maturing control system

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
with the still maturing control system
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.150
with the still maturing control system
that regulates impulses that allows us

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
that regulates impulses that allows us
 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.180
that regulates impulses that allows us
to make better decisions and and middle

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190
to make better decisions and and middle

there's a time when you have a very

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
there's a time when you have a very
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.070
there's a time when you have a very
easily aroused reward system which makes

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080
easily aroused reward system which makes
 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.330
easily aroused reward system which makes
you less attentive to the possible costs

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340
you less attentive to the possible costs
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.000
you less attentive to the possible costs
of a risky decision and more attentive

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
of a risky decision and more attentive
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.310
of a risky decision and more attentive
to the immediate rewards so you have

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
to the immediate rewards so you have
 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.100
to the immediate rewards so you have
this hyper arousal reward system and you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110
this hyper arousal reward system and you
 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.900
this hyper arousal reward system and you
have this immature impulse control

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910
have this immature impulse control
 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.190
have this immature impulse control
system so kids pursue their rewards and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200
system so kids pursue their rewards and
 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.020
system so kids pursue their rewards and
they don't have the brakes to you know

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030
they don't have the brakes to you know
 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.600
they don't have the brakes to you know
to put on so how can how can we address

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610
to put on so how can how can we address
 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.270
to put on so how can how can we address
this because clearly you know when you

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280
this because clearly you know when you
 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.190
this because clearly you know when you
were on a couch making out with your

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
were on a couch making out with your
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.680
were on a couch making out with your
girlfriend and you're aroused you know

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
girlfriend and you're aroused you know
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.600
girlfriend and you're aroused you know
if you don't have the maturity of

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610
if you don't have the maturity of
 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.310
if you don't have the maturity of
judgment to stop and say you know we

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320
judgment to stop and say you know we
 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.870
judgment to stop and say you know we
should use a condom before we go any

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880
should use a condom before we go any
 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.510
should use a condom before we go any
further you're going to have unsafe sex

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520
further you're going to have unsafe sex
 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.090
further you're going to have unsafe sex
so the the the approach I think we need

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100
so the the the approach I think we need
 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.880
so the the the approach I think we need
to take for many of these behaviors is

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890
to take for many of these behaviors is
 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.100
to take for many of these behaviors is
by changing the context in which kids

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110
by changing the context in which kids
 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.320
by changing the context in which kids
live not by trying to change the kid I

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330
live not by trying to change the kid I
 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.180
live not by trying to change the kid I
don't think we can change this aspect of

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190
don't think we can change this aspect of
 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.900
don't think we can change this aspect of
adolescence nor do I think we should

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
adolescence nor do I think we should
 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.810
adolescence nor do I think we should
what do I mean by changing the context

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820
what do I mean by changing the context
 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.680
what do I mean by changing the context
graduated driver's licensing is a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.530
graduated driver's licensing is a
perfect example of this it is well

when they're driving by themselves we
 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:13.949
when they're driving by themselves we
did a study in our lab in which we

did a study in our lab in which we
 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.420
did a study in our lab in which we
