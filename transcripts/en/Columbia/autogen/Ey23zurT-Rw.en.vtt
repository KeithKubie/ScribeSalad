00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:42.860
development and defeating poverty and
 

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.110
development and defeating poverty and
for that is good to ask us how well we

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120
for that is good to ask us how well we
 

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.690
for that is good to ask us how well we
have done or how poorly we have done and

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:49.700
have done or how poorly we have done and
 

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.900
have done or how poorly we have done and
the answer to that question depends with

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:52.910
the answer to that question depends with
 

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:57.160
the answer to that question depends with
whom we compare ourselves if we compare

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.170
whom we compare ourselves if we compare
 

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.050
whom we compare ourselves if we compare
yourself with the world we Latin America

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.060

Chile has done a very good job

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.220
Chile has done a very good job
 

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.460
Chile has done a very good job
particularly as you can see there in the

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.470
particularly as you can see there in the
 

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:06.610
particularly as you can see there in the
last 30 years when we started to grow

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:06.620
last 30 years when we started to grow
 

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.500
last 30 years when we started to grow
much faster than the rest of the region

much faster than the rest of the region
 

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.770
much faster than the rest of the region
and that's why we were able to move from

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:11.780
and that's why we were able to move from
 

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.510
and that's why we were able to move from
one of the lowest position in terms of

for a long period of time it was a kind

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:29.400
for a long period of time it was a kind
 

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.120
for a long period of time it was a kind
of time then we lost I will lag behind

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.130
of time then we lost I will lag behind
 

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.230
of time then we lost I will lag behind
but we have been able to recover and we

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240
but we have been able to recover and we
 

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.190
but we have been able to recover and we
are growing much faster than the rest of

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:40.200
are growing much faster than the rest of
 

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.190
are growing much faster than the rest of
the world and therefore we are moving in

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:43.200
the world and therefore we are moving in
 

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.310
the world and therefore we are moving in
the right direction right now chili is

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320
the right direction right now chili is
 

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:50.420
the right direction right now chili is
in a position with a 20,000 per capita

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:50.430

of the OECD and therefore our task is

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660
of the OECD and therefore our task is
 

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.890
of the OECD and therefore our task is
not just to do better than other Latin

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:09.900
not just to do better than other Latin
 

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.000

in all the real meaning of that world
but if we compare yourself with the best

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:19.710
but if we compare yourself with the best
 

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.760
but if we compare yourself with the best
you see that except for the last three

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:22.770
you see that except for the last three
 

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.370
you see that except for the last three
years we also have been lagging behind

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380
years we also have been lagging behind
 

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.310

what we need to have to achieve before
the end of this take what is the mission

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:37.260
the end of this take what is the mission
 

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.520
the end of this take what is the mission
of the generation of the Bicentennial

which is our responsibility and
 

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.010
which is our responsibility and
basically our mission is a very

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:46.020
basically our mission is a very
 

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:49.100
basically our mission is a very
ambitious one a very novel won a very

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.110
ambitious one a very novel won a very
 

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.010
ambitious one a very novel won a very
demanding one but we think that is also

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.020
demanding one but we think that is also
 

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.380
demanding one but we think that is also
an achiever one which is basically to

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:54.390
an achiever one which is basically to
 

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.870
an achiever one which is basically to
transform till it into a country without

this we know is a huge challenge which

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:06.850
this we know is a huge challenge which
 

00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:09.210
this we know is a huge challenge which
was the dream of our fathers I will

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:09.220
was the dream of our fathers I will
 

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.390

grandfather's they always cherish this

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400
grandfather's they always cherish this
 

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.159
grandfather's they always cherish this
accomplishment but they never were able

00:17:14.159 --> 00:17:14.169
accomplishment but they never were able
 

00:17:14.169 --> 00:17:17.039
accomplishment but they never were able
to achieve it and we hope that we were

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:17.049
to achieve it and we hope that we were
 

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:20.760
to achieve it and we hope that we were
able to change that history this is the

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:20.770
able to change that history this is the
 

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.829
able to change that history this is the
challenge with which our government came

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:22.839
challenge with which our government came
 

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.860
challenge with which our government came
to power three years ago and for that of

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:25.870
to power three years ago and for that of
 

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.900
to power three years ago and for that of
course we will need to change history

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:27.910
course we will need to change history
 

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.210
course we will need to change history
and to take advantage of all the

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220
and to take advantage of all the
 

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.070
and to take advantage of all the
potentialities of this small country in

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:35.080
potentialities of this small country in
 

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.789
potentialities of this small country in
the end of the world very close to the

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799
the end of the world very close to the
 

00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:41.730
the end of the world very close to the
South Pole so I want to talk about the

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:41.740
South Pole so I want to talk about the
 

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.400
South Pole so I want to talk about the
future the difference between the future

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.410
future the difference between the future
 

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.680
future the difference between the future
and the past is only one the past is

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:46.690
and the past is only one the past is
 

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.650
and the past is only one the past is
already written we can talk about it for

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.660
already written we can talk about it for
 

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:52.020
already written we can talk about it for
years but we can look and we cannot

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:52.030
years but we can look and we cannot
 

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:55.200
years but we can look and we cannot
change a comma about it but the future

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.210
change a comma about it but the future
 

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.560
change a comma about it but the future
is something very deep it is not written

00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:58.570
is something very deep it is not written
 

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:01.710
is something very deep it is not written
and therefore we can dip our pants into

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720
and therefore we can dip our pants into
 

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.919
and therefore we can dip our pants into
ink and begin to write it and that's

00:18:04.919 --> 00:18:04.929
ink and begin to write it and that's
 

00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:09.090

since then it started in 2008 and you
 

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.710
since then it started in 2008 and you
know that very well because maybe this

serious own was right here in New York
and it hasn't yet ended and that was the

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120
and it hasn't yet ended and that was the
 

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.639
and it hasn't yet ended and that was the
second difficulty that we had to face

00:25:32.639 --> 00:25:32.649
second difficulty that we had to face
 

00:25:32.649 --> 00:25:36.180
second difficulty that we had to face
and address the third one was that the

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:36.190
and address the third one was that the
 

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.970
and address the third one was that the
country that we received was losing its

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:38.980

salaries and increase investment and
therefore we had to change the tide and

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:49.210
therefore we had to change the tide and
 

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.299
therefore we had to change the tide and
that's something which you know very

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:51.309
that's something which you know very
 

00:25:51.309 --> 00:25:55.080
that's something which you know very
well is never easy but those were the

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.090
well is never easy but those were the
 

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.649
well is never easy but those were the
main difficulties

00:25:56.649 --> 00:25:56.659
main difficulties
 

00:25:56.659 --> 00:26:00.460
main difficulties
what has been the results basically we

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.470
what has been the results basically we
 

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.619
what has been the results basically we
can distinguish three periods in the

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:02.629
can distinguish three periods in the
 

00:26:02.629 --> 00:26:05.379
can distinguish three periods in the
last part of our economic history the

00:26:05.379 --> 00:26:05.389
last part of our economic history the
 

00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:08.469
last part of our economic history the
first is between 86 and 97 where we

00:26:08.469 --> 00:26:08.479
first is between 86 and 97 where we
 

00:26:08.479 --> 00:26:12.879
first is between 86 and 97 where we
behave as a hair the growth rate was

above seven percent relativity was

00:26:15.609 --> 00:26:15.619
above seven percent relativity was
 

00:26:15.619 --> 00:26:18.479
above seven percent relativity was
increasing in a very substantial way

00:26:18.479 --> 00:26:18.489
increasing in a very substantial way
 

00:26:18.489 --> 00:26:21.339
increasing in a very substantial way
creation of new jobs was was very strong

00:26:21.339 --> 00:26:21.349
creation of new jobs was was very strong
 

00:26:21.349 --> 00:26:24.009
creation of new jobs was was very strong
and we were growing much faster than the

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:24.019
and we were growing much faster than the
 

00:26:24.019 --> 00:26:26.200
and we were growing much faster than the
rest of the world unfortunately

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:26.210
rest of the world unfortunately
 

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.169
rest of the world unfortunately
something happened in the late 90s

00:26:29.169 --> 00:26:29.179
something happened in the late 90s
 

00:26:29.179 --> 00:26:33.849
something happened in the late 90s
because from 1998 to 2009 2009 another

00:26:33.849 --> 00:26:33.859
because from 1998 to 2009 2009 another

because from 1998 to 2009 2009 another
12 year period we behaved as tortoise

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:36.940
12 year period we behaved as tortoise
 

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.599
12 year period we behaved as tortoise
because the growth rate went down by

00:26:40.599 --> 00:26:40.609
because the growth rate went down by
 

00:26:40.609 --> 00:26:42.669
because the growth rate went down by
half the same thing happened with

00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:42.679
half the same thing happened with
 

00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:44.529
half the same thing happened with
productivity and job creation and we

00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:44.539
productivity and job creation and we
 

00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:48.609
productivity and job creation and we
were growing at a lesser path than the

00:26:48.609 --> 00:26:48.619
were growing at a lesser path than the
 

00:26:48.619 --> 00:26:51.430
were growing at a lesser path than the
rest of the world as can be seen in this

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440
rest of the world as can be seen in this
 

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.560
rest of the world as can be seen in this
graph so why were commitment was to

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:53.570
graph so why were commitment was to
 

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:57.299
graph so why were commitment was to
recover that leadership that dynamism

00:26:57.299 --> 00:26:57.309
recover that leadership that dynamism
 

00:26:57.309 --> 00:26:59.919
recover that leadership that dynamism
because it was absolutely necessary to

00:26:59.919 --> 00:26:59.929
because it was absolutely necessary to
 

00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:01.989
because it was absolutely necessary to
achieve our goal to become a developed

00:40:10.339 --> 00:40:10.349
guarantee you that nobody can guarantee
 

00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:13.839
guarantee you that nobody can guarantee
that but something that will have to be

00:40:13.839 --> 00:40:13.849
that but something that will have to be
 

00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:16.400
that but something that will have to be
achieved by the new government but I

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:16.410
achieved by the new government but I
 

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.230
achieved by the new government but I
hope that they will realize two things

they don't know what they're talking
 

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:25.839
they don't know what they're talking
about so somebody thinks that all the

about so somebody thinks that all the
 

00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:28.569
about so somebody thinks that all the
result should be ready in three years

00:50:28.569 --> 00:50:28.579
result should be ready in three years
 

00:50:28.579 --> 00:50:31.809

have to make a decision if they want to
 

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:04.810
have to make a decision if they want to
become part of the new system with much
