00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:17.170
iven the dark undercurrent of Roald Dahl’s
works, perhaps it wouldn’t be surprising

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.039
if his famous snozzberries mentioned in the
book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964)

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.130
made into the film Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate
Factory (1971), were, in fact, penises.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.870
(Although having such on a wallpaper intended
for kids to lick would have safely moved the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.590
character of Wonka from “a little weird”
to “ultra creepy.”)

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.250
Thankfully, contrary to what you’ll read,
well, most everywhere on the internet since

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.140
2012 when comedian Anthony Scibelli wrote
a facetious piece for the popular humor site

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.870
Cracked, The Filthiest Joke Ever Hidden in
a Children’s Movie, it is quite clear that

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.170
Dahl did not intend a snozzberry to refer
to a penis in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.940
In the Cracked article, Scibelli backs up
his claim that Dahl did intend the snozzberries

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170
to be penises by referencing Dahl’s book,
My Uncle Oswald.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.170
In a nutshell, the book is about a man named
Oswald and a seductress named Yasmin who pair

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.390
up to attempt to acquire the sperm of rich
and powerful men throughout Europe with the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.150
goal of selling it to women wanting their
future children to have the genes of these

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.200
successful men.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.890
Pertinent to the topic at hand is the following
text in the book discussing Yasmin putting

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.530
a condom on one of the men in order to clandestinely
collect the sperm:

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.410
“How did you manage to roll the old rubbery
thing on him?”

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.130
“There’s only one way when they get violent,”
Yasmin said.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.720
“I grabbed hold of his snozzberry and hung
onto it like grim death and gave it a twist

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.450
or two to make him hold still.”

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.450
“Ow.”

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.520
“Very effective.”

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.750
“I’ll bet it is.”

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.270
“You can lead them around anywhere you want
like that.”

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.270
“I’m sure.”

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.340
“It’s like putting a twitch on a horse.”

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.530
So there you have it.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.979
Dahl himself is using the term to mean penis
and/or testicles.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340
So Scibelli is correct, right?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.460
Well, no.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.870
To begin with, Dahl wrote My Uncle Oswald
about a decade and a half after Charlie and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.350
the Chocolate Factory, meaning we can’t
really know just from this whether he really

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.649
was thinking a snozzberry was a penis in the
former work.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.200
Much more importantly, 31 years before My
Uncle Oswald and 16 years before Charlie and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.260
the Chocolate Factory, Dahl published Some
Time Never: A Fable for Supermen.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.620
In the story, creatures known as gremlins
are described as having been displaced by

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.010
humans and forced to live in hiding under
ground.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.650
While they briefly emerge to wreak havoc on
mankind via sabotage during WWII, the leader

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.520
of the gremlins decides that mankind will
destroy themselves without the gremlins doing

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.530
anything, allowing the creatures to once again
re-take the world.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.620
The book from publication to this day is largely
considered amazingly bad (and it really is),

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.460
but it does, at least, shed some light on
the question, “What’s a snozzberry?”

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.680
In it, Dahl very clearly writes that snozzberries
are the gremlins’ main source of food, describing

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.740
a snozzberry as a sweet, juicy, red fruit
that grows in orchards.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.970
As for the book, Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory, Wonka states the lickable wallpaper

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.310
“has pictures of fruits on it – bananas,
apples, oranges, grapes, pineapples, strawberries,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.849
and snozzberries…”

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.750
Beyond explicitly calling it a fruit here,
we’re guessing if the lickable wallpaper

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.200
included pictures of penises, the adults present
probably would have said something…

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.140
Very clearly, in the context of the story,
a fruit of some sort was shown.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.630
Thus, from the evidence at hand, it would
appear Dahl’s mention of it in Charlie and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.709
the Chocolate Factory is probably just an
inside allusion to his made up main food source

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.610
of mythical gremlins.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.550
Supporting this notion, in Some Time Never
(spoilers ahead), when humanity destroys itself

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.240
and the gremlins finally get to re-take the
world, they end up ceasing to exist as they

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.900
were simply the product of man’s imagination
or dreams.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.550
Why is this important to the snozzberry connection?

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.080
Consider the following lines from the Wonka
film, the script of which was largely written

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080
by Dahl:

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.280
Willy Wonka: The strawberries taste like strawberries.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.459
The snozzberries taste like snozzberries!

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.459
Veruca: Snozzberries?

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.690
Who ever heard of a snozzberry?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.459
[Wonka grabs Veruca’s jaw] Willy Wonka:
We are the music makers… and we are the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.120
dreamers of dreams…

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.709
Whether this was really supposed to be Wonka
referencing the fruit eaten by dreamed up

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.390
gremlins or just Dahl re-using a silly word
he coined for a made up fruit or not, his

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.109
later use of the term to refer to male genitalia
wouldn’t negate it being meant to be a fruit

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.460
in the previous works- calling certain human
bits by the names of food items is nothing

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460
new.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.340
With regards to testicles, for instance, we
have food related euphemisms like plums, nuts,

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.259
and berries, among others.

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.659
With regards to the penis, common slang terms
include dingleberry, plum-tree, pudding-stick,

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.400
hotdog, salami, sausage, etc.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.159
In the end, just because an author might refer
to a woman’s breasts as “melons” does

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:45.039
not necessarily mean every time said author
used the word “melons” in previous works

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.271
they were also referring to “breasts,”
particularly not when in the context of the

00:04:50.271 --> 00:04:54.300
previous works it is quite clear the author
was referencing a fruit.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.199
(We realize this is amazingly obvious, but
we felt it necessary to be excruciatingly

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.889
explicit on this one, given this myth abounds
on the web with nobody seeming to bother to

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.919
question the dubious reasoning used in the
Cracked article.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.300
Which, to be fair, contrary to what happened,
we’re reasonably confident Scibelli was

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.919
just trying to be funny and didn’t think
his humorous hypothesis of Dahl intending

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.809
snozzberries to be penises in Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory would be widely accepted

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:14.809
as fact.

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:17.969
But these things can happen after such a sensationalized
piece receives nearly five million views,

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.979
with its one sentence version getting tens
of millions more views as it’s spread across

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.660
social media without anybody fact checking.)

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.860
So to sum up, given Dahl explicitly describes
the snozzberry as a fruit in Some Time Never

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.039
and later in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
calls it a fruit, as well as says that the

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.759
fruits mentioned in the Wallpaper Room are
shown in picture form to the characters in

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:43.069
said story, it seems very clear he meant the
snozzberry to be a literal fruit in these

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:46.300
two stories, and wasn’t trying to make some
twisted joke.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.879
And as for Dahl’s use of “snozzberry”
in My Uncle Oswald, it is just as clear this

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.879
is a metaphor for male genitalia, not unlike
many other food names used to describe said

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.879
nether region.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.889
In this case, Dahl simply chose to use his
own made up fruit for the euphemism.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.599
The specific term “gremlin” first appeared
among members of the Royal Air Force sometime

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:11.569
in the 1920s, referring to mythical creatures
that liked to sabotage aircraft, though the

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.939
origin of the name beyond this isn’t clear.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:18.389
Whatever the case, the term and idea was later
popularized in WWII, which is no doubt where

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.349
Dahl encountered it during his time as a member
of the Royal Air Force.

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.369
Dahl’s first children’s book was his 1943
The Gremlins.

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:41.039
In this work, the gremlins are eventually
trained by the Royal Air Force to fix 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.280
their planes, rather than sabotage them.
