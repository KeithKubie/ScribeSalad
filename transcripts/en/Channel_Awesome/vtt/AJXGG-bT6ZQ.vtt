00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
- Have You Been Helped?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.920
- Don't you remember, Critic?  It's me, Tamara.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.700
- Tamra... oh yeah, from the "Catwoman" review; yeah,
yeah, you were funny in that!

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.180
- Thank you.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.040
- I find you socially awkward due to your disturbing
silence!

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
- I see you have "The Wicker Man" DVD in your
possession.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.200
- Oh, uh, yeah.
- Did you know that that's my favorite movie?

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.080
- I don't even know what your last name is, so why
would I know that?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.400
- Do you have the original or the unrated version?
- Uh, the unrated.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400
- Oh.  Good.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.040
- Why?
- No reason.  Enjoy your movie.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.760
- Uh, um... thanks; I w--

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.760
That was weird--AH!  @#$%!  Can you go that way, please?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
Jesus!  What the hell's going on around here--

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.840
DAH!  Will you get outta here please?!
DAH!  Turn around and piss off--

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840
DAH!  Get outta here, you little wack a mole

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.340
As if this week couldn't get any more creepy--
let's keep it going with Nicolas Cage month!

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.500
(theme music playing)
♪ I'm Nicolas Cage! ♪

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.120
Actually, I have a confession to make.  I'm actually not
Nicolas Cage.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.240
I'm Nicolas Cage pretending to be a narrator who
sounds like Nicolas Cage.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.080
(maniacal laughter)

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.800
By the way, I'm gonna be starring in about 26 other
movies this month.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.760
And if they ever made a live action Winnie-the-Pooh, I'd play Eeyore.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.720
Hello; I'm the Nostalgia Critic.  I remember it so you
don't have to!

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.320
Let's talk about Neil LaBute!  You might not recognize
his name, but you might recognize his movies.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.520
"Lakeview Terrace," "Nurse Betty," and probably
his most controversial: "In the Company of Men."

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.920
And, if you were like most moviegoers, this was
probably your reaction to them.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.360
His films usually have a shockingly harsh, mean-spirited
tone that many critics liked,  but most

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.220
audiences didn't know how to accept.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.680
"We take a girl at a time--just some corn-fed bitch--and
then one day, out goes a rug, and us pulling it hard,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.840
she'll be reaching for the sleeping pills within a week;
and we will laugh about this till we are very old men."

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.480
People came out of each film say, "It is piss-my-pants
uncomfortable, which I think is the film's intent; but

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:00.640
is the film actually any good?  I think so...ish.
It's say something...ish, that I think is beneficial...ish."

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.560
For years and years, nobody quite knew what to make
of him.  That is, until the abominable remake that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.840
finally gave moviegoers clarity.  That being that out of
all his films, we know quite clearly--this one

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.440
is absolute shit.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.040
That remake is, of course, "Wicker Man."

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
Based on the British cult hit of the '70s,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800
the film centers around a cop

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800
brought in to investigate an abduction on an

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.800
island run by a bizarre cult.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.800
The major change in this one?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.800
The island is dominated by women!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520
Yeahhhhhh, interesting change,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.520
but ah, I'm sure the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.520
guy who a story about sexist

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.520
men breaking the heart of a lonely, depressed deaf

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520
woman will clearly show no signs of

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.520
misogyny here!

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.520
But, why wait to find out?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.200
Let's take a look at the burning disaster remake that is
"Wicker Man."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So as the credits roll, we naturally open up

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
with our hero, played by Nicolas Cage.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
(Hallelujah Chorus added)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
He's a cop who likes checking out books that

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I'm sure most of us will need to read after viewing

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
this picture.  He's off doing is coply

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.800
duties when he sees a kid drop her doll out the window.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.560
(motorcycle zooms by)
Jeez!

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560
I didn't think you could make Nicolas Cage

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.560
grabbing a girl's doll actually look

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560
cool, but by God, this movie actually

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560
kinda pulled it off!

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.680
(Nicolas Cage impression)  In the name of Strawberry
Shortcake, you shall be avenged! (End impression)

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.440
So he pulls the car over to give the child back her doll.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.280
- "We won't let it happen again, sir."
- "Great, thanks a lot."

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.720
- "Sweetie, stop that!  I'm so sorry; she's belted in, but--"

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.200
- "Don't worry; it comes with the territory.  I'll get it."

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.200
(Cage impression) As an officer, it's my duty to

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.200
keep my eyes peeled for any opportunity

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.200
to serve and protect.  Except,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.200
of course, when a giant truck is traveling on the wrong

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200
side of the road for no reason, plunging innocent

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.140
civilians into a fiery ditch.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.920
For some reason I'm not very good at spotting those.  (End impression)

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.880
"Keep your head down!"

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.880
Cage tries to save them, but the little girl's too

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.200
busy being needlessly creepy, because...

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.200
that's what kids in movies kinda did for a while.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.800
And she burns up in the fire.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.520
Cut to some time later--they never

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.520
specifically say how long--as it seems

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520
Cage has a problem getting over his mistake.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.040
- "Hey."
- "Hey."

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.360
- "So..."
- "That about sums it up."

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.600
So, um, you got a scene for me?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.680
- "Stuff helping you?"
- "You don't have to stay; I don't really need visitors."

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.720
Well!  She added a lot!  As we see Cage,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.720
gets a letter from his ex-fiancée,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.600
who apparently has Elvish penmanship,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.600
and alerts him that not only has she moved

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600
to an island called Summersisle--not

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
only does she have a child named Rowen--

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
not only is she probably his--

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.600
not only is she now missing and

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.600
she's incredibly concerned--but she wants

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.600
him to come to the island

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600
and look for her.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.640
God damn, that's like Jesus finally writing to his father saying how he enjoyed Jerusalem

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.640
*Phone Ringing in the background * - "Hey", "Hey"

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.720
So he goes to his cop friend to and get some advice,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.720
who, quite frankly, seems

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720
way too spontaneously into this,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.320
having just heard about it.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.320
- "The plot thickens.  So is this like, some

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.320
old girlfriend or something, this uh, Willow?"

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.320
- "We were engaged."
- "Sounds like she got kinda

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.320
close with someone else, too."
- (sigh)

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.320
- "Summersisle?!  ...  And she's got the nerve to contact

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.320
you now?!  Shit.  I mean, you're gonna blow

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.320
this off, right?  ...  Why don't you do a little digging on her first.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.320
I mean, come on.  Tell her to contact the

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320
father!  Give her a call!"

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.320
I don't know why; I'm just really upset about your

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.320
problems right now!  (phone rings)

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.320
Hello?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.000
Oh, your husband's been murdered?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.320
Well boo-f**kety-hoo!

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800
- "We need to be at that briefing in ten minutes."
- "Okay."

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600
- "Hey.  It's good to see ya."

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.600
Still got no scene for me?  Okay.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600
Nevertheless, Cage agrees to the case

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600
as, when traveling to the island, he can't

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.600
help but still think of the girl he let down

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600
before.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.920
Jeez!  Who let the truck

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.920
on the boat?!  Do boats really

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.920
need a sign that says "No Trucks

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.920
Allowed"?  If it's a party boat, do we have to put

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.920
"No Trucks Under 21 Allowed"?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.760
Ha ha!  This movie's dramatic

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.760
subtlety is on part with

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.120
UHF!  (beeping, screaming)

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.120
So he gets to the island of Summersisle--or

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.120
as I like to call it, the Creepy Shire--as

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.120
he comes across some scary Hobbitfolk.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.120
- "Now a complaint has been made by a resident

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.120
of this island--"
- "Complaint, you say?"

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.120
- "Yes ma'am, about a missing child.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.640
- "Well now, that's always trouble."

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.720
- "What's in the bag?  A shark, or something?"

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.080
- "Go on.  Take a peek!"

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.120
(laughter)

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.120
(Cage impression)  Well, nothing suspicious here.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.120
You go ahead and take your bleeding, moving,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.120
human-sized bag to wherever while you

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.120
laugh maniacally.  I'm gonna go see if this

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.120
place has any cake.  (End impression)

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.920
So he walks into the middle of the Hocus

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.560
Pocus 2 auditions to see if he can get any answers.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.560
- "Are you the bar maiden

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.560
here, or whatever you call it?"
- "I'm Sister

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.400
Beech; yes."

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.400
(snorts)  What's her name again?

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.400
- "I'm Sister Beech, yes."
(snorts)

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.180
Please tell me that's the only time we hear that

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.180
name?
- "Mrs. Beech"

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.180
- "Sister Beech"
- "Sister Beech"
- "Sister Beech"

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.180
(sigh)  There's not enough images of

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.180
slaughtered bunnies in the world to get me not to laugh at

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.180
that.
- "Sister Beech"
(razzes)

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.780
(comic voice)  My brethren will get revenge in the hokiest,

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.780
most over-the-top way possible!  (end voice)

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.780
- "Sorry; I'm allergic."
So he comes across

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.780
his ex-fiancée named Willow, who is

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.780
quite the talent for giving all

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.780
information and no information at

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.920
the same time.
- "What in the hell

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.560
happened to you?"
- "We were young."

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.180
- "So what?"
- "Why do we do anything?"

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.500
- "I need some kind of answers."
- "I was scared."

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.500
- "Why do this?"
- "We're different here."

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.500
- "Was it some other guy?"
- "I wasn't ready for this."

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500
)Cage impression) Okay, if I give you a multiple

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.500
choice between A, B, and C, will you give

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.780
me a straight answer then?  (end impression)

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.540
(Willow impression)  I choose Q.  Christ (end impression)

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.220
Speaking of which, Cage continues to see all sorts

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.220
of strangeness on the island.  Twins

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.220
talking in unison, women wearing red hoods

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.220
over their heads, everyone talking in scary,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.220
foreshadowing tones, Leelee

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.220
Sobiesky, and oddly enough,

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.220
decides not to get the @#$% outta there.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.220
But again, being Cage, maybe this all makes

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.220
him feel at home.
- "Excuse me.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.220
Did someone unpack my bag?--because I'm missing

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.220
some tapes."
- "I wouldn't know about that."

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.460
- "They're called 'Everything's Okay.'"
- "Good."

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.460
♪ "Look; there she goes; that girl is so peculiar..." ♪

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.460
Things don't get any better when he continues to

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.900
dream about the same girl he lost before.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.340
(creepy laughter)

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.720
(creepy background voice):  That's not her daughter, 
though!  (truck horn)

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.720
(Critic laughs)  Again?!

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.720
This thing follows his subconscious like

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.720
Freddy Krueger driving the truck

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.720
from "Duel"!  It doesn't get any scarier

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.280
the more you show it; it just gets funnier!

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.200
(truck horn, Critic laughs) Can we just get a loop of that?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.000
(truck horn repeats)

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.980
(Critic laughs)  And they say there's nothing
good on the internet.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.980
But Cage thinks he sees Rowen in the garden

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.980
and tries to go after her, thinking he's

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.380
narrowed her down in the barn.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.940
(person runs by)
- "Rowen?"

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.700
(Cage impression) I could hear your "vroosh."  (end impression)

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.200
Which is really obnoxious when you think about it.  How

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.200
come in a movie whenever someone passes the camera

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.040
in the dark, it's always accompanied by a "vroosh"?

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.040
I mean, do people have no control over that?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.040
It's really annoying.  (jump scare whoosh)
Dah!  Malcolm!

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.380
- Huh?
- Can you keep your vroosh down?

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.000
I was just talking about how obnoxious it is!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.360
- Sorry!  It's the new shoes.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.260
(repeated jump scare whooshes)

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.900
He loses track of her and doesn't seem to get any closer--

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.140
making this scene
(ding!)
entirely pointless!

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.140
He does, however, notice what any freaking idiot would

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.140
notice the first time being there: a massive

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.140
lineup of pictured girls all looking like

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.440
they're about to be sacrificed at an alter.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.360
But one picture seems to be missing.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.360
- "...our harvest festival--we

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.360
have one the end of each autumn--

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.360
and then the festival of fertility

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.920
too, of course."
- "What happened to last year's?"

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.800
- "Afraid it got ruined last night."

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.800
(Cage impression)  Okay, let's cut the bullshit;
we all know you're

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.200
Brian Cox in drag; just stop pretending!  (end impression)

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.740
So he goes to see if he can get any answers

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.740
from little Leelee.
- "Hey,

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.740
I mean to ask you in there, do

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.740
you recognize this girl?"

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.200
- (chuckles)

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.560
- "Uhhh, well where's the other woman who works here?"

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.560
Noo, let's go back to the question you

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.560
just asked and clearly didn't get

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.560
an answer to: "Have you seen this little

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.560
girl?"  God!  Do you

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.560
have any policeman insight?  Would you

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.560
do this on any other case?

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.560
- "Excuse me; have you seen this white man

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.560
with glasses and a goatee?"

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.640
- (creepy laugh)

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.640
- "Okay, well that's good enough for me.  Alright, guys,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.920
nothin' to see here!"

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760
Things get--imagine this--even

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760
stranger when he goes to a school

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.760
that only seems to be teaching girls.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.760
- "Will you tell us what

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.760
man represents in his purest form?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.240
Yes."

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.900
- "Phallic symbol, phallic symbol."

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.900
Hey, hey, HEY!  As a man,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.900
I am very offended!

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I mean, you're not supposed to just say it!

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.620
- "School's really changed since I was a kid."

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.620
- "How dare you stand there and

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.620
frighten my children?"
Wow!  Nicolas

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.620
Cage is so creepy he can stare people by just

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.620
standing in the same room as them?  Oh,

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.020
let's be honest--none of us are surprised by that.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.500
- "Whose desk is this?"

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.080
(crow caws)
- "What?!"

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.540
My apologies; we are studying the textbook of

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.540
lazy jump scares.  Okay, chapter

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.540
2 children: walking by the camera and going

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.540
"vroosh!"

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.540
The more questions he asks, of course, the fewer answers

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.540
he gets.
- "If Rowan Woodward existed--

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.540
- "IF?!  I suppose her mother is lying

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.540
to me too, huh?"
- "Not lying, no.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.040
Grieving."
- "You mean that Rowan is dead?"

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.640
- "It was an accident."
- "What kind of

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.640
accident?"
- "Leave things alone, please."

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.640
- "Sister Rose, how'd she

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.640
die?"
- "She'll burn to death."

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.900
- "What did you just say?"
- "She burned to death."

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.500
So, seeing how Rowan has more inconsistent

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.500
back-stories than Tommy Wiseau, Cage sets

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.500
out at least to locate the body or

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.500
grave, which neither Willow nor Cage

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.600
thinks proves at all that she's actually dead.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.500
- "They put it there; I didn't."

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.000
- "Who's they?"

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.080
(crows cawing in the background)

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.420
So here's a crazy idea!

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.420
He asks her to take him to the place

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.420
where she last saw her!

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.780
Uh, shouldn't this have been the

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.220
first friggin' thing that he did?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.220
- "So this is where you last saw Rowen?"

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.220
- "Mmm."
- "Yeah?"

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.100
- "Can you give me the details?  It's important."

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.100
(Willow impression)  Sorry; I don't operate in details.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.100
Just foreshadowing bullshit that makes for great creepy

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.940
padding.  (End impression)

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:52.940
- "And you're sure there's no way it could be someone

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.340
from off the island?"

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.260
- "No."
Well, that could be

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.260
considered a clue if it wasn't typical

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.260
writing for any child stuck at school.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.260
- "Wait for me."
So he doesn't seem to get

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.260
any closer--that is, until he thinks

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.260
he sees her drowning under the dock.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:14.840
(thrilling music)

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.740
Oh!  Clearly it was just a

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.740
dream-- (screaming) or maybe it wasn't; oh my
God!!! (end screaming)

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.100
Nope!  Just a dream.
- "God damn it!"

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.380
(Cage impression)  A double fake-out?  Really?!

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.380
We're that desperate?!  Gah!

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.380
The least they could have done is at least thrown in
another truck

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.380
(car horn and crash)
So he goes to ask more

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.380
questions--after randomly passing by

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.380
the cult of Jawas ("utini!")--as he

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.380
JUST NOW @#$%ing

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.380
realizes that Rowen was the

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.380
girl missing in the framed picture!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.380
Nawww, you think?!

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.380
- "Why didn't you tell me Rowen was a part of all this?

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.380
Huh?  The rituals!"

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.380
- "Well I'm frightened of this place too."

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.380
- "Alright; I'm sorry; it doesn't matter.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.380
Doesn't matter."

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.380
Jesus Christ; does this guy EVER

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.380
use his brain?!

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.380
These have gotta be some of the worst detective

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.380
skills of all time!  I mean how

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.700
stupid do y ou have to be--

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.500
shish!
- How's the review

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.500
coming, Critic?
- That's it!

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500
Listen here ya creepy little

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500
elf on the shelf--I'm not gonna let a crazy

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.500
and potentially dangerous person get in the way of

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.660
my work!
- What are you gonna do?

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.520
Leave?  Call for

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.520
backup?  Bring in as many

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.520
sane and rational people possible

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.240
to level out this insane playing field?

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.840
- No!  That'd be unbelievable stupid.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.840
I'm just gonna ask obvious question

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.840
after obvious question that anyone would 
know in the hopes

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.840
that you will give me an incredibly vague 
answer that will

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.840
make me more angry!
- Oh.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.840
Alright then.  Go ahead.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.600
- What's goin' on here?!
- They would know.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.140
- Who is they?!
- They is them.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.860
- Them is they?!
- All is knowing.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.860
- Knowing is all?!
- You can't understand

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.860
that not understanding is

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.120
understanding when you can't understand.

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.780
Understand.
- Your vagueness is making me

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.780
angry!!!
- Then maybe I should leave.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.780
- Fine!  Think I've utilized my detective

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.780
skills long enough.  Get outta here!

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.860
(scary music)

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.980
Whoo!  Okay, so after that--

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.140
Will ya get outta here?!

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.740
It's a bad day to be me.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.420
So, in keeping with his brilliant deduction

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.420
skills, Cage gets absolutely no

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.080
answers from anybody, so he tours the island more.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.080
He notices that the men on the island are only used

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.500
for labor and are never allowed to speak.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500
Kinda like how they treat people at Walmart.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500
But trouble starts a-brewing when he comes across

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.500
a giant farm of bees.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500
As you remember, Cage is horribly allergic to bees.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.500
So, what to do?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.660
(buzzing)

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.820
Run deeper into the farm of bees, of course!

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.140
Because it's

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.940
opposite day?

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.200
He gets stung too many times and passes out,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.200
but is saved by some of the workers, who dropped him

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.200
off at Sister Summersisle's home--the

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.840
woman who runs the island, played by Ellen Burstyn.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.320
They go walking just outside the beehives, which

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.960
Cage seems to be taking miraculously

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.960
well, seeing how he nearly died from

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.960
them.  I'd piss my pants if I saw one

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.960
on a sandwich after that!  So she

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.960
talks about how they honor the great goddess,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.960
and also their treatment of men on the island.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.540
- "Men are what?  Second-class

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.540
citizens?"
- "No!  Not at all; we

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.540
love our men!

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.160
We're just not subservient to them.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.220
But men are a very important part of our little

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.780
colony.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.340
Breeding, ya know."

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.340
My God this island is

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.340
terrible!  All the men do around here is

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.340
mate!  And stay at home!  And

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.340
mate!  And not have to talk to anybody!

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.800
And mate!  And can I vacation here?

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.480
- "...the strongest, the finest,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.480
the most sturdy of our kind."

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.480
- "Female--right?"

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.480
Well, when the upper body strength fairy

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.480
comes to help you move a recliner,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.860
then we'll talk!

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.860
But then Cage remembers: oh yeah, the little

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.860
girl thing!  And brings the questions back to

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.860
looking for her.
- "Perhaps it is time

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.860
for you to stop bullshitting me, okay?"

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.860
- "Hey, be careful."
- "Especially when a

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.860
little girl's life is at stake--my

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.860
little girl.  I'm sure you've

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.860
guessed."
- "As a matter of fact, yes."

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.720
- "I'm only interested in the law."
(LAWWWWW!)

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.620
Now do I have permission to open the
grave of Rowen Woodward?

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.620
- "Oh, I was under the impression that I'd

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.620
already given it to you."
So he gets permission

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.620
to look through the grace, but all he finds is

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.620
a burnt little doll.  This of course gets

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.620
Cage EVEN ANGRIER!

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.580
- "This hers?

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.040
TELL ME!!!"
- "Yeah."

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.040
- "How'd it get burned?  HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!"
- "I--"

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.040
- "HOW'D IT GET BURNED, HOW'D IT GET BURNED?!"

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:58.040
Somebody lit it!  Somebody lit it!

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.300
- "Where are  you going?"
- "Back to her place."

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.300
- "Then I'm coming with you!"
- "No!  Willow, I

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.300
mean it!"
- "But maybe if we--"

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.300
- "Something bad is about to happen.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.300
I can feel it."

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.300
Yes, because everything's been going great up

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.300
until now!  I'd hate to see what happens

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.160
if this all went down some weird, nonsensical road.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.760
(climatic music)

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.040
Like, that's a good start!

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.920
Let's see what's behind door number two!

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.360
Oh, is it weird-bee-thing-o' clock already?

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.860
And folks, that's only the

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.860
beginning of where this Tijuana

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.660
car wash of insanity takes you.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.660
Including the Great Gonzo being pulled over by

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.660
Cage at gunpoint!
- "Get off

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.660
the bike.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.020
(gun clicks)
Step away from the bike!"

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.520
(Cage impression)  I have shot people over less than this!

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.540
Hey, guess who I am?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.920
Da da da da da daaa daaa...
(Tune of the Wicked Witch of the West's theme)

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.680
That's right: Monica Crawley.  (end impression)

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.920
- "It is him."

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.140
Huh.  So that's why the Olsen Twins don't make

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.480
public appearances anymore!

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.460
(girls laughing)

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.080
We were playing why-the-hell-would-we-be-laughing-

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.080
except-to-create-a-not-so-creepy-environment-because-

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.700
the-acting-and-storytelling-can't-deliver-on-its-own!

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.700
Now with a take-home edition!

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.320
Annnnnd, now we've entered a kegger

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.320
in Narnia.  But instead of Aslan

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320
leading the party, we have...

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.280
(laughing)  Oh my God.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.280
- "Oh goddess of the fields, please

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.560
accept our offering."

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.560
(William Wallace impression)
We may be able to take this off our

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.560
resumé, but we'll never be able to take

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.120
it off our embarrassing IMDB page!
(End impression)

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.260
And yes, it looks like Cage has

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.260
finally had enough of this

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.260
God damn island.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.680
Time to punch a "Beech" in the mouth!

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.340
(Cage impression)  That's for making me think you were
Albert finney!  (End impression)

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:00.100
But little Leelee attacks, and

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.100
yes, they actually do have a fight

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.100
sequence together!  All while

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.100
Care-A-Lot is getting smashed.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.740
- (ritual music)

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.560
Ya know, for the "stronger

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.560
sex" island, you could teach

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.560
less wimpy fighting moves.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.560
- (screaming)

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.560
(mocking the screams)
Fear me; I am

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.560
mighty, and...
(mocking screams)

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.560
Well!  Looks like Sobiesky

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.500
needs to sober up-ski.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.500
(YEEAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!! music)

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.380
So he disguises himself in the bear suit

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.380
Mrs. Beech was gonna wear, and he works his

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.380
way into the LARP parade.

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.340
(Cage impression)  Help, a bear ate me; get me outta here; hahaha!

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.340
No, seriously, we're all in big trouble.  (End impression)

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.920
(whispering)
- "I thought told you to wait for me!"

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.920
- "What do you mean?  I had to come!"

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.920
So Cage finally finds Rowen,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.920
who's about to be sacrificed, and decides

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.920
to save the day in one of the most

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.920
surreal, unintentionally

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.920
funny moments ever put

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.920
to film!

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720
- "What is it; what's wrong, sister?"

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.680
- "What is it; what's wrong, sister?"

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.520
(sentimental music fades in)

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.860
- Hey Critic!  What are you looking at, family pictures?

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.080
- No.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.080
All my old bear jokes.

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.080
I've made so many in the past.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.080
Aw, look at this one:

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.080
this is when Christopher Walken said "It's not

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.080
over--bears!"  He never says anything

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.080
like a human.
- (chuckles)

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.080
- Oh, and here!  This is from

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.080
"Care Bears 2," when Darkheart said, "Time

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.080
for a game of disappearing bears."

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.080
He never says anything natural either.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.080
- (chuckles)
- Oh, and there's

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.080
Charlton Heston talking about hunting

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.080
bears; there's even Sean Connery in a bear

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.080
suit!
- Wow.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.080
So many bear memories.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.840
- And yet here, Malcolm--

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.840
here in "Wicker Man"--is the

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.840
holy grail of bear scenes:.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.840
a moment where

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.840
Nicolas Cage is in a bear suit

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.840
and he punches out a woman while

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.840
Ellen Braveheart watches.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.840
(sigh)  There's just--

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.840
so many jokes I can do,

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.840
and I don't know which one to pick!

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.840
(sigh)

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.840
Maybe I should just skip the joke altogether.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.840
- Hey, don't talk like that!

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.740
You know, sometimes the more obvious the

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.740
joke, the more it has to be

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.740
addressed.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.740
- But which one should I do?

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.740
Which one should I do?!

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.740
- Tell ya what.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.080
Why don't you do--all of them?

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.120
- All of them?
- Yes!

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.120
That way the public can decide

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.120
which one's best.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.120
- You know, that's not such a bad

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.120
idea.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.120
Thank you, Malcolm.  Thank you for

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.120
understanding my bear dilemma.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.120
- That's what I'm here for.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.500
(music turns ominous)

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.500
- Is it working?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.500
- Yes.  Everything is going according to plan.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.080
Okay, so...

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.960
here are my Nicolas Cage bear jokes!

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.920
Waka waka, whore!

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.760
Papa bear says this bitch is too conscious!

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.540
Bernstein family says hi!

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.380
Allow me to introduce myself; I'm Winnie-the-shut-the-@#$%-up!

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:49.120
The Bear Necessities would like you to get
more acquainted with the ground.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.320
♪ Gummy Bears, bouncing here and there and
in your FACE! ♪

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.100
Sister Rose, meet Brother Bear!

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.320
I hear you've been harnessing pic-a-nic baskets!

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.140
Paddington told me we should meet face to fist.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.020
♪ Can't get enough of that Golden Crisp;
it's got the crunch with  punch! ♪

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.040
And the number one Nicolas Cage bear joke is:

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.280
Only you can prevent not your ass kicked by
Nicolas @#$%ing Cage!

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.520
Play me up, Paul!  (Paul Schaffer music)

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.900
So Cage saves Rowen, but little does he know--

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.900
she was never in any danger at all.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.900
In fact, she even runs back to her

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.900
group, who welcome her with open arms.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900
- "You have come of your own free

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.900
will to keep this appointment

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.900
with the Wicker Man.  And now the game

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.900
is over."
- "The game of the hunter

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.900
leading the hunted."

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.900
This was all part of a new reality show

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.900
called @#$%ing With Cage!

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.460
Next week, we're gonna see what
happens if we make him think

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.460
he's a vampire.  ("I'm a vampire!

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:50.460
I'm a vampire!

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.460
I'm a vampire!")

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:54.460
- "STAY BACK!"
Cage tries to fight them off,

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.000
but--what do you know?
(Elmer Fudd:) No more buwwets!

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
They break his legs, take him to a giant

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000
wicker man, and put him inside

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000
setting it ablaze.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.540
Worst burning man ever!

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.540
But, it doesn't stop there!  We get one

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.540
more ending where I swear

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:15.540
James Franco and Jason

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:17.540
Ritter are off-duty cops

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.540
in a bar chatting it up.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.540
- "Check it out."
- "Yeah."

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.780
- Hey, ya wanna hear about a role where I destroy

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.780
a world's entire future by my mere

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.780
existence?  - Planet of the Apes?  - No; Oz

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.780
the Great and Powerful!
- "Well, hello there!"

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.780
*chuckles*
But then Sister Willow

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.780
enters in and, presumably, it

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:36.780
all starts over again.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.380
- "When you leave here, where are you going?"

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.580
- "To my apartment."

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.220
- "When you do leave, take me with you?"

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.220
*buzzing sound effect*

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.480
*screaming*

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.800
(comedic music added)

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.940
- "BITCHES!  YOU BITCHES!"

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.240
And that was "Wicker Man!"

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.780
What the @#%!

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.780
I think it's tryyying to be anti-

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.780
feminist?--but on the other hand,

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.780
Cage is kind of a shouting, idiotic

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.780
jerk, as are half the other guys

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.780
in the movie, so, maybe it's the other

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:16.780
way around showing that being chauvinistic

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.780
and misogynistic will lead to your

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.780
demise.  But then,

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:22.780
why do they try to make this place

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.780
come off so creepy and insane?

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.780
I don't know, and in the end,

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.780
I don't care, because it's incredibly obvious

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.780
this is a giant piece of shit.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.780
I mean, this flick is so entertainingly

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.780
bad; and every other second

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.780
has something to laugh at in terms of how

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.780
awkward it is.  So,

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.780
if you're looking for a batshit

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.780
insane movie that'll have you unintentionally

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.780
laughing in the isles,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.780
then this wicker-ham is for you.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.700
I'm the Nostalgia Critic!
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.640
(theme music playing)

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.400
(music stops)

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500
(thrilling music)

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.140
Ehhh... isn't that usually it?

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.140
- Not quite.  (jumpy music)

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.760
Aren't you forgetting something, Critic?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.760
- Tamara!  The hell you doin' here; the

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.760
review is over!
- There's one famous

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:21.760
part you forgot to mention.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.760
- The most famous part of the movie.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.760
My all-time favorite scene!

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.900
- Not--
- (whispers) No.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.120
- the--
- (whispers) No!

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.420
- Bees!

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.420
- NO;God damn it!  Everybody talks about that

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.420
stupid scene!  The internet has talked about that

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.420
scene since the beginning of stupid

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.420
scenes!  We are NOT talkin' about that stupid scene!

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.420
I'm not talkin' about that stupid scene;
you're not talking about that stupid

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.420
scene; you're not talking about that stupid scene; we are

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.780
NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT STUPID SCENE!

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.780
- I thought you'd say that--which is why

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.780
we've come to make sure that you'd follow through.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.580
- Over four million hits on YouTube,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.580
- Countless quotes in countless

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.580
forums.
- It cannot be

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.960
ignored.
- It is your destiny!

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.960
- No.
- - The more obvious the

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.960
joke, the more it has to be

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.420
addressed.
- No!

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.420
- - The more obvious the joke,

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.420
the more it has to be addressed!

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.260
- What, you think saying that in unison is

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.260
somehow gonna change my mind?
- No,

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.260
but--this will.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.100
- *groaning*
- Reference

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.400
the bees.
- Never.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.020
- Reference the bees!

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.080
- Never!

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.080
(hitting, screaming)

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.080
I'll see you in hell

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880
- Ah, ya crazy bitch!

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.880
Tell the rest of the Lollipop Guild I said hello!

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.740
What is that?

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.620
No... no, not that!

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.980
Anything but that!  No!

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.160
No, NOOOOOO, not the memes!

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.160
Not the memes!

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.160
Ohhhhh, they're everywhere!

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.160
They're all over the internet!

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160
Ohhh, they're in my eyes!  I've seen them so much

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.160
they're ingrained in my eyes!

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:14.800
AHHHHHHGH!!!  AHHHHHHGH!!!
AHHHHHHGH!!!  AHHHHHHGH!!!

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.280
Alright; alright; I'll talk about the @#%ing bees!

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.480
The irony is that the most famous scene

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.480
movie--where Cage is being

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.480
tortured by the bees--isn't even

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.480
in the original.  It was in the

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.480
unrated cut.  So this moment

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.480
literally is so enjoyed that it

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.480
became popular despite it

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.480
never getting a theatrical release.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.480
So, what is it about this

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.480
moment that everybody goes nuts for?

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.480
Is it the bees are so

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.480
horribly CG-ed?  Is it that the

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.480
idea itself is so crazy?

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480
Is it that he keeps shouting "They're in my

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.480
eyes" when they're clearly not in his

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.480
eyes?
- "Oh they're in my eyes!

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.480
MY EYES!"
Well, the only

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.480
conclusion I can come to why

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.480
everybody loves this scene, of course,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.480
is the Cage man himself.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.480
It's only a few seconds long, but

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.480
he does his thing!

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.480
Screaming at the top of his lungs, asking what something

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.480
is like they're honestly gonna tell

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.480
him,
- "What is it?!  What is it?!"

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.480
and even shaking his head back and forth going

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.480
"Blahhhhhh, blahhhhhh!"

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.920
- *screaming*

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.920
Perhaps it's because it's not just typical

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.920
over-the-top--well--

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.920
okay, it kind of is; but it's also

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.920
just kind of awkward!

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.920
He's not going full Cage

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.920
freak-out; this is more like an 8

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.920
or a 9.  If he was, his eyes would be

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.920
more bulgy like they usually are.  He

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.920
just sorta goes halfway and then

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.920
kinda gives up.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.920
Which, bizarrely enough, makes it even more

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.920
over-the-top and strange.  Perhaps it's one of those

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.920
instances where going big but not

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:45.920
all the way big makes

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.920
it even more awkward and memorable.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.920
And surprisingly, maybe making it

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.920
the biggest moment in any Cage movie!

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:53.920
It has its own unique blend of

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.920
strange, not of this world, so-

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.920
bad-it's-good corniness, that will live

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.920
on in ridiculous film history!

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.920
- "Oh!  No; not the bees!

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.920
Not the bees!

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.920
*screaming*

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.920
Oh, they're in my eyes!  My eyes!"

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.920
*more screaming*

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.720
There!  Ya happy, you crazy, obsessed @#$%?

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.720
- Oh, I am.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.840
I am.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.100
- Wait!  Where the hell you goin'?

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.360
- Don't you understand, Critic?

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.360
The journey never ends.  I must

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.360
find other Nicolas Cage fans to talk about

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.360
this scene.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.360
So that it may be exploited for all of

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.360
eternity!

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.400
- Okay, we are having a meeting about this tomorrow!

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.400
- She was very persuasive!

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.500
(bar music and chatter)

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.840
- No, no, best Nicolas Cage

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.840
movie ever--"Bad Lieutenant:

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.840
Port of Call New Orleans."
- You're out of your mind, because it's

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.840
the John Woo classic

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.840
"Face/Off!"  Why?  Because you've

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.840
got Nicolas Cage weilding

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.840
twin gold-plated

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.840
desert eagles!
- He was doing that

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.840
in his own mind in "Bad Lieutenant!"

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:09.840
Plus, with dancing souls, iguanas,

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.840
and fat Val Kilmer.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.620
- "Peach--I could eat a peach for
hours!"  But, be that as it may,

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.620
- *clearing throat*

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.540
I hear you two are Nicolas

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.540
Cage fans?

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.540
- A touch!
- Ahhhh, bit

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.540
of an understatement, honestly.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.540
- Would that mean that you would be interested in

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.540
maybe doing a "Wicker Man"

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.540
review in the future?

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.540
Possibly

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.540
for little old me?

00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:38.540
- *chuckling*

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.480
- HOLD IT!

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.480
- *surprised mumbling*

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.960
- Okay, Arya Stark.  If you think you can

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.960
just leave after all the crazy shit you put

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.960
me through, you got another thing coming!

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.960
You are by far the craziest,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.960
nastiest, meanest,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.060
sadistic-dissest, psychotic-est-dest-dest-dest,

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.060
criminally insane, unwell,

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.060
mentally ill, @#$%ing obsessed

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.060
nutjob I've ever seen in my

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.060
entire life, and I

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.060
am gonna do what needs to be done

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.060
about it!

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.060
(suspenseful music)

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.680
You wanna come work for me?
My views always seem to go up

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.220
whenever I'm in pain!

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.220
- Yeah!  Sure.
- Woohoo!

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:25.300
(truck horn and crash)

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.300
(theme music)

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.060
- Hey, can't you read?!  No trucks

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.060
