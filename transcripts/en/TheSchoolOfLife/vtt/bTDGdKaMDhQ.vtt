00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260
Politicians from all walks of life nowadays agree on one thing:  we need to build more meritocratic societies.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.280
That is, societies where everyone, no matter what their background is,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.780
has the chance to succeed on their own merits.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.980
This is a beautiful idea responsible for some great things

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.940
like free education for all, positive discrimination, and a real effort to end nepotism in business and government.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.740
We've largely done away with the old world of feudalism where lords couldn't manage their estates,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.040
commanders couldn't understand the principles of battle, and peasants were brighter than their masters.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.940
No longer is background an impossible obstacle to advancement.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.380
An element of justice has finally entered into the distribution of rewards.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.940
It's been going on for about two hundred and fifty years, ever since Napoleon declared

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.260
that the ranks of the French army and civil service would henceforth

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.520
be open to all on merit rather than family background.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.560
It's been a brilliant development but there is, importantly, a darker side to the idea of meritocracy.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.000
Because if we truly believe that we've created or could one day create a world where the successful

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.720
truly merited all their success, it necessarily follows that we'd have to argue

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.960
that the failures were exclusively responsible for their failure.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:29.500
In a meritocratic age an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth and status, of course,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.740
but also of poverty.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.540
Low status comes to seem not just regrettable, but also deserved.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.840
Succeeding financially, without inheritance or contacts in an economic meritocracy,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.180
gives individuals an element of personal validation that the nobleman of old,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.200
who'd been given his money and his castle by his father, had never been able to feel.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.320
But at the same time, financial failure has become associated with a sense of shame

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.800
that the peasant of old, denied all chances in life, had also thankfully been spared.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.580
The question of why, if one's in any way good, clever, or able, one is still poor

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.260
becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.500
to themselves and other people, in a new meritocratic age.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.480
This turned out to be no shortage of people willing to answer the question on behalf of the poor.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.080
For a certain constituency it's clear, and perhaps even scientifically provable,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.560
that the poor owe their position to their own stupidity and degeneracy.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.440
With the rise of an economic meritocracy in certain quarters, the poor have moved from being described as unfortunate,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.480
the target of the charity and guilt of the paternally minded rich, to being described as failures,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.580
fair targets of contempt in the eyes of robust, self-made individuals who are disinclined to feel ashamed

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.000
about their mansions or shed crocodile tears for those whose company they've escaped.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.440
In the harsher climate of opinion that can gestate in the fertile corners of meritocratic societies,

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.440
it's become possible to argue that the social hierarchy rigorously reflects the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.840
qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.960
and so that conditions already in place for good people to succeed and the dummies to flounder,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.400
attenuating the need for charity, welfare, redistributive measures, or simple compassion.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.160
It's a symptom of our great faith in meritocracy

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.060
that it's largely become impossible to explain away our failures as the result of bad luck.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.720
While it's granted that luck maintains a theoretical role in shaping the course of our careers,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.140
the evaluation of people precedes in practical terms as if they could all fairly be held responsible for what happens to them.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.080
It would seem duly and even suspiciously modest

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.520
to ascribe a victory to good luck

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.880
and more importantly, it would be pitiable to blame defeat just on bad luck.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.280
Winners make their own luck.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
That's what modern society tells us.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.660
It's tough living in a world so in love with the idea that we're all responsible for everything

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.480
that it's largely dismissed bad luck as a credible explanation for defeat.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.640
But, of course, there can never be a truly meritocratic system

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.480
because the merit of an individual is far too complex and subtle a thing

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.480
to be determined by what job you end up having
and how much money you end up earning.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.740
Those who have faith in meritocracy are essentially subscribing to an insane and certainly arrogant assumption

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.120
that ordinary humans -- employers or customers -- can handily take over the solemn responsibilities

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.140
that past ages more wisely left in the hands of a god

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.140
who, helped along by the angels,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.660
was due to weigh the souls of each person on the day of judgement.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.160
No one in this world ever gets exactly what they deserve

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.860
in terms both of the good things and the bad things.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.900
Life, is to a large extent we don't quite admit to, random

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.400
in a way that the meritocratic philosophy denies.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.680
To free ourselves from some of the more punishing side effects of a meritocratic world view

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.520
it would be wise to cease investing something

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.020
as haphazardly distributed as jobs and money with moral connotations

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.100
and we should retain a little of the old-fashioned,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.860
modest belief in a distinction between what some earns and what they're like as humans.
