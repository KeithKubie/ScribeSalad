00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Welcome,
it's September 12th, 2018.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.410
We're here at the
Library of Congress.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.710
My name is Steve Winick.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.380
I'm the editor in the American
Folklife Center, and I'm here

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.100
with our guest John
McCutcheon, and John is going

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.630
to be performing
a concert tonight

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.550
in the Coolidge Auditorium,
and in the meantime,

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.100
we're going to ask him
some great questions

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.590
about his life and his career.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.890
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
Great, let's go.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.260
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, John,
let's begin with the sort

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.790
of typical question, your early
life and how you got interested

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.220
in all this music stuff?

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.840
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Well,
I was born and raised

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.480
in Northern Wisconsin, a little
town called Wausau, Wisconsin

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.430
and was interested in music in
general the way young kids are,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.710
but the seminal moment happened
actually not far from here.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.560
I wasn't there, but my mother,
when I was 11 years old,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.800
was watching television
in the middle of the day,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.590
and my mother didn't
watch television, period.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.890
And, here she was in
the middle of the day --

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.800
who know there was television
in the middle of the day,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.280
and she said, "Come over
here and watch this with me."

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.970
And, I was the eldest of her
nine children, so I was the --

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.500
and my father was a traveling
salesman, so I was the closest

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.370
to adult companionship
that she had,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.740
and what she was watching
was the March on Washington.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.260
And, it was, as you probably
know, the first thing

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.000
in our nation's history
broadcast live on every channel,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.030
which at that time meant three.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.860
And, it was an astonishing
thing to watch, and the takeaway

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.750
of that for me, it was my
introduction to folk music.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.090
I'd never heard of
folk music before,

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.460
and there was John Baos [assumed
spelling], Bob Dylan, and Peter,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.510
Paul and Mary singing, what my
mother told me were folk songs.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.330
And, I recognized them, because
they were all original songs

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.630
that they sang.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.020
Well, there was Marian
Anderson and Mahalia Jackson,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.510
which was a religious experience
for a kid from Wisconsin.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.690
But, I recognized this music
as something that was deep

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.010
and potent, but also
something that was connected

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.350
to contemporary issues as well,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.840
this being the most
contemporary issue.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.100
It was on the news every night,
and my best friend was watching

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.670
at the same time, and we -- the
next day we saw one another.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.050
I said, "Did you see that?

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.640
What was that," and we started
talking about this music

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.760
that we knew nothing about,
but that had really moved us.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.800
And, we started listening to it.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.200
It was at a time
-- this was 1963.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.660
You could hear folk
music on the radio.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.730
It was on television,
and it was --

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.340
I immediately went through
the sort of more rustic sound.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.110
I mean, a few years
later I got a guitar,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.190
because my best friend got
a guitar for his birthday,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.670
and I went down to the library,
and the only book in the library

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.200
that could teach me guitar
chords was Woody Guthrie

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.500
folk songs.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.870
And, I didn't know
who Woody Guthrie was.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.960
I was 14, and I'd sung
a song from school.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.790
Every American kid grows up
singing Woody Guthrie songs,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.950
but they never tell you
who writes those songs.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.780
So, I opened it up, and
here's a page of chord grids.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.090
I thought, "Great, I
know what these are,"

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.540
and here's a whole
bunch of songs.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.690
And, so my first real
heavy duty exposure

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.940
to learning this music was Woody
Guthrie, who was firmly planted

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.850
in traditional roots, built his
writing firmly on those roots,

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.310
and what it meant is I
completely missed the sort

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.970
of button-down collegiate
of folk music.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.610
I didn't know for five
more years, for instance,

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.460
that the Kingston Trio existed.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.870
I was right in the flannel
shirt and work boot world.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.720
It was Woody and from there it
was [inaudible] and, you know,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.700
somebody gave me
a Bob Dylan album,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.200
and I could tell what
well he drank from.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.490
So, it was, you know, it
began that crooked road

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.750
that took me right down
into one day saying,

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.360
"I want to play the banjo."

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.660
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Interesting.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.960
So, one of the things
that you mentioned

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.460
that was interesting was
that these were all people

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.000
on TV doing folk music.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.130
They were all doing, as
you said, original songs.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.430
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
Original stuff.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.450
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, that
sort of opens up that question

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.500
of the connection between
traditional folk music

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.330
and the original songs
that are called folk songs

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.210
by a lot of Americans.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.030
What's your take on that?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.290
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Well, I was
-- I fell prey to that as well.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.470
I mean, I knew that this
was somehow, you know,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:17.670
when Pete Seeger sang John
Henry, Broadside, or --

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.570
and, then he sang, you know,
Who Killed Davey Moore.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.520
They were somehow connected.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.930
They were built on the same
matrix, and so I thought, "Well,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.720
I'm going to write songs."

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.980
Look at this whole -- I finally
found out who Woody Guthrie was.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.360
"These are all original songs.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.020
I'm going to write
songs too," and I did,

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.790
and I wrote really awful songs
like you do when you start off.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.150
And, they were all
the more awful,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:58.220
because of the traditional songs
I knew that have been warm,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.200
smooth, and beautiful
on thousands

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.340
of tongues before mine, and--

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.660
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: So, they
were awful by comparison?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.530
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: They
were awful by themselves.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.090
My best friend, the
guitar guy who's --

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.120
we both started off
together, he's got a tape

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.000
of all those songs, and he
claims he's going to go right

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.290
up on YouTube if we ever
have a serious falling out.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.980
So, you know, what I did when
I got to banjo world, you know,

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.040
I was going to a little
college in Northern Minnesota,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.920
Saint John's University,
and it was at a time

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.220
when there were pretty
free willing

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.230
about giving people
independent studies.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.000
And, I went to my adviser
and said, "I want to --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.320
I'm going off the deep
end on this banjo thing,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.410
and I can tell I'm heading for
not being in college anymore,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.300
and is there a way we
can make this work?

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.600
Can I get credit?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.450
I need to be around
banjo players."

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.130
And, Guy Carawan had
come to our college,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:02.140
and I was designated his host,
because I was the only kid

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.230
in college who knew who he was.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.660
And, then I met Pete
Seeger later on in the year,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.790
and both of them said,
"You just got to go south.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.500
If you want to play the
banjo, you got to go

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.350
down where it's part of
the meat and potatoes

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.550
of people's daily diet."

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.150
So, I convinced my adviser

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.740
to let me do a three-month
independent study of traveling

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.040
around the Appalachians.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.570
I didn't have a car.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:31.270
I was -- I hitchhiked, and
so there I was at the side

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.050
of the road with a
banjo and a backpack,

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.970
and it was like a free bus ride.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.640
You know, people would
pick me up, and they'd say,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.940
"You play that thing?"

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.960
And, I learned to say, "I
play at it," and they'd say,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.260
"Well, play me something."

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.140
And, we'd be driving along
in a truck or something,

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.920
and I'd take it out and
play some and they'd say,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.320
"You play that old-style."

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.880
And, people called it
alternately flailing

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.220
and whacking and knock down,
claw hammer, and old time.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.000
And, they would say,
"Well, yeah,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.640
that's like my Uncle Beechert
[assumed spelling] plays."

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.190
And, I'd say, "Well, where
does Uncle Beechert live?"

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.400
And, they'd say, "Well,
he's right up here."

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.700
And, I guess the prospect

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.160
of seeing two banjo
players was enough

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.870
to derail people's
plans for the day.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:24.180
And, then it was, you
know, you meet one person,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.470
and that one person would
say, "Hey, come on over.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.440
We're going to have a party."

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:34.990
And, eventually, you know,
three month into this,

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.380
three-month independence study
I knew I was just figuring

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.450
out how to do this.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.780
Because, you know, you come
out of academia, and you --

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:50.150
in a little room, and they -- a
professional teacher comes in,

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.570
armed with a pedagogy that
is sequential or whatever,

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.110
and to the exclusion of
everything else you study,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.880
you know, late 18th
century French literature.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.340
And, then you go
to another room,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.820
and you do something entirely
focused and different.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.550
With this, it was as about
as unacademic as possible.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.850
They weren't teachers.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.750
They didn't have
a pedagogy for me.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:24.100
I just had to -- I had to learn
how to learn traditionally.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.160
I had to learn how to listen
and remember and duplicate

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.860
and be quiet and pay attention
and hang around the fringes.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.020
And, I discovered quite later
that I was the beneficiary

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.680
of a cultural phenomenon
that I didn't know --

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.590
I didn't recognize it in time.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.280
I was part of the first
generation of kids who grew

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.000
up in that part of
the world who had --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.090
was totally immersed into radio.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:57.230
And, they were -- they had
all kinds of stuff coming in,

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.220
all kinds of music, and
the kids of the people

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.060
that I was just happening upon
in general were not interested

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.740
in learning that music.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.500
They wanted to learn this
music, the popular stuff,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:17.120
the stuff that would give
them, you know, possibilities.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.430
And, there was the radio, there
were roads, there were jobs

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.140
in cities elsewhere,
and I end up knocking

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.860
on someone's door
unwittingly saying,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.840
"I'm from a 1000 miles away, and
I'd like to learn this music."

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.690
So, I became the
unwitting beneficiary

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:43.370
of this cultural phenomena, and,
you know, it didn't take me long

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.720
to fall in love with everything
about the region, the people,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.920
the music, the land, the stuff
that was just percolating

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.980
up in every -- you know,
whether it be the reform

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.310
of the mine workers union

00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:00.220
or a popular protest
against strip mining.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.720
What they call them [inaudible],
land rights issues, you know,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.540
water issues, and every
little community seemed

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.400
to have this kind of stuff.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.240
So, there was a lot of energy.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.590
I thought I was going down to
learn how to play the banjo,

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.910
but what I found was the
most interesting thing,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.340
and it's been my
study, since that time,

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.020
is how music functions in --

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:35.390
as a fundamental rather
than an ornamental part

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.860
of community life.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.310
That's what was really
interesting to me.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:44.390
And, if I learned some fiddle or
[inaudible] or a story or a song

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:49.410
or a dance or a hymn at
the same time, wonderful,

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:55.930
but if I walked away and just
got to go to a pie supper or go

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.420
to an old regular Baptist
meeting or whatever.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.290
It was a treat.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Great.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.440
So, were you recording all
of this at the time or?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.590
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: At first,
at the very first I wasn't,

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:16.530
and then as I started to
accumulate contacts and context,

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:22.100
I realized that I should
get some of this down.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:27.600
I became friends with the people
at Appalshop in Whitesburg,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.840
Kentucky, and they had good
recording equipment [inaudible]

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.810
boxes and stuff like that,
that I was able to --

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.430
and, I contacted
the Folklife Center.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:43.260
Joe Hickerson was the head
archivist at the time,

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.660
and he and I have been
-- we're still friends.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:52.290
I still see him every time I go
to Portland, but they arranged

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.360
to give me free reel-to-reel
tape,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.610
and so I started off
doing it that way.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.330
I got really dissatisfied
with reel-to-reel tape,

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.990
and I remember Mike Seeger and
I would have lots of discussions

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:12.380
about high-quality
cassette recordings,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:15.610
just because it wasn't
-- it was less intrusive.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:16.910
You could do more.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:20.600
It could be longer, and I can't
tell you how many times I would

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.850
watch someone singing
or playing something,

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.750
and they're watching
the reels go around.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:30.910
And, it just felt like it was
altering the whole atmosphere,

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:35.290
and I was all about, you know,
I was really reluctant to,

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:38.600
you know, it was sort
of like asking someone

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.320
if I could kiss their daughter.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.000
Excuse me, I know
we've, you know,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.460
I think I put my time in now.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.760
One funny story.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.160
One of the traditional
musicians that I was the closest

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.410
to was a fellow named Isaac
David Stamper, ID Stamper.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.860
Just the most stunning mountain
[inaudible] player I've ever

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.750
met, of blues mountain
[inaudible] player,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.320
originally from Searcy,
Arkansas, but his family moved

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.970
up to Letcher County, Kentucky,
and I met him at a festival,

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:13.080
and we agreed to
meet at his house.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.600
So, I went to his house,
and after I was there

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.450
for about three hours, I
said, "Mr. Stamper, you know,

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.440
my memory is just not that good,
and I really love your music,

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:26.690
and would you mind if I went
out to my car and brought

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.670
in my tape recorder and
tape some of your stuff?

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.660
I'll be happy to make a copy
for you and your family."

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.360
And, he said, "I'm
so glad you asked.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.640
Can I tape some of
your music as well?"

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.190
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
That's a nice outcome.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.490
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yeah,

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.080
it's better than some
that's been around there.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.600
I've heard lots of
stories over the years.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.390
Somebody taped me,
and made a record,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.630
and made a million dollars
off it, and there was no way

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.780
of dissuading people of that.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.680
So, I was hesitant to do it.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.390
A part of it was the
immediacy, but I also knew

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:12.040
that I was given incredible
intimate access to this stuff,

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.430
and for the longest
time I believed,

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:20.220
like a lot of people did and
some do, that this is dying out.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.800
That wasn't my experience
at all, and it was vibrant

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.900
and evolving, and it's sort
of like, "Can I tape you?"

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:32.440
you know? You know, I didn't
meet people who wanted me

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.420
to be a human tape recorder,
mimicking what they played.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.840
These were musicians.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.490
They were interested
in being musicians.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.580
They wanted to see,
well, how do you play?

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.240
You know, let's play
something together.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.400
No, I don't care if you can
play just like me, you know,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:54.250
and that's what I tried to do at
first, and I -- but I was young,

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.080
stupid, and I'd learned,
and now I'm old and stupid.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.430
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
Well, your recordings

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.690
of ID Stamper are
here in the library.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.100
There's copies of them,

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.620
and within that collection we
also have some other interesting

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.660
folks that you interacted with
and recorded at that time.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.890
And, I wonder if you mind
telling us a little bit

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.810
about some of them, starting
with Peanut Cantrell.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.110
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
Peanut Cantrell was

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.150
from McMinnville, Tennessee.

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:27.370
He was one of the very few
hammer dulcimer players

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:33.310
in the south, and as a hammer
-- you know, when I got to --

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:38.060
when someone gave me a hammer
dulcimer it was -- she built it.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.940
And, she said, "Here, I
just wanted to build it.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.240
I don't want to play it.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.540
You play a lot of instruments.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:45.370
You could probably play this."

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.920
And, I started to, but I
felt really ungrounded,

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.190
because of all the instruments
I played, I had really sought

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.890
out people who'd
played all their lives.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.720
I felt like they gave a
kind of, you know, gravity

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.510
and depth that I didn't find.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.870
And, I couldn't afford to
take lessons, but when it came

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.390
to the hammer dulcimer,
I couldn't find anybody

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.530
who was a traditional player.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.750
I went up to West Virginia
and met with Russell Fluharty

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:22.800
and Worley Gardner was up
in the Morgantown area.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.760
And, I never made it up to meet
Chet Parker up in Michigan.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:32.440
So, I happened to be out
at some fiddle convention

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.810
in McMinnville, and I decided
I was going to get up on stage

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.110
and play the hammer dulcimer.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.660
And, somebody came
over to me and said,

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.750
"You know Peanut Cantrell?"

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.790
And, so I went over
to his house.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.100
It was the only time we met.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:53.440
He died shortly thereafter,
but it was so exciting for me,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.920
because by this time I'd
actually been to Europe

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.640
and traveled around and found
hammer dulcimer type players

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.220
over there to find someone
with an American repertoire.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.510
And, Peanut was a
perfect name for him,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.250
little short guy and lovely man.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:10.550
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
So, how did he play?

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.850
I mean--

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:14.320
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: It was
very simple type stuff.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:18.400
I mean, I approached
the dulcimer as a drum,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.100
because I got sticks in my
hand, and all of a sudden,

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.250
I was eight years old, you know,

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.620
beating on the table
with pencils.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.450
So, I was -- you know, one
of the things I'm so grateful

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.110
for is that I went into
this whole experiment

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.250
with a completely open slate.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.840
I didn't, you know, when I went
south, you know, I was raised

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.340
on the Beverly Hillbillies,
Little Abner, and Snuffy Smith,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.560
and all that crap just
like everybody else.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.230
But, luckily, somehow I
didn't believe any of it,

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.360
and everything was information.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.400
So, with Peanut, it was --

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.840
I had no preconceptions of
what he was going to do.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.840
It was just like, "Let's go.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.370
Let's play," but it was --
you know, I have less --

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.130
I have fewer recordings of
him than I would've liked,

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.670
but I was really grateful that
I had an opportunity to see him.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.970
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And, it's rare

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.830
that anyone recorded a
traditional hammer dulcimer

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.130
playing in the south anyway.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.240
So, it's great that you did
get those recordings, yeah.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.540
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
Well, if you're --

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.840
I mean, that's one of the --

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.930
it's sort of like being
that 20-year-old kid

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.230
with the banjo and a backpack.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.920
I had a signal out there.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.600
This is what I do.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.630
So, when someone saw me
play the hammer dulcimer --

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.060
I mean, the first time I
ever played the dulcimer,

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.740
I was at [inaudible]
Mountain Music

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:40.470
and Dance Festival in Asheville.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.610
And, I was playing some
tunes, and I'd been playing

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.320
for 24 hours, but I knew how
to find fiddle tunes on it.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.620
And, this woman said,

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.860
"I've never seen anybody
play the [inaudible] before."

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.190
So, it was a pretty
unusual instrument.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.030
So, when I did, people
would come up and say,

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.090
you know about so and so.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.390
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:04.030
Great. Well, another person in
that collection is Cas Wallin,

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.340
who is kind of better
known I suppose,

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:12.050
but what was your
experience with [inaudible]?

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.680
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: I
stumbled into Sodom Laurel.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.330
There are the three Laurels,
Shelton Laurel, Sodom Laurel,

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:23.750
and Big Laurel, up in Madison
County, North Carolina.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.640
Many years ago, the Morris
Brothers from West Virginia,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.520
John and David Morris, got a
grant from the Ford Foundation

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.950
to put on some community
festivals

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.440
around the Appalachian
south, and one of them was

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.650
in Sodom, and I heard about it.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:44.430
I was probably 20-21 years
old, and I had heard some

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:49.810
of the Folkways Records of
people like Dillard Chandler,

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.320
and I -- so, I went up to this
festival, and it was, you know,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.400
Sodom was properly named.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.310
I mean, there was a
shooting, and a knifing,

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.760
and people would come around,
and say, "Stay in your tents."

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.790
But, the music was just
fantastic, and Cas, again,

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:15.640
was a short fellow,
very expressive,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.780
and he would plant
himself when he would sing.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.040
And, he would motion
with his arms, you know,

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.520
"Where will I shelter my
sheep tonight," and he had

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.530
that very adenoidal
kind of voice

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:40.590
and just an incredible
repertoire and a wicked sense

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.730
of humor, once you
got to know him.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:50.900
And, his wife would talk the
entire time that he was singing,

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:55.900
which is memorialized
in the collection.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:02.340
But, he sang old
ballads, and he was part

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:06.890
of that whole Dellie
Norton, Dillard Chandler,

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:12.640
Obrey Ramsey group up there
that -- and, Sheila Kay Adams,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.570
by extension, who was Dellie
Norton's granddaughter,

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.580
and who I met that weekend.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.010
We're -- Sheila Kay and
I are about the same age,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:29.210
and we were both young, you
know, banjo struck young people,

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:34.790
who just wanted to eat, breathe,
and play traditional music.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.550
And, I remember we sat
out most of that evening,

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.640
and then she took
me up to see Dellie,

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:47.580
who I think is the unsung star
of that whole clan up there.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.920
I mean, her singing is just some
of my favorite in the world.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.220
But, Cas -- I'm going
to be singing some

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.520
of Cas's stuff tonight, yeah.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.820
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick:
Yeah, that's great.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.840
Yeah, I think Sheila would
agree with you too about Dellie.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.210
She talks about her.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.300
So, one more person in
that collection is sort

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.390
of a separate tradition,
Michael Kennedy.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.150
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
I met Michael Kennedy

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.410
through my friend Malcolm
Delvish [assumed spelling],

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.290
who was a beautiful
hammer dulcimer player.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.450
He was -- when I started
playing, I was living

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.800
in the Knoxville area,
and Malcolm was living

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.620
in the Cincinnati area.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.130
And, because there weren't very
many hammer dulcimer players

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:28.580
in the world at that time,
we glommed on to one another

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.060
and just burned up I-75 going
back and forth between Knoxville

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.870
and Cincinnati, almost
every weekend if we could.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:38.060
And, Malcolm was
particularly taken

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.410
with Irish traditional music,
and he met this fellow,

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:47.380
Michael J. Kennedy, who
was a melodeon player,

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.830
an Irish national immigrant to
this country, and he was living

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.210
in Covington, Kentucky,
which is right

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:56.740
across the Ohio River
from Cincinnati.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:00.770
And, he would take -- and,
he and his musical partner,

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.410
Grey Larsen, would -- excuse
me, I just hit the mic.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:07.710
He and his musical partner,
Grey Larsen, would take me

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:14.640
over to Michael Kennedy's
house, and I had, by that time,

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:21.770
started to organize some of my
field recordings into albums

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.090
for June Apple Records,
which was a, you know,

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:31.500
a nascent record company that
was a division of Apple Shop.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:35.880
And, had gotten a small grant
from the National Endowment

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:41.610
for the Arts where Alan
Jabbour was the head of --

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:48.590
what was it called --
Folkarts or something like --

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:54.670
but, it was something even
more broad earlier on.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.450
And, I'd gotten a small grant
to put some recordings together

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:05.370
and organize them into LPs,
and so I got together with --

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:11.180
at a radio station in
Cincinnati -- with Michael.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.270
And, he wanted to
do it very formerly.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.830
You probably, you know, people
who listened to it, you know,

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:22.850
he would announce what he was
going -- "This is this tune."

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.770
And, then he would play it,
and he wanted people to clap

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.030
at the end, which was
problematic, because after two

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.980
or three hours they
were sort of like.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.680
And, I'm running
the tape recorder,

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.010
clapping like, "Come on guys.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:37.310
Be a little more enthusiastic."

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.960
And, there's four of
us in the room, so.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.160
But, he was a lovely man, and
he died -- when did he die?

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.710
But, I remember I
was passing through,

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.400
and he was in a hospice --
in a hospital, and I went --

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.460
Malcolm and I went by and played
him some tunes that would turn

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:57.760
out to be the night
before he died,

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.290
and Michael Malcolm called
me the next day to tell me,

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:06.430
and I thought, "I
hope that's my fate."

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.580
That some of my musical
friends will come in

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:10.060
and play something
at my bedside.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:14.690
He was a beautiful man.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.580
He looked -- you know,

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.810
it's funny I saw his picture the
other day, and I never asked him

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.230
if he actually got a
gig as Santa Claus,

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.650
but he certainly had that look.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.950
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Excellent.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.250
So, I mean, yeah,
it's interesting,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.020
because you've mentioned
before that these traditions,

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.320
although we might have thought

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.890
at one point they were dying
out, they aren't really.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.210
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: No, no.

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.510
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But,
the individual people

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.810
that you meet and record.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.130
They pass on, and so--

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.770
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: As
we all do and will, yeah,

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:51.380
and so there was
a period of time

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.980
when I got much more aggressive.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:54.850
Not aggressive, I
got much more --

00:26:54.850 --> 00:27:00.810
spent a lot more time doing
field work and trying to figure

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.940
out how to do it
better all the time.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.420
I mentioned that Mike Seeger
and I worked, you know,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.090
there was a period of time
for years where we were both,

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:13.160
you know, really trying to --

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.460
we were experimenting

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.040
with different high-end
cassette recorders,

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.850
which seems like an oxymoron.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:27.400
But, there were actually some --
Nakamichi had a three channel --

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.460
it was a stereo and a mono,

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.350
and I have some beautiful
recordings,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:33.130
which I'll be sending
up to the library,

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.660
of this banjo players Will
Keyes [assumed spelling]

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.470
from Upper East Tennessee, from
Gray, Tennessee, and he played

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.320
in such a way -- he
lost one of his --

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.320
he lost the tip of his index
finger in a sawmill accident.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.510
And, he, as a child -- so,
he learned to play the banjo

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.860
in this very unusual
two-finger style

00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.050
where he could play all five
strings with his index finger,

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:04.430
because it was short relative
to what his thumb was.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.720
And, he sort of held
the banjo out here.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:13.010
So, the Nakamichi, for instance,
allowed me to do a stereo micing

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:17.930
and then put the third
mono mic actually in --

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.920
point it in the back of the
banjo, and it's the most --

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.930
it's my favorite banjo
recording I've ever heard,

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.840
because it's dull.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.210
You're really inside the
banjo, and for someone

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.360
who plays it's sort of like
someone who plays the autoharp.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.970
They get to hear this orchestral
sound, and to everybody

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.130
out in front it's sort
of [imitating strumming].

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:49.340
So, and then, of course, DAB
machines came and it's funny.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.350
I remember I was in -- I
was thinking of this today,

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.430
knowing that we were
going to talk.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.360
I happened to be coming
back from Nicaragua

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.010
where I had been doing a
bunch of field recording.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:08.240
This is in 1980, mid-80s, and
I was waiting in baggage claim,

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.860
and up walks Flawn Williams,
an old friend of mine,

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.360
who at that time
was working at NPR.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.380
And, he's saying, "So,
where have you been?"

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.560
So, I've just come back from
three weeks in Nicaragua.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.910
I'm waiting for my
suitcases of tapes.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.940
He said, "Yes, I just went
off for NPR to Vietnam,

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.960
and I've got a 100 hours."

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.510
And, I said, "I do too.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.920
Mine is in three suitcases."

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:38.220
And, he said, "Mine is in the
shoe box under my arm here."

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:39.520
And, I said, "What?"

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.820
He says, "It's this
new technology,

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.630
a little tiny DAB machine."

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.840
So, of course, I
went out and got one,

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.150
and it changed everything.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:52.150
It -- I mean, it was -- didn't
have the hiss of a cassette,

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.460
and again, it was even smaller

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.490
than the smallest
cassette machine.

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:01.750
And, it just made the
recording experience

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:08.510
for everybody much less
obvious, which is what you want.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.810
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:13.110
And, now, of course, the media
size is negligible compared even

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.410
to the equipment.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.000
I mean, everything's
so small, yeah.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.300
Yeah.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.600
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yeah, and --

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.970
but, back then, it
was the Wild West.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.700
I'm really grateful
that I had access

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.760
and [inaudible] studios
here in the area.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.320
Bill McCaroy [assumed
spelling] had a Nagra

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.750
that I would rent
from time to time.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.200
So, I mean, I was
grateful I had access,

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.550
because there was a period
of time I had a wallet sack.

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:40.850
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:44.180
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: You
know, big bear of a thing,

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:47.880
and it was like you
were moving a television

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.180
into somebody's house.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.480
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: And, the funny
thing is they called those

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.260
things portable, because
they had handles on them.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.560
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yes.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.860
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: But, yeah.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.160
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Well, you
know, it's sort of like what's,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.400
you know, the original
laptop computers where--

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.700
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Right.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.000
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
Filled your whole lap.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.300
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: Yeah.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.600
Yeah, great.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.860
So, well we've talked
about a couple

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.380
of the instruments you play,
but the hammer dulcimer kind

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.310
of stands out being
an unusual instrument,

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:17.150
but also people consider you
a master of this instrument.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:20.940
So, you talked about your
beginnings with the instrument,

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.510
but how did you get
further involved?

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.920
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
I had a girlfriend

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.230
who took an instrument
building class

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:35.320
up in [inaudible] West Virginia,
and I went up to visit her

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.730
at the end of this class,

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.400
and she had built this thing
called a hammer dulcimer.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.940
I'd heard about it.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.350
I'd seen Guy Carawan play
it and that was the --

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:49.000
you know, I never thought
I wanted to play it.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.320
But, she said, "Here, I have
this thing that I've built,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.680
and I just -- I've
accomplished my goal.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.930
Why don't you," -- and,
my birthday was nearby,

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.230
and she said, "Here,
happy birthday."

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.670
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: That was
nice, and what was her name?

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:03.970
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Jude
Odell [assumed spellings],

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.060
and she is a wonderful banjo
player who lives up in --

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.520
and jeweler who lives
up in Indianapolis.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:16.210
And, it's, you know, there
are many different tunings,

00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:19.250
but the tuning that has
sort of become dominant

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:25.550
in American music
now is very logical,

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.070
and it was diatonically set up,

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.110
and I was primarily a
fiddle player at that time.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.790
It happens, you know, banjo
players discover the fiddle,

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.480
and then they are -- they fall

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.610
into the rabbit hole
of the haired bow.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.820
And, so I was just
playing fiddle.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.740
So, I had an encyclopedia
of fiddle themes in my head,

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.270
and I just started
pecking them out, and,

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:55.120
"Okay I know how this
works," plus you can do rolls,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.530
and when I was a kid, I
wanted to play the drums.

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.960
And, so this was like the
close -- it was a string drum,

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.270
and so what I did, as far
developing my playing on it,

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:13.310
I mostly played fiddle
tunes, but I was different

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.650
from most other hammered
dulcimer players

00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.540
that I was meeting.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.600
And, they included people like
Sam Rizzetta and Paul Reisler

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:29.900
who played with Sam in the
group Trapezoid and Malcolm.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.980
Different people who were
all parts of ensembles.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.920
They had some kind of
chordal foundation upon

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.780
which they were playing, and
it effected how they plaid.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.080
I was a soloist.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.380
I wasn't going to be in a band.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.090
I didn't want to be in a band.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:50.640
It was nice and mobile and
portable, and it worked for me.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:55.510
So, I had to figure out
how to create some kind

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.750
of harmonic foundation upon
which to play, and it really --

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:04.020
so, I was playing these
tunes, and then trying

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.640
to create an accompaniment
at the same time

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.920
or at least an arrangement that
didn't make people say, "Well,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.830
that'd be pretty good if
he had a guitar player

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:16.290
with him or something."

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:22.430
But, I was also looking for
those traditional players,

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:27.210
and I was frustrated
enough that I knew

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:32.510
of a fellow named
David Kettlewell

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.680
who had done a book called, "All
the Tunes That Ever There Were,"

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.920
which was a little
mimeographed thing I got

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.640
from Andy Spence
[assumed spelling].

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:46.770
Talked about a bunch of dulcimer
players throughout England

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.070
and Ireland.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.260
So, I said, "I have the same
feeling as when I open that,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:56.750
you know, Mountain Music of
East Kentucky album that came

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.050
into our college library."

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.590
There was a picture of
Roscoe Holcomb on the front,

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.740
and inside was directions.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.410
You know, here's where
these people live,

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:08.990
and I thought, "Okay, I'm going.

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:10.970
I want to have some kind

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.500
of traditional foundation
for my playing."

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:18.350
So, I went over and met
Bill Fell [assumed spelling]

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:26.750
and Billy Bennington, and the
absolute star was Jimmy Cooper.

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.940
Just the most astonishingly
versatile player.

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:34.330
He played on streets
as a young man

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.170
and just played all
the kinds of tunes

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.450
that you would expect a
traditional Scottish player

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.450
to play.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:46.610
[Inaudible] and [inaudible] and
hornpipes and jigs and reels,

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:51.310
but he also played Cha
Chas and old parlor songs

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:56.060
and accompanied singing,
and it was like opening

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.800
up a whole world, because prior

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.530
to that it had been
fiddle tunes.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.120
Then, I started with
ragtime piano pieces.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.590
&gt;&gt; Steve Winick: There's
a certain logic to that.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.460
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yes,
and then in the mid-70s,

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.980
I discovered [inaudible]
Caroline, and said, "Okay, well,

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.530
I'm going to take harp music,"
which, again, there's a kind

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.980
of logic to this,
but I came back,

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:21.420
and this is 1977,
when I met Jimmy.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.670
I came back, and I was playing
at the Buffalo Folk Festival,

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.240
and my -- I didn't know my
life was about to change.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:30.920
I was doing a hammered
dulcimer workshop,

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.680
and this young woman came up
to me and said, "You know,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.910
my dad plays the dulcimer."

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:37.100
I said, "Really?"

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:40.410
She says, "Yeah, my dad
and his two brothers

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:43.530
and my great-grandfather
and, yeah,

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.250
so it's a tradition
in our family."

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.550
And, I said, "I would
love to meet your father."

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:52.090
And, she said, "I bet
he'd like to meet you."

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:54.340
And, so the day after
the festival I went

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.510
over to her house, and
there sat Paul [inaudible],

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.730
and he changed everything.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.370
I mean, not only did he
become one of my dear friends,

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.840
but he was a guy who was the
most musical dulcimer player

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.140
I've ever met.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:12.440
He loved to play.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.740
In fact, I walked
in, and there he was,

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.270
sitting behind his dulcimer
with his hammers in his hand,

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.570
you know, like, "Come on.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.950
I don't want to know
about your family.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.650
I don't want to make small talk.

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.990
Let's just play."

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:31.320
And, he made everything he
played sound like it was written

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.450
for the dulcimer, and it
was like a light going off,

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.780
and I thought, "This is what
American hammer dulcimer

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.670
music is."

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:46.080
And, he just passed
away in March.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: March, yeah.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.750
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: And, he --

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:55.690
at 97, and at 97 he was still
the best hammer dulcimer I've

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:56.990
ever heard.

00:37:56.990 --> 00:38:01.940
He'd -- and, he got more
adventurous the older he got.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.080
When I met him, he
was playing a dulcimer

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:08.350
that his grandfather had
built, and it was a fifth

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:09.690
across the treble bridge,

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:12.320
and then like the
Michigan players an octave

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.710
from the right-hand side

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:17.570
of the treble bridge
to the bass bridge.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:19.990
And, it was a really
funky instrument.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:24.750
And, it was held together with
bailing wire and scotch tape,

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:29.560
and he was very interested
in my Rizzetta instrument,

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:34.210
because it was chromatic, and
eventually had dampers on it,

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.960
and it was light, and
it stayed in tune well,

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.660
and so he ordered a
Rizzetta instrument.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.390
And, Sam tweaked
it here and there

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.140
to make it even more chromatic,

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.680
and then he was off
to the races.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.340
Whenever you saw
Paul after that,

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:55.330
he was playing the
most wild chromatic --

00:38:55.330 --> 00:39:00.250
you know, let's substitute
this B flat chord here

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.550
for this, you know.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.580
And, so he was really
adventurous, loved music,

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.680
loved musicians,
and he was just --

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.760
I don't know what my
playing would have been like,

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:17.790
and he was learning new tunes.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.100
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Was
he trained as a musician?

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:21.450
I mean, like reading
music and all that?

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:22.750
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
No, not at all.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:26.410
He learned to play from
his maternal grandfather,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.450
a fellow by the name of Jesse
Martin [assumed spelling],

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:32.890
who was a professional
hammer dulcimer player.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.230
He played in movie houses.

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: In
that Henry Ford era when--

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.730
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
He won the audition

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:42.170
to be Henry Ford's hammer
dulcimer player, but he --

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:44.740
but, Henry Ford, very
famously, was a [inaudible],

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:49.390
and Jesse Martin, very
famously, was not.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:52.990
So, he won the audition,
but never played, but --

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.040
so when he -- he
played in movie houses,

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.500
while they were changing
the reels, and, you know,

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.060
and people who know
what I'm talking

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:05.890
about are officially old.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.590
And, then in his retirement
he moved in with his daughter

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.540
and taught his grandsons,
Phil, Paul,

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.900
and Sterl [assumed spelling],
and Sterl was a fixture and sort

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:20.700
of the -- he played fiddle
and dulcimer in the sort

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:28.170
of western New York Bluegrass
and folk music world.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:32.780
Phil, who built dulcimers,
moved to Arkansas,

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.230
and I actually have one
of his dulcimers built

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:40.290
after his grandfather's design,
and Paul lived in [inaudible].

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:44.810
Paul was a tool grinder for
[inaudible] craft by trade,

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:48.510
and then when he -- it's funny.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.540
I was just playing at the Wheat
Lands Music Festival up at --

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.200
near Traverse City,
Michigan this last weekend.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.380
And, some people came up to
me, while I was there, saying,

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.020
"I remember when Paul
[inaudible], and you would come

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.320
to the Everett, you
know, old time music

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.560
at the hammer dulcimer
convention,

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.440
and Paul would be the first one
up and the last one to bed."

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.950
He would wear everybody
out in the jam sessions,

00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.880
and I attended several
[inaudible] family reunions

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.630
where I got to hear the
three brothers play together

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.390
which was just angelic.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:28.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Amazing.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:29.990
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yeah.

00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:31.290
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:35.180
So, in addition to playing all
these instruments you're also a

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:41.300
well-known songwriter, and I
wanted to ask you about writing

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.600
for different instruments.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.000
I mean, do you write a song
for a particular instrument

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.940
or what's your writing
process like?

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.170
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: I tend to --

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:55.650
the two instruments I
write the most for --

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:01.830
on are guitar and piano,
and I switch back and forth,

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.120
and sometimes, in the middle
of writing of something

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.300
when I'll just say, you
know, "I want to have," --

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.430
the guitar for me
is very blockish,

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.440
the way it's all set up, and
the piano is very linear.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.210
And, it's all about voice.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:21.330
But, everyone now and again, you
know, I'll be writing something,

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:25.320
and I'll say, "This
is a banjo piece."

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:32.710
And, to me all these instruments
are absolutely related.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.050
I mean, number one I started
playing all these instruments,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.650
because I would be at
some banjo player's house,

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.210
and a fiddle player
would be there,

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:45.880
and we would have
the same vocabulary.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.110
And, I remember the first time
I ever played a fiddle I was

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.090
at a square dance in
Benfield, Tennessee,

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.870
and the fiddle player
didn't show up.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.170
And, I was used to
playing the banjo,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.910
and somebody there had a fiddle,
said, "Here, you can play this."

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.210
And, I said, "No, I can't."

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.380
They said, "Well, the
dance is 20 minutes long.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.070
You know what the notes are.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:06.120
By the end of this 20 minutes
I'll bet you'll be playing it."

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.420
And, they were right.

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.520
I could play really badly
this particular tune

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.820
by the end of it.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.040
So, it was -- and, so
then you realize, well,

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.270
this is the same
fingering as the mandolin,

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.580
and a lot of it was
just you're using --

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.550
you're doing this with one hand

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:23.190
and something completely
unrelated with the other.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.630
So, once you get this
tapping your head

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:27.620
and rubbing your belly.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:34.120
All that is to say that I look
at these as having a great, big,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:39.050
really expensive tool box, and
when I'm writing something,

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:41.870
sometimes I will write it on the
guitar and I'll say, "No, no,

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:43.170
it doesn't belong there."

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.960
Or, what would it be like?

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.840
How would this change?

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.860
And, sometimes it's
an atmospheric thing.

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.900
A banjo gives it a different --

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.590
Wade Ward, one of my
favorite musicians from down

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:58.940
in Independence, Virginia had
this beautiful way of talking

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:02.700
about musical terminology,
and he would call --

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.620
when you wanted to play
in the key of A, he'd say,

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.960
"Let's get up in that
high atmosphere."

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.440
And, I always thought that's
such a beautiful way of talking

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:18.860
about keys and the different
voices of, you know --

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.740
whether I'm writing
in a voice, you know,

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.500
I'm going to be a 14-year-old
Native American girl,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.530
or whether I'm going
to say I'm going

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:37.610
to give this piece an atmosphere
by singing it with the fiddle.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.020
You know, it -- sometimes,
it happens right

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.700
from the beginning, and
sometimes it's saying, well,

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.690
let's try on another
suit of clothes

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.310
and see what it looks like.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So,
in your song writing --

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.800
I mean, you've mentioned
Woody Guthrie

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.920
and Pete Seeger as
two influences.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.220
Are they influences

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:57.260
on the songwriting part
of your life as well?

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.090
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon:
Woody, certainly,

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:05.860
because in that book
-- this was a book

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.530
that I thought was a
guitar instruction book.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:11.370
I mean, that's how little
I knew about Woody Guthrie,

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:15.610
and it as was a -- and,
so I thought, "Well,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:18.360
it's an instruction book, so
you start in the beginning."

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.300
And, I went sequentially,

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.240
and it took me an embarrassingly
long time to realize

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.950
that it was arranged
alphabetically.

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:29.490
I mean, what are the chances
that all the easier songs start

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:35.300
with A, but what that meant,
that kind of, you know,

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.390
that's just how they
decided to do it.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.180
One page was a love song,
the next was a kid song,

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.720
and then there'd be
an historical song,

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:46.020
and then a topical song,

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.010
and then a funny song
and an angry song.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.120
And, it was an introduction
to someone who wrote

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.980
about everything for
every possible audience.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:01.360
It wasn't weird to write
kid songs directed to kids.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:04.740
It wasn't weird to write a
song about a historical event

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:08.380
that you knew your
listener knew nothing about.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:13.820
Your job was to pay attention
and to try to tell the truth.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:15.120
And, so that was huge.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:22.340
I mean, that was -- and to
have guts, to be courageous,

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:30.430
to be willing to name things,
and to give something of --

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.340
I mean, I remember one
of the very first --

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.740
because, it was alphabetical,
one of the very first songs

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.480
in this book was
the 1913 Massacre.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.560
And, I got to this line
that said, "I'll take you

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.260
through a door and
up a tall stair."

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.770
And, man, I was there.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:50.330
It was very, you know,
a song as a movie,

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:53.430
and I thought that's
how I want to write.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:59.830
I want to be that cinematic and
take people inside, you know,

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:02.550
invite them into these spaces.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.280
So, yeah, Woody --

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.630
the songwriters that were
really powerful for me,

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:12.980
as I was starting out,
was Jean Ritchie who is

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.950
such a good songwriter that
most people don't know she's

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:18.250
a songwriter.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right,

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:20.850
they don't know the
songs were hers, right?

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.150
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yes, and
you hear a song like Cool

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:23.940
of the Day, and you --

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:29.570
which, she told me once that
she wrote while she was ironing.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:34.280
And, most people don't know that
that's not a traditional song.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.560
Hazel Dickens, the same thing.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.850
I mean, she was thoroughly
immersed in traditional music,

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.450
and so her writing
came out of that,

00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:50.760
and talk about a courageous
writer, that song Black Lung.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:58.260
My god. Utah Phillips, again,
came out of that school

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.890
of knowing, you know,
about traditional music,

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:05.930
using those forms, and
having a kind of empathy

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:09.570
and compassion that, you know --

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:15.190
I mean, to Utah no
one was dispensable.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.490
And, so yeah, you'd --

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:20.920
funny thing, why is he singing
me this song about this hobo?

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:22.570
I don't know anything --
I don't know any hobos.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.430
Are there hobos anymore?

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:30.310
And, all of a sudden,
you couldn't look away,

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.680
and that was the kind of writing

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.860
that really inspired,
and continues.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:41.480
Bernice Reagon Johnson, just
an astonishing songwriter that,

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.550
again, people don't know.

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.970
And, she came right
out of the church.

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:47.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.380
Yeah, and that's
another kind of influence

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.220
that you can detect
in your songs.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.610
I guess, there's both kind of
the sacred heart side of things

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.870
and the African-American
spiritual side, so.

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:02.720
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Well, I, you
know, I grew up as a Catholic,

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:07.770
which has the meagerest
singing tradition.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.940
I was actually the seminary
for a couple of years,

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.410
and when I decided I was going
to leave, I told my mother.

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.140
I said, "No, I don't think
I want to be a priest.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.750
I think I'd rather
be the choir leader."

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:20.650
And, she said, "That's a tougher
job at a Catholic church."

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.950
So, when I came to a
place that was, you know,

00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:27.040
there was this rich
musical tradition.

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:32.880
And, it was -- I could be
completely misspeaking,

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:39.150
but I think American folk music
is unique or certainly rare

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:42.150
in that it includes
religious music

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:48.090
in music that's considered
folk music.

00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:51.920
And, you know, on one
hand I would be sitting

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.260
with Janette Carter, and
she would be singing,

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.460
"Little Moses," or "The
Poor Orphan Child,"

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:01.210
and the next day I would be
attending a regular Baptist

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:04.410
service with Roscoe Holcomb.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:08.500
And, everybody somehow knows
the melody of this circuitous --

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:11.080
and, someone is lining
out the words,

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.220
and then the next day I would
be at an old harp singing,

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:20.900
and it was all religious music,
completely different stuff.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.430
And, the next night
I'd see Ralph Stanley

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.090
And The Clinch Mountain
Boys doing, "Oh, Death," or,

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.410
"Children Go Where I Send Thee,"
or "Cry From The Cross," or,

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:32.800
you know, "Two Coats
Lay Before Me."

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.730
And, it was -- again, I think
if you look at the history

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:40.720
of political music
in this country,

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.890
the most powerful
stuff was the music

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:44.770
from the Civil Rights Movement.

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:49.030
And, a lot of it was
because it had the depth

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:52.540
of not only it being
traditional based,

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:55.900
but spiritually based
stuff, which gave it a kind

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.470
of gravitas that, you know,

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:03.040
newly composed stuff
just wasn't approaching.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:06.800
Well, the other sort of great
political movement bringing us

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.470
songs was the Labor Movement,
and I know you've worked

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.960
with both, labor songwriters
and labor as a musician.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.570
So, let's talk just a little
bit about your projects

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:20.410
with [inaudible], for example.

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.710
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Well,
Sai [assumed spelling],

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:26.550
as the people who are watching
this, is a rabbi's son who grew

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.700
up in State College,
Pennsylvania and signed

00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:32.420
up for SNCC in the
very early days

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.180
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.510
He, you know, was a
guy who played guitar,

00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:42.140
but wasn't writing songs, but
quickly understood the kind

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:48.380
of plane spoken vernacular
usage of people's own words.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.990
I mean, when you -- when one
of the things that I recognize

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:55.660
about Sai's music early on,
this is back in the days

00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:00.080
where he denied he was writing,
and he would flat-out lie.

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:03.100
"No, I didn't," you know?

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:07.200
I'd be at a party [inaudible],
"Wow, that was a great song.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.810
Where did that come from??

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:13.000
He says, "This guy down
the road," and eventually,

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.880
I just drove down to his house
in Mineral Bluff, Georgia,

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.080
and I said, "I want to meet
this guy down the road."

00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:22.080
And, he says, "Well,
I wrote it."

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.540
And, I said, "Well, why
aren't you admitting this?"

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:29.500
"Well, because everyone
is into collecting stuff.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:31.200
Now, and I figured
if I said I wrote it,

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.500
the people wouldn't
take it seriously,"

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:36.180
sort of like J.P. Fraley, who
I spent a lot of time with,

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:40.030
and he wrote half the tunes
he played, but he said --

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:41.360
and he would confide in you.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.770
I mean, he's dead now, so I can
-- he'd confide, and he'd say,

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:47.600
"Well, if I told so
and so I wrote that,

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:51.600
they wouldn't pay any attention
to it, so I tell them that I,

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.190
you know, collected
it from [inaudible],

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.820
or I learned it from
my grandfather."

00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:00.430
But, Sai is just one
of the most prolific

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:05.190
and wonderful songwriters
in his spare time.

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:09.960
We met on a Harlan County picket
line on Thanksgiving Day, 1972.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.760
He was there working with
the Brookside Strike,

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.320
the subject of Harlan
County, USA,

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.210
the Barbara Kopple
Academy-award-winning film,

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:21.400
and I was there, because I
didn't have a Thanksgiving

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.700
Day invitation.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.610
And, I knew there was a strike,
and I figured, okay, well,

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:27.110
I'll go up and sing
at the picket line.

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:31.400
So, I was sitting around a 55
gallon oil drum with a bunch

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:38.690
of guys who were wanting to be
back at work, and somebody said,

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:42.430
"There's a guy who is a banjo
player down at the picket line."

00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:44.120
And, so I showed up.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.520
And, he was working for
the UMW at the time,

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:52.250
and we recognized our mutual
love of traditional music

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:57.340
and southern music and struck
up a partnership that exists

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:01.330
to this day, and we started
writing songs together

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:04.120
in the early 1990s.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:09.710
We did a lot of work together,
and we toured together

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.710
in the early and mid-80s,

00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:15.790
but we were both singing
our own songs at that point.

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:21.250
We started writing
together, because we're guys,

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:26.650
and we had to have an
excuse to get together.

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:29.380
We'd have to say well, you know,
"Yeah, we just like to hang

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.500
out for a few days, but
that would be weird,

00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.230
and we don't hunt.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:38.270
So, why don't we get
together and write songs?"

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:42.460
And, we found that we
worked really well together,

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:45.900
because we were compatible
and complementary.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:53.240
Sai is a wall and stud guy,
and I'm the guy who comes in

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.950
and does the finish work,

00:54:54.950 --> 00:55:01.690
and the way we would write is
sometimes I would write a whole

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.270
song, sometimes he would
write a whole song.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:06.780
We used the Lennon and McCartney
rule, everything that, you know,

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:10.850
everybody knows John Lennon had
nothing to do with, "Yesterday,"

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:14.550
but they both -- you know,
this is an agreement.

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.640
But, there were times
when we would --

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.290
Said would come up with some
structure, and he'd say,

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:22.550
"Fine, okay, you finish it."

00:55:22.550 --> 00:55:25.340
And, years later he
would see it on an album,

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.850
and it would be credited to him.

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.320
He said, "Did I have
anything to do with it?"

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:33.520
Yeah, yeah, you did, and at the
time I started working with Sai,

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:39.660
I was the kind of guy that if
I wrote a song, I was like,

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:40.960
"That's a good day's work."

00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:45.090
And, Sai would say,
"Great, what's next?"

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.460
And, we got to the point
where we wrote an entire album

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:52.350
in a day and a half,
and it was a good album.

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.430
We got a Grammy nomination
for it, but we were just

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:58.210
in the groove, and
we were, you know,

00:55:58.210 --> 00:56:00.160
passing stuff off
back and forth.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.900
And, Sai would go off and take
a nap, which he's really good at

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.780
and come back and
be ready to go.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:11.210
He's the most present
person I've ever met.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.820
He's just, you know, I got
to do a conference call,

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:17.130
and he's right there,
and then he hangs up

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.970
and he's right back there.

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:25.090
He's astonishing, and
he's also an endless font

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:28.690
of fantastic ideas.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:36.160
I just recently started
doing his song that --

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.510
I remember when he
wrote it called,

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.410
"Go To Work On Monday
One More Time."

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:45.330
It was just -- he was working
on the J.P. Stevens Boycott

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:47.010
at the time, and
he happened to --

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:51.300
they were trying to get
brown lung introduced --

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:55.590
recognized as an
occupational disease.

00:56:55.590 --> 00:57:02.760
And, he just -- it was
a guy talking about,

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:04.520
you know, "I'm sick.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:06.930
The doctor is lying to me,
my boss is lying to me,

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.330
and everybody knows
what's wrong,

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:10.630
and I can't do anything else.

00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:12.360
So, I'm just going
to have to go to work

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.520
on Monday one more time."

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:19.340
And, it's, you know, I've
known that song for 40 years,

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:24.550
and every time I sing it, and I
just -- I do it with fiddle now,

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:27.890
just give it a different voice.

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:34.270
It's an astonishing song, and
it's so effecting, and it's one

00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:36.470
of the things that fiction does.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:39.670
It opens us op to an
experience that we would --

00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:44.600
I mean, I defy anybody
not to be changed somehow

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.110
by hearing this really authentic
voice saying, you know,

00:57:49.110 --> 00:57:51.810
"The doctor says
I smoked too much.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:53.110
He says that I ain't trying.

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:54.610
He says he don't
know what I got,

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:57.290
but we both know he's lying.

00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:03.310
I'm going to work on Monday
one more time," and not just be

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:05.070
in that guy's presence.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:07.570
And, it's a special
songwriter that can do that,

00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:09.990
and Sai is that kind of
songwriter, and I'm lucky enough

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:12.820
to sort of be on the planet
at the same time he is,

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:15.550
and we're pals, and we
get to write together.

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:16.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.780
Well, there's one other pal
I'd like to ask you about,

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.690
because I had the pleasure
of interviewing her here

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.070
when she was here, and
that is Carmen Aberdeen.

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:28.160
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: I
mean, I do know her.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.460
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Carmen is John's wife.

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:34.270
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Yes,
yes, for ten years now.

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:35.570
Well--

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I mean,
as an influence though.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.790
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: It was
her birthday yesterday.

00:58:40.790 --> 00:58:50.690
You know, I met Carmen sort
of back in the mid-90s.

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.350
I was doing a collection for --

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.080
I was on the board of
Grassroots Leadership

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.590
which was Sai's regional
organizing organization.

00:58:57.590 --> 00:58:58.890
That was his real job.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:03.470
He was a great songwriter in
his spare time, and I was --

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:09.630
I put together a multicultural
children's album of music

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:15.330
for the, you know, for
1992, the 500th anniversary

00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:18.470
of Columbus stumbling
on the New World.

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:23.360
And, it was very successful,
and I didn't know Carmen at all,

00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:26.630
and I was going to do a
multicultural storytelling album

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.450
to benefit the same
organization,

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.700
and our mutual friend Michael
Parent [assumed spelling],

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.780
who was a wonderful storyteller
of French-Canadian descent,

00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.150
said, "Well, here's
who you should get."

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.790
And, I had been to the National
Storytelling Festival a couple

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:47.240
of times, I guess as sonic
relief, but somebody recognized

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:53.180
that a lot of John's songs tell
stories or have introductions

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.010
that are more than
just sort of pedantic

00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:59.780
or I wrote this because.

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:03.330
And, Carmen was one of
the people I approached,

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.170
and she agreed to
be a part of this.

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:10.820
And, then once it was clear
that she and I were an item,

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.070
I got invited almost every year

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.610
to the National Storytelling
Festival, and that was

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:22.140
where I was really in the
company of workers of the word.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.770
And, if you're a
word nerd like I am,

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:28.210
just to hear people
use language,

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.420
it was one of the things
that made me fall in love

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.670
with the south, just the
way people would talk.

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:36.460
I mean, I had, you know, and
people would say, you know,

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.760
"I just dread Christmas,

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.220
all this rushing and
swarping around."

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.970
Or Janette Carter
used to say, "Well,

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:46.300
that Johnny Cash just needs to
get all his shit in one sock."

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:48.330
And, I just thought, well,
that's a weird thing,

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:54.170
but I know what you
mean, you know.

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:59.290
Or, she was in a
state of high fuss.

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:00.910
And, my exposure

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:06.900
to the storytelling world via
my relationship with Carmen --

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:14.000
but, I mean, Carmen has
the best sense of story

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.660
of anyone I know,
in her writing.

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.510
She's the hardest-working
writer I know.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.860
I mean, she has primarily
worked in the world

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:27.440
of children's picture books,
which everybody looks at

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.010
and says, "This is 32 pages.

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.780
How hard can that be?"

01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:34.240
But, she completely
understands the form.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.290
She's working on a
book until they tear it

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:41.560
from her fingers to print it.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.400
I mean, she gets [inaudible]
fold it and gather the proofs

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:46.700
and says, "I want to --

01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.680
no, I got to change
that line right there."

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.750
She just wants to
make it perfect.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.460
She is the hardest-working
writer I've been around,

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.100
but a great sense
of story in both,

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.720
the way she tells her
stories and that sense

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.950
of story has really
influenced my songwriting.

01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:07.410
I mean, my last album of
original songs, I look at it,

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:11.690
and I thought I couldn't have
written that ten years ago.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:16.140
I didn't know how to use --

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.120
I mean, I understand the
distillation of language

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.290
that songwriting and poetry is,

01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:27.310
but to present a convincing
story and not have that pebble

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:31.830
in the shoe moment was
something that, you know --

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:36.970
I did an album of songs and
stories that I recorded live

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:38.660
at the National Storytelling
Festival.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:43.840
And, one reviewer happened
to say, "It's obvious

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.600
that his marriage to Carmen
Aberdeen has turned him

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.970
into a first rate
storyteller," so.

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Even
better storyteller.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.950
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Well, and
I showed that to her, and she,

01:02:56.950 --> 01:03:00.010
of course, said, "No,
you were great before."

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.310
But, it's true.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.610
It's true.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:06.260
You can't -- if you are someone
who loves words and loves story

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.910
and loves the world that you
can create in a few minutes,

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:14.750
you can't help, but
be influenced by her.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.900
I would like to think
she is influenced by me,

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.450
but I certainly know that
I'm influenced by her.

01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:21.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: All right.

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.050
Well, I think we have
to leave it there,

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.750
but it was wonderful
to have you here.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:27.140
John McCutcheon,
thank you so much.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.230
&gt;&gt; John McCutcheon: Thank you.

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:32.910
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
