00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.370
Hey evolutionary cousins of bacteria, Trace
here for a DNews Short.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.920
If you’ve ever been infected with Salmonella,
you’ll know how horrible the symptoms are,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.470
including diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.640
But despite its debilitating and sometimes
deadly effects, researchers from Duke University

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.919
just developed a strain of the bacteria that
may be great at fighting cancer.

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.660
In particular, a brain cancer called glioblastoma,
which has been a thorn in the side of cancer

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.660
researchers for decades.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.599
It is incredibly aggressive, and causes fast-growing
tumors in the brain.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.260
The average survival time is just over a year,
and less than 10 percent of patients survive

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.719
for more than five years.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.989
And what’s worse is that brain cancer isn’t
like other cancers, say lung or breast, because

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.829
those can be targeted more easily with conventional
chemotherapy.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.720
But the brain doesn’t let those same methods
through due to something called the blood-brain

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720
barrier.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.079
This is a membrane surrounding the brain that
keeps out circulating blood and prevents the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.499
brain from being exposed to harmful chemicals.

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:01.980
Unfortunately, this also means it blocks most
chemotherapy drugs that would be effective

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.159
against glioblastoma.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:05.120
That’s where Salmonella comes in.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.890
But not just any, run of the mill, uncooked
chicken-based Salmonella.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.220
Researchers were able to genetically alter
the makeup of the bacteria so it was missing

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.920
a key amino acid called purine, which is commonly
found in tumors.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.000
It was also programmed to produce harmful
compounds that cause cancer cells to self-destruct

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.630
in low-oxygen environments — inside a brain
tumor, for example.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.460
When the bacteria is injected into the brain,
it bee-lines to get to the purine in the tumors

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.000
and then releases its compounds to kill the
cells.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.860
Then, when the tumors are gone and there is
no purine left, the salmonella dies as well.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.950
And just to make sure that the salmonella
itself doesn’t actually make you sick, the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.570
team deactivated its toxicity.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.570
Science is magic.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.460
This method was tried out in rats, and resulted
in extending the life of 20% of those treated

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.109
by roughly 100 days, which equates about 10
human years.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.450
Trials to genetically modify other kinds of
bacteria have been used for years.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.600
Insulin can be produced for medicinal use
by a genetically modified type of E coli,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.420
and another strain of E. coli can be altered
to act as an appetite suppressant, potentially

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.580
leading to an obesity cure.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.660
There are some problems we humans can’t
solve on their own; sometimes, we need a little

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.940
genetically modified organism to do the job
for us.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.950
Salmonella's normally associated with food
poisoning but do you even know what that is?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.120
Find out in this video here.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.020
Do you have any other crazy medical cures
you want us to look into?

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.100
