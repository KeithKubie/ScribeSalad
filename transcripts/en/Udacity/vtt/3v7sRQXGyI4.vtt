00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, before we get to Eratosthenes' solution, let's talk about some previous attempts made

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to calculate the circumference of the earth.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
One famous thinker, Plato, estimated the earth's circumference at 400,000 stadia.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What's a stadia?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, a stadia is a unit that the Greeks used, and it's a unit of length.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In physics, we'll often be using different units.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's not something we should be intimidated by.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Actually, we don't even know what the Greeks meant when they say 1 stadium or 2 stadia,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but our best guess is that one stadium is about equal to 185 m,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which is a more familiar unit and one that we'll be using frequently in this class.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's convert this number--400,000 stadia-- into a better unit, maybe kilometers.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, one way to do that is to start by writing out what we were given.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We know that we have a number, 400,000 stadia, and I'm being careful to writing the units,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because the units are pretty relevant here.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'm going to write this as over 1, because I can always do that without changing the number.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm then going to multiply this by a conversion factor.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The conversion factor that I chose is the one I know--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that 185 m is equal to 1 stadia.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The interesting thing about this is that stadia appears here,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and it appears here--numerator and denominator--so we can cancel.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We now have a number that's represented as meters-400,000  185 m.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But that's not exactly what I want either.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So, we'll need to use another conversion factor,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and since I know that there are 1000 m in 1 km, I can write this conversion factor.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Notice that I put meters in the denominator so that it will cancel

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
with the meters in the numerator over here.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So, we can see all of the units have canceled.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
All I'm left with are kilometers, and to carry out this calculation,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I do 400,000  185  1/1000.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
That gives me a result of 74,000 km.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now, the true circumference--and this is the number you get if you type into a search engine

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
the question what is the circumference of the earth--it's 40,000 km.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Plato was wrong, but how wrong was Plato? How far off was he?

00:02:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Error is something we often want to talk about in physics, but how do we do it?
