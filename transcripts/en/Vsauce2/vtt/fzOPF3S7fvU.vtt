00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.310
Vsauce!

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.310
Kevin here.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.540
Twenty seven years before Superman flew in
to save the day with alien powers - Nyctalope

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.600
had bionic abilities.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.460
First published in 1911 and considered one
of the first superheroes Nyctalope had an

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.320
artificial heart and night vision color-shifting
eyes.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.090
He was a “cyborg” fifty years before that
word even existed.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.599
In the September 1960 issue of Astronautics,
Manfred Clynes and Nathan Kline first used

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.880
the word cyborg to describe a cybernetic organism.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.770
Their motivation was to propose a conceptual
revolution: Instead of building artificial

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.930
environments to survive in extraterrestrial
locations, why not upgrade our bodies on Earth

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.730
to adapt to what we find through space exploration?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.900
After half a century of research, we may not
be ready to walk around Mars in our underwear,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.020
but there are cyborgs among us -- and millions
more on the way.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.090
Mind-controlled robotic arms are a reality.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.100
They work by remapping the nerve endings that
controlled the hand, wrist, elbow and shoulder

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.270
to existing muscle groups and then programming
a prosthetic limb to react to the input.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.259
We’re years away from ordering bionic limbs
off Amazon, but a bionic eye is commercially

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.340
available.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.960
The Argus II, named after a Greek mythological
giant with a hundred eyes, is a retinal prosthesis

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.100
system that restores some sight to the blind.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.649
It features a video camera attached to glasses
that send images as electrical signals which

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.549
are processed and delivered wirelessly to
electrodes implanted on the retina.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.289
Patients go from complete darkness without
it to seeing flashes of light, which allows

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.520
them to navigate their home, cross streets,
or, in the case of Larry Hester, see his wife

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.929
for the first time in 33 years.

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.179
More common mechanical systems that help restore
lost biological functions include pacemakers

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.000
which help control abnormal heart rhythms,
and cochlear implants, which are essentially

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.440
bionic ears that deliver signals directly
to nerve fibers so the brain can process them

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
as sound.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.150
But the world’s first government-recognized
cyborg is Neil Harbisson, who has an antenna

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.030
on his head that allows him to hear colors.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.220
He was born only able to see in grayscale,
so he had an antenna integrated within the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.640
occipital bone of his skull that picks up
colors with a sensor and translates them to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.050
sounds that he hears through bone conduction.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.280
Harbisson successfully petitioned the British
government to recognize the “eyeborg”

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.620
as part of his body and was allowed to include
it in his passport photo.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.330
These are all technologies we have today.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.739
Currently in development is an injectable
neural lace that could lead to connecting

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.120
our brains wirelessly to the internet, and
the observation of neurons in the Medial Temporal

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.570
Lobe that drive the formation of memories,
which means that someday we could literally

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.120
download knowledge.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.800
While we can now 3D bioprint human skin, synthetic
skin to shield us from cosmic radiation is

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.740
a ways off -- let alone artificial lungs to
breathe Martian air that’s 96% carbon dioxide.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.880
But with continued progress on small blood-pumping
motors designed to replace human hearts and

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.980
biohackers having developed eyedrops that
temporarily give humans night vision…

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.950
Nyctalope could be roaming the streets any
day now.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.190
And as always - thanks for watching.
