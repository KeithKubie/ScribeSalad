00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.139
So, you're a big fan of superhero movies,
are you?

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.360
Do you regularly astound your friends with
your unrivalled superhero movie knowledge?

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.930
You might be able to recite the Christopher
Reeve Superman movies word-for-word, perhaps

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.189
you know which year every movie in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe franchise was released,

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.040
and you might even know why Fox thought that
awful 2009 version of Deadpool was a good

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.000
idea, but what about all that lesser known
superhero movie trivia from behind the scenes?There

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.450
are a lot of facts about movies that might
just take you by surprise - and that's what

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.880
this video is all about.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.270
Here's a special superhero edition of twenty
rapid fire behind the scenes movie facts...

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.570
The Mask
In The Mask, when Jim Carrey is being chased

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.930
by a group of gangsters and pulls a wet condom
out of his pocket, the line "Sorry wrong pocket"

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.810
was entirely improvised by Carrey.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.650
Watchmen
The first trailer for Watchmen premiered with

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.329
The Dark Knight in 2008, and it sparked so
much interest that it sent the graphic novel

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.100
back onto the bestseller list.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.390
Booksellers Barnes and Noble Bookstores reported
selling out of the novel.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.739
Howard the Duck
The role of Beverly Switzler in Howard the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.470
Duck ultimately went to Lea Thompson, but
it was auditioned for by the likes of 80's

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.600
icon Phoebe Cates and popular vocalist Tori
Amos.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.130
Ghost Rider
Ghost Rider star Nicolas Cage is famously

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.330
a fan of the character and actually had to
have a Ghost Rider tattoo covered up with

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090
make-up in order to portay him on the big
screen.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.790
The Dark Knight
The Dark Knight was the first comic book movie

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.890
to gross more than $1 billion wordwide, and
it actually made more money than its predecessor

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.600
Batman Begins' entire domestic run after only
6 days of release.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.180
Hulk
In a scene that was deleted from the final

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.850
cut of 2003's Hulk, there was a cameo by Willie
Brown - at the time the mayor of San Francisco

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.810
- playing himself and talking to Sam Elliott's
General Ross on the phone.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.240
Superman Returns
Amy Leland, the female actress whose voice

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.229
is used for the airplane computer in Superman
Returns, is also the same voice actress used

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.670
for Professor X's Cerebro in the X-Men films,
which are also directed by Bryan singer.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.400
Guardians of the Galaxy
Chris Pratt improvised a lot during his performance

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.220
as Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.110
Examples include the obscene gesture he gave
after being captured by the Nova Corps and

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.920
the line about his ship looking like a Jackson
Pollock painting under a blacklight.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.790
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
Scott Adkins auditioned for the role of Batman

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.509
in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.090
He had previously played the awful version
of Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.420
stunt scenes that Ryan Reynolds wasn't needed
for.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.739
Deadpool
In Deadpool, the titular character says that

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.770
he looks like he was "bitten by a radioactive
shar-pei" - a wrinkly breed of dog.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.830
This is a reference to a Deadpool comic in
which the character said that he looks like

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.970
a cross between Ryan Reynolds and a shar-pei.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.120
X-Men: Apocalypse
TÃ³mas Lemarquis plays Caliban - an albino

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.690
mutant - in X-Men: Apocalypse.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.700
It is the third movie in which Lemarquis has
played an albino - the others being Noi the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.170
Albino and Snowpiercer - in spite of the fact
that he is not albino himself.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.879
Green Lantern
In Green Lantern, San Diego doubled-up as

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.400
the fictional Coast City, and one of the shots
from the movie shows Parallax over the San

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.069
Diego Convention Center, which is famously
the home of Comic-Con.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.520
Spawn
John Leguizamo - who played the villainous

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.020
and clown-like Violator in the Spawn movie
- described wearing the required fatsuit as

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.550
"Like a penis wearing a condom".

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.660
Batman Returns
The late Burgess Meredith, who played the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.819
Penguin in the Adam West Batman television
series of the 1960s, was asked to play the

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.819
Penguin's father in the opening of Batman
Returns, but illness sadly prevented him from

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:06.819
doing so.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.150
Hellboy
Ron Perlman legitimately broke a rib while

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.709
filming the subway scenes in Hellboy.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.540
He crazily jumped onto a train that was coming
towards him at about 45 miles per hour.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.710
Tank Girl
Rapper Ice-T was paid an astonishing $800,000

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:23.940
to appear as the kangaroo-like T-Saint in
the awful 1995 comic book movie Tank Girl.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.770
Blade
Marvel legend Stan Lee famously cameos in

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.410
most Marvel movies, but he didn't appear in
Blade.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.730
He did film a scene, but it was cut from the
final movie.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.470
He played one of the cops that entered the
blood club and discovered Quinn's body on

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.610
fire after Blade had been there.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.610
Suicide Squad
It has been said that, in order for her to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.610
get in the mood to play the Enchantress in
Suicide Squad, Cara Delevingne listened to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.610
rock music ranging from Nick Cave to Megadeth.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.610
Spider-Man 3
For the filming of the crane accident scene

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.810
in Spider-Man 3, Bryce Dallas Howard performed
her own stunts, unaware that she was actually

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.580
pregnant at the time of filming.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.360
Steel
In the utterly garbage Steel movie, Shaquille

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.739
O'Neal had no choice but to do all of his
own stunts, as the movie's producers were

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:04.590
unable to find a 7' 1" stunt double for him.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.250
