1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,250
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,600
The most common pattern that I've
seen after interviewing hundreds,

3
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:16,601
300400500 world class performers at this
point is that at least 80% have some

4
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:21,950
type of mindfulness or meditation
practice and if you are like me,

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,270
perhaps you've heard of this many times
and perhaps you even tried many times

6
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:29,330
and decided you do not
meditate, you cannot meditate,

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,450
you are not designed to meditate,
which is what I concluded for a very,

8
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:37,451
very long time until I tested a number
of simple options that may work for you

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,940
and I would anticipate that really one
or two will stick and have some type of

10
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:47,750
toehold and you'll be able to then develop
the habit over a week or two of doing

11
00:00:47,751 --> 00:00:50,600
this and I would recommend trying
it first thing in the morning.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,790
Here are a few different options.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,890
Number one is using an app of some type
and there are several that are well

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,700
designed.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,700
Headspace would be one the 10 in 10
that's 10 minutes per day for 10 days

16
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,760
straight is very effective. Calm is
another insight timer is yet another.

17
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:12,230
There are many on top of that. If you
want to go straight to guided meditations,

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,800
you could consider looking
for Sam Harris. Uh,

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,860
you could consider looking
for Tara Brock, Vrac, ACH.

20
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,620
There are many different options and
they range in length so you can choose

21
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:22,880
something that works for you.

22
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,460
Next option is something like
transcendental meditation
where you actually take

23
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:32,720
a course and you have that
social accountability and
you pay for it and then you

24
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,520
will work with someone
for four days straight.

25
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,600
You will meditate in between
those sessions and you
will need to report back to

26
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:42,280
them and it is 20 minutes
per day, twice per day.

27
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,700
Encourage most people, at least I do it
once per day, normally in the morning.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,740
That is mantra based meditation.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:54,220
Another option is picking one song
that is very uplifting to you.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,740
Like we're going to party
like it's 1999 by prince,

31
00:01:57,741 --> 00:02:00,050
which is the one I actually
use in the early days.

32
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,210
And you simply listen to that song first
thing in the morning and focus on your

33
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:08,570
breath and you want to sit
in a comfortable position.

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,180
So I would sit cross legged
with my back against the wall.

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,060
You could certainly sit in a chair, you
could sit with your feet on the ground,

36
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,880
hands on your thighs, it doesn't
matter. You want it to be comfortable.

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,330
Listen to that song, focus on your
breath and when you focus on your breath,

38
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:23,810
this is very common advice.
What does that mean? All right,

39
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,850
we should get specific.
So a few recommendations.

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,750
You could focus certainly on
feeling it in your lower abdomen.

41
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:31,100
You can focus on feeling in your chest.

42
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,630
What a lot of people find helpful is
actually focusing on feeling the breath,

43
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:38,840
the inhale and XL right on
the edges of their nostrils.

44
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,530
And you might even notice that on the
inhale it's cooler and on the exhale it's

45
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:47,750
warmer, right? Those are two tips
that I find very, very helpful.

46
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,370
And the last recommendation I
would make is actually twofold.

47
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,090
So there two super short
options throughout the day.

48
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,830
If you find yourself feeling stressed
out or anxious or if about to say

49
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,920
something you might regret,
take a three breath break.

50
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,690
This is actually something
I started doing a,

51
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,650
I had heard 10 breaths that seemed
excessive to me, which I know is funny,

52
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,760
but I would pause to just focus
on taking three deep breaths.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,780
That is a form of meditation
and mindfulness present
state awareness training.

54
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
The other is something called loving
kindness meditation or Meta TTA meditation

55
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,890
and this is very simple.

56
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,770
Instead of focusing on yourself that
you're going to focus on other people.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,400
This was a breakthrough
for me and actually made a
big difference in my entire

58
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:34,960
experience in practice meditation and
really all you're going to do is sit down,

59
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,790
eyes closed comfortably and focus
on envisioning someone you care for.

60
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,280
That's where you start
a friend, family member,

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:46,030
whoever it might be and
wishing them joy and happiness.

62
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,010
You can do that any way
you want. All right?

63
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:53,011
You're wishing them joy and happiness
and a life free of pain and suffering and

64
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,710
you do that for one or two minutes for
one person and then you do it for one or

65
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:57,550
two minutes for the next.

66
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,940
And I've seen multiple friends try
this and they do it for five minutes,

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,890
either first thing in the morning
or right before going to bed,

68
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,630
and at the end of the week they tell me
that is the best week I've had in years.

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,790
All right, so that's another
option that you can test out.

70
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,780
So those are whatever it is, six, seven,
eight different options. Try them all.

71
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,020
You could try one a day for
a week. Find one that sticks.

72
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,210
And the imperfect program,

73
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,570
the good program that you follow is
better than the perfect program you don't

74
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,150
follow. So pick something
simple, get started,

75
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,560
and you can always add to it later.
