00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.740
- [Instructor] In other
videos, we have touched on

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.940
the idea of property
rights, but in this video,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.270
we're going to go a little bit deeper,

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.520
and think about how
property rights connect

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.530
to the notion of a market.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.350
So, first of all, think about
what a market means to you.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.070
You have probably heard of
things like the stock market

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.700
or you have probably gone to a supermarket

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.240
to do your groceries.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.791
What's common about these things?

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:31.060
Well, if we wanna say
as broad of a definition

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.020
of a market, you could
view it as a market forms,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.610
let me write this down.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.272
Well, this is an informal definition.

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:43.210
Forms, when multiple parties,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.893
multiple parties,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.063
exchange things of value.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.500
Exchange

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.340
things

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.213
of

00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:54.046
value.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.970
And let's see whether our
notions of a market hold up

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.850
or whether this definition
holds up when we think

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.830
about our notions of a market.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.310
Well in a stock market, you
have a bunch of people together,

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.610
and they are trading stocks,
and usually what happens is,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.140
let's see if this is a
stock right over here,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.550
these are all different
shares of the same stock

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.640
or different stocks,
what typically happens

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.390
is if there might be parties
who want to sell this stock

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.850
and then there's other parties
who want to buy this stock

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.132
and then whoever of the
buyers is willing to offer

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:31.060
the most for that share,
well then that money

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.430
will go to the seller of the
stock and then that stock

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.720
will go to the party that
just paid that amount.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.800
And so you see that there's an
exchange of things of value.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.210
At a supermarket, you will see
aisles and aisles of goods.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.880
This is my drawing of a aisle of goods,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.730
and there's all sorts
of merchandise on 'em

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.610
and you put 'em in your shopping cart

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.590
and then when you're done,
you go to the checkout,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.320
this is my little shopping cart here.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.220
You go to the checkout
and you pay for them.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.381
So once again, you are
picking which items you want.

00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:05.640
There's a price on them, so
the seller which in this case

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.410
is the supermarket, tells you
what they're willing to take

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.170
for those items and then when
you put them in your cart

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.720
and then take it to the
checkout, that's you agreeing

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.930
to pay those prices and so
you exchange, once again,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.520
money for those things of value.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.930
So the money has value
and those groceries,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.484
whatever you're buying, might have value.

00:02:25.484 --> 00:02:29.513
Now, we tend to believe that
markets are the best way

00:02:29.513 --> 00:02:33.080
of allocating resources
and different markets

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.410
work different ways.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.040
As you could just see,
the stock market could be

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.950
very different than a supermarket

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.490
and then you could have an auction

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.560
where things are auctioned off.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.930
That would also be a form of a market

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.390
but the actual mechanics
of how things happen

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.060
would be a little bit different.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.550
But a key factor that you
need in order for markets

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.640
to function properly is
that you need to have

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.490
a notion of property rights,
and as we've talked about

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.587
in previous videos,
property rights are the idea

00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:03.793
that things can be owned.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.870
Now what does it mean to own something?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.310
We almost just take this for granted

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.840
but it's not some law of the universe,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.120
it's something that we
just assume culturally

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.500
and it's become so embedded
in us that we just say

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.580
of course you can own something
but at the end of the day,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.860
there's three real properties
to owning something.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.900
One is the idea

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.730
of a party being able to
exclusively own something.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.610
So let's say that you own a piece of land

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.710
that you want to farm on.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.290
Well that means that
you can exclude others

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.930
from using that land and
whatever that land produces.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.250
It might just be a fun
place for you to run around

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.620
or sunbathe or it might be a
place where you grow some food

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.810
that you have the rights to
the benefits of that thing.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.436
Now another key dimension
of property rights

00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:57.230
is that those rights
have to be enforceable.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.010
Enforceable.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.460
What does that mean?

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.360
Well, if someone obnoxious wants to come

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.790
and sunbathe on your property
that you have enjoyed

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.690
running around and
sunbathing on, you say hey,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.390
you're infringing on my property rights

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.990
and you should be able to call the police

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.480
or some type of enforcers
to take that person

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.870
off your land if you really
do have property rights

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.170
and if they are truly exclusive.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.062
Or let's say you have
property rights on your shoes

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.607
and if someone were to steal your shoes,

00:04:24.607 --> 00:04:27.070
you should be able to
call the police and say

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.080
a crime has been committed and the police

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.930
should enforce those property rights.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.358
They should go and get those shoes back

00:04:33.358 --> 00:04:35.980
and punish that shoe stealer in some way

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.710
and then last but not
least, in order for markets

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.670
to work well, those property rights

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.123
have to be transferrable.

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:46.550
Remember, a market is
all about transferring

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:47.810
property rights.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.110
In the stock market, one party is giving,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.080
is transferring their
property rights to that money

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.541
to the seller of the stock
in exchange for getting

00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:00.020
the seller of the stocks property rights

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.970
to the actual stocks.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.000
If this was not transferrable,
then it would actually make

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.730
no sense to have a market as we know it.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.370
So I'll leave you there.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.130
These are things in our daily life

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.930
that most of us take for granted

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.340
because we live in a market economy

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.690
and we are used to things like ownership

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.915
but there are definitely
ways of organizing society

00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:25.071
where it's not as based
on markets in terms

00:05:25.071 --> 00:05:29.578
of who gets what and even
today, markets in many sectors

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:32.857
or in many parts of the
world don't operate as well

00:05:32.857 --> 00:05:36.330
as they could because
some of these dimensions

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.170
of property rights aren't
working as properly

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.140
as they should.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.680
It might be hard to
transfer property rights

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.890
in certain markets.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.240
In certain markets, if someone, let's say,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.870
just takes over a property,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.450
the government might not be so good

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.260
at enforcing those property rights.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.170
Or it might be hard to keep one party

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.126
from using something of value that is,

00:05:56.126 --> 00:05:58.879
at least according to the property rights,

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.993
owned by someone else.
