00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.780
Problem 52.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.980
Colleen solved the equation 2
times 2x plus 5 is equal to 8

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.300
using the following steps.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.870
OK, so she has a
bunch of steps.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.150
To get from Step 2 to Step 3,
Colleen-- so it's good that I

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.850
read the question before I just
started diving into it.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.476
So to get from Step 2 to Step
3-- so this is her Step 2, and

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:21.430
this is her Step 3 right here.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.420
What did she do to get
from here to here?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.960
Well, she divided
both sides by 4.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.370
Right?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.970
You could say 4x is
equal to minus 2.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.020
If you divide both sides of
this equation by 4, the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.420
left-hand side-- these cancel
out, you're just left with x.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.900
And then the right-hand side,
minus 2/4 is just minus 1/2.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.220
So she just divided
both sides by 4.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.010
And that is choice A.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.290
She definitely didn't subtract
4 from both sides.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.390
She didn't add 4
to both sides.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.300
And she didn't multiply
both sides by 4.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.300
Then we would have
had 16x minus 8.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.000
So that was a pretty
straightforward problem.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.220
And then 53.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.240
What is the reciprocal
of ax squared over y?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.080
This is another, you just have
to know what a reciprocal is.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.380
A reciprocal of something is
just 1 over that something.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.530
Or if it's a fraction,
you just flip it.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.590
So if you have a/b, the
reciprocal is b/a.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.520
If you have xy/ab,
the reciprocal

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.420
is going to be ab/xy.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.200
So if you have ax squared over
y, its reciprocal is just

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.390
going to be y over ax squared.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.510
That easy.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.120
And that is choice D,
y over ax squared.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.870
You just have to know to flip
this fraction right there.
