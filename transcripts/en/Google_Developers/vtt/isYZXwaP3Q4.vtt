JON WILEY: Hi everybody.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.250
Welcome.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.960
So during the keynote
you heard a little bit

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.350
about material
design, and we hope

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.967
to give you a little bit
more detail about that today

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:22.675
and in the sessions
that follow tomorrow.

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:26.560
But first I want to
tell you a little bit

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.100
about our inspiration
around material design.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.300
Every object in this
room owes its origin

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.400
to a few people throughout
the millennia who

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.040
paid careful attention
to their environment.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.884
They sought out the
very best materials,

00:00:41.884 --> 00:00:43.300
and they learned
their properties.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.640
And they used this
knowledge to make things.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.520
And when you consider
making things, the design

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.600
and the manufacture
of things, we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.670
inherit thousands of
years of expertise.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.360
In contrast, relatively,
software design

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.713
is just getting started.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:05.379
Much of interface
design concerns itself

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.730
with what people see.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.290
But with modern high
resolution displays

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.750
coupled with the ability
to physically interact

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.794
with the software your
expectations are much greater.

00:01:15.794 --> 00:01:17.960
In fact, there's thousands
of years of expectations.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.865
And so we took a step back.

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.240
We looked at all
of this software

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.040
and we asked what
is this made of?

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.710
We challenged ourselves
to define the underlying

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.510
physics of our interfaces, and
craft a visual language which

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.817
unifies the classic
concepts of good design

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:41.400
with a solid
understanding of the most

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.490
fundamental physical properties.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.060
At first we thought
like designers.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.650
How should it appear?

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.140
How should it look?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
But then we thought
like scientists.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.590
Why does it behave this way?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.630
And after many experiments
and many observations

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.390
we wrote down everything
that we'd learned.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.640
These are our
material principles.

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:19.520
MATIAS DUARTE: Hello.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.270
In Android 4.0,
Ice Cream Sandwich,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.460
we introduced a typographic
magazines style UI,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.170
and a lot of people liked it.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.310
We were pretty happy with it.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.070
But design is
continually evolving.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.400
Users are getting
more sophisticated.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.210
The design landscape
is more sophisticated.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.536
In particular, motion has
become incredibly important

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:46.535
over the last few years.

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:55.170
We wanted something
that was taking

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.360
the very best of
graphic design clarity,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.170
and the innovations
in motion graphics,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.880
and motion communication,
but that still

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.980
taped into those elements of
tangibility, of physicality

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.230
that industrial
designers themselves use.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.450
So this led us to a question
of how do we do this?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.230
And the very first
principle in material design

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.080
is metaphor, which
seems a little random.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.590
Why metaphor?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.720
Metaphor is basically a
very, very short story.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.450
And like stories, metaphors are
really powerful because they

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.700
are deep and dense in meaning.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.685
They communicate more richly
than verbal language can.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.500
If I'm writing a play
or if I'm telling you

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.705
about a character or
a person in real life,

00:03:56.705 --> 00:04:01.100
if I say she was a
hurricane, I don't

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.580
have to tell you about
her force of will

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.330
or her indomitable spirit.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.120
I don't have to tell an
actor that averting her gaze

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.060
would be inappropriate.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.570
The metaphor is a form
of knowledge transfer

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.790
that depends on
shared experience.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.650
And in fact, this capacity
to transfer knowledge

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.940
and to transfer learning
is one of the things

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.550
that defines humanity, and,
in fact, defines intelligence.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.560
So for us the idea of metaphor
is a backstory for the design.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.910
It unifies and
grounds the design,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.840
and it has two functions.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.760
It works for our audience.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.770
We want to present a metaphor
that they can understand,

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.120
that they can connect with,
that they can use to move faster

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.780
into understanding
how to use things.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.740
But it's also a
metaphor for ourselves,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.030
for the designers, and the
developers, and the PMs,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.950
and the QA people,
everybody working together,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.970
because when you have a metaphor
that everybody understands,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.920
intuitively
understands, you don't

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.550
have to explain how they
violated subsection C, clause

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.110
2 of your style guideline.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.950
They just know it feels wrong.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.340
They know it's out of place.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.290
So why this particular metaphor?

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.450
Why did we imagine
a material that

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.790
was a form of paper
sufficiently advanced

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.560
as to be indistinguishable
from magic?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.060
Well, one part of
it is of course

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.030
that we do have a
lot of experience

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.750
as humanity
communicating with paper.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:54.170
Paper is just rich in a
history across all our cultures

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:01.000
of conveying information,
and it naturally

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.160
affords so many different
ways of interacting with it.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.190
But the other aspect of paper
is that it is a physical thing.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.985
It exists in the world.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.620
And this idea that
surfaces because they

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.920
are tangible are a metaphor
that we can use to accelerate

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.590
understanding of our
UI is really important.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.660
You have this perception
of objects and surfaces

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.350
that's happening in the more
primitive parts of your brain.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.390
It's happening in these
visual cortexes that

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.200
are in the back and lower
parts of your brain.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.840
And that means they're
simply easier than language.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.390
They are more natural
than language.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.300
You have this
inherent understanding

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.180
about the separation of things
and the relationships of things

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.740
that allow us to look at
this and have it make sense,

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.870
even though we know there is
no material in the world that

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.030
could possibly do this.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.950
It is irrational and yet
feels completely natural.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.500
And that's what
we want when we're

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.140
creating digital,
magical interfaces.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.640
Right?

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.120
Because we are not
constrained by the laws

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.000
of the real world in
our user interfaces.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.600
Surfaces are intuitive.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.220
And that's why we use
them as the foundation.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.870
They organize space and
rationalize the interaction.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.560
And it matters that you
preserve this inherent sense

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.260
of what's right.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:57.100
Not for the sake of artifice,
but in order to make the mind

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.650
work less.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.410
One of the things you'll
discover in our material design

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:08.720
documents is that our buttons
rise to the surface in response

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.080
to touch instead of
syncing into a surface,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.320
like a fake, plastic
button would.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.150
And we do this because we want
this illusion to be consistent.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.980
The idea that when
your finger touches

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.130
that glass on your
phone that surface

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.235
is coming up and
meeting your finger

00:08:29.235 --> 00:08:30.485
at the point where it touches.

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:42.230
JONATHAN LEE: Content is bold,
graphic, and intentional.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.200
We pushed ourselves when we were
thinking about material design

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.580
to make clear and deliberate
design decisions regarding

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.990
color and topography.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.090
So embracing these
classic visual design

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.050
principles Jon and
Matias have both

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.230
spoken about in
our new framework.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.020
With Ice Cream Sandwich
Android introduced

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.060
a new system font, Roboto.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.460
And today we're updating
Roboto to go beyond phones

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.912
and tablets, and be the default
typeface for the material UI.

00:09:11.912 --> 00:09:13.870
Here you can see the
current version of Roboto.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.820
And Roboto is now slightly
rounder, friendlier,

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.379
and most importantly, redrawn to
perform on desktop and beyond.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:25.170
And I can tell you from
personal experience

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.050
that it handles really well.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:32.850
We also developed and
documented our design guidelines

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.400
for typographic scale.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.650
By using one typeface and a
handful of weights for emphasis

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.820
we believe that it delivers
consistent and clear

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.080
hierarchies in your products.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.460
Using scale and
appropriate display sizes

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.290
you can create dynamic,
print like layouts

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.000
with using white
space and contrasts.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.110
This focuses your users on the
content that really matters.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:01.350
Using vertical key lines
and baseline grids content

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.680
is bold, elegant, and
graphically clear.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.580
We also developed a
complete color palette

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.430
with intentional color decisions
for shades, tints, and accent

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.200
pops.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.810
These are not just adding
white and black to a color,

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.681
or using alpha.

00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.430
We actually looked at
each of these shades

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.010
and decided what they should be.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.200
So strong and intelligent
application of color

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.800
gives life to your UIs.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.030
And it connects users
with your brand.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.270
It also can create
very strong hierarchy

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.800
and liven up some
pretty standard UIs.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.580
As you can see in
this example, it's

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.220
essentially some kind of
form that you're filling out.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.050
And there's a clear
area for your title,

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.270
and that's what we want
people to focus on.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.470
Dynamic color is
also really exciting.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.270
Earlier today Matias announced
a new API in the L preview

00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:53.629
called Pallete.

00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:55.670
This system really makes
it easy to color things,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.175
dynamically select, and
extract color for use.

00:11:00.754 --> 00:11:02.670
One of the things that
you could use color for

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.930
is contrast accent colors.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.930
Contrast colors make this
floating action button,

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.220
which is the play/pause
button really pop.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.920
Brand, color, and
icons are accelerators

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.650
that guide users
through your design.

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.277
When think about app icons we
looked at real life studies

00:11:21.277 --> 00:11:22.235
in lighting and shadow.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.740
We started by defining
a universal grid

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.260
for app icons, one that supports
primary geometric shapes.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.470
A product icon is the
first literal touch

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.770
point of your user's experience.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.270
We looked at extracting those
attributes from your icon,

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.130
and from your brand, and
intelligently applying those

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.600
to the surfaces within your UI.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.620
The top toolbar and the
floating action button,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.354
again, are accelerators
for those actions.

00:11:55.354 --> 00:11:56.770
Here's just another
example of how

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.990
to connect those services
to the product icon.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.100
And finally, we took the
same modern, bold, geometric

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.647
approach from app icons and
applied it to the UI icons

00:12:08.647 --> 00:12:09.480
you see in your app.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.180
Our design teams are
now using one common set

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.590
of icons between Android
L, Polymer, and the web.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.690
This means one trash
can across all devices.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.940
And we'll be releasing these
icons later this summer

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:26.180
through our design
guidelines, available for use

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.600
on both Android and the web.

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:32.660
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: All right.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.740
So even if we're doing all this,
and we've got great typography,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.700
as an industry we're leveling
up when we start using baseline

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.140
grids, we've got
amazing color, it's

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.590
not enough just to draw the
static states and stop there.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.300
We can do more to show people
how the states are changing,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.060
letting them focus on
the content that matters.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.990
So when you think about it,
almost all state changes

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.470
in the UI start with user input.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.310
And this is why material
UI puts that user input

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.610
at the center of
the animation story.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.550
So when I touch the
screen immediately

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.180
the surface responds.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:10.040
I can see exactly
where I touched,

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.730
and the intersection of the
object that's responding.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.160
This does two things.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.839
First, it tells people
that they've been heard.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:18.630
They feel powerful.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.046
They feel like
they're in control.

00:13:20.046 --> 00:13:21.520
Apps feel responsive.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.612
Second, it confirms
to them that the UI

00:13:24.612 --> 00:13:26.445
is going to do the thing
that they expected,

00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:28.700
that it's working.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.240
This animated touch
feedback is now

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.940
built into the platforms for
both Android and Polymer,

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.300
and it's being used by all
of the relevant components.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.790
So it's not just the
immediate feedback

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.790
though that's centered
on user input.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.620
The material itself transforms
to bring in new content.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.360
And all this happens
on a shared stage.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.890
When I say I shared stage, I'm
talking about the environment

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:58.720
where this material lives.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.520
It's important to know as
we're looking at the material

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.340
that it lives in the same scale
and in the same space as we do.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.060
We're not flying through
some imagined space,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.240
or looking through a
window into another world.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.540
This material lives at the same
scale as the device itself,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.210
whether it's in
our hand, or we're

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.790
looking at it on our desk.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.810
We don't move.

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:24.260
The material does to
bring the content to us.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.240
You can see how this works as
transitions organize themselves

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.530
around the object
as it's selected.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.920
The material moves, expands
to reveal the new content.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.530
And notice that even as the
content transforms in a way

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.100
that maybe a physical
material like paper

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.870
wouldn't, it's still
very clear what's

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.117
happening because of the way
the material responds to light,

00:14:45.117 --> 00:14:47.575
and the way the shadows are
being rendered by the platform.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.510
So animation is crucial to
reinforcing this metaphor

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.210
that Matias talked about.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.260
It's just in the same
way that shadow rendering

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.060
helps us understand
what we're looking at.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.410
The way that things move
give cues about how they work

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.280
and about their properties.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:14.150
So, for example, the
material animations naturally

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.000
show continuity from
one state to another.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.470
When I select an item it
expands to the next state.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.690
It doesn't jump cut.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.770
It doesn't blink in and out.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.330
It moves naturally like
sliding a piece of paper

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.760
across the table.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:32.860
If we teleport our users from
one state to another in a UI

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.765
it can be confusing
and disorienting

00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:36.390
when they get to the
other side, almost

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.042
like if we were to be
teleported in the real world.

00:15:40.042 --> 00:15:42.500
If I were to just appear on
the stage in front of everybody

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:48.430
here, it'd take me a few
moments to get my bearings.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.180
It's the constraints that are
inherent in the material that

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.990
make it clear for
people what can happen

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:01.420
and lets them predict and
understand what has happened.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.700
So if it makes it easier
to understand what's

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.680
changing, at the same time it
can show us what's important.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.650
So since our eyes are
naturally drawn to motion,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.190
if something moves, and
it's in our field of view,

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.990
we're going to see it.

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:19.720
It's a really strong tool
for us to help direct focus.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.500
If in a music screen
the player controls

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.210
are the primary interaction, the
animation can point that out.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:31.200
Also, even noticing the
details, those small things

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.200
that you might not even notice
overtly, like, for example,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:41.200
the small slide on the
control slider as it comes in.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200
Wait for it.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.170
There it is.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.920
Even though people might not
notice it overly, they see it,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.860
and they know how things
work without having

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.990
to think a lot about it.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.120
NICHOLAS JITKOF: So these
guys talked about many

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.270
of our core
principles, primarily

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.860
this sense of tangible
surfaces, which

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.485
appeal to the primal
parts of our minds

00:17:03.485 --> 00:17:05.460
with dimension and shading.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.680
Bold and intentional
design, which provides

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.710
a unified language that
allows brand and UI

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.510
elements to stand out.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.990
And meaningful
motion, which fuses

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.130
this design and the
surfaces together, and gives

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.665
new affordances and life to UI.

00:17:17.665 --> 00:17:19.869
What we want to use
these for is to create

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.232
a new unified
experience for users.

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:24.690
We're surrounded by devices,
and people experience our work

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.380
across all of these
different platforms.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.520
And for that reason we
want to treat every device

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.520
as a window on the same content.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.210
We want to tailor the form
factor so that each one of them

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.770
has commonalities, but
also can be unique.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:37.770
Color, type, and
spatial relationships

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.200
help tie them together.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.540
In this example
email app the sizes

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.320
are all related by
color and structure,

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.403
but there's diversity in
the overall presentation.

00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:46.590
The larger ones use cards.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.350
The line length is
kept reasonable.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.850
And the small ones
end up being full

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.820
bleed so they can take advantage
of the size the device.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:55.462
In this file's app there's
a drawer on the side,

00:17:55.462 --> 00:17:57.420
but on desktop it becomes
a persistent element.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.190
On tablets it's a
temporary overlay

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.990
so it stays out of the
way, and on phones it's

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.094
a persistent UI
that you drill into.

00:18:05.094 --> 00:18:07.760
In this calendar example there's
more variety between the views,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.885
but, again, typography and
color tie them together.

00:18:09.885 --> 00:18:12.816
So they feel like they're
a consistent experience.

00:18:12.816 --> 00:18:15.560
Immersive imagery also
plays a pretty big role.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.240
This is something we've seen on
mobile where people are doing

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.170
things full bleed
that we actually

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.775
want to take back to desktop.

00:18:19.775 --> 00:18:21.760
It looks great there as well.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.480
And in particular, when things
used to be sort of full bleed,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.234
we now can use things like
cards to keep that same sense,

00:18:27.234 --> 00:18:28.650
even though they're
now surrounded

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.850
by other kinds of content.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.390
Beyond the platforms
we also care

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.655
about working with
different disciplines.

00:18:36.655 --> 00:18:38.780
Interaction, motion, visual
design, and engineering

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.694
are often not deeply associated.

00:18:40.694 --> 00:18:42.610
And so we've been using
this material metaphor

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.110
as a way to bind the different
disciplines together and make

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.340
them more collaborative.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.090
In interaction the materials
reinforce the overall sense

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:49.870
of hierarchy.

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.800
The scrolling and
layering give a good sense

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.430
of how gestures
work, and emphasize

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.900
how the user should
focus their attention.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.230
Visual design becomes
simpler because of this.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.619
The content itself can be
very graphic in its hierarchy,

00:19:02.619 --> 00:19:04.410
and rely on dimensionality
for higher level

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.530
structures like toolbars
or other elements

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.930
so they're not
considered together.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.670
And motion is in most
ways the most important.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.610
Materiality provides
the grounding for it.

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:16.380
It makes it consistent
and intuitive.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.430
So it's obeying
realistic physics,

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.324
and speaking better
to the user for that.

00:19:22.324 --> 00:19:23.740
More importantly,
it allows motion

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.254
to be deeply tied into
interaction and visual design.

00:19:27.254 --> 00:19:28.420
We've got sessions tomorrow.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.440
And we'll talk a
lot more and more

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.950
about the interaction between
these different elements,

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.949
starting in the morning
with interaction design,

00:19:33.949 --> 00:19:36.900
and then in the afternoon
visual and motion design.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.650
If you're interested
in learning more now,

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:41.250
you can take a look at
the initial spec preview

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:42.000
that we've put up.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.452
There's probably
more than you're

00:19:43.452 --> 00:19:44.910
interested in seeing
in the moment.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.250
But you should come by
and listen to the talks.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.747
And we'll point out the
most important parts.

00:19:49.747 --> 00:19:50.830
And stay in touch with us.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:52.764
We put up a new site
for google.com/design,

00:19:52.764 --> 00:19:53.930
as well as a Plus community.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.506
So be sure and follow us there.

00:19:56.506 --> 00:19:59.130
We created these principles as
a tool for all your future work.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.647
We want to inspire and evolve
your designs and your apps.

00:20:02.647 --> 00:20:04.230
So in addition to
these sessions we'll

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.885
have a number of
design sandbox events.

00:20:05.885 --> 00:20:08.100
You should come
by and talk to us.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.226
But thank you for joining us.

00:20:10.226 --> 00:20:14.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.070
JON WILEY: So we've
left time for questions.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.990
And there's actually microphones
in the center aisle here.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.490
There's two.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.531
There's one in the back,
and there's one up here.

00:20:26.531 --> 00:20:29.530
So if you all have any
questions about this

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:33.989
or design at Google, or--

00:20:33.989 --> 00:20:35.030
Nobody has any questions.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.035
Everyone just wants to
play with Cardboard.

00:20:38.035 --> 00:20:40.740
By the way, if you've tried the
Google Earth on the Cardboard

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.340
thing, it's just amazing.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.090
Here's a question.

00:20:46.384 --> 00:20:47.300
AUDIENCE: I apologize.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.660
I'm a developer, not a designer.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.080
So this is a silly question.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.890
I like design though.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.970
I see a lot of circles.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.450
What's up with the circles?

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:57.950
I like them.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:58.510
I like them.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.520
Just could you speak about
where they're appropriate,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.949
what you see them conveying
to the users, stuff like that?

00:21:04.949 --> 00:21:07.240
MATIAS DUARTE: Who's going
to take the circle question?

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.340
JON WILEY: Matias takes
the circle question.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.256
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh, OK.

00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:12.120
I'll take the circle question.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.370
I really would have thought
the circle question should

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.530
have belonged to
the art directors.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.270
Well, there's a couple different
ways that we're using circles.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:30.810
Actually it's probably good to
step back and talk about one

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.350
of the ways that
we've simplified,

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:38.990
and we've tried to keep very
low level, and elemental,

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.030
and primal what we're
doing in material design

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:47.560
is everything is really
its most simple and basic

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.540
geometric shape.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.730
So you'll see circles.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:50.780
You'll see squares.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:51.710
You'll see rectangles.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.520
You'll see basically
divisions of space.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.810
So when you want to have a
contained element the simplest

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:02.230
way to do that is to
bring in the circle.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.990
So we used a circle
because it's naturally has

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.730
contrast to a space
that you've divided up

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.210
and that has blocks
of text, or areas

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.870
that have been created by
cards, or divisions color.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.460
The circle is a great way to
draw your eye without motion

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.720
to those elements that
you want to emphasize,

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.740
whether that is the
floating action buttons that

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.490
are indicating primary
actions, or it's

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:29.440
the avatars of people
that are very important.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.894
Circles create
rhythms themselves

00:22:31.894 --> 00:22:33.935
that help you organize
and scan through the page,

00:22:33.935 --> 00:22:37.000
like when we have the
multiple messages in email.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.766
So what you should think
of the circle as is it

00:22:40.766 --> 00:22:44.940
is a geometric element
that is a visual design

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.020
tool like any of
the other tools.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:53.990
It perhaps, in a very simplified
shape pallet, stands out.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.150
And that is it's attribute,
that it does stand out.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.650
And you want to use it in places
where you want to stand out

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:00.831
or you want to create
rhythms by repeating it.

00:23:00.831 --> 00:23:02.580
Did you guys want to
add anything to that?

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.630
JON WILEY: Yeah, I was
thinking about sort

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.480
of where a lot of the
circles kind of came

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.784
from, and in the early days when
we were thinking about this.

00:23:11.784 --> 00:23:14.200
So at the beginning I talked
a little bit about, you know,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.640
its material principles
and the underlying physics.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.090
And one of the things that
happens with any interface

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.181
if you're interacting with it
is you're injecting energy.

00:23:22.181 --> 00:23:22.680
Right?

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.460
There's events that are
happening where you're either

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.820
interacting with it, you're
touching the interface,

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.384
and as you're using it
you're injecting energy

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:31.300
into the process so
things that are happening.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.883
And one of the most
fundamental things

00:23:32.883 --> 00:23:36.240
that happens within physics is
that whenever a signal happens,

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.660
whether it's sound, or
light, or what have you,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.230
it propagates in a circle.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.440
It propagates from
its point of origin,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.729
at ideally at the same
velocity outwards, right?

00:23:45.729 --> 00:23:48.020
And that's generally in a
sphere in a constrained depth

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.853
environment, that's
going to be in a circle.

00:23:49.853 --> 00:23:51.530
And so when you see
not only the circles

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.350
in terms of the affordance
for interacting,

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.890
but also as you tap on things
and that circle radiates,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:02.030
it's really about just conveying
the sense of the physicality

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:03.649
of the energy going
into this system,

00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:05.190
and that that's
actually your actions

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.260
are spreading forth
into communicating

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.920
with the rest of the things
that are on the screen.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.500
Next question.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.520
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.580
My question is regarding
the form factor.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.880
It seems like it's apps now
with the material you'll

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.670
be able to design one app, and
basically the app will adapt,

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.440
it'll be responsive
to the screen size

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.360
that the app is running on?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.355
Is this where this is going,
where with the material

00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:40.070
you'll be able to
create one code base

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.630
and be able to run the
app on any screen size?

00:24:44.537 --> 00:24:47.120
MATIAS DUARTE: Want to talk to
that one Nicholas, or should I?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.060
NICHOLAS JITKOF: Yeah.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.143
There's two sides of this.

00:24:49.143 --> 00:24:52.080
One is we want to make it as
easy as possible to not just

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.290
re-flow to different sizes, but
also to tailor the way that we

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.980
re-flow in a unique way.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.555
So while the default
platform behavior

00:24:59.555 --> 00:25:01.305
will do the right thing
as far as allowing

00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:03.259
you to expand things
to different sizes,

00:25:03.259 --> 00:25:04.800
we do want more
thought and attention

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.855
placed on how it should
actually accomplish that.

00:25:07.855 --> 00:25:11.660
Beyond that, a lot of
these design guidelines

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.660
are intended to make that much
more seamless of a transition.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.310
Like the commonality of
iconography and typography,

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.720
those, blend them
together, even as we

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.070
introduce more differences.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.470
But our prime focus
right now is trying

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.270
to get these things
to carry a design

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.816
across those different
form factors.

00:25:27.816 --> 00:25:29.190
MATIAS DUARTE:
Yeah, I mean, I'll

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:30.711
be a little more
explicit as well.

00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:32.710
I mean, for starters, we
do have two code bases,

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.080
one if you're developing
native apps for Android,

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.649
and one if you're developing
with Polymer for the web.

00:25:38.649 --> 00:25:40.690
There are framework
components in both apps which

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:44.040
will make it easier for you to
scale between different screen

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:51.360
sizes, but there is a lot
of intentionality and design

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.190
thought that needs to go into
making some of those decisions.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.860
So we don't have
one automatic system

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.620
that will take any application
and automatically scale it

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.770
for you to any screen size.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.400
Maybe someday.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.460
But I think that would actually
require intelligence that's

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.750
pretty close to that of a
developer and a designer

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:10.080
combined.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.410
What we do have here
is a design system

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:18.430
where you can create a coherent
app and use the same design,

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:21.230
and have very straightforward
ways to adapt it

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.219
if you understand also what
the purpose of the app is,

00:26:24.219 --> 00:26:26.510
and what is appropriate for
the different screen sizes.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:30.194
And that still requires a human.

00:26:30.194 --> 00:26:30.860
JON WILEY: Cool.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.360
Next.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.890
AUDIENCE: First
off, you guys rock.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:39.816
JON WILEY: Thank you.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.330
AUDIENCE: So I'm a big
fan of the animations,

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.290
and giving cues to the
user and everything,

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.080
but sometimes it can
be too much, right?

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.790
So at what point
do you say, if I

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.520
hit the play button it's going
to go around the screen three

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.405
times, come back
in, and pop up--

00:27:02.405 --> 00:27:05.270
JON WILEY: That happens on
every press every single time.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.010
AUDIENCE: So sometimes
users can see that as a bug,

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:13.200
or it might slow them down to
whatever actions they're doing.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.647
So were there any
concerns around that?

00:27:15.647 --> 00:27:17.480
And if so, how do you
tackle that challenge?

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.630
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: Yeah,
so I think one of the things

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.005
to know about-- This isn't
just true of motion design.

00:27:22.005 --> 00:27:25.080
It's true of design
generally, that there's

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.010
a lot that's going on
below what people notice.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.330
So we don't actually
want people all the time

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.050
thinking about the
animations when

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.000
they're going from
one state to another.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.450
We don't want them
to say, gee whiz,

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.590
I just opened up that email,
and again I saw that animation.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.530
We want them thinking
about the email.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:45.160
So if you apply that
standard is how much do

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.410
I want people thinking about
the animation themselves,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.440
what is it trying
to communicate, then

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.434
you can kind of back it
down to the right level.

00:27:52.434 --> 00:27:53.850
NICHOLAS JITKOF:
One of the things

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.370
that we considered consistently
throughout this process

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.480
was how to use the animation
to sort of go along

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.080
with user's intention.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.750
Because when you have touch
responses that sort of emanate

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:07.530
outwards it's very easy to hide
details in there that reinforce

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.460
what's happening without
feeling like you've

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.990
added a bunch of
animation in there.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.670
So we're going to go into
this a bit more tomorrow,

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.952
but having things
sort of move counter

00:28:16.952 --> 00:28:18.660
to the direction the
user's doing things,

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:19.670
draw attention to them.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:20.440
And if you're
going to do so, you

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.687
should do that intentionally.

00:28:21.687 --> 00:28:23.520
If you don't want
intention drawn to things,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.620
there's places to hide them.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.040
And it's really about
trying to figure out

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.581
how you want to
balance it, and where

00:28:27.581 --> 00:28:30.880
you want to draw
people's attention.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:34.650
So I was wondering if
you could extrapolate

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:40.700
on how you see new forms of
input with respect to motion.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:44.030
So in regards to
wearable devices,

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.230
let's say a swipe left and a
swipe right with a wrist watch,

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.560
or drawing a circle
in the air, how

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.060
would that integrate with user
experience on an app level

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.590
let's say, or on your desktop?

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:56.138
And how that would
sort of integrate?

00:28:59.962 --> 00:29:03.624
JON WILEY: We've been given a
design challenge on the fly.

00:29:03.624 --> 00:29:05.040
How to design
gestural interfaces.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:14.450
I think a lot of this goes back
to the material as a metaphor.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.835
And part of what we're
trying to do is-- You know,

00:29:16.835 --> 00:29:21.717
you go and you watch some
summer blockbuster sci-fi movie.

00:29:21.717 --> 00:29:23.800
And sometimes it can be a
little bit of a let down

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.190
because like they set up
the world in which they're

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.520
operating, but then they
break some principle, right?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.850
And it just kind of falls flat.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.320
And why did that happen?

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.100
And I think part of what we're
trying to do with a system

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.790
like this is to set up a series
of sort of a world in which it

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:44.400
functions, and ideally it's
grounded enough in the reality

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:49.120
that we have here such that you
can bring your intuition of how

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.090
objects function to
the system, and it

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.450
fulfills those expectations,
and hopefully exceeds them,

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.450
but then maybe we add in
additional magical things

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.650
we can't quite do yet
with physical devices

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.700
because we're rendering
with virtual devices.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:09.450
The bridging of gesture, and
other types of interfaces to me

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.566
is actually just
another level, it's

00:30:12.566 --> 00:30:13.940
another additional
dimensionality

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:15.800
in terms of interaction.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.870
And it's a progression.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:18.760
So when we started
with computers

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.590
we basically had keyboard.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.836
And then eventually
we got a mouse.

00:30:22.836 --> 00:30:24.210
And so that was
like a little bit

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.717
of interaction,
slightly removed.

00:30:25.717 --> 00:30:27.300
You know, here it's
happening up here,

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.010
and I'm using these
things to control it.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.570
Then we get all the
way now to today

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.154
where we have smartphones
with touch screen displays.

00:30:35.154 --> 00:30:37.070
And now we have this
additional dimensionality

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.740
of being able to physically
touch the software.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.660
And now we're adding this other
layer in, hopefully over time,

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.310
and hopefully do
it right, where we

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.410
have wearable devices
that have gyros and stuff.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.160
I mean, even the
cardboard device actually

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.180
is really fascinating because--
Again, it's really awesome.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.500
You play with it.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.210
But it's just like
doing, you know,

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.320
basic head tracking
and things like that.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.140
And so as we continue
to sort of add

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:05.250
in the dimensionality of
interaction with gestures

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.260
it just makes it
so much more rich.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.100
And so we just want to make sure
that we're always grounding it

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.470
into sort of these principles
that we set up initially.

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.830
So it's always self consistent.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.829
You don't get to a moment
where you're like, oh,

00:31:16.829 --> 00:31:18.930
I did this thing, and
that didn't make sense.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:22.060
It was discontinuous
with all the principles

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.170
that had been set up before it.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.980
One of things that I think is
really interesting about this,

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.230
and we'll talk about this
more in tomorrow's sessions,

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.500
is that there's actually
a fair amount of spectrum.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.430
Right?

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.180
There's a lot of
different types of things

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.638
that can be expressed, both in
terms of color, and content,

00:31:37.638 --> 00:31:41.650
and the animation that gives
you a pretty big pallet.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.400
It still feels like
it's part of a system,

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.390
but it gives you a
very large pallet

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:46.223
so you can express lots
of different things.

00:31:46.223 --> 00:31:48.850
So I think with the
addition of wearables

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:54.040
I look forward to seeing how
people express their apps

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.250
and their applications through
these additional different

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.314
interface forms in
terms of manipulation.

00:32:00.314 --> 00:32:01.980
NICHOLAS JITKOF: One
of the other things

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.438
that came up as we
were doing this,

00:32:03.438 --> 00:32:06.202
first as we are looking at just
desktop and mobile together,

00:32:06.202 --> 00:32:08.410
was unifying the overall
touch feedback through them.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.720
So having hover states
and tap states all

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.810
be resolved together.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.060
And then we started to see
more and more of these.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.550
And treating it as energy was
a very nice metaphor for us,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.534
because we were able
to look at on touch

00:32:19.534 --> 00:32:21.200
these things are going
to move outwards.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.280
Voice, as you're speaking, you
have a similar response to it.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.540
As you use the D Pad
on the TV the movement

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.780
of your focus through a
UI will be very similar.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.363
And one of the things
we didn't really

00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:33.760
touch on, but like tabbing
between controls using

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.567
a keyboard can have
a very similar feel.

00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:37.150
It is your focus
moving through space,

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.180
and then when you hit
Enter on something,

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.990
that energy blast is very
similar to any other mode

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.227
of input you might do.

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:44.540
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.559
Thanks.

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:47.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.720
Appreciate your time.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.250
So I work for a company where
we are both cross platform

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:57.520
and our mobile apps are not
our primary money maker.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.540
So when it comes to
requesting time be allocated

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.010
to working on this
it can be looked

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:07.900
as a little bit of indulgence.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:11.300
What would you suggest
as some maybe priorities

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.280
to focus on when
looking at implementing

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.864
some of these things?

00:33:15.864 --> 00:33:17.280
NICHOLAS JITKOF:
For the most part

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.940
the framework should be
supplying 90% of the animation

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.250
and the richness in the UI.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.000
What we're asking
people to do is actually

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.559
look at some of the new
APIs for shared element

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:27.850
transitions between activities.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.170
Like there are moments that
make good places for polish,

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.600
and brand in your app.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.760
So using the core elements,
using the core iconography,

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.970
using the theming to make it
feel like it's your product,

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.880
but then just
polishing one or two

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.987
really critical things
usually has the best outcome.

00:33:47.987 --> 00:33:50.070
JON WILEY: Yeah, and Polymer
framework is actually

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.995
going to be really great for all
kinds of different platforms,

00:33:52.995 --> 00:33:54.305
you know mobile platforms.

00:33:54.305 --> 00:33:55.340
NICHOLAS JITKOF: Yeah,
and part of the reason

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.631
that we've done this for
ourselves, it's helpful for us

00:33:57.631 --> 00:33:59.690
to be able to have,
if we do a mobile web

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.736
app and a native app, to create
a very similar structure there,

00:34:02.736 --> 00:34:05.110
so we don't have different
interaction designers thinking

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.610
about different
ways of handling it.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:09.469
They should be treated as
pretty much the same app

00:34:09.469 --> 00:34:10.739
with small adjustment.

00:34:10.739 --> 00:34:12.655
JON WILEY: This is
probably a good opportunity

00:34:12.655 --> 00:34:14.546
to also mention that
after this some of us

00:34:14.546 --> 00:34:16.670
are going to be in the
design sandbox on level two.

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.530
And as part of releasing
our spec, and design,

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.600
and having all this
announced, we really

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:24.339
want to talk to
designers and developers

00:34:24.339 --> 00:34:26.880
about kind of the problems they
have in terms of what they're

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.730
trying to solve for their users,
and so that we can understand

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.840
how material design
and the principles

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.000
here can help support
that, or maybe there's

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.485
some unique problems
out there that

00:34:37.485 --> 00:34:39.110
need a little bit of
a different twist.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.020
And we'd love to hear
feedback about that.

00:34:44.821 --> 00:34:45.654
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:34:45.654 --> 00:34:46.154
I'm Pierre.

00:34:46.154 --> 00:34:47.540
I'm a UX/UI designer.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.679
And my question is
regarding animations.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:51.870
For one, as you all
know, animations

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:55.030
are something that kind of
make an app pop and stand out.

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.851
And recently we had
a lot of trouble.

00:34:57.851 --> 00:34:59.350
I work in design
agencies and stuff.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:02.060
So where we make an app,
we create animations

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.890
either in After
Effects, Origami,

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.785
or we just animate
them manually.

00:35:07.785 --> 00:35:09.590
And I was wondering
if there's going

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.620
to be a tool from Google that
will help us kind of animate

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.150
our design, because that's the
hardest part of transferring it

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.590
to a developer,
explaining to them

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.010
how it's going to interact.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.660
And will there be an addition
to the design guidelines

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.640
explaining what kind of default
animations you should focus on?

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.340
Will there be like more of
a sandbox the designers can

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:29.540
use so they can kind
of carry their points

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.915
across to the developers?

00:35:30.915 --> 00:35:32.540
Because I usually
find that point where

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.290
you kind of transfer all of
your work to the developers,

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.440
that's the toughest bit.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.995
And if a tool were there,
like a native tool that

00:35:37.995 --> 00:35:40.970
would help us aid in that
process that would be great.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.690
But do you have
any tips for that?

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.330
And is there anything
planed on improving that?

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.970
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON: So
even before the tool,

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.470
one of the things
that we've noticed

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:54.350
as we've been doing that
same process in designing

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:57.240
things, and working with
engineering to make them happen

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.150
is it having that
shared metaphor,

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.980
and having engineering
kind of understand

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.150
those same principles
gets us a lot closer

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.820
from the very beginning that we
kind of know how things should

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.110
move, and how
things should react.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.006
And I think that's a
good place to start.

00:36:12.006 --> 00:36:13.880
I don't know if anybody
else want to comment.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.540
NICHOLAS JITKOF: It's also
helped us to-- We actually

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.720
define a number of
different animation curves.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.120
We're not using just sort of
simple ease in and ease out.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.306
But we got those sort
of built in, and worked

00:36:22.306 --> 00:36:23.330
with the engineers so
they understood those.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.788
And we tend to use
them everywhere,

00:36:24.788 --> 00:36:26.900
and we iterate on
them as needed.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.600
So tools aside, we
found it just helpful

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.150
to stay in constant
communication

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.850
with the engineers, and try to
get as much of this stuff baked

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.820
in as logic into the system
rather than like as things

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.674
we're handing over
that are one-offs.

00:36:39.674 --> 00:36:40.215
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:40.215 --> 00:36:42.170
And what's your
standard design process

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.344
for like explaining
it to the developers?

00:36:44.344 --> 00:36:46.260
It's just like a case
of them sitting near you

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.790
and you kind of cover the entire
animation process with them

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:49.350
together?

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:52.960
How do you get the
point across to them?

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.460
NICHOLAS JITKOF:
It's fairly ad hoc.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:56.040
Depends on the situation.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.440
Sitting together is
always the best way

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.525
to accomplish anything.

00:36:59.525 --> 00:36:59.890
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.139
I was just wondering if you
had a standardized process

00:37:02.139 --> 00:37:02.780
for that.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.010
All right.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:03.510
Cool.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.730
Thanks.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.250
MATIAS DUARTE: I do want to
mention before you walk away

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:13.030
that that kind of a request or
interest in tools or anything

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.280
like that-- We don't have
any tools to announce today,

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.562
but that's the kind of
feedback and pain point

00:37:18.562 --> 00:37:20.020
that you guys are
feeling that we'd

00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.860
love to hear about more so we
know how to focus our energy.

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:25.790
And if you guys have more
of those kinds of questions

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:30.221
or requests come by
the design sandbox.

00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:31.470
JON WILEY: One follow up.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:32.150
AUDIENCE: Where's
the design box?

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.465
Sorry.

00:37:32.465 --> 00:37:33.870
JON WILEY: It's
the second floor.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.753
It's over by the
Distribute section.

00:37:37.753 --> 00:37:40.336
MATIAS DUARTE: It's kind of like
you look for the YouTube sign

00:37:40.336 --> 00:37:41.544
and follow the YouTube sign.

00:37:41.544 --> 00:37:42.210
JON WILEY: Yeah.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:42.710
Exactly.

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.929
It's by the YouTube booth.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:45.970
It's a very clear design.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.940
Yeah.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.260
AUDIENCE: So my question
is really about color.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.580
And I see a lot of bright
colors these days everywhere.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.340
And even in the pictures
there some of you

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.670
have a purple
background and a red.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.160
So very bright
colors, and they're

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.490
all different combinations.

00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:06.620
So how do you pick these
bright color combinations

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:12.300
in context of material
design so that it's actually

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:17.950
appealing to the user, and
so it has meaning and is not

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:23.862
bright enough to be
noisy or something.

00:38:23.862 --> 00:38:25.070
JON WILEY: We test 41 shades.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960
I'm just kidding.

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.620
Sorry.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.120
Too soon.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.620
Too soon.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.600
JONATHAN LEE: There's
two approaches to color.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.390
One is that we
intentionally wanted

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:44.230
to take a very exuberant
approach to applying color

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.825
to our applications.

00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:48.074
We felt that, like I was
kind of talking about in some

00:38:48.074 --> 00:38:50.490
of the slides where you should
really embrace your brand's

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.460
product colors, or your icon
colors, and extend those things

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.920
all the way through all
the series of screens

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.710
that someone's going to see.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.860
And so we thought, why
not push it further?

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.090
And on the reverse side
I think there's also

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.660
some pretty extensive usability
and contrast ratio studies

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.560
that we started to
standardize around.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.830
And I think that
that's the intention

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.290
of the design guidelines
is to kind of help

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.590
give guidance on being
exuberant while still

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.740
being accessible and usable.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.010
MATIAS DUARTE: Yeah, so
to be super clear, if you

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.370
go into the spec you'll find
a whole bunch of pallets,

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.790
and they have a lot of guidance
on what kinds of colors

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:33.890
you should put together in
order to get legible text on top

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.900
of them, and stuff like that.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.370
But we are very
much in love with

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.020
and excited with these
modern, bold colors.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.470
But the entire
system is designed

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:50.070
to let different
approaches and philosophies

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.410
to color feel just
as much at home.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:55.030
If you want your content to
pop more and your UI elements

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.616
to be really muted
and subdued, you know,

00:39:57.616 --> 00:39:59.240
that's part of material
design as well.

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:01.430
The idea is that it is
a material like paper,

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.170
and you can print something
that's very exuberant on it,

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.970
or you can print something
that's much more muted.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:11.370
We want to be a framework
where any brand can fully

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.350
express itself and
feel at home, and not

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.487
be overshadowed by the
platform's conventions.

00:40:17.487 --> 00:40:19.570
NICHOLAS JITKOF: Some of
the examples you actually

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.100
can look at in the
preview will be

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.870
like the Settings
app is quite muted.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.550
It's intended to be
very utilitarian.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.190
Calculator app is
also muted, but it

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:29.320
uses a single pop of
color to draw attention

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.710
to other functionality.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.330
So it's, again, about
management of where

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.720
you want attention
and color that

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.790
makes an app really unique.

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.782
One other point
too, that the pallet

00:40:39.782 --> 00:40:41.240
library that we've
been working on,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.555
one of the reasons we were
so excited about it was it

00:40:43.555 --> 00:40:46.138
allows you to select colors that
can go alongside imagery that

00:40:46.138 --> 00:40:49.310
allow the image to feel like it
is covering the entire surface,

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.540
rather than like an
arbitrarily chosen color that

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.070
may contrast in
some unusual way.

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:57.230
So you have the opportunity
to have it extend the image

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.150
outwards into the system, or
even to contrast to that image

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.942
if you want to draw
attention to an action.

00:41:01.942 --> 00:41:03.608
MATIAS DUARTE: And
it looks like we only

00:41:03.608 --> 00:41:06.260
have three minutes and
four questions left.

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.370
So let's try to get
through them super quick.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.911
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry
to take the time,

00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:12.709
but actually I have two
questions, and it's tough.

00:41:12.709 --> 00:41:13.750
MATIAS DUARTE: All right.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.946
The crowd will vote on
which one we answer.

00:41:15.946 --> 00:41:16.446
No.

00:41:16.446 --> 00:41:16.942
I'm just joking.

00:41:16.942 --> 00:41:17.442
Go ahead.

00:41:17.442 --> 00:41:20.960
AUDIENCE: First of all, I heard
Jonathan is working for UXA,

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:25.130
which is the Google design
guidelines for the Google Apps.

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.460
So would you like to talk
about that a little bit,

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.840
how are you working
across different apps

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.510
to make the UX guidelines
consistent across Google Apps,

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.550
and how you also make
sure all the apps

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.190
will follow the guidelines
when you did that.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.600
That's the first question.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.260
And the second question
was Google always

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:45.980
have a big push on
the left navigations.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.360
As a company we didn't
follow that rule,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:54.560
and unfortunately what happened
was right after our release

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.200
from main screen navigation
to the left navigation

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.420
we did see a lot of drop
for the user engagement.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:05.960
And also we see a big trend
in that for Facebook app,

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.350
and on Google+ they changed from
left navigation into the main

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:10.500
screen navigation.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.580
So do you guys like to share
some insights of that change,

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.250
and how that will lead into a
lot of companies that develop

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.360
social apps that could
get insights from this?

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.612
Thank you.

00:42:22.612 --> 00:42:25.070
NICHOLAS JITKOF: OK, I'll answer
the second question first.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:26.862
MATIAS DUARTE: Super
quick second question.

00:42:26.862 --> 00:42:29.361
NICHOLAS JITKOF: Left nav is
appropriate for certain classes

00:42:29.361 --> 00:42:30.180
of apps.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.930
The places we've seen
them most successful

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:33.390
is when it's
something like Gmail,

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.550
or like a stream of content
where like 90% of your time

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.250
is spent there, and the rest
of the time you need sometimes

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.650
access to other labels,
or things like that.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:45.150
We'll go a lot more into this
in interaction design tomorrow

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.610
morning, but left
nav is only one

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:49.810
of a number of different
top level constructions.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:50.560
You can have tabs.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.130
You can have the
content area itself

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.929
act as overall navigation.

00:42:54.929 --> 00:42:57.220
One of the things we are
trying to do in the guidelines

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:58.900
is very specifically
calling out the benefits

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.233
of each of those different ones.

00:43:00.233 --> 00:43:02.540
Left nav itself
isn't inherently bad,

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.750
but when it's used for the
wrong type of application

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.435
it can focus the user
in the wrong way.

00:43:07.435 --> 00:43:09.060
JON WILEY: And I'll
answer the question

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.480
how do we coordinate
design across Google.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.250
We all talk to each
other all the time.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.040
That's it.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:13.950
We go up.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:14.850
That's it.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:15.440
MATIAS DUARTE: Lots of drinking.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.160
JON WILEY: Just
talking all the time.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:16.840
Just talking.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.881
All right, next question.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:22.960
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
about all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.190
and the physicality
that you stressed out

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.370
in the paper metaphor.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:30.500
And I was thinking about
Facebook's Paper app.

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:35.920
And they go a step further
giving away all buttons,

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:41.720
and making the motion the
clue to the interaction,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:42.940
like to close something.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.990
And I wanted to know
what you think of this.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.680
If you think that this
app would feel right

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:53.300
in the next generation
of Android apps?

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.017
NICHOLAS JITKOF: We
love using motion

00:43:55.017 --> 00:43:56.850
as an affordance for
things that can happen.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:43:59.110
We need to be careful about
being too reliant on it

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.318
because there are maybe
people who can't perceive it,

00:44:01.318 --> 00:44:03.900
but it is a wonderful
way to give clues

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.140
as to gestures
that can be taken,

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.137
and even just to simplify the
way the UI looks through it.

00:44:09.137 --> 00:44:10.845
So we're excited about
the possibilities.

00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:12.845
MATIAS DUARTE: And you
can see in our Calculator

00:44:12.845 --> 00:44:16.380
app we have a side panel
of expanded options.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.480
There's no button for it.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.240
There's no little
textured drag handle.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.310
It's just a surface.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:23.939
AUDIENCE: And you close
it by sliding to it?

00:44:23.939 --> 00:44:24.730
MATIAS DUARTE: Yes.

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:25.050
JON WILEY: All right.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:26.040
We can take one more question.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:26.520
MATIAS DUARTE: Oh no.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.250
Come on.

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:27.520
JON WILEY: Just one.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.160
Sorry.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.750
They're telling us to go.

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was wondering
if these design principles also

00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:35.789
apply to Google Glass?

00:44:35.789 --> 00:44:37.330
CHRISTIAN ROBERTSON:
To Google Glass?

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:38.960
JON WILEY: Will the
design principles also

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.795
apply to Google Glass?

00:44:39.795 --> 00:44:42.044
NICHOLAS JITKOF: As of right
now our design principles

00:44:42.044 --> 00:44:43.349
don't cover Google Glass.

00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:45.640
The information about color,
and brand, and iconography

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.370
definitely do.

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:50.070
And we're working very
closely with that team.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.510
Our primary focus for now
has been sort of the watch

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:55.930
to television form factors,
but we're definitely

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.009
considering it and working
to tie them together.

00:44:58.009 --> 00:44:58.800
JON WILEY: Awesome.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.340
Thank you everybody
for attending.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.830
Enjoy the rest of
your afternoon.
