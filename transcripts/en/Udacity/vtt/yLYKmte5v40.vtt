Now for the third question, I want you to try something different.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.570
Take a moment to think about everything you've learned thus far

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.160
and write it down.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.270
This type of reflection can help us better recall new ideas at a later stage.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.960
I remember my grad school professor used to say,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.890
the way to put things in long-term memory, is to describe them to someone else.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.890
So, here is your chance to do that.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.390
Think about everything you have learnt thus far and write it down.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.490
You can either draw an image using pen and paper.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.390
Then take a picture of it and share with us using Twitter, LinkedIn or Facebook.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.630
Or if you want to keep your work private,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
you can write down everything that you've learned in this text box.
