00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:09.390
Hello.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.030
Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm Paul Saxman, a developer
advocate on the Google Maps API

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.800
team.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.530
In this video, I
cover the basics

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.530
of adding markers to a map using
the Google Maps Android API V2.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.540
Markers are the fundamental way
to show position of something

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.560
on a map.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040
Something in this context can
be a place, such as a city

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.780
venue or landmark, or it could
be a transient or moving object

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.470
such as a person or vehicle.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.780
Essentially, markers can be
used to represent anything

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.090
that has a global position
in latitude and longitude

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.860
coordinates.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.660
Adding a marker to the map is
as simple as calling addMarker

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.200
on the Google Map object
with a marker options

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.970
object as a parameter.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.190
An instance of a marker
is returned from addMarker

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.870
so that you can later
update or remove the marker.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.317
You can remove a map marker
by calling the remove method

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:57.275
on the marker instance.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.380
When creating a marker,
the marker options object

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.349
needs to be configured
with a position in lat

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.000
long coordinates,
but it also supports

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.220
a number of other
optional parameters.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.740
For example, you can
create an invisible marker,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.470
which you can
later make visible.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.640
Or you can set the
transparency for a marker

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.770
using the alpha property.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.340
The default marker is a
red inverted tear drop,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.590
which should be
familiar to most users.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.870
However, you can easily
change the color of a marker

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.580
or provide your own marker
image using the icon

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.245
method and a bitmap
descriptor factory object.

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.870
We'll cover these
techniques in a video

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.530
on creating custom
markers, however,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.940
since there are a
number of ways that you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.314
can change a
marker's appearance.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.720
After a marker has
been created, most

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560
of its properties like its
position, visibility, and icon

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.650
can be changed by calling
corresponding mutator

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.874
methods on the marker class.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.290
For example, if
you want to toggle

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.790
the visibility of
a marker, you can

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.520
call a setVisible method
of a marker instance.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.420
Toggling marker
visibility is a great way

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.990
to implement place
filtering, since making

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.290
an initially invisible
marker visible

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.670
is faster than creating
a new marker altogether.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.720
For example, if you want to
allow the user to hide or show

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.050
hotels with specific
price or cost levels,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.825
you'll likely want to use marker
visibility instead of creating

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:18.950
new markers altogether to
get the best performance.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.730
If you want to show a
small amount of information

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.500
on the map along
with the marker,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.890
you can add a title and
snippet to your marker using

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.552
the corresponding methods
on the marker options class.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.010
The title and
snippet are displayed

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.430
in an info window, a
bubble over the marker when

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.550
the user touches the marker.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.320
You can also programmatically
show or hide the info window

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.610
using the showInfoWindow
and hideInfoWindow

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.160
methods of a marker instance.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.780
You can fully customize
the appearance

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.440
of the info window using
an info window adapter.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.197
However, since there
are a couple ways

00:02:53.197 --> 00:02:54.780
that you can customize
an info window,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.154
we'll cover these techniques
in a separate video as well.

00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:02.330
If you want to take some other
action when a user touches

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.520
a marker besides
showing an info window,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.000
you can implement an
on-marker click listener

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.640
and assign an instance
of your listener

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.170
to the Google Map class.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.086
When a user touches the marker,
the on-marker click method

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:16.210
of your adapter instance
is called with a reference

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.855
to the marker that was clicked.

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:22.060
It can therefore be useful to
maintain a hash map of markers

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.500
that you've created in order
to look up and display more

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.980
information about the
place or object associated

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.130
with a marker.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.990
For example, if you use
markers to represent hotels

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.830
and you want to show
details about a hotel

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.150
in a separate view when a
user touches a hotel marker,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.130
you can use a hash map to look
up the hotel description using

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.650
a clicked marker as the key.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.620
So now you should know how
to get started with markers.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.170
If you'd like more information,
check out our documentation

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.420
and watch a show
about custom markers.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.260
In the meantime, have fun
making remarkable maps.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.446
Thanks for joining and
hope to see you soon.
