1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,820
Boom. Here we go. Yeah, buddy. Good
to see you. Great. Good to be here.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,390
We were talking before the podcast about,
uh,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,930
people who get mad when I have you on.
Like as if you're some sort of a monster.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,280
You're a mean person. Like I didn't
need her to say you're a New York Jew,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,590
you're snarky.
You say funny things,

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,570
but this idea that you're a Nazi or
something like people have gotten soap.

7
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,080
This is this ice breaker. Hey, by the
way, why do people think you're nuts?

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,160
Someone sent me,
I don't read comments on Twitter,

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,730
but someone sent me something like,
you having this guy on today and I'm like,

10
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:39,600
that is so hilarious. I go, this guy
is, yeah, there's some shit you say.

11
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:43,020
I don't agree with. Sure. You're very
reasonable and very intelligent. Yeah.

12
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:47,100
The last chapter of the book A's me
arguing with the Nazi conversation folks.

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,190
It's not bad. It's not bad.
I talk that I, well, it's,

14
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,570
it's kind of for them a religious
thing, right? If someone is a sinner,

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,090
you can't acknowledge that they
have to be outside of the fort.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,530
That's a good way to look at it. That is
what it is. You know what's interesting?

17
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:05,280
It's,
I know these people don't mean to do this.

18
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:09,570
This is not their plan, but if you
wanted to keep Donald Trump in office,

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,040
the w the way the people that oppose
Donald Trump are behaving is the perfect

20
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,820
way to keep them in office.
If you tell high schoolers if you smoke,

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,940
you're parents are going to get upset
and the teacher didn't get upset.

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,800
That's the biggest question. Right?
Right. Yeah. So you tell these kids,

23
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:29,610
Hey, if you go to these
websites and read these books,

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,320
then your parents and the establishment
and the teachers are all gonna be afraid

25
00:01:34,321 --> 00:01:37,750
of you. Well, sign me up. I
mean, it's as simple as that.

26
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:41,700
It's the same exact psychology and they're
driving people to the fringe they are.

27
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,760
And the the D platforming
things fascinating.

28
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:49,680
Because the way this stuff works folks,
is when people get DDI platform.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,160
The first people that will get deep
platform are people that you agree with

30
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:57,870
getting d platformed. People
like, you know, I'll go real Nazi.

31
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,890
Like someone who's a, an
avowed white supremacy, like
yeah, d platform, that guy,

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,540
and that's a little slippery because then
it's like this guy's a suspected Nazi,

33
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,350
or this guy is friends with a Nazi, or
this guy hadn't rights. He on his show,

34
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,870
this guy had a white
supremacists onto this show.

35
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,680
This guy had a guy who thinks it's okay
to be white on his show and then it gets,

36
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,990
it gets more,
as it gets more and more progressive,

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,000
it gets more and more preposterous,
but it really is great.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,790
It's once you accept one grade,

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
then you drop below in a little bit more
preposterous and then that's acceptable

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,200
and then a little bit more and
then that becomes accepted.

41
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:34,350
And it's a double standard between people
who are Orthodox and people who are

42
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:39,270
unorthodox. Barbara Walters sat down
with Castro. She sat down with Kadafi,

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,060
who's killed how many
people? Yeah, that's fine.

44
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,400
You could sit down with the
murderers dictator if you're Kadafi.

45
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,150
If you sit down with someone on a
podcast with someone who has all point of

46
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:52,380
views, that is somehow different.
Well, it's a new thing, right?

47
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,730
Platforming and d platforming and you put
putting this guy on your platform like

48
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:00,850
all this, this, this kind of communication
is very new. I just didn't exist.

49
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,400
No one was saying that to Mike
Wallace. No, no one's saying that.

50
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,020
As you're saying to Barbara Walters,

51
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,950
that was my argument to the Damien's data
and society lady. I said, Jesus, I said,

52
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,890
Barbara Walters interviewed Fidel Castro.
Does that make her a communist?

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,720
Like all right, I interviewed Milo. Am
I a gay conservative provocateur now?

54
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,510
I don't think so. You need to go to a
doctor for sure. I mean, what, what, what,

55
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,630
what they, what they're trying
to do is thanks to social media.

56
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,930
They no longer have a monopoly and I
don't mean they have just been like

57
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,680
Orthodox thought isn't he left wing and
right wing Orthodox thought no longer

58
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,450
has a monopoly on the microphone.

59
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,560
And that's very dangerous if you want
to basically set the boundaries of what

60
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:43,060
acceptable discourse is. Same thing with,
forget politics. Look up music, right?

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,120
If you want to say these are the co
you shouldn't have lyrics like this.

62
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,970
People shouldn't dance like this. They
shouldn't, you know, dress a certain way.

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,230
This is what they would like.

64
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,070
I mean back in the nineties you remember
they'd had the warning labels on cds

65
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:58,510
and says this has explicit lyrics and
that way Walmart could with clean hands

66
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,320
say we're not being involved.
Politics, we're following their rules.

67
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,840
So that's what this data was society
ladies trying to do. It's like, okay,

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,100
I'm giving you target
whatever company and excuse,

69
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,250
these are the people you don't need to
deal with. And then they could say, well,

70
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:15,660
it's not up to us. We're looking at this
from an external point of view. Well,

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,760
and also my perspective on it is that
there's certain subjects that I think that

72
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,921
we can all agree we need to cover and we
need to deal with in terms of laws and

73
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,900
in terms of the way the government is run.

74
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,900
But a lot of these
disagreements aren't on that.

75
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:36,400
A lot of these disagreements seem to be
just on political ideologies and like

76
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:40,720
liberal versus conservative ideologies.
And people think differently.

77
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:43,810
They have different styles
of behavior and thinking.

78
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:48,100
This is why like if you had a station
that played hip hop and all of a sudden

79
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,410
you just got a bunch of Aerosmith
songs playing, he'd be like,

80
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:52,540
what the fuck is this?
This is not what I want.

81
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,250
Get this off the station except
for walk this way. That's good.

82
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,370
Well the one with run DMC,
that was one exception,

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,680
but that that's sort of how a lot of
people seem to be approaching conservative

84
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:09,511
versus progressive thinking is it's
like once you have this mindset,

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,530
you don't want to hear other opinions as
if they're going to influence you or if

86
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,090
you don't like the way they sound,

87
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:18,700
you don't like what they're doing and
you want to get them off the channel.

88
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,840
And this is what it seems
like is happening with social
media platforms, right?

89
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,050
Is that the social media platforms
are like, we're a country station.

90
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,260
We don't play heavy metal.
Get that shit off our network.

91
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,460
Like we are a progressive network.
We don't play conservative.

92
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,260
Get that stuff off. Well if they had
said that we're progressive in that way,

93
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:40,870
it's like a server that would be honest
and fair, but they, the claim is no,

94
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,290
we are banning people who
are doing x, Y and Z. Yeah.

95
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,700
And you know for people that are like,
oh my God,

96
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,010
they're talking about this
again, two fuckers, listen,

97
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,750
this is really important shit.
This is going to decide how we,

98
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,260
this is, this didn't exist
before. Okay. And now it does.

99
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,040
Now we have this unbelievable

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,100
ability to communicate and I'm enjoying
it right now talking to you. Right?

101
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,040
We're all enjoying it if you're tweeting
about this or writing comments about

102
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,580
this,
but it's,

103
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,280
if this really branches off into a one
side get to do it and one side doesn't,

104
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,150
we're going to have a fucking
tremendous problem in this country.

105
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:16,510
If you think that this problem
that we have right now and it's,

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,150
it's just starting to be an issue
over the last couple of years.

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,470
If you think that this is what this could
escalate, it's like a serious conflict,

108
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,250
which I mean almost like it's,

109
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,130
it's absolutely reasonable to think that
violence could come out of this. Well,

110
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:33,590
the Trump presidency was
the escalation before Trump.

111
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:36,910
It was okay [inaudible] fake news with
this left idea that like this, you know,

112
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,410
this new sites of putting out lies your,

113
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,930
if your point of view is different
to mine, it's not just wrong.

114
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,840
It's illegitimate. Right? And a lot of
people in that voting booth and said,

115
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,820
you want an illegitimacy?
Okay,

116
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm voting for Donald Trump for president
and now he's in the White House.

117
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:53,420
So for you to say that, if people
to say that these ideas, you know,

118
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,120
are evil and shouldn't be discussed,
those are separate concepts.

119
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,700
Cause even if you think they're evil,
if from your point of view,

120
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,570
it's in the White House,

121
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,170
are you going to pretend this isn't the
most powerful man in the world? It's,

122
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,500
there's a big contradiction there,

123
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,240
but one of the things progressivism offers
many people is this idea of truth and

124
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:08,870
certainty.

125
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,050
Knowing you're one of the good guys and
knowing you're in the majority and when

126
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,710
you find that that is not always true.
I think that caused some cognitive stress,

127
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,170
you know? No, I would
absolutely agree with that.

128
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:23,171
I just think there's a real problem
that's happening now with some of the

129
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:27,170
accounts that I'm seeing. Getting
banned without reason, without reason,

130
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:31,820
for things that are like parody accounts.
Carpay docked them.

131
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,140
So I interrupt you.

132
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,960
He's the one who made this great meme
during the state of the Union where he,

133
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,750
ted,
president Trump and all the,

134
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,570
he said footage from the state of the
Union of the Democrats looking pissed and

135
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:44,450
he put it over the song. Everybody
hurts, right? There's two minute video.

136
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,570
It's a joke. It's fun, right?
You could see on second life,

137
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,380
you don't have to be Republican or
Democrats to laugh at Saraf pluses.

138
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,710
They got a copyright strike cause it's
like you don't have the right to use the

139
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:58,040
music. Trump had retweeted
it. He put out another one,

140
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,870
he just got suspended for a week. He did
the video from my book. So they don't,

141
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,460
here's the thing, if someone is a name,
you can say, hey, delete this tweet.

142
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,770
It violates our guidelines,
right? You give them warnings,

143
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,820
you could call their manager. They don't
do that. You're just vanished overnight.

144
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,390
And there's something very Soviet about
this because when they vanish you,

145
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,180
your entire archives get managed
to, and it's like, wait a minute,

146
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,500
this person's bad and dangerous.

147
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
Don't you want to show other people
as an example of what to avoid?

148
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,770
Like this will get you banned so you
can modify your behavior accordingly.

149
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,731
But what they want,

150
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:33,290
apparently it looks like what they want
is for everyone to be self censoring and

151
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:38,000
to be afraid. And that way it's like, uh,
instead of saying we're since, sure. Yes.

152
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:40,070
It's like you made that
decision on your own. Well,

153
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:43,370
I know Trump has been talking about this
now because it affects so many people

154
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,960
that are supporters. Right. And he's, um,

155
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,780
been discussing that the idea that
these people need to abide by the first

156
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,530
amendment and then there's your argument
will either they're a private company,

157
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,040
they can put on whatever
they want and they

158
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,970
can decide whatever they want or they're
protected by the first amendment.

159
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,360
You know, I had Tulsa Gabber don the
other day. She was running her love her.

160
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,800
I love her too. And she's running. I asked
her, do my Shushu wouldn't reply. Really?

161
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,960
Yeah. Why? I don't know. She
didn't reply. I don't know.

162
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:14,190
Having that say on compound media, Guest
Digital, Oh, you're already has digital.

163
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,920
That's even more disgusting. And
compound media. That's the problem.

164
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,280
And all that good ways. It all the
good ways. Listen, I love Lewis.

165
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:23,640
I love all those guys are savages
lose. She's probably like, oh fuck.

166
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,990
I forgot I'm savage Jason. Like I'll
have those guys. You know what I mean?

167
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,900
I have officially gotten permission
that the room we all recording.

168
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:34,890
It's called the gas chamber.
Oh, Jesus. Yeah. You could
say that. I could say that.

169
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,120
Yeah. You're alone. Yeah. Where
you guys put that privilege.
Yeah. That's privilege.

170
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,190
Do Frivolous. Yeah. Yeah. Um, maybe
she will, um, I'll, I'll look,

171
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,780
tell her about it.
But she was on her and I are besties,

172
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,700
tele slash two by the time
I really do respect the shit out of her.

173
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:54,330
I really do. Um, you know, I'd
love to call her madam president.

174
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:58,950
I think that'd be dope. She's smart, man.
She's, she's, she's so measured. I mean,

175
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,940
she doesn't have all the answers.

176
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,420
And some of the things that she says
are things that you say, you know,

177
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,910
I'm not sure we're going to, we're going
to have to work to create more jobs.

178
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,720
Like those kinds of, that kind of talk.
It's like politician talk and I go, okay,

179
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,000
well what would that mean? And we'll
have to figure that out. And I,

180
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,960
I think she's sincere, but these
answers, you know, don't really exist.

181
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,840
Like how to fix the inner cities.
Like how to like,

182
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:21,210
these are the like some that some of
the big issues that you discussed.

183
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:24,480
We talked about, um, like
horrible neighborhoods that
have always been harmed,

184
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,920
right? Like, how was this?

185
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,350
Like we're going to fucking
Afghanistan trying to fix their, yeah.

186
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,950
And we're not trying to fix Chicago, the
south side Chicago. What's happening now?

187
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,530
Why? Why are so many people getting shot?
How come we can't fix it? It's funny.

188
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:38,580
Back in the day they had something called
slum clearance and the idea was if you

189
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,250
tear down these old buildings
and build new buildings,

190
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:45,120
somehow the crime's going to go away. And
this was a big nation. It's just like,

191
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,880
yeah, it's the buildings
fall fucking content houses,

192
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,320
they have decades and decades of
crack and bullets flying through them.

193
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,380
That's so crazy.
But she's great because she,

194
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,560
my biggest issue is anti war.
Yes.

195
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,270
At anyone for me whose first priority
isn't let's stop killing people.

196
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:08,140
Yeah. That I'm a fan of. Yeah.
And she's also a veteran.
Yeah. 16 years. Yeah. Yeah.

197
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,190
I'm a big fan. Um, but
you know, I think, um,

198
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,620
this country needs more, you know,
we need a, we need real plans.

199
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,630
We need like someone, we just, the
way we engineer software systems,

200
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,790
um, you know, search engines,
operating systems for cell phones,

201
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,260
they should engineers society.

202
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,860
I mean we should really be looking
at it in terms of the potential for

203
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:36,690
prosperity opportunity, all these
different things that we don't cover.

204
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:39,790
We just sort of leave so much
up to chance because we buy the,

205
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,300
the bullshit that like,
I mean,

206
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:45,630
I think we all know at this point then
not everyone's on an even playing field,

207
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:49,500
which is not, but we don't think
a lot of people know that. Well,

208
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,130
they're fucking crazy. And that's the
problem. Yeah. Yes, they're fucking,

209
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,010
if you don't think

210
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,630
that being born in a crime
or in a neighborhood with
violence all around you and

211
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:02,380
being exposed at an early age fucks
your head up. I don't even mean that.

212
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,290
I think the fact that said, admit that
a lot of people aren't hardworking.

213
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,520
Oh yeah,
there's that too.

214
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,280
And I like to say that out there as
shocking to many people. It's like, yeah,

215
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,330
some people are bad.

216
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Some people think that just because they
show up at work and they don't want to,

217
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:20,360
that they're working hard. Right.
It's hard for them. You fucking,

218
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,990
you just go lucky or you do the,
you know what I read,

219
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:26,920
that was one of the more hilarious
things that I've ever heard of crazy

220
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:30,370
progressive person. Right.
If you are successful,

221
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,480
it is because someone else got
fucked over. That's so disturbing.

222
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,820
But it's such a crazy way to
look at it. It's like, okay,

223
00:12:36,821 --> 00:12:39,340
somewhere down the chain already,
if you have an iPhone,

224
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,680
someone got fucked over that
logic, right? No, no, no,

225
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:44,890
no.

226
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,890
The logic is someone had to work as a
slave and Foxconn to make these fucking

227
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,750
iPhones for like 15 cents a week
or whatever they make over there.

228
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,810
But if it wasn't making 15 cents a week,
that slave would be dead.

229
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,160
That's what they're saying.
It's squirrely. Right. Cause,
but yeah, but is that okay?

230
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,690
Like when they go to third world countries
and set up these sweatshops and uh,

231
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,700
like I knew someone who had one and
they were like doing fucking mental

232
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:09,790
gymnastics to try to justify.
And I was like, wait a minute,

233
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,500
how much he paid his
people and they were like,

234
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,450
they were going to starve to
death if it wasn't for us. Mike,

235
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,240
are you sure they were there?
Right? They were there.

236
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,720
They probably been there for thousands
of years. Like where'd you go?

237
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,120
Like Guatemala, where was it? Argentina?

238
00:13:22,121 --> 00:13:24,760
Like where are you said I'll
give you two examples that are,

239
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,300
maybe I can't speak to specific
second world examples. North Korea,

240
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,890
which has obviously my beat. Yeah,
that's your beat. So there is a, um,

241
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,720
a zone between north and South Korea where
they work together. DMZ, motherfucker.

242
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:42,190
No, but it's like this enrichment zone.
And in your case all work together, right?

243
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:44,950
So the North Korean has worked at the
South Korea has kind of put it together.

244
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,790
Oh. And the government takes
like 95% of your money.

245
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,880
And also North Koreans who work in Russia
in logging camps where the government

246
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:55,000
takes like 95% of your money.
They're slaves. They're 100% slaves.

247
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,740
But they're beating down their doors to
work in these locations because they're

248
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:03,070
providing for their family and they're
still wealthier than the alternative. Now,

249
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:06,250
this is a very extreme situation.
This isn't like, I don't know,

250
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:08,440
third world what country your,
your friend has a sweatshop in.

251
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,210
But there are circumstances where a lot
of people on the left and on the right

252
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,960
don't understand often that
politics and economics is about,

253
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:20,800
often you have two bad choices. Like
what is the alternative? It's like,

254
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:22,780
what do you like? For example,
you're going to put forth the law.

255
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,900
What are you going to do about people
who are going to look at this law?

256
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,790
Not In good faith. Like there was that
guy was named zoomies Judy who said,

257
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,390
I'm trans and he just made a
video break. Newbies. Zov Yeah,

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,290
he just broke the woman's dead referees
like, Oh man, here we go. By the way,

259
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,900
they took those, uh,
records away from that.

260
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:45,340
An Australian woman that you see guy there
was Australia, right? Wasn't the world.

261
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:49,180
The power lifting woman's world records.
She broke like three of them.

262
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,980
So it's not even about trans
stuff. It's like, what do you do

263
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,950
with any law when someone is
going to act in bad faith?

264
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:56,390
And if you can't account for that,

265
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,770
you're not being a responsible
with your proposal. Yeah.

266
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:04,220
This isn't even a law though. We're
talking about with the Trans Athletes.

267
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:06,320
It's just,
it's loopholes.

268
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,150
So some weird people don't want to be
seen as trans phobic in today's climate.

269
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:14,930
So that allowing preposterous things.
What was that like for you?

270
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:15,501
And you were talking,

271
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,230
I remember when you're talking to Adam
on this show that got pretty heated.

272
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:23,210
Oh yeah. Adam ruins everything.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, it didn't
get heated. We just, I mean,

273
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,570
I never got upset. We,
we've absolutely disagreed,

274
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,460
but he had some crazy notions about
competition that didn't make any sense

275
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:34,310
either.
Like that somehow or another,

276
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,750
the sports are designed
to favor men. What? Yeah.

277
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,820
It didn't make any sense. It was a lot
of it was progressive rehashing. Okay.

278
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,200
In my opinion,
I think it sounded good to him,

279
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,690
but I don't know how much
actual thought is put into it.

280
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:52,960
What's actually interesting is like in
his show he's well researched and no

281
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:57,710
one's opposing these,
this data that he's putting out.

282
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,090
So he gets to say these things is one
of the problems with like writing a blog

283
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,820
or making a video about
something where no one goes.

284
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:07,460
Actually that's not really true.
This is why that's not true.

285
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,550
Let me explain and this is why
you're wrong. And now continue.

286
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,820
See when you could just go on
these long unchecked rants.

287
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,130
That's where you get like flat earth
believers. That's what that shit from.

288
00:16:19,131 --> 00:16:21,980
Cause they watch those videos and they go,
oh this makes sense.

289
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,670
But this is why it's so important that
unorthodox voices don't get the platforms.

290
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:29,270
Because even if that person is proposed
putting for things that are completely

291
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:32,540
full of shit,
they're criticism and their perspective,

292
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
they might have some truth in it.
And at the very least,

293
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,450
like when I was at Charlottesville and
I talked to these people by talking to

294
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:43,190
them, it makes me think through why do I
believe what I believe? Why is my truth,

295
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:46,580
the actual truth? And I'm going
to be challenged on my views.

296
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:48,980
And I'm going to have a better
grounding for them as opposed to,

297
00:16:48,981 --> 00:16:49,521
like you're saying,

298
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,280
if I'm sitting here just
giving a monologue and no
one ever calls me out on my

299
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:55,580
bullshit. Yeah. I think
I see what you're saying.

300
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,390
And I think what they think is you
have to silence these bad voices.

301
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:03,230
Like the Anti vaccs movement. That's a
big one right now. People are saying,

302
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,650
you've got to silence NTP. So they're
taking an anti vaccs videos down there,

303
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:10,370
taking into vax pages down.
You know,

304
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:15,230
I don't know how much they actually
know about the science, you know,

305
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:15,951
I don't,
I mean,

306
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,900
vaccines are incredible for health in
terms of what they've done to protect us

307
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:24,290
from diseases. They've stopped
smallpox, they've stopped polio.

308
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,860
And when you see these
outbreaks of measles,

309
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,450
that is a direct result of people
not getting vaccinated. You know?

310
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,770
Does that mean that no one's ever been
hurt by vaccines? No. No, it doesn't, man.

311
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:41,000
There's a vaccine court. People been
injured. People have died. That's a fact.

312
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,660
But that's, I think, just a part of
medical procedures and human beings. Men,

313
00:17:45,661 --> 00:17:49,770
a lot of kids die every year from
circumcision. Yeah. They get infections.

314
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:53,610
They lose their penises. Yeah.
Yeah. It's like very common,

315
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,210
like way more common in terms of like
the numbers per year than you would ever

316
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:01,710
want to hear. Oh God. Okay. People
die from things. They get infections.

317
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:05,070
People get, have allergic
reactions to certain chemicals.

318
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,450
Then the problem is now those vaxxers
can say we're being covered up now.

319
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,880
They're honest. It's the truth. They are
being covered or being covered up. Yeah.

320
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,890
So it's a very, I would think it
problem is who's right and who's wrong.

321
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,720
Like if you're a person and you
have a child and you terrified,

322
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,120
can you go to these websites
and like, oh my God, um,

323
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,100
I don't want my kid to get autism.

324
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,790
Like what they're saying that vaccines
cause autism. I'm not vaccinating my kids.

325
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,280
I'm not going to take the chance.
And that's where a lot of it comes in.

326
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,300
If you watch those videos and you watch
a video that's not done by a scientist,

327
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:39,990
that's not up to date on what
we know about what causes,

328
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,970
like I had Peter Hotez on who's um,

329
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,500
very knowledgeable about vaccines and
very knowledgeable about diseases in

330
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,770
general and he was describing the,

331
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:52,430
the what they think the
causes of autism are.

332
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,590
That how it takes place in the womb and
how what's most likely happening is it's

333
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,160
just expressing itself at the same time
that the kids getting vaccinated and

334
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,960
you're correlating the
two things together.

335
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,680
Well there's also the movement of
not regarding autism as a problem or,

336
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,230
or door a Cota, you know,
children of deaf adults, you know,

337
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:13,920
you have these parents whose kids are
deaf and they refuse to get them cochlear

338
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:17,580
implants to give them the ability to
hear cause they think that's losing deaf

339
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:22,300
culture. Now to me, you never heard
this? No. This is a thing. Yeah.

340
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,210
For me,

341
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:27,450
everything is a thing because you can
see it when you think about it for a few

342
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:27,451
seconds,

343
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:29,610
you can understand where they're coming
from because you're going to be like,

344
00:19:29,611 --> 00:19:31,560
well, you're saying I'm bad
because I'm deaf. I know it's like,

345
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,000
but then you hear people that are like
Trans Disabled. Do you know what that is?

346
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,210
Whether they cut their hand off because
they feel like they're supposed to have

347
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:43,410
no hand, no. Oh yes. Oh yeah. See
these things. This is what I'm saying.

348
00:19:43,411 --> 00:19:44,041
Like they're all,

349
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:47,730
I'm lumping them all together because
what they are is all of them are these

350
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:52,731
weird variables when it comes to human
behavior and thinking and patterns and

351
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:54,300
biology.
Oh,

352
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:58,800
he's weird variables where you get so
many numbers and if you have all these

353
00:19:58,801 --> 00:20:01,860
people, 300 whatever million
we have in this country,

354
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:06,090
you're going to have a few thousand
of almost every fucking variable,

355
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,490
every weird variable. Good
Lord I lord. Yeah. I'll,

356
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,030
I know is the politics
that the health stuff,

357
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,390
I don't even want to wait into that too.
That was why I was, there was an old,

358
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:20,280
a website that I was going to, um,
what was that body modification?

359
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:25,050
Extreme [inaudible] that guy
BME, he died the Lizard Guy? No,

360
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:27,080
the cat guy.
His name was Shannon Shannon,

361
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,100
I think Shannon laureate
is how you say his name,

362
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,810
but B m e x body modification extreme was
the website. Um, he and I became like a,

363
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,010
uh, pen pen pals going back.
Like he sent me some stuff on,

364
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,430
I wrote something once
about body modification.

365
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,770
Like what kind of weird shit people
do it. And he's like, hey man,

366
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:46,440
if you ever have any questions, feel
free to ask me. This is my website.

367
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:49,450
He sent me a to his wet cause it was
like one of those six he had to pay for a

368
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:53,830
membership and I was like, Holy Shit,
you go to this website and it's just,

369
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,150
it was just, this was in
the 90s. Okay. And the,

370
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,070
the most freakish,
weirdest fucking body modifications.

371
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:04,900
And there's a whole culture behind it.

372
00:21:04,901 --> 00:21:08,380
People putting horns on their heads
and doing weird shit to their skin,

373
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:11,560
making them sold out and tattoo
in their whole face. Melissa,

374
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,320
she had magnets implanted on her fingers.
I don't know why.

375
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,520
We never know what I would, I think the
magnet, well you have to pick things up.

376
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,170
You don't want to close your hand. Fuck
is wrong with the frog magnets. Well,

377
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:26,200
people think that magnet like where
magnets is a wristband supposed to be good

378
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,460
for you cares autism, but you
get the vaccine magnet. You know,

379
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,300
it sounds stupid,

380
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,330
but they use magnetic therapy for veterans
that have PTSD and CTE because um,

381
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,410
there's areas of the brain
that can actually stimulate
with these very powerful

382
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:44,800
magnets.
A Cat Zingano UFC fighter.

383
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,160
She went down there when she was having
some serious repercussions from her

384
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,340
fight with Amanda Nunez.

385
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,450
She got really battered badly in the
first round and her hormones are out of

386
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:58,060
whack for months afterwards.
She was all fucked up.

387
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:01,820
Her Cortisol levels were all fucked up
and finally she went and got some milk.

388
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,990
Sparring was off her time. And these
options are, I just have to rush people.

389
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,880
I didn't have any sense of timing.
Oh yeah.

390
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,030
She was on real problems with
their brain and they fixed it.

391
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,520
They fixed it with magnets. These,
these electromagnetic pulse on,

392
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,340
I'm just saying words
that I don't understand.

393
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:17,840
So if you're a scientist and
you're like, well, shut the fuck.

394
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:22,330
Are you saying this side? Just tweeting
at you? Feverously call. Listen,

395
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,040
angry scientist come with you. I'm, I'm,
I'm retarded. Listen, they throw these,

396
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,550
these,

397
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:32,550
these waves at the brain and somehow
know that these electromagnetic waves

398
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:37,861
stimulate areas of the mind
and it actually forces brain
cells to grow in forces

399
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,340
neural connections. It's
really interesting stuff.
Cats Ganos played it pretty,

400
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,500
pretty, pretty in depth,
but it really helped her.

401
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,540
So it's weird that a
magnet would work for that,

402
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,530
but those are like really strong ones.
Okay. The little ones around your wrists.

403
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,990
But it might, I mean, I don't
know the fuck do I know? Yeah.

404
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,460
I'm not spending that 24 99
in that fucking bracelet,

405
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,990
but it's kind of an English
guy that's selling it.

406
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:04,510
That's how you know it's
legit and it comes with a
mop, comes with a free shammy.

407
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:07,750
Remember the sham? Wow Guy. He's dead,
isn't he? Yeah. Didn't you guys Israeli?

408
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,360
You get bit by a hooker.
Yeah. What's the other one?

409
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:13,990
Who got the oxyclean guys dead?
Billy. Whatever. Shamwows alive. Yeah.

410
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:17,290
Billy was tooting up. Yeah.
Is that what it was? Yeah.

411
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:22,150
He had a lot of coconut system
apparently. Oh, Playtech.

412
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,980
Right. Well listen, I got that oxy
money that clean your sinuses up.

413
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,180
Do you want to fucking party?

414
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,740
Who's probably had a yellow
Lamborghini Dick Implant. Just kidding.

415
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,810
I made that part up.
I'm sure he was a great guy.

416
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
Wasn't in the middle of
doing a television show.

417
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,880
They were doing a television show
about him. Uh, yeah, he was, well,

418
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,460
he had the pitchman.
It was like a sitcom or something.

419
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,000
It was like a reality show.
Reality type show.

420
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,700
They're following them around
doing pitches and stuff.

421
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,520
There's an art to that
shit. Those guys, he's,

422
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,620
he got me to realize
shark tank before them.

423
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:56,500
I think they were helping people do stuff
sorta like kitchen nightmares. Yeah.

424
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,290
I'm friends with the son.
The shark tanks on the no sham.

425
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,150
Well really made friends with Billy May
son. Yeah, I went to school with, Oh,

426
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,830
I'm sorry. I said all this. What's
his son's name was just joking around.

427
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,770
Bellamy's Jr he's the third. Oh, the
problem. Mad. We're talking to his dad.

428
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:12,980
He's,
I'm sure Billy Mays was a good guy,

429
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,840
but didn't eat well. Yeah. He's
your friend. Whatever. Yeah.

430
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,870
That's why he couldn't respond
anyway. Dude was partying. Um,

431
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,590
the sham wow guy was the guy who got bit,
I tried to track it.

432
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:31,100
I actually think he bit someone. Yeah.
I'll look at it. Someone like Marv Albert.

433
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,850
Did Marv Albert Bite someone?
Yeah. Did he bite the lady?

434
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,860
I thought she bit him to
get my stories all confused.

435
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,640
He comes to dude dudes fighting too
many vaccines. That's your problem. That

436
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,520
they saved me from the measles,
but I got into a big fight with them.

437
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,370
They made me dumber. What happened? Oh,
there it is. Oh God. Oh, he bit her.

438
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,850
It's happened a few times I think with
shamwow pitch man. Brutal beat down. Yeah.

439
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,730
So they just went to war. Oh my God.
He did that to her eyes. Is that real?

440
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,160
I don't know what I mean, that might not
be real. That looks like makeup though.

441
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,980
That looks crazy. That's
like smoking. Yeah. No,

442
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,930
it didn't look like your makeup to
me. So symmetrical. Sorry. Black eyes.

443
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,000
That's what happens. Feet smashed in the
nose. That's the look. Make Up. You know,

444
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,300
she uh,

445
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,030
she had his tongue and so he started
punching her until she realized system.

446
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,050
Oh my God. Her hand on her mouth. Tongue
or in the consciousness in the face.

447
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,850
Oh my God. People are
crazy. That's math, right?

448
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:30,150
I had to guess what's involved there.
No, it's something crazy at the meth.

449
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:35,270
Really like PCP or like a on
bath salts. Oh, remember that?

450
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,200
If you're grabbing someone's tongue, it's
bath salts. Think Beth salts were Metho.

451
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,810
No. Yeah, I think it was,

452
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,590
I think what it was was math with the UN.
The,

453
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:50,591
I think they altered the molecule so
that it doesn't fall into the protected

454
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,970
schedule one drug c that you can
do things like that. Like, uh,

455
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,840
that's why DMT was illegal.
But five methoxy DMT wasn't,

456
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:04,190
which is actually stronger. Huh? Um,
what's that? Um, they missed that one.

457
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,350
Here it goes. What's that
drug? The last 10 minutes. Oh,
why does this best salts? I,

458
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,300
well, first of all, here's another thing.

459
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,430
I think there's a bunch of different kinds
of bath salts for sure. Yeah, for sure.

460
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,590
You got the lavender. I mean there's
got to get the lemon, but I mean nobody,

461
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:25,940
uh, I don't think anybody has a patent.
You can't call that bath salts. Wait,

462
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:29,420
cause that's all they got high on that
it's best salts. Cause the name bathy own.

463
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:34,150
It's no, no, no. The bath salts is cause
they were selling it in stores as Bateson.

464
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,900
Not for human consumption wick who end
up like you just planted the chemicals

465
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:43,530
bath he owed no, Kath. Oh,
I'll can I misread it. Okay.

466
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,280
But what I'm saying is that labeled
it bass also, they could sell it,

467
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:49,800
but everybody knew it was Matt.
Phil. Okay man. This bath salts over,

468
00:26:49,801 --> 00:26:50,970
they should try smoking that.

469
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,280
But isn't that how Salvia
was around for a long time?

470
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,640
Salvia was around for the same reason.
Five methoxy DMT was around,

471
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,340
but I missed it in the sweeping
schedule. One drug, uh,

472
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,230
drug act of 1970 they missed that one.
Two of the most potent ones.

473
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:07,650
They missed Salvia divinorum
and five methoxy DMT.

474
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,910
And that's why they're always changing it.

475
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:11,760
Cause if it's slightly different than
you could say it's not that exactly.

476
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,740
So see if you find that like bath
salts is meth because someone,

477
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,330
there was a guy,
there was a guy who got a,

478
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,390
who's a homeless guy that
I think they shot him.

479
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:25,110
He was biting someone's face off in
Florida. Yeah. You remember that? Yeah.

480
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,200
And they said that he was on bath salts.
That's the first time I heard of it.

481
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,650
Yeah. And I think someone said
that it was meth that he was like,

482
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,030
cause like that cat stuff.
But it's like your thing,

483
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,400
it's just a bunch of different things.

484
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,850
You can call it a sound that
are made with mephedrone.

485
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:47,670
You could basically sell whatever you
want if you're selling it as not for human

486
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,500
consumption.
And also I'd probably,

487
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:53,160
they'd probably put smell into
it so they can say no. Well,

488
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,250
you know,
they probably threw some fucking,

489
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,190
so they have like a little cat and mouse
game going on for a while where they

490
00:27:59,191 --> 00:28:00,840
would have a,
it's the same thing.

491
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:04,190
What's going on with that k
two spice stuff like yoga.

492
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,010
We have synthetic THC,
there were spraying all over it and stuff.

493
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:11,910
Supposed to be terrible for us. Awful.
Yeah. Way Worse for you than actual,

494
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,060
but they would outlaw one little chemical
and then those guys would figure out,

495
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:18,760
okay, tweak it and make a t
h three, seven, nine. Okay.

496
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:21,990
And now next week is three 80 and they
just would keep doing it every single

497
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,920
week literally.
And by the way,

498
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:27,450
that's the same shit that they did with
steroids with like the clear when Barry

499
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:29,760
bonds and all those
guys that balco scandal,

500
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,500
that's what all that stuff was about.
Oh,

501
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:35,010
they just changed the like the points
after the trucks and stuff around a little

502
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,230
and then it doesn't show up in this,

503
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,220
in the test because it's not the
thing that you're looking for.

504
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,670
The way it's been explained to me is
a lot of tests for things were very

505
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:46,070
specific. So when the testing for
something and it's just a little bit off,

506
00:28:46,071 --> 00:28:47,640
I was like,
you test negative for it,

507
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,700
but it has a similar result or
approximate result in a different way,

508
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,800
Huh? Yeah. I will say
though, with the bath salts,

509
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,030
people were breaking into any
place that had them. Gas Stations,

510
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:03,150
any store that had bath salts, if
they think they had them, what?

511
00:29:03,151 --> 00:29:05,010
Your windows are being broken.
Your doors are being broken.

512
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:09,900
You're not going to have that stuff
tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Those are methods.

513
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:13,290
That's meth head activity.
Jesus Christ. Do you knew what?

514
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:17,280
Did you ever know anybody?
There's a method. No. Yeah.
I haven't known a few people.

515
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,800
Uh, it's weird to see because it's a
visual. The results. Well, not always.

516
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,880
That's what's interesting,

517
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,070
what you're seeing when you see people
that are completely fucked up and picking

518
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:32,880
the skin off their face and they weigh
five pounds and they're falling apart.

519
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,830
That is worst case scenario.

520
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,820
There's some people that I would call
functional methods and what these people

521
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:42,160
are people that are on
amphetamines every day or

522
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,560
almost every day,
they're constantly on amphetamines.

523
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:48,070
So some of them get prescribed by doctors.
They get really irrational.

524
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,650
They start thinking that
everyone's out to get him. Um,

525
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,970
they get real mean and nasty towards other
people. Very defensive. They're always,

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,700
they're always attacking and thinking.
They're persecuted,

527
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,310
thinking that someone's attacking them.
It's very strange.

528
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,790
And these people could function like
this for years, years and years.

529
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:07,000
And you get the same with
the Adderall addicts. Yeah.
Yeah. But that's just speed,

530
00:30:07,001 --> 00:30:11,050
isn't it? Same thing. Yeah. It's very
similar to math. It's amphetamines.

531
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,990
It's just a different release.
Like what Adderall is.

532
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,800
Duncan Trussell has a great joke is like
as if as a scientist took cocaine and

533
00:30:19,841 --> 00:30:21,880
went,
I can fix this.

534
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:32,590
Just makes people talk
active and aggressive and
insulting and mean and nasty

535
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:37,960
because it like, it highlights some
of the worst aspects of people.

536
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:42,490
The bitchy pettiness. I love that stuff.
That's my bread and butter, but it's not,

537
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:45,520
that's why you do it. You do it with
a smile. Thank you. That's true.

538
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:48,960
Snarky people need to be having
more fun. Yeah, but you are,

539
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,220
your positions are always even fun
on agree with them. The rational.

540
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,460
I see your thought process. I see
where you're going. Well, thank you.

541
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,640
That's a huge compliment.
Not a method that well. Yeah.

542
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,620
Why do you say the Jews are doing what?

543
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:08,300
What's happening with the Nazis or one
big one? I guess. I interviewed uh,

544
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,540
a Nazi for the book and I
said to him, I go, look,

545
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,160
what do I supposed to do when they
see your people come at me and say,

546
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:19,600
the only reason you care about North
Korea and its concentration camps is

547
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,700
because they're anti Israel.
And he goes,

548
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,580
why do you want me to tell you there's
idiots? And every group as I'm like,

549
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:28,730
all right there separate because
they're anti Israel. Jeez.

550
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,860
The idea that Israel has to go through
with Korea, it's just absolutely amazing.

551
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,570
But I get that online people
connect to everything, right.

552
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,170
That are really into the
nutty conspiracies. There's
a network of connections.

553
00:31:40,171 --> 00:31:42,400
So fall then if you're
not talking about it,

554
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,290
what they think is the
most important issue,

555
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,980
you're clearly being dishonest
because it's the most important issue.

556
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,640
Must be a shill.
Yes.

557
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,770
That time over there in Korea.
Interesting.

558
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,860
I did break American
[inaudible] over there,

559
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,310
North Korea. Hey, I wanted
to talk to you about this.

560
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:02,450
I don't know if you know
anything about it, but, um,

561
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,970
actually Google has pulled
the plug on Huawei today,

562
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,420
meaning they're no longer a allowing
android updates on waterway phones and

563
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:17,980
they're not allowing the Google app to
work on, on Walway phones or excuse me,

564
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,110
the g mail app to work on Walway phones.

565
00:32:20,111 --> 00:32:24,730
If you had an old Walway phone with the
Gmail App, you're fine. But going forward,

566
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,990
no walkway phones will be
allowed to have a Gmail anymore.

567
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:33,370
W what's the reasoning? It's a very
good question. Uh, Marcus Brownley,

568
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,150
who's Marcus has been on the show before
and he's probably one of my favorite,

569
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:42,140
if not my favorite, um, tech reviewer on
youtube. He, uh, had a point about it.

570
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,740
He, you know, he put it up on his Twitter
and then I followed the feed. He's like,

571
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:49,430
this is very important. And I followed
a fee and there's tech people,

572
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:53,660
they're saying there is no reason
for this. There's no evidence.

573
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,040
Did not point to anything.

574
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,400
But then when I talked to people that
are experts in foreign policy and they

575
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:02,900
explain the way China works and China's
relationship between the government and

576
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:06,380
industry, how they're inextricably
connected and the, Oh yes,

577
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,500
every business works for the
government. They were saying, well no,

578
00:33:09,501 --> 00:33:11,390
there's a reason why they're doing this.
Like this is the,

579
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,760
these guys are playing
in this real long game.

580
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:18,761
And to aid them in any way is
extraordinarily bad for our country.

581
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:23,120
Yeah. I had a Marian Smith when these,
you know, communism on my show and uh,

582
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,150
since my focus in North Korea, I
wasn't that much flux in China. And He,

583
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:28,220
and we all think in the West that,
you know,

584
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:31,010
China has gotten so much better than
it was, which is true, but he goes,

585
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:34,370
it's still really, really,
really bad. And one of the big,

586
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:38,300
I think fair criticisms or the corporate
press is how much their po focused on

587
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:41,150
Putin and Russia.
And it's like you calling him a dictator.

588
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:44,960
The shit they're pulling in China is an
order of magnitude worse and something

589
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:47,300
that they're doing now they
stole from North Korea.

590
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,330
North Korea has a southern called Sung
button and everyone on been s o n g B

591
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,750
when Sung won,

592
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,740
everyone in North Korea got interviewed
and there are several iterations of this

593
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,140
and you've got a score
based on your family.

594
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,000
So if you are family was born in
South Korea or a priest or land owner,

595
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,830
that's a low score.
If you,

596
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,760
your grandfather fought with the great
leader Kim Il Sung, that's a high score.

597
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,010
It's divided into favored class,

598
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,270
wavering and hostile and there's like
51 sub categories and this determines

599
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,340
everything about your life,
where you live,

600
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,490
where you go to college and is
China's now starting to do this.

601
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,300
They're trying to implement a social
credit system based on your loyalty to the

602
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,050
government,

603
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,140
which will allow things like leaving
the country and all sorts of other

604
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:33,680
opportunities and that's scary,
scary stuff and that's what needs to be,

605
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,060
I think covered much more in the west.

606
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,780
The problem with that as it becomes like
a game and people are going to want to

607
00:34:38,781 --> 00:34:40,860
have a really high school.
Of course that's,

608
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,200
people are so weird when it comes
to score in games, but we get,

609
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:48,920
so you have to have a high score or else
you're not getting food. That's our job.

610
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,310
Right, right, right. Yeah. But
it's also like people covet it. Oh,

611
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:55,580
but they don't tell your score. Oh
Geez. You have to intimate it. Oh yeah.

612
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:58,010
It's scary. Oh yeah. Yeah.
So you got to fly. Right.

613
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:02,600
And so you're always nervous euro. That's
what they want. You're always nervous.

614
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,250
It's not a transparency
self-censoring as well. Yes.

615
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,660
It forces a system of self
censoring. Like Twitter. Yes.

616
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,690
Are you saying that Twitter is like China?

617
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,880
Did you just say that Twitter's like
communism, those words? Yes. No,

618
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,330
we've got a ways to go for communism,

619
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:24,650
but some of the techniques they use are
very disturbingly totalitarian. Yes.

620
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:27,350
Disturbingly. So. And the other thing
is yes, they are a private company.

621
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,320
It's funny how the left is like,
as soon as you criticized Twitter,

622
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:32,630
they're private company. They can do
they want, but any other private company,

623
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,420
whatever it,
a private company can be criticized.

624
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,010
And if you know you're were perfectly

625
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:42,270
appropriate in a free market to say what
you're doing is screwed up and give us

626
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:44,040
answers or we're going
to use another company.

627
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,080
I think when I talked to Jack about this,

628
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:49,440
one of the things that he was saying is
that they're considering an open Twitter,

629
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,040
like they're going to have Twitter
where it's like a safe neighborhood and

630
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:56,520
Twitter where it's like the wild west.
Okay. And I said please do that. Yeah.

631
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,360
I said please do that. You know, I
mean if he does is to block people,

632
00:36:00,361 --> 00:36:03,060
there's ways to avoid people. Black
people liberally. You know, it's weird.

633
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:06,300
They'll block lists when you never
even had an interaction with someone.

634
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:09,510
It's like a black list. Yeah. And you
go to their page and their blocked,

635
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,270
you're just blocked.
Just [inaudible] reasons.

636
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,640
People have block lists for anyone
who follows president Trump. Yeah.

637
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,340
And it's like if I'm a journalist,
yeah.

638
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,520
I sure as hell better be falling the
fucking precedent right now. He's saying,

639
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,160
first of all, he says hilarious shit.
Yes. On the reg. Look, he does do.

640
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:29,760
What's your favorite Trump tweet? Rocket
Man, when he was calling my favorite one.

641
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:34,320
Hold on, Jim. John Own Rocky man. What's
the one about the haters and the losers?

642
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:36,450
Yes, that's a great one. But he
did that before he was president.

643
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,530
It was like 2013 it's still my
favorite Trump tweet by far. Oh yeah.

644
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,380
Every time I speak of
the haters and losers,

645
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,240
I do so with great love and affection.

646
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,210
They cannot help the fact
that they were born fucked up.

647
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,480
I would like if he said
that now as president.

648
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,450
I know that's one thing he's really doing.
Done a great job as president,

649
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:56,850
not swearing. Yeah, it's amazing. Well,

650
00:36:56,851 --> 00:37:00,840
did you see what CNN did to him
during the campaign? He said, boy,

651
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:03,600
that's really up.
So he didn't say it.

652
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:07,160
They played the clip that they believed
him. Yes. We talked about this before.

653
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,950
Yeah. It's very dishonest. Yeah.

654
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,140
They bleeped it to make it look like
he said something that he didn't did,

655
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,260
but he's cursing blue streak in the
White House. Anyway, we all know this,

656
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,770
but it's funny. I liked it. I think
that part is funny, like I'm not,

657
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,140
I'm not happy with a
lot of what's going on,

658
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,860
but I'm very happy that
he's this ridiculous person.

659
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,630
I think it's funny and I think it's very
healthy for us to have less reverence

660
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,420
for the president because when
a precedence on a pedestal,

661
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,150
he's in a position to send
our sons and daughters to die.

662
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,480
Whereas if you look at him as a clown,
you're going to be much less,

663
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,650
more skeptical of, is this man
going to war for the right reasons?

664
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,230
Is he doing these things for the right
reasons? And I think that's very,

665
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,760
and that's what the
founding fathers wanted to,

666
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:50,580
they didn't want the president
to be looked at as a god. Yeah,

667
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:54,540
that's an interesting point that I think
you're correct and I think this idea

668
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:58,020
that it's behavior unfitting for a
president, that's what we're thinking,

669
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:00,990
that a president is a special person,
very special job,

670
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,890
and they'll act accordingly like a
gentleman. And they're human beings.

671
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,500
It's a stupid job.
It's a ridiculous job for anyone.

672
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:11,320
You saw Biden went after Trump and says,
oh, being presidential is always, yeah,

673
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:14,460
by definition he's always
being presidential cause
he's the fucking president

674
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:18,430
and you're not well Biden's a weird guy.
Do you see all this videos?

675
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,600
Him Sniffing those kids?
Oh, what is that about?

676
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,060
I mean it could just
be a sweet old grandpa,

677
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,580
but switch some sweet old GRANDPA's
don't want to fuck kids. They do do that.

678
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,060
The thing is it would in a sense be
make more sense to people if he was just

679
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,460
like Hanzi right. It's like okay,
you're all right. Right. This is like,

680
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:39,490
I don't even know where to put this.
Right. Where do you put sniffing? Yeah,

681
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,720
it's so fucking weird thing.
He's just a weird guy.

682
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,420
Did you know about um,
the,

683
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,200
the plagiarism from back when he was
running for president? He ran three times.

684
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,340
Yeah. I think he's fucked in the primary
because his track record is pathetic.

685
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:58,060
So the first time you ran was an 88
cycle, right? He announced this in July.

686
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:01,840
He has to fold by September cause
this plagiarism scandal, right.

687
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,370
He runs again in oh eight comes in
like what sixth in Iowa has to pull.

688
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,850
So he, in terms of his history of
running for presidency, it's been very,

689
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:13,510
very poor. He's a good backup man. He's
like right, right. Cause you steady,

690
00:39:13,511 --> 00:39:17,120
reliable results. Yeah. Stay
the fuck out this look it's,

691
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,270
they're going to eat him alive.
It's ugly. It's going to be ugly.

692
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:21,430
You're going to hate it bro. And you're
not going to win. They're getting the,

693
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,080
I don't think he's going
to raise the front runner.

694
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,010
And you look at the democratic polls in
terms of the Democrats who was a fun run

695
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:30,470
or at this point in 2003 Oh Joe Lieberman.
Ah,

696
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,680
because he was the vice presidential
candidate from Gore. You,

697
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,920
everyone knew his name. What happened
with that guy? He lost and he reads.

698
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,410
He went right, didn't he? He, he lost
the primary in his State of Connecticut.

699
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,840
Then he ran as an independent
Democrat one again, I got elected,

700
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,160
he killed universal health care cause
they needed 60 votes and he's like,

701
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,900
fuck you, we're not doing it. So they
had to have this Obamacare market system.

702
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:56,650
It's because of him and
now everyone hates him.

703
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,730
Didn't he turn it into a Republican
though? No. No. But he endorsed the,

704
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,560
became a Nazi [inaudible] Joe Lieberman,
Joe Lieberman,

705
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:09,250
invention peer or Nazis.
Yet God sees the new, right.

706
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,820
Yeah.
The fact that he gets called one,

707
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:16,420
that's the funniest shit ever while I
was wearing a Yamaka people calling them

708
00:40:16,421 --> 00:40:20,950
or not. So that you'd never
suspected. Yeah. Sneaky. We're sneaky.

709
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,860
I just think if we had to
design a system from scratch,

710
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:31,120
there's no way we'd have one person
at the top of the pyramid. Right.

711
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:34,410
Doesn't make any sense. It doesn't
need to be a pyramid. Yeah. Doesn't,

712
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:39,280
it could be a series of silos.
Yeah. No reason. I mean,

713
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:44,200
I guess the good thing would be that
person can veto stuff and get things done.

714
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,810
So if there is some sort of,

715
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,210
if he's a reasonable person and he
really works well with those and doesn't

716
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:52,900
abuse that power, one
thing he has done, those,

717
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,280
the what I mean, I'm just going
to sound ridiculous, but when he,

718
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,620
as Kim Kardashian bring in cases of
people that were unjustly prosecuted,

719
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:06,970
are unjustly imprisoned and he releases
them. I liked that. I liked it.

720
00:41:06,971 --> 00:41:10,450
She does it and I liked that. He does.
It takes a lot for me to get angry.

721
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,430
But when people were clowning
them and I'm like Kim Kardashian,

722
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,830
you can say a lot of shit about her.
She saved people's lives.

723
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,900
She's helping people in a tremendous way.

724
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,620
You're going to tell those families
that Kim Kardashian is, fuck you.

725
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:27,790
She's helped 17 people be released
from prison in the last three months.

726
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,640
And I think it's also
very disturbing how Glib,

727
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:34,310
a lot of people are about
prison and it's a really,

728
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,530
I don't know what it's like and I
don't want to know what it's like.

729
00:41:36,531 --> 00:41:38,110
You don't want, it's no joke. Yeah.

730
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,740
But it is a punchline and it's like
you're laughing about people being

731
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:46,650
traumatized for life and possibly
having no possibility of returning into

732
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,170
society if this is,

733
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,890
people used to be able to laugh about
stuff like that cause it would be like

734
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:55,520
laughing at work, you know, you
go to work and you're like, hey,

735
00:41:55,521 --> 00:42:00,110
oh Jay's in the can and he's going to
take it into care and you would go to work

736
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,360
and you'd say something stupid like
that and it wouldn't go anywhere.

737
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,890
But when you say something like that
on Twitter or Facebook like oh boy,

738
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:10,880
you remember. Um, I mean people find
out and you say the inappropriate thing.

739
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:13,640
You remember that with
Justine sacco south.

740
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,450
I was flying here for this show and
someone tweet at me Hashtag has malice

741
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:21,490
landed yet because that was
the Hashtag for her. Oh yeah.

742
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,730
Cause she tweeted out a joke.

743
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,110
She gets out of flight and it blew up
while she was on the flight and when she

744
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,400
lands where life is going
down for a dumb joke.

745
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,490
Yeah. That jump, Joe could have been
something that you would just say.

746
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,670
And then the next day be like,
oh, the fuck is wrong with me.

747
00:42:37,671 --> 00:42:40,580
I was on Ambien and alcohol
and trying to be funny.

748
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,170
And that is something that the
evangelical left is very scary about,

749
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,750
about being,
about if you're tea,

750
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:49,820
if you take a joke and that's
inappropriate in some sense,

751
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:52,400
and they're the ones judging, it's
inappropriate. Your life should be ruined.

752
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,410
That is crazy. And a totalitarian. Yeah,

753
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,120
it's um,
it's also,

754
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,160
it smacks of deep insecurity and fear
that you experienced personally and you

755
00:43:04,821 --> 00:43:06,110
want to turn it on other people.

756
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,900
The same feeling that people
have when they're bullies.

757
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,590
The reason why someone's a bully is almost
always because they're not confident

758
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:13,401
of their own abilities.

759
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:17,450
So they want to somehow or another
by being cruel to someone else,

760
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:22,451
they exercised this power on someone
else and it's somehow or another relieves

761
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:27,860
them of a certain portion
of this inadequacy. They
feel the stress they feel.

762
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,700
That's why one of the reasons why a
lot of people are saying that bullies,

763
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,120
contrary to like what would
think would be a logical thing.

764
00:43:35,121 --> 00:43:37,130
You should teach them how
to fight and they wouldn't,

765
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:38,390
they wouldn't want to do this.

766
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,020
The reason why they're doing this
to people's cause, they're insecure.

767
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,710
And that's the same thing
I think when you're,

768
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,920
when you see these Twitter moms
and people at attacking people,

769
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:49,400
the thing they fear most is that
they're going to be attack themselves.

770
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:52,450
The thing that they feel,
what they feel, social ops,

771
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,150
they fear social ostracization the fee.

772
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,280
They fear that the theory being standing
up on their own two feet and being an

773
00:43:58,281 --> 00:43:59,114
individual.

774
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,480
And I have a whole chapter on dark humor
in this book and I was shocked that

775
00:44:02,481 --> 00:44:06,990
they let me publish it because Bobby
McFarland, great comedian, she has, she,

776
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,690
she was roasting Jim Norton and she
says to him, uh, your show is selling,

777
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:14,450
listen to bubble. I'd rather hear
my daughter drowning. And it's like,

778
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,120
are you going to 12 it?
But let's say let's break this down.

779
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,260
Are you going to tell her as a comedian
or as a mom that that's not appropriate?

780
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,650
She, so far they only made me cut one
joke. I have everything else in there.

781
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:27,590
And the point I make is something
might not be funny for you if you're an

782
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:31,450
assault victim. Right. You don't
want to kind of thought that's right,

783
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,100
but it's not,

784
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,850
that means something's not
for you. Doesn't mean it's
not for anyone. What is, uh,

785
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,640
the new, right? This is the,
the title of your book. Yeah.

786
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,620
A journey to the fringe of American
politics. What, what inspired you? Uh,

787
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,760
so the circles I was swimming in started
going into developing to the scene as

788
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:52,830
it was happening that culminated in like
the Trump presidency in Charlottesville.

789
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:54,540
So I was there as this was happening.

790
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,100
What circles we discussing this kind
of the anarchist circles, the, the uh,

791
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,370
what they call 'em race realism,
the racist, you know, uh,

792
00:45:02,371 --> 00:45:05,910
the alt right and seeing
a lot of it happening.

793
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,340
Just being discussed in the press and
people not knowing what they're talking

794
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:09,420
about. I'm like, all right,

795
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:12,920
someone's got to write this book who's
been there and understands it and it

796
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,380
might as well be, how do you
understand it? Like what, what,

797
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,650
what about at doing the race
realist? Because I, the,

798
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,740
one of the points I make is this is not
one scene where everyone's in agreement.

799
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,040
These people often completely
hate each other and disagree.

800
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:29,760
The only thing that unites them is
there opposition to progressivism.

801
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,050
And this is you looking at this as a
journalist when you say, sure. Yeah.

802
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,820
With the way you're saying it is like
you're a part of these groups. Well,

803
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:39,090
I was the, I, I, I'm like, all right,
I went to all the meetings, you know,

804
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:42,900
I'd go to Charlottesville and interviewed
all the types I had. I, you know,

805
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:45,810
and it's what their points of view are.

806
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,380
And if you're gonna engage
with this kind of thinking,

807
00:45:49,381 --> 00:45:51,570
which is somewhat
prevalent on the fringes,

808
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,900
you have to at least understand where
they're coming from and being dismissive.

809
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:57,250
And that gets a power for sure.
But what I want to say is,

810
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:02,130
cause I don't want people to misconstrue
you so someone could listen to this and

811
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,140
inadvertently misscans or
purposely misconstrue and
think that you're a part of

812
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,490
these groups. Oh No, no. So it's very
clear in this book who I agree with that.

813
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,510
Absolutely. Yeah. In the book,

814
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:15,840
but the way we're discussing
it in this conversation,

815
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:17,910
you're saying the circles that you run in.
Yeah.

816
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:20,520
Cause a lot of the people who I was
friends with fell down this rabbit hole.

817
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,900
They fell down the rabbit
hole of Nazi-ism racism. Yes.

818
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,630
And that's who you were friends with
fell down. I'm not naming. Yeah, because,

819
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:32,070
and it was very disturbing them
in real life. Correct. Wow.

820
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:36,360
And it was very disturbing to watch as
they start throwing our terms like HPD

821
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:40,920
and Rx, human biodiversity, that's their
code word for different races. Right.

822
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:45,470
Schuman, biodiversity is the code
word for different races. Yes.

823
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,260
And what's the other one?
HBS and NRX anorexia reaction.

824
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:52,950
So this is basically a,
America has this decadent,

825
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,280
why my republic and we need to
return to like hardcore, right.

826
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,480
Euro reaction. Neo, neo,
neo, neo reaction. That's,

827
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:03,270
that was the Hashtag before was the
outright, it's not the same buddy.

828
00:47:03,271 --> 00:47:08,220
They similar enough. So, and a lot
of these guys are really cerebral.

829
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,500
You know, they could tell you
about the history of England.

830
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:14,930
They could tell you about, you know, all
the science and Swat went wrong. Uh, with,

831
00:47:14,931 --> 00:47:18,450
with, with whom? With them. I,
I don't know what went wrong.

832
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,080
I think one of the things that goes
wrong is when no one's talking to you and

833
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:23,400
you're just talking to each other,

834
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:26,730
you're going to start doubling down
because there's no one hitting the brakes.

835
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,310
You know what else happens, what
you say controversial things. People

836
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,830
attack you and then some
people don't attack you.

837
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:35,950
They support you and then you gravitate
towards those people that support you.

838
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:39,280
Right? And then you get that endorphin
rush. You Get the light. Yes.

839
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:43,390
You start seeing that with people and
they started embracing really weird fringe

840
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:45,640
ideas.
They become a part of these fringe groups.

841
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:48,730
They get praised by these fringe
groups and then the elevate to,

842
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:51,920
to virtue signal for that fringe group.
And so at a,

843
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:56,050
you could be either an average person
in the mass or you could be a leader in

844
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:56,680
the fringe.

845
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,670
So it's a big fish in a small pond and
you can be one of those who knows one of

846
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:03,520
those who knows, right. People
know what the fuck is going on.

847
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:05,680
So not going to get me with the scam.

848
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,100
So my line is you take one red
pill but not the whole bottle.

849
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,670
You take the Adderall Bro, the
fucking Adderall. No one's going to,

850
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,620
I know what's happening.
Start stashing weapons in your backyard.

851
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:22,510
Prepping. Yeah. Yeah. It's an interesting,

852
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:24,700
and there's also a long
history of this stuff.

853
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,490
So how did you know those guys in real
life? Did you know them from work?

854
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:31,280
Did you know from like uh, like
Antarctica circles? So yeah,

855
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,800
this anarchy thing. Like how
serious are you about that? 100%.

856
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,690
100% serious. So anarchists think
there should be no cops. No, Eric is,

857
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:43,810
don't think they should be government
cops. They should be private security. Oh,

858
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:47,240
private security for what?
Well, same thing you,

859
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,280
no one wants to have a scenario.
Like if you go to a bar,

860
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,980
you're not paying for the
doorman or if go into a hotel,

861
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:55,000
you're not paying for the security.

862
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,150
The point is whoever has an environment
wants it to be as safe as possible for

863
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:02,860
stop right there. Okay. Cause if you go
into a bar, if you're buying a drink,

864
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,320
the bar is taking some of the money from
that drink to pay for that security.

865
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:10,540
Correct. It's the same thing as you paying
taxes. It's not the same thing as you.

866
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:13,210
Pink texts. Let's just look at it
this way. It's just money into a pool.

867
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,870
It's not just money. Please. If
you throw the money into a pool,

868
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,930
but do you need me to, let me
explain. Okay. If you throw
the money into the pool.

869
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,890
Okay. And the obviously taxes get taken
from you. It's different in that regard.

870
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,990
But if you have a certain amount of money,

871
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,590
certain amount of money's going
to go to protecting the people.

872
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,280
And this is the idea of police force
and this is the idea of a bouncer or at

873
00:49:33,281 --> 00:49:36,790
least a bouncer is more likely acting
in the interest of the club share and

874
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,610
trying to keep out bad people and try
and keep people from getting sued.

875
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,450
But the money for the drinks goes to that.
Some of it,

876
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,340
a percentage of it goes to
that much like your tax money.

877
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:47,680
Some of it goes to the
cops. Sure. Right, correct.

878
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,040
But the big difference is one is
voluntary and one is forceful and one is a

879
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:57,940
monopoly and one isn't.
So if you had an a three system,

880
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,450
you would have more security because
the streets would have someone doing

881
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:05,800
security and the bar and the store and
there would be complimentary to each

882
00:50:05,801 --> 00:50:09,050
other as opposed to you only have to
dial nine one one wouldn't have it.

883
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,960
Look how many dating sites.
They're all right.

884
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,820
Wouldn't it be great if instead of one
number you had dozens of places that are

885
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:20,770
gonna offer you security. So like
private businesses that work like Uber,

886
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,930
you give him a call when you're getting
raped unless you press a button has

887
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:27,200
short one with the dude was we had on
you press a button and then someone shows

888
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:29,510
up. We have that now. We have now.

889
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:34,310
I mean if you go to an apartment
building or a business building,

890
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,660
there is going to be security
there already. You're not gonna,

891
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,780
you're not going to call the cops.
You're going to call the downstairs.

892
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,570
We'll just book readers. Sure. You're
sitting there playing with their phone.

893
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,540
They used to be book readers
to other phone players. Well,

894
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,640
I'd rather they be reading books than
shooting dogs. So that's where we are.

895
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,000
Right. I see what you're saying in
terms of that's the grossest shit ever.

896
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:53,420
When you see swat teams show up and
shoot people's dogs when people get,

897
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,500
and that's the problem with having a
monopoly is there's no consequences.

898
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,400
So let's say there's all these cases
where, you know, dogs get shot,

899
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,180
the flash grenade and the
baby's crib. Yeah. These
people aren't fight like a, um,

900
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:06,043
Eric Gardner,

901
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,230
the only person who got in trouble for
Eric Garner dying is the guy who filmed

902
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:10,310
it.
I mean,

903
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:15,340
if you are a cook and you are serving
food and you under cook chicken,

904
00:51:15,411 --> 00:51:19,730
it's a mistake, honest mistake and someone
gets sick. That shouldn't be your job.

905
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,250
But if you're a police officer often,

906
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,830
and I'm going to get a lot of heat
for this, and that's fine. Uh,

907
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:27,860
if you see something bad happens
as a consequences for actions,

908
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,220
there have to be consequences that
maybe this isn't the right job for you.

909
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,730
We'll oftentimes a ruse if they're sure
in inappropriate shooting or supplying

910
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:40,190
those lines. But I think you're right
and mean. I've experienced abusive cops.

911
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,280
I think we all have. And I also
think that it's very, very,

912
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:46,070
very difficult to be that guy.
Absolutely.

913
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,140
And not become abusive and
not become worn out by it,

914
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,640
not become extremely stressed out.
I'm a big supporter of police.

915
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,980
I just don't think that
it's a job for everybody.

916
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,100
I think being a cop is like
a lot of other jobs that are,

917
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,800
especially that one that's
super fucking difficult.

918
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:03,590
The idea that you just hire people off
the street and run them through some

919
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:07,400
tests and they're gonna make great
cops. I agree. It's crazy. I agree.

920
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:09,080
And then what happens is
when you're a monopoly,

921
00:52:09,081 --> 00:52:10,940
you don't have to be
efficient or effective.

922
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,980
I think they should hire former military.

923
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,070
That's what I think have that
at least they hire people, know,

924
00:52:16,071 --> 00:52:19,030
hire people that have disciplined,
hire people that,

925
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:23,060
that have gone through some
experience in actual combat,

926
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:27,380
who know how to handle pressure
better and then make it a very,

927
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:32,381
very valuable job and make it a very
like very strict codes of conduct and

928
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,690
behavior and action.

929
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,380
I think another problem that police
have in their defense is when you have

930
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:43,190
public streets, people uh, have
certain rights and they can act,

931
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:45,470
have where they were like, here in
la you have all these, these tents.

932
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:45,920
And I thought,

933
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,350
my understanding is the government
said you can't clear out those tents.

934
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:51,230
That is hilarious, isn't it? And
now the cops can't do anything.

935
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,510
So they are hamstrung for
being able to do their jobs.

936
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:55,790
Whereas if this was private, this
would not be happening. Well,

937
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,730
if you go under underpasses and La folks,
I don't know where you live,

938
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:02,960
but there's a fucking campground that
literally they have tents everywhere.

939
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,960
I went to see, I didn't know skid row
was an actual place. I didn't know.

940
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,830
I went there last time I was
here and they were, they,

941
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:11,720
the whole block is covered intense. Oh, it
was unbelievable. People who don't know,

942
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,160
uh, I love to take them to skid row.
It's just amazing. Downtown La is insane.

943
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,720
Like you go there and you're like, what
is this? Well, what this is, is failure.

944
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:23,450
This is failure. I mean, cultural failure,

945
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,280
failure to address these
members of our community.

946
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,420
Fair failure to provide health care,
failure to raise children correctly.

947
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,310
Failure to keep people from drugs,

948
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:35,610
failure to provide good systems
to get them off of drugs.

949
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,820
It started in New York to de Blasio.
Who's a real charmer that one.

950
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,700
Like now all you go
into every subway train,

951
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:44,760
there's a homeless person
with all their bags and this,

952
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,550
there's got to be better alternatives
than that. Even for them. Well,

953
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:48,241
there's somewhat,
oh,

954
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:52,050
Donald Trump jr posted videos all over
the news the other day when he was

955
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:55,400
talking about the de Blasio and he's
like, this is, I'm driving here. I'm,

956
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:58,980
LIZ is out my window and filming and
look good. Look at all these tents.

957
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:00,270
Like he look at all those homeless shit.

958
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,550
He started following me
on Twitter and now, uh,

959
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,140
I live in fear of like saying the
wrong thing again. I don't know.

960
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:10,020
It's just like holy shit because North
Korea is my biggest issue by far.

961
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:12,330
Right by far.
But what are you in fear of?

962
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:16,320
Like getting on followed by Donald
Trump Jr. Yeah. She ain't got long fall.

963
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:20,670
You well, he better not. No. I have
friends that are friends with him. Okay.

964
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,560
Like good friends, like my good friends
and they're good friends with him. Okay.

965
00:54:25,561 --> 00:54:27,600
I'll slide in. Tastes like
him. They say he's a good guy.

966
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,170
Just a slide into his dms. Do it so
weird. He's just in a weird position, man.

967
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:36,000
If he wasn't the, the president's son,
he wouldn't be under so much scrutiny.

968
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,760
You'd be like, oh, he's a great guy.
It's like everybody's just like, oh,

969
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:42,690
you're the president's son. But it's
weird for me, given that that was my beat,

970
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:45,960
that I'm like one step away from being
able to influence policy in that issue,

971
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,020
which is the most important
thing to me. But again, it, yeah.

972
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,440
What would you tell them
about North Korea? Uh, I mean,

973
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:54,120
I wouldn't even know where to start.
I would just,

974
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:57,300
I would think I'd have a
lot of information about
helping with the psychology,

975
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:02,390
how to kind of influence them, how to
basically, uh, manipulate them, uh,

976
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:06,750
also how evil they truly,
really and truly are.

977
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,570
I'd always to keep that in mind.
So it's a dance.

978
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:12,870
It's a very delicate dance with them.
Um,

979
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,170
do you think he's going to get
in trouble with Russia? Who,

980
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:19,200
which one don't Trump jr? Yeah. You think
he will? I don't know. I don't think so.

981
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,510
I don't think so. Yeah. Thing
anybody's, I think it's over.

982
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,140
I don't think it's Alpha. It's not, I
don't think it's over it because people,

983
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:28,290
if after three years of reporting now
you can say with a straight face what,

984
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:31,020
there were three years of reporting over
nothing. If there's smoke, there's fire,

985
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:35,070
you know, blah, blah, blah. So I
haven't been following it that closely.

986
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:36,690
I saw Justin Amash,
you know,

987
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:40,500
just tweeted out that he had this whole
tweet storm that he thinks Trump should

988
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:44,250
be impeached based on who was that? Justin
Amash is a congressman from Michigan.

989
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:49,260
He's uh, uh, uh, one of like
three libertarians and he turned,

990
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:50,910
he said, he's like, I
actually read the report,

991
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:54,350
which most people have not in Washington.
He'd hundred pages, is it? Yeah.

992
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,980
And he's like, I think this is, there's
stuff in here that's impeachable. Whoa,

993
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,170
this was a big deal. And then all
the left, we're like republic.

994
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,860
Even Republicans like Justin Amash is
like, no, no. It's just him. It's not,

995
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,070
there's no, like it's him. It's
literally just hit save him. Yeah.

996
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,110
There's only two like him.
It's Thomas it like them.

997
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,370
It's Thomas Massie and likely that's the
three of them. And Ran Paul for rand.

998
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,820
Paul's an interesting cat.
I like him. Well, I was, uh,

999
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,950
I want to talk to his neighbor that fucked
him up. Oh, that's such a bitch move.

1000
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,980
Don't be such a bitch.
That

1001
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,620
is such a bitch. Tackled him when he
wasn't even looking. I know. Yeah.

1002
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:30,250
I think he had earphones on to
it's, it's uh, uh, I'm gonna,

1003
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:33,280
I'm not sitting here like some Badass,
but come on. What the fuck are you doing?

1004
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,410
Yeah. How about that guy that
kicked Arnold Schwarzenegger? Yes.

1005
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:39,880
That was hilarious. He kicked this kid,
dropped, kicked Arnold towards the nigger.

1006
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:43,630
I think he was crazy. South Africa. He
was saying he was screaming out. Help me.

1007
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:46,150
I need a Lamborghini.
While they were arresting him,

1008
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:53,680
it was the bath salts. Worldstar
hip hop made it. He's on. Look,

1009
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:57,760
I mean, if that's what he want, look
what really happened to Arnold. Nothing.

1010
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:01,350
What's really gonna Happen to that kid?
Probably go to jail for a couple.

1011
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:04,650
Actually, I don't know. You don't know
South Africa. Look at, look at, uh,

1012
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,340
Ottawa beer in North Korea.
He steals a sign in and he's dead.

1013
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,890
So you don't know what the laws
like in South Africa could be.

1014
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,560
Think it's not as bad as North Korea.

1015
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,260
That's not a status North Korea
come on y'all. It's not a to guard.

1016
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:20,430
Fucked him up pretty well too. Then
it looked like it. Two seconds.

1017
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,670
Let's say if your, if your drop kicking
people out of nowhere. That's the problem.

1018
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,140
When I was talking to Eddie Izzard,

1019
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,940
Eddie ran a bunch of marathons
in South Africa. 20 was,

1020
00:57:30,941 --> 00:57:34,630
it was to sell to do,
it was a designation.

1021
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:38,890
It was the same numbers, the amount of
years that Nelson Mandela was in prison,

1022
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,760
social 27. Um, so he ran 27 marathons,

1023
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,830
but there was areas where they're like,
listen man,

1024
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,800
you ain't running through here like
this is this area we want to go to.

1025
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,270
We're going to take you,
I'm going to put you in a car.

1026
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,640
We're going to drive you
way the fuck past here.

1027
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,470
And then you keep running when
you're not running through here.

1028
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,160
Like you'll get killed, you'll get,
you'll get your gift Card Jack. This is,

1029
00:57:57,161 --> 00:58:01,420
we're all gonna get shot. You're not
going through here. And that's, you know,

1030
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:06,310
there's parts of the world that are
like that and on Swartz and Egor when he

1031
00:58:06,311 --> 00:58:08,320
visited South Africa,
what's the worst you've got?

1032
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,200
Drop kicked in with poor technique.
Okay.

1033
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,710
Want to say to the kid had no follow
through, right? Barely knocked a 71 year.

1034
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,800
First of all, even though Arnold
Sports Center, 71 years old,

1035
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:21,730
he's still a 71 year old Arnold's wards,
and of course he's still at tank,

1036
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:26,860
but I mean even fall over kid drop cam,
he didn't even know it was coming. Right.

1037
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:28,420
He gets hit in the middle of this guy

1038
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,250
and he's fine. It's kind of
impressive. I got your precedent.

1039
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:40,650
You do? What do you got? Ready? Okay.
What do you like best about me? Uh,

1040
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:44,920
get to fuck this up. I got this,
this system as Joe Rogan thing.

1041
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:48,040
That's like a thing of girl says to you,
right? She's about to trap you. What?

1042
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,090
That's the intellect. Your
personality. I like everything.

1043
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:55,950
This is the most Joe Rogan thing I've
ever found. What is it? Here you go. Well,

1044
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,110
we got here.
Take it.

1045
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,310
What is that?
It's a mini museum set.

1046
00:59:04,311 --> 00:59:09,130
It's got 29 different things from all
over the universe in Cayston. Lucite. Wow.

1047
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:13,410
That is fucking dope. Yeah. Wow.

1048
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,710
Got a piece of the White House.

1049
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:17,440
A piece of the Hollywood
sign is some Amazon water.

1050
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:22,450
A giant sloths claw. I think. Wow.

1051
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:26,960
Thank you. You are welcome to.
That'll go right fucking here. Yeah.

1052
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:31,630
Here's the book to tell Centrelink
about it. Thank you. Very cool. That's,

1053
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,540
where'd you find this?

1054
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,080
I want them one of my rabbit holes in
the Internet and I'm like, Holy Shit.

1055
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:40,430
This will be perfect. Gel Internet
rabbit holes. Oh, that's dope, dude.

1056
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:45,290
Thank you very much. Um, so you
get the velvet bag. Oh yeah. Oh,

1057
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:49,190
this is a bag for it. All the bag. I
feel like I needed to have it out though.

1058
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:53,720
The bag right here, I got mine
on display desk is so cluttered.

1059
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,360
This is a ridiculous to ever keep
saying I'm going to clean it up.

1060
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:02,060
It's not going to happen. Yeah. So tell
me more about your book and why you,

1061
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:06,290
why you breaking. Um, these buildings.
Is that, that's a dog whistle.

1062
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:07,790
That's a dog was to cover.

1063
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:12,670
So there's a guy named Ben Garrison and
he was a regular conservative artist.

1064
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:16,340
Right. And he would have drawings about
like Ben Bernanki or Hillary or whatever.

1065
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,370
The Nazis took his art,

1066
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,280
replaced all of his drawings with Jews.

1067
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:24,920
So instead of the great
wizard or debt being the Fed,

1068
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:27,410
it was a Jewish caricature
and they did it perfectly.

1069
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,630
And they also invented this
whole backstory about him
that he was this closet

1070
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:35,480
Nazi and this poor guy in Montana, if
you Google him, it's like not to end.

1071
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:38,600
He's like, why is this happening to
me? And the Photoshop work is perfect.

1072
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,240
So eventually they
calmed down and you know,

1073
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:43,760
he now he's kind of like a regular
cartoonist and the story got out.

1074
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,340
But that's his artwork.
So the people that,

1075
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:49,130
this poor guy who is talking
about a victim of Nazis,

1076
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,810
it's very rare nowadays to have a new
victim of Nazis and he's actually one of

1077
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:56,610
them. Well, meme culture is
very strange, right? Yes.

1078
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:00,740
And those little humorous images
that get chucked around. Oh yeah.

1079
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:04,980
There's a lot of dirt bags that have
really profited off of other people's meme

1080
01:01:04,981 --> 01:01:09,080
work to my, like my friend
Don, he's terrible. He works,
he works for a meme site.

1081
01:01:09,081 --> 01:01:12,020
Yeah, sorry, I'll turn it
back. Those sites are bad, man.

1082
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:15,950
Some of them just flat out steal and
some of them steal and then they'll

1083
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:18,170
attribute, yeah. Somewhere.

1084
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:22,130
Like they'll just say your name and
sometimes they don't even say your name.

1085
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:24,830
They say unnamed of like a fake account.

1086
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,350
That doesn't even just it
just attributed to someone.

1087
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:30,110
Oh we thought we got it from that
person because they know that it's at a

1088
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,430
hundred different accounts cause a bunch
of people have this guy's like you,

1089
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,890
you'll find something and you're like,
oh this is funny and you put it up.

1090
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:41,360
But then these people that they make
these giant sites with all other people's

1091
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:45,690
work and they curate them and they make
millions. Yep. Like the fat Jewish. Yeah.

1092
01:01:45,691 --> 01:01:47,600
Oh yeah. Everyone hates him. Yeah. This,

1093
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:50,720
this is one of this is like one of your
big issues with like people who like

1094
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:52,250
take content and basically it'd be,

1095
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,550
it'd be appropriate for themselves
first for sure would stand up comedy.

1096
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:59,100
But the thing that's happening
with memes is like you're, you,

1097
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,890
if someone sends you something,

1098
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:04,880
like there's a bunch of things that my
f like Eddie Bravo sends me hilarious

1099
01:02:04,881 --> 01:02:05,750
ones all the time.

1100
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,500
He'll send me a funny meme and then I'll
send it to Brendan shop and like I'm

1101
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:12,350
not asking who made that
mean. Right. So it's a joke.

1102
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,690
Brendan doesn't think
that I made it myself.

1103
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,340
So it's not like I'm stealing that joke,

1104
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,620
but I'm definitely not
crediting the original creator
cause I don't know who the

1105
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:19,980
fuck it

1106
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,490
is. Right. And those things
fly around, they flyer out. So,

1107
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:27,240
but that's all with in good faith.

1108
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,410
The person was in bad faith,
right.

1109
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:32,580
Curates a website and then
starts profiting off of it.

1110
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:36,630
They find a loophole and then they make
deals with comedy central and they also

1111
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:41,520
have people who actually steal standups
bits and turn those bits in the memes

1112
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:45,690
and they put those bits on there, their
meme pages and they do the same shit.

1113
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:50,040
They'll do it. They just, their content
needers they need content. They're whores.

1114
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:53,980
Parasites. Yes. So they just,
they'll hire people to do it. They,

1115
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:56,220
they in the people that they hire,
they'll,

1116
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,820
they'll steal people's jokes and
tournament into memes. I mean it's real.

1117
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:00,610
It's a real problem.

1118
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,630
That's, that's, that's, I
mean, that's like become a
joke because people were like,

1119
01:03:04,631 --> 01:03:08,200
oh, this is a rare pepe. Right. As cause
like please save it. It's just like,

1120
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,050
you know, even though you can
replicate it into the lab,

1121
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,820
a lawsuit lawsuits going on, right.
I talk about that in there. Oh No.

1122
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,850
The new one that's happening right now,
Alex Jones refused to,

1123
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:20,050
he refused to settle out of court.
So they're going to go to court.

1124
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,150
They're going to figure out whether or
not peppy can, you can use pepe the frog.

1125
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:29,040
But I mean, I talk about this
in the context of, it's like,

1126
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:33,270
can you Andy Warhol use a Campbell soup
can. It's the same thing. It's like, it's,

1127
01:03:33,271 --> 01:03:35,860
yeah, someone creates it. But
if someone is using it in it,

1128
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,100
kind of a broader satirical context,
what it doesn't though,

1129
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:42,010
because Andy probably couldn't
do that today. Yes, he could.

1130
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:45,850
I think that assume if you tried to
make a lot of money off of Campbell soup

1131
01:03:45,851 --> 01:03:50,290
cans, corporations had more power
back then unless, uh, accountability.

1132
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:53,220
Because now with social media, if I want
to lose their minds on Campbell's, right.

1133
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:56,140
That's true. That's a
good point. I think that,

1134
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,750
do you know what they did with
Campbell's did when he did this,

1135
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,560
he paints all 40 flavors of soup cans,
right? Puts them up in a gallery.

1136
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:05,380
Campbell's is like, what the fuck is this?
Like they didn't know what to do. Right.

1137
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:07,150
And they didn't know who to call it.
This is unprecedented.

1138
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:10,900
So they had a storefront and they
had the cans out the window. They go,

1139
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:13,660
why pay a hundred grand?
You could get a here for a dollar.

1140
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,720
So they tried to own it in their
own way. That's smart. That's smart.

1141
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,590
Great advertising for them. Yeah.
I mean gigantic advertising.

1142
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,380
But that's the other thing is like with
this meme culture, people like, oh,

1143
01:04:23,381 --> 01:04:26,680
pepe means white supremacy.
It's like you can't,

1144
01:04:26,681 --> 01:04:29,170
Campbell's doesn't say what
a Campbell soup can means.

1145
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,060
Different things mean this is not news.

1146
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:33,070
Different things mean different
things to different people.

1147
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,200
And if you're using it in one context
doesn't mean other contexts aren't

1148
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:39,010
legitimate. That's how
art and images work. Yeah.

1149
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,640
I mean that's almost like what happened
with the guy in Montana, right?

1150
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:44,860
He takes his work and then turns into
Nazi stuff and then all the sudden he

1151
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:48,070
becomes a Nazi. Right. And that's what
they do with it. With pepe the frog.

1152
01:04:48,071 --> 01:04:51,640
Cause that guy who met here.
Yeah. Oh he's so upset. I know.

1153
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:54,460
Cause he know what they did to him log.
Do you know if they did to him?

1154
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,200
He had a cartoon where he killed peppy.
So all the trolls are like,

1155
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,730
oh that's interesting.

1156
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:05,410
So they took all his other characters
and made them full blow Nazis.

1157
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:07,580
So Heinrich,
who's the wolf,

1158
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,800
instead of having reflections in a
sunglasses had the SS, they're like,

1159
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:14,370
oh you want to, you want to throw
it out, we'll throw down asshole.

1160
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:16,280
And that's what ended up happening to him.

1161
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:20,360
Wolf has a name already now they gave
him the last name. It's like Heinrich,

1162
01:05:20,361 --> 01:05:24,460
something else. But that name,
I'll tell you what. Oh my
God, I, no, no, no. This is,

1163
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,170
what do they call it? That's a Nazi
wolf. Sounds like a Nazi war navy. They,

1164
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,140
what was the guy's hilarious that he
thought he could just kill it off.

1165
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,270
That's like d platforming. He thought
he was going to d platform. Pepe.

1166
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,120
Let's also like,

1167
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:39,400
let's suppose I decided to kill off
Paul Bunyan put the fuck are you,

1168
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,250
how does that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.

1169
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:44,290
Like the idea that he's going to
kill it off and they're going to say,

1170
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,460
oh well we killed the dog.
His name was originally land wolf,

1171
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:49,451
so they said,
oh,

1172
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:53,490
his first name is Heinrich land wolf
and the you pull it up and the glass as

1173
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:55,270
well. Maybe we shouldn't have that
assessed the damage right here,

1174
01:05:55,271 --> 01:05:57,820
but land wolf as opposed to sky wars.

1175
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,410
Fuck does that mean, the funny
thing is about pepe? It was,

1176
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:07,090
it was always so bland in lame.
Well I think for,

1177
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:11,740
it was adopted as a meme. Like when
you see like feels bad man, right?

1178
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:15,250
Like it was like, Whoa, this is
so low. Blood sugar bothers me.

1179
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,060
But it's also the idea of, you're
saying that because Nazis are using it,

1180
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:20,800
you can't use it as feels bad man.

1181
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,670
Like if you're giving it okay symbol
and they're using it this way,

1182
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:27,430
you can't say, oh that's
okay as make any sense. Yeah.

1183
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:30,850
You can't say something to me. I
go, okay my mouse if I do that,

1184
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,270
that's white supremacy. No, everybody.

1185
01:06:34,271 --> 01:06:38,230
For years I had a whole series on my
Instagram page of people doing the okay

1186
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:42,610
sign. Of course, including me back
when I had earrings, it was radio days.

1187
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:46,930
Bill Cosby doing the okay symbol.
It's fucking, come on man.

1188
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:49,480
You guys know this is not,
that's not what this is.

1189
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,450
Just because people are using it and
saying it is. And they were investigating.

1190
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:55,030
People were investigating people.
There was a guy who is on television,

1191
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,300
they blurt it out.
Yeah.

1192
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,140
And the other thing is we're at a point
now where it's more easy to give the

1193
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:04,660
finger to someone than to say,
okay,

1194
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:08,380
yeah cause you blur the finger out and
nobody cares. But if you do that like, oh,

1195
01:07:08,381 --> 01:07:10,810
what is he doing?
He's touching his fingers.

1196
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:13,870
You can't even do like you're holding
a joint cause that's like a white power

1197
01:07:13,871 --> 01:07:18,490
giant. Like if you're like doing
that like a roach, that's bad.

1198
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:21,730
That's bad. How do you, do
you have to use a roach clip?

1199
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,490
It's a ploy by the roach clip industry.
But there's, I have a list in their world,

1200
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:31,120
the things that are called racist milk
show dinosaurs milk become racist.

1201
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,690
Oh cause the,
the what the trolls do is they make it,

1202
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,690
let's see if we get them freaking out
about milk and they got it. Picnics.

1203
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,780
My favorite one the trolls did was the
free bleeding movement. I'm like God,

1204
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,730
that's the greatest thing that people
who've ever accomplished that they

1205
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:49,030
actually got women. No, no,
no, no. You're, there's two
things. You're confusing.

1206
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,640
Two things.
The free bleeding was a woman who made it,

1207
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:54,940
but there was the pee on yourself
and there was no free bleeding.

1208
01:07:54,941 --> 01:07:59,380
Was a four Chan Chantrel no, it was
the girl running a race cause she was,

1209
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:00,460
she was actually smart about it.

1210
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:03,970
She said this is to create awareness
toward women in third world countries who

1211
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:06,340
don't have access to
sanitary pads. I, yeah,

1212
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:11,470
I was reading a whole
article on the four Chan,

1213
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,500
the creating the free bleeding
movement. Okay. I could be wrong.

1214
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,980
See if he could pull that out.
I

1215
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,430
know there was a legitimate
example of the free bleeding. Yeah,

1216
01:08:18,431 --> 01:08:23,060
I think that was post that on putting it
up. They've done a few things like that.

1217
01:08:23,061 --> 01:08:26,270
They all said, pee on yourself
to fight rape. Oh, I heard.

1218
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:28,820
Because that's one of the big
arguments that to fight a rapist,

1219
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,980
that you're actually in that situation,
pee on yourself,

1220
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:33,560
that'll turn them away and it's like you
shouldn't give people advice. It's like,

1221
01:08:33,561 --> 01:08:35,390
listen,
if she's actually getting assaulted,

1222
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,580
what should she do in that
horrible circumstance?

1223
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:40,880
And then it's like pee on yourself to
show your support for victims sexual

1224
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:41,241
assault.

1225
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:44,810
Wasn't there a senator or somewhere that
actually said that if it's a legitimate

1226
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:49,040
reason that's in there, and Todd Aiken,
Todd Akin was run, this is amazing.

1227
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:53,960
Todd Akin was running for
Senate in Missouri and he's
prolife and they asked him

1228
01:08:53,961 --> 01:08:58,880
a very common question for
life people. What about if
it's rape? And he goes, well,

1229
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:03,470
that's very rare. And it
goes, but my understanding is
a, if a woman is assaulted,

1230
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:05,090
the body has a way of shutting it down.

1231
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,050
Now there's a book called sperm
wars and apparently an, again,

1232
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:11,060
I'm crazy scientists don't get mad at me.

1233
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:14,960
Didn't work. That's the book's not legit.
Is that true? No, no. It's been disputed.

1234
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,460
It's been debunked. Okay, thank you.

1235
01:09:16,461 --> 01:09:21,461
Is there is no evidence that sperm
acts as anything other than sperm that

1236
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,320
attacks the egg and tries to get up

1237
01:09:23,340 --> 01:09:25,240
pregnant. The claiming that book, Yeah.

1238
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,370
Is that rape is more likely to result
in pregnancy than regular intercourse.

1239
01:09:29,371 --> 01:09:33,690
The point is, he got red out of town
on a rail, uh, and then Reza Aslan,

1240
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:38,100
who said on Twitter, you know
what? I hope he gets raped.

1241
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,860
And if you take his
comment out of context,

1242
01:09:40,861 --> 01:09:44,160
it's very disturbing and it's
kind of disturbing in context.

1243
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:48,270
But Rez response being like, this is
a response to you being like, yeah,

1244
01:09:48,330 --> 01:09:49,710
you've got raped or not
going to get pregnant.

1245
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:52,140
And he got the new right one after him,

1246
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:55,860
Reza and got him fired
from CNN years later.

1247
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:58,860
Is that what he got fired from?
He also called the present and a shithead.

1248
01:09:59,250 --> 01:09:59,791
So they're like,

1249
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,160
they use that and they use the
other tweet and they gave it to him.

1250
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:05,200
What's free, really free
bleeding stuff has been online.

1251
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:08,430
There's an article I
found from 2004 Oh crap.

1252
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:11,500
So it's been online for a long time,
but as we started it,

1253
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:16,240
four Chan picked it up as a troll in
2014 okay. Say started as a real thing.

1254
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:19,330
It's been a thing online now for
a long time on feminist blogs.

1255
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:21,860
I'll 2011 there's another
thing when you fuck,

1256
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:26,650
but when you find in 2004 was it a
troll? No, it was all about my vagina.

1257
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:31,390
My badge.net. Yeah, I
told you we'd do a new,

1258
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:34,180
I'm glad I got this right. Okay.
You got it right to my badge.

1259
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:39,450
Fortunate has too much
power long [inaudible] dot
net some ladies experienced

1260
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:43,210
with her free bleeding, so she just
lets her 15 years ago, her twat bleed.

1261
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:47,650
Oh sorry. That's okay. You got that one.

1262
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:53,260
The article was so fucking convincing.
That's a problem man. It's a Pr,

1263
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,620
you know and that's what
people in that are arguing for.

1264
01:10:56,621 --> 01:11:00,040
D platforming are saying when
they're like for d platforming,

1265
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,020
anti vaxxers or d platforming,

1266
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:07,030
flat earthers or anybody
who's got information that's
just not accurate in terms

1267
01:11:07,031 --> 01:11:08,650
of,
the other thing is climate change.

1268
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:09,543
Yeah. Hold on. Pick one.

1269
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:14,820
My big answer is you guys reported WMDs
for a long time and hundreds of thousand

1270
01:11:15,601 --> 01:11:17,580
people got killed because
of this misinformation.

1271
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:20,580
So if that's going to be your standard,
you're going to have two d platform,

1272
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:25,020
the New York Times as well. So
it's a very, a double edged sword.

1273
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:27,150
When you start talking about
if people give misinformation,

1274
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:29,010
they have to be banned from
these social media sites.

1275
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:33,300
You need someone to be able to check the
orthodox point of view no matter what

1276
01:11:33,301 --> 01:11:35,610
it is. It's true. There's no denying that.

1277
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,580
What does [inaudible] this is the poster.
That's the key.

1278
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:39,810
I didn't know this was about a poster.

1279
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:43,510
It's a fair use issue with
the peppy and Alex Jones.

1280
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:48,600
[inaudible] upon certain, like they're
arguing as fair use and he's arguments,

1281
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:50,540
not blah, blah, blah. So interesting.

1282
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,340
It's not just because it's
a meme or something. Yeah.

1283
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:59,130
There's the poster person behind
Alex to l a to the left of Alex.

1284
01:11:59,170 --> 01:12:01,080
All right. He's going to question.
Most of these people are,

1285
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,011
I know who all of them.

1286
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:05,100
I don't know if that's like a cigarette
in their hand or a test tube or a tampon.

1287
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,560
What does that, what does that,
is that a blunt? What does that,

1288
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:10,230
so the Sharpie is that you're
writing something on Alex's back.

1289
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,790
Is that a dude or a guy? Who the fuck is
that? Who is that? I know everybody else.

1290
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,880
Whatever. We could be here for days.
Is that the diamond and silk? Okay.

1291
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:22,920
Is that lady, I think that was so, I
don't know. It must be diamond and silk.

1292
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,920
The two of them whose diamond and so
there are these two black ladies who are

1293
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:26,970
Trump's biggest fans.

1294
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:29,260
And they go to social media and
they start ranting or raving.

1295
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,230
I've seen one and that one of them always
drinks blue line blue wine and it's

1296
01:12:34,231 --> 01:12:36,280
like when you're so sick
of his blue bullshit,

1297
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:40,590
they just drinking literal Koolaid.
It's blue. She's got a blue liquid.

1298
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:45,240
It's crazy green one here and
she's a Trump. It's racist.

1299
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,170
Well, wait a minute. Maybe she's
drinking coolers like do you can get,

1300
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,350
can you get Green Koolaid? No,
I think it's wine. Wine glass.

1301
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,970
I think they have blue line. Now what?
Let's look at the looks on her face.

1302
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:58,050
She's always seemed sad.

1303
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,020
I don't know what you want is diving
for when Silk One zero always act really

1304
01:13:01,021 --> 01:13:05,250
upset the other month. Just like,
why am I here? That's a good move.

1305
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:08,800
If you just want attention.
If you don't really support Trump,

1306
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,910
I can sit in there with the Green
Line. Yeah, just get super outrageous.

1307
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:15,240
See and they testified
in front of Congress.

1308
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:19,560
That's why I love this timeline.
It's like this is where we are.

1309
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,090
They testified in front of Congress
about Facebook censoring people because

1310
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,790
Facebook is censoring them.
They said, what do you see?

1311
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:30,930
What's going on with Alex Jones? If you
right Alex JonesJones' name on Facebook,

1312
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:35,580
it says only you can see this post. I do
license name, I do live streams a lot.

1313
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:40,080
Right. And if the live stream was my
thoughts on Alex Jones live stream,

1314
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:41,720
the second it's uploaded,

1315
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,550
it's demonetized and they laid
her has to get remodeled ties.

1316
01:13:44,551 --> 01:13:46,710
Once they see it's okay.
So the default setting is,

1317
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:52,110
and that's the other thing of all of
these people. Alex Jones is the worst one.

1318
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:54,510
Like you have actual full blown,

1319
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,050
we need another holocaust types
and he's the villain. Yeah,

1320
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:01,470
well he's got a big platform.
That's the idea.

1321
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:05,250
The idea is that he's got a big platform
so they have to show the other lie.

1322
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:05,730
They're like,

1323
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:09,420
oh blah blah blah sandy hook or like
you're an upset when the sandy hook should

1324
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:11,950
happen.
You're getting upset about him now.

1325
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,910
Years later.

1326
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,610
Cause you're being whipped up into a
froth by the corporate press about it.

1327
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:17,950
You wouldn't flip flip saying
he should be beauty platform.

1328
01:14:17,951 --> 01:14:22,020
Seven years ago when was,
whenever it was sandy hook was,

1329
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,710
was something around them.
Right. Five years ago.

1330
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,900
Well it becomes something that
is a talking point, right? Right.

1331
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:33,820
Like that he needs to be d platform.

1332
01:14:33,821 --> 01:14:35,740
Do you use it or agree with
it or you don't agree with it?

1333
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:39,520
And I think that's the case with a
almost what is happening with our, uh,

1334
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,290
something happened up there. Oh,
is that the perch? The perch.

1335
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:50,210
Now these guys are here messing
with electronics. Okay. Um, no,

1336
01:14:50,211 --> 01:14:52,670
there's no approach here. Yeah.
Okay, good. Yeah, we have security.

1337
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,790
I would not do well in purge. Yep.
You're fine. Dude. Stay in this room.

1338
01:14:55,850 --> 01:15:00,170
This room was bulletproof.
Yeah. All right. Good to know.
Yeah, you'll be all right,

1339
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:04,850
man. Okay, good. Are you
worried about the purge? No.

1340
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:08,900
Are you worried about the apocalypse? No.
Natural disasters? Not at all. Nothing.

1341
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:11,840
Solar flares taken out
the grid? No. No, no.

1342
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:14,840
I mean there's a satellite's
going wasn't the best books.

1343
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,100
No more Sirius satellite radio.

1344
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:18,470
And this is my response to
people on the far right.

1345
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,720
And I'm using that term
to term accurately.

1346
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:24,050
It is a great book by Arthur Herman
called the idea of decline in western

1347
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:27,080
history. And he talks about,
you know, every 20 years,

1348
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:29,750
it's a different group on the left,
on the right. And they're like,

1349
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:30,680
the world's going to end.

1350
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:33,890
And he brings the receipts and it never
ends up happening because people are

1351
01:15:33,891 --> 01:15:38,870
smart some. And we have a huge
asymmetry in wanting to stay alive.

1352
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,050
So the idea that the
last of what apocalypse,

1353
01:15:42,051 --> 01:15:45,410
what probably the black plague I would
say would be the last apocalypse we were

1354
01:15:45,411 --> 01:15:48,590
doing so good so far. Do you know the
belt, the people that got the black Pitt,

1355
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:49,551
excuse me,

1356
01:15:49,551 --> 01:15:52,580
the people that got the black plate
cause they were eaten a Marmot liver,

1357
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:54,520
is that what a,
was it a liver or kill?

1358
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:57,860
I thought they thought it was the fleece
from the rats. No, no, no, no, no.

1359
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:01,210
There's some, oh, recently, recently,
recently got the black plague,

1360
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,020
but it's just like the flu now.
The rats,

1361
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:06,260
the last time that happened in the
United States I think was in the 1920s.

1362
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:10,610
And that was in Los Angeles actually. The
last, uh, evidence of the black plague.

1363
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:14,330
Yeah, but you don't die from it anymore.
Oh, you could definitely die from it,

1364
01:16:14,580 --> 01:16:17,920
but they died in the twenties I think
they died in the 20s and I thought it's

1365
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:18,754
still okay.

1366
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:23,360
Maybe it's the people died this
year from the black plague. Oh Shit.

1367
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:27,250
People that ate the liver. Okay. Kidney,
I think. Right? You're killing couple,

1368
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,370
you know, we're all Marmet kidney. Yeah.

1369
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:34,160
Marmet it's like a vole. Yeah. Yeah.

1370
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,990
That's what we used to be
65 million years ago. Yeah.

1371
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:41,990
Just weird little mini museum. Weird
little rodent thing. Yeah. Yeah.

1372
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,500
These people hate it. Ate It, and wound up
dying from the play. What was the point?

1373
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:49,070
I had a point about end of the world.
Are we worried about the apocalypse?

1374
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:49,700
You know,

1375
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:54,470
that idea that people have always
worried about the end of the world and it

1376
01:16:54,471 --> 01:16:57,470
never happens. Sure. That's like saying,

1377
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:02,000
I've always worried about dying, but
I never have. I'm not going to die.

1378
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,790
I'm not going to die. I'm not going
to be there. You're going to die,

1379
01:17:04,970 --> 01:17:07,070
but I'm not going to be there.
How do you know? What do you mean?

1380
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:11,660
How do you know you're not
going to be there? But I mean
that's a dying means. Oh,

1381
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:15,440
you not going to be there when you die.
Right? So you're not going to die. Right.

1382
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,600
Cause I'm not gonna experience
the hive or you're not.

1383
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,020
So don't even worry about
it. Does what? It's over. You
won't be here. So who cares?

1384
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,180
I wouldn't say who. So who cares. But I
mean if your entire life is focusing on,

1385
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,050
you know, avoiding death, that's a very
bad mindset. Yeah, that's for sure.

1386
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:35,080
That's what I'm saying is that I think
people are operating with a very small

1387
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:38,420
historical timelines and the more I
talk to people like Graham Hancock,

1388
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,961
what is the,

1389
01:17:38,961 --> 01:17:43,961
describe the overwhelming evidence that
something pretty severe happen to the

1390
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:48,830
human race around 12,800 years ago.
Most likely common impact or some,

1391
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:49,760
something along those lines.

1392
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:53,270
Are there other people think that it was
actually a solar mass coronal ejection

1393
01:17:53,271 --> 01:17:56,090
that made lightning storms like rainstorm.

1394
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:00,200
Lightening was coming down like rain
all over the world and just killed

1395
01:18:00,201 --> 01:18:00,890
everything.

1396
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:05,240
And this thing could
happen easily at any time.

1397
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:08,390
Not Easily. Oh yeah. Easily. Okay. Yeah.

1398
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:11,240
Common impact or asteroid impact easily,

1399
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,490
easily or not easily in terms of
likelihood because it would happen easily.

1400
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:20,270
Turn the likelihood it would've happened
by now. No, no. That has happened.

1401
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,010
There's a lot of evidence
that it's happened.

1402
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:25,070
It's just we're dealing with a
small timeline. The ideas could,

1403
01:18:25,071 --> 01:18:28,190
could you get lucky and it won't happen
in the next 60 years or so while you're

1404
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:32,150
alive. Yeah. Yeah. Could happen or could
hit tomorrow. That could happen too. Okay.

1405
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:36,680
I'll take that bet. It's good bet. I mean,
it's good. Look, your prospective is good.

1406
01:18:36,681 --> 01:18:40,750
That's a good, it's good to not
worry to, to not look at license,

1407
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,540
but you don't have power if you don't
have the power to effect the comment as I

1408
01:18:44,541 --> 01:18:46,970
personally don't know. That's
true. Uh, knowing it's coming.

1409
01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,770
Who could theoretically,
what can I do about it?

1410
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,700
Just live and I th one of my heroes,
Albert Kamoo, great French philosopher,

1411
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:55,280
you know, his point about living
to the point of tears, right?

1412
01:18:55,490 --> 01:19:00,490
And I think what really I find sad in
this culture is cynicism and hopelessness

1413
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:05,540
and it's like we're blessed. You know,
we have this, I mean there's beyond,

1414
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:09,440
beyond the Internet, you can find
people who are making amazing things,

1415
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:10,820
more opportunities than you can count.

1416
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:12,860
And if you're just going
to sit there and Mope,

1417
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:17,420
I mean you're blowing this great gift
that God's given you. Yeah. Well,

1418
01:19:17,421 --> 01:19:19,310
I think a lot of those
people that are moping,

1419
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:23,240
that are concentrating entirely
on the negative aspects of life,

1420
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:25,650
they're doing themselves a
giant service and they can't.

1421
01:19:25,730 --> 01:19:27,080
It's almost like they can't help it.

1422
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:31,130
I think there's a lot of people that are
affecting the way culture shifts today

1423
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:33,530
that are probably clinically depressed.

1424
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:37,790
And one of the things I resent
enormously about culture is this idea of

1425
01:19:37,791 --> 01:19:42,230
something is joyous or fun. It's less,
it's less legitimate artistically.

1426
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,510
And that is such a disgusting,

1427
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:49,280
horrible mindset and we need more joy
and more happiness. And I, for me,

1428
01:19:49,281 --> 01:19:53,060
because I want to see Jojo
Siwa last night. Okay. Yeah.
Do you know who that is?

1429
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,570
You don't know who that is?
She's a youtube star.

1430
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:00,270
My nine year old loves her.
So how to,

1431
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,390
how to go to Jojo Siwa was
birthday concert last night. Okay.

1432
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,980
At the Microsoft Center.
Whatever the fuck that is.

1433
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:10,610
I know because Burt ran into her at
the airport or loves or two of that bet

1434
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,060
because Berta, his young daughters
too. Yeah. She's all about positivity.

1435
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,630
Believe and achieve fun times.
I'll upload a video later.

1436
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:23,310
Is it all like Saccharin like Disney
stuff or is it sincere? Sacrad as again.

1437
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:27,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like um, yeah,

1438
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:32,340
she was taking old queen songs and
reworking the words, cleaning them up.

1439
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,960
Just like those mean people.
She always, she's cleaning,

1440
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,550
she toning down Queen Song
tone down some queen songs. Oh,

1441
01:20:38,551 --> 01:20:39,510
this woman is the devil.

1442
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:45,620
How dare you take someone's art and
an appropriate it and make it like a

1443
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,940
takeout. All the, all
the energy. Yeah. She uh,

1444
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,210
this is corporate culture at its worst,
but she's doing it for three year olds,

1445
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:58,140
Bro. Sell to sleep. Five year olds. They
don't need to be listening to queen over.

1446
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:01,260
There it is. Oh, Jesus Christ loves
Freddy Mercury, Bro. What's problem? No,

1447
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:04,770
she doesn't. If she loved
him, she'd respect him. That's
just fucking 12 she know.

1448
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:09,240
Oh, she's 16 excuse me. Yeah. Should
know any better. She does know better.

1449
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,240
How smart were you when you were 16
smart enough not to try to rewrite queen.

1450
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,510
I bet she doesn't have a say in it.

1451
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:19,440
I bet whoever's pulling the strings
gets her to rewrite even more nefarious.

1452
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:23,680
Of course the Disney people
or the, the, the, the, the,
the sensors, wherever it is.

1453
01:21:23,681 --> 01:21:27,660
The producers. Wait, am I wrong?
Where's the lie? Where's the lie?

1454
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:31,590
What song was it that they did it
to? I'm trying to remember. They did.

1455
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,960
We are the champions.
She sang that

1456
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:39,720
the champions. I mean, someone is
a loser. Yeah. No time for losers.

1457
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:42,760
That changed her. No
time. What? Don't got no,

1458
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:45,720
I don't think they've changed that now.
The time for recess.

1459
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,800
Oh my God. This is horrifying. Video two,

1460
01:21:53,010 --> 01:21:56,280
this is like those videos they made
for like Mormons where they took like

1461
01:21:56,310 --> 01:22:00,120
Hollywood blockbusters and cut out
all the sex and all the cursing. Yeah.

1462
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:03,600
And it's like you are evil vampires.
Horrible monsters.

1463
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:06,480
She did crocodile rock. Elton John. Okay.

1464
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:11,220
And she changed Rainbow Chevy to
rainbow beamer. So Crocodile Rock,

1465
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,890
you know, my theory is that that
song, I tweeted this out years ago,

1466
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,970
I just imagined Elton with a bunch of
his friends all getting high as fuck,

1467
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,800
right? And they're like, all right,

1468
01:22:19,830 --> 01:22:23,840
let's try to think of the most fucked
up lyric and Eric Elta and you're gonna

1469
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:25,860
make a song about it. They're like,
all right, how about like, um,

1470
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:29,250
like crocodile rock? And he's like,
all right, I'll fucking do it.

1471
01:22:29,251 --> 01:22:32,580
And he fucking sits and nails it. And
then what the fuck does that even mean?

1472
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,710
What does that mean?
But I'll tell you what man,

1473
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:38,670
the word crocodile means something
different to me after watching that Black

1474
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:42,270
Mirror episode titled Crocodile,
I haven't seen it. Holy Shit.

1475
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,310
If you're listening to this,
ladies and gentlemen,

1476
01:22:44,311 --> 01:22:49,311
and you have a sensitive heart and you
can't handle really fucked up premises in

1477
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:52,640
a really fucked up episode
like her fans don't want young,

1478
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:57,300
don't watch it cause it's rough.
It's really good though. It's,

1479
01:22:57,301 --> 01:22:59,070
but it's like,
Holy Shit.

1480
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,110
It's one of those ones where they
are not giving away anything.

1481
01:23:01,111 --> 01:23:03,330
But at the end when you're,
when you're done with that show,

1482
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:07,870
you feel like you need a
fucking shower. Like he was
like, whoa. Oh Geez. It's dark.

1483
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:12,250
Okay. There's nothing to do with the
reptiles. I do like dark. It's just dark.

1484
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,760
It's dark.
I just read this book by this woman,

1485
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:19,600
Cynthia Carr called fire in the belly.
It's the life story of this artist David,

1486
01:23:19,601 --> 01:23:19,960
when he wrote,

1487
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:24,960
which I didn't know anything about and
he was in New York in the early to late

1488
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:29,320
eighties when AIDS was coming up.
And as she tells his life story,

1489
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:31,780
you hear the story of Aids
percolating through this culture.

1490
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:36,010
And that book is as dark as fuck because
she'll have a scene where he's like, oh,

1491
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,530
he had dinner and Dah, Dah,
Dah. And the next sentence,

1492
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:42,730
Keith haring died on this day at age 34
and you realize this is what it's like

1493
01:23:42,731 --> 01:23:45,880
for them. Like they're hanging
out, phone rings, Keith's dead.

1494
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:49,000
And these are men who are the
symbols of virility early,

1495
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:51,490
late twenties early thirties
just dropping like flies.

1496
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:55,450
And the thing is they're watching
each other die knowing I'm next.

1497
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,860
That's going to be me in a year from now.

1498
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,810
And they're getting
dementia before they die.

1499
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,950
So they're talking all crazy at age 30
so this book really fucked with my head

1500
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,970
really, really badly. We're giving them
easy t to yell. Yeah. Didn't help. No,

1501
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:08,800
but that was later.
At first they're like,

1502
01:24:08,801 --> 01:24:10,480
we don't know what the fuck
to do is go. Good, good luck.

1503
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:13,090
And it's like we're dying. Like, no, I'm
sorry. Should I suck Dick? It's like,

1504
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:16,100
what the fuck? What the fuck
am I supposed to do? Yeah,

1505
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:19,690
they were calling it the gay cancer.
We didn't know what it was they did.

1506
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:23,260
And then when they were trying to
fight for education, people are like,

1507
01:24:23,261 --> 01:24:25,570
well we're not going to teach kids, you
know about sucking Dick. And they're like,

1508
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:28,750
dude, we're dying. And they're
like, mm, sorry about it. And it's,

1509
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:32,050
is this book really got with fucking with
my head especially cause you know it's

1510
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:36,640
real. Yeah. Did you ever hear
a book Kutchers of course,

1511
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:40,450
about chasers both chase fuck
chasers. Yeah. That's again,

1512
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:43,480
we're talking about things that are
just fucked up about human beings.

1513
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:48,550
When you look at the spectrum of behavior,
bug chasers are people who tried, yes.

1514
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:53,290
Gay Men. Right. Cause they thought it was
the ultimate symbol of being gay. Well,

1515
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:56,220
I'm sure there's a bunch of reasons
that was the big reason. Well,

1516
01:24:56,221 --> 01:24:57,550
so there was probably that,

1517
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,850
but probably they felt bad that other
people had it and they wanted it.

1518
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:03,490
And there was other people that just
wanted it because they're crazy. Sure.

1519
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,460
And other people hated themselves.
So they wanted,

1520
01:25:05,461 --> 01:25:07,300
there was also that guy
in Germany who was like,

1521
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:09,760
I want to cut off
someone's Dick and eat it.

1522
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:12,520
And they got someone signed up
for it. No, he said, I want to,

1523
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:17,521
I want someone to cut off my dick
and eat it and I want them to eat me.

1524
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:22,870
Right. So someone said, sure, let's meet
up. Yeah, that's right. I got it wrong.

1525
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:27,760
And so the guy cut his dick off and they
both shared his dick and then killed

1526
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:28,780
the dude and started eating them.

1527
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:31,120
And then they arrest him and they didn't
know whether to charge it because it

1528
01:25:31,121 --> 01:25:35,680
was voluntary. Yeah, it's
a good point. Yeah. Yeah.

1529
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:40,900
I don't, I'm not a fan, but I
mean you still like you can't,

1530
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:46,000
that's murders. Like it either is
murder or it's not murder. Like if, uh,

1531
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,850
if you're in a gay relationship
with the guy and the guy says, okay,

1532
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:51,490
this is what I want you to do,
I want you to beat me up and raped me.

1533
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,150
And you're like, oh, okay.
Can I get that in writing?

1534
01:25:55,210 --> 01:25:58,540
And you write down and once you to beat
me up and then, you know, the cops come,

1535
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:02,080
he's like, you beat me up. And he
raped me. Like, oh bro, listen here.

1536
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:03,980
He wrote it right here.
He made

1537
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,890
a video tape. You didn't use you all
the video and use your safe word.

1538
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:09,050
He said he wanted me to
beat him up and play by him.

1539
01:26:09,051 --> 01:26:13,190
And the cops probably let you
go, but you can't murder. Right.

1540
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:17,420
You know what I'm saying? Because
consensual sex is obs obviously legal.

1541
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:20,510
So if you have consensual
sex with someone, it's legal.

1542
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:25,220
But if you pretend to be fighting them
off, right, and then real place you,

1543
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:29,780
it's fun. It's roleplay. But
murders never roleplay. You know,

1544
01:26:29,781 --> 01:26:33,230
I found, um, uh, when I was doing research
for the book, the National Review,

1545
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:36,380
who's my favorite paleontology
journal in the late nineties,

1546
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,920
as the gay rights movement was coming
up into mainstream consciousness,

1547
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:44,510
they wrote an article comparing the
struggle for gay rights to a struggle for

1548
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:47,180
necrophilia. They're like, love
get a difference. Like if I,

1549
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:52,181
and they talked about how right now in
the European Union perverts are fighting

1550
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:57,290
for the right to be violent toward
each other in bed in, in various ways.

1551
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:01,880
It's like, yeah, it's like rough sex. It's
adjacent to vanilla sex. They like it.

1552
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:05,930
And now the are the articles are the
conservative case for gay marriage.

1553
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,710
It's like you guys have no fucking shame
then and you have no fucking shame now

1554
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:10,640
at least be consistent.

1555
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,580
One of the things that disturbs me
greatly today is there is a movement,

1556
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:18,140
and I don't know how big it is,

1557
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,370
but it's a movement for people
to try to recognize pedophiles,

1558
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:25,330
us as a sexual distinction,

1559
01:27:25,331 --> 01:27:30,331
as sexual designation rather than a sick
disease that similar to being trans or

1560
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:35,630
being gay or that some people
are just born pedophiles. Well,

1561
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:40,631
I think what's important there is it's
not just a crime because a crime can be

1562
01:27:41,031 --> 01:27:42,170
fixed and treated.

1563
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:46,730
So I think it is important to
understand these people will always

1564
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:51,440
psychologically be pedophiles and
you're not going to get them to be like,

1565
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,830
Whoa, uh, straight, you know, hold on.

1566
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:57,680
No therapy that's ever been
shown that I think it's,

1567
01:27:57,681 --> 01:28:00,340
I try and make someone who's gay.
It's straight. Is it really that,

1568
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,450
that's my understanding.
If that's the case,

1569
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:06,590
then is there an argument that we should
be more compassionate with them as long

1570
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:09,650
as they don't act on that. But that's
the danger. Because the other thing,

1571
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,870
what they don't understand
is from their point of view,

1572
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:15,830
those kids are giving consent, which
they are, right? The kids saying yes.

1573
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:20,300
So they're like, look man,
that's what's scary. I don't
even know if they do. Right.

1574
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:24,330
They don't think a statutory raping
a thing. And I knew, okay, this,

1575
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:29,740
I interned at a place long ago and there
was a librarian who worked there like a

1576
01:28:30,111 --> 01:28:31,550
Guido type,
you know,

1577
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,000
and grow or Guy Guy and
years later he was arrested.

1578
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:38,330
He was a schoolteacher.

1579
01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:43,510
He was arrested at an undercover sting
trying to meet a kid who he knew was 13

1580
01:28:43,521 --> 01:28:46,460
or 12 in a park to try to sleep with him.
Right.

1581
01:28:46,461 --> 01:28:49,250
This was an Jeanine Pirro who
later became a Fox commentator.

1582
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:52,820
He got out of jail and
I see him on Facebook,

1583
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:55,760
he's married with kids and it's just like,

1584
01:28:56,430 --> 01:29:00,520
you think it's fine that that
shit scary shit. That's insane.

1585
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:03,810
And it's thing to be switched gender too.
If you're going for young boys,

1586
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,440
you're going to go to like regular aged
women. I don't see how that would work.

1587
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:08,333
Right,
right.

1588
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:12,600
And this is something that is such a
taboo topic that I don't think once you,

1589
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:17,250
for a lot of people correctly, once you
start talking about kids in sexuality,

1590
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,680
their hackles res,
it is a PC subject.

1591
01:29:19,681 --> 01:29:23,150
Cause it's like why even introducing
this into the conversation where you're

1592
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,900
going with this, it's a very,
very, very slippery slope. Well,

1593
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:31,770
if you're trying to say or if they're
trying to say that this is something that

1594
01:29:31,771 --> 01:29:32,640
people are born with,

1595
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:36,030
I don't think there's evidence
that people just are born that way.

1596
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:39,720
I think there's evidence that people
become that way from sexual abuse. Yes,

1597
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:42,220
that's true too. Absolutely.
And they think it's appropriate.

1598
01:29:42,221 --> 01:29:46,140
Never heard of anybody that grew up
in a normal household wasn't abused.

1599
01:29:46,230 --> 01:29:50,640
Is that the case? I might not in a
position to talk about this at all.

1600
01:29:50,850 --> 01:29:55,230
I think we have probably a very few
cases of pedophiles on the record, uh,

1601
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:58,510
explaining how they came to
this point of view. But he,

1602
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:01,140
in either situation born or abuse,

1603
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,000
I can't see how this is something that's
going to be, uh, an emotion level.

1604
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:08,460
You're going to be able to turn
them away. Well, it's also a super,

1605
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:13,110
the idea of that being in
your neighborhood. Yes. This
is in your neighborhood.

1606
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:17,040
You've got this guy who likes to fuck
kids and he promises not to do it anymore,

1607
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,500
but they did a few times.
They locked him up in a cage.

1608
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:22,200
Now he lived down the street and he
locked up on a couch where he was

1609
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:27,270
traumatized. Also further traumatized,
so and also if he promised not to do it,

1610
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:30,060
but knowing when he's looking at it,
he's checking out my son or my daughter.

1611
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:36,750
Yeah. I did not accept to be talking
about this today. I know. Of course.

1612
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:40,390
That's just the beauty of the show.
It's a fucking the,

1613
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:45,440
that the human mind can be that it'd
be imprinted in your abused when you're

1614
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:50,400
younger, that you go on to do that same
thing that was horrifically done to you,

1615
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:54,300
that that is a common thing that happens
with children that may get abused,

1616
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:57,820
doesn't make sense to you. It does make
sense to me. It's like that way I'm not,

1617
01:30:57,830 --> 01:31:00,480
I wasn't abused. I was enjoying
it. Could be. Right. You know,

1618
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:02,550
that that way it takes away
the trauma cause it's like,

1619
01:31:02,551 --> 01:31:05,250
oh this is how I've always been.
So it was okay,

1620
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:08,220
nothing happened to me and you don't
have to deal with the trauma that way.

1621
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:13,640
Well that's what my low and when he was
talking about being sexually abused as a

1622
01:31:15,121 --> 01:31:17,600
child. Right. I think that's what
he was kind of doing. Oh yeah,

1623
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:20,440
he was saying I was the Predator and
I w I was going on for the panel.

1624
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,650
Talk about that in the book because if
there was anyone other than Milo people

1625
01:31:23,651 --> 01:31:25,740
would, because he was older, he
wasn't like 12 he was like whatever,

1626
01:31:25,741 --> 01:31:27,690
1814 I think he was like,

1627
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:30,090
I don't remember how well do
you know if he's 18 is fine.

1628
01:31:30,091 --> 01:31:33,460
It wasn't 18 but it wasn't 12 I think
he was a teenager. But if you're young,

1629
01:31:33,810 --> 01:31:36,900
if it was somebody else, people are we
talking about heteronormativity. Right.

1630
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,230
And it's historically not that weird for
an older gay dude to get with a younger

1631
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:42,960
gay guy, especially when everyone was
closeted to kind of initiate them into the

1632
01:31:42,961 --> 01:31:46,830
lifestyle. This was a thing, but
it's my low now it's, Oh my God,

1633
01:31:46,831 --> 01:31:47,910
you want pedophilia,
blah blah.

1634
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:51,000
It's like there's different standards
for gay people that frustrate people and

1635
01:31:51,001 --> 01:31:54,750
that's appropriate and acceptable and
people understand that in other contexts.

1636
01:31:55,140 --> 01:32:00,140
Well the problem is society as
the way we understand human beings

1637
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,430
and the way a person's brain
works when you're young,

1638
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:08,490
you shouldn't be allowed to make those
decisions because sexually in particular

1639
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:11,470
you could get coerced.
You can. Yes you can get,

1640
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:14,030
you can wind up doing something
that you don't want to do,

1641
01:32:14,031 --> 01:32:17,710
that can be straight guys that are 14
years old and her talked into having gay

1642
01:32:17,711 --> 01:32:22,060
sex by a very charismatic 40 year
old man who gives them things.

1643
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:24,790
The idea is that this is
a bad thing for the boy.

1644
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:27,160
It's bad thing cause you wouldn't
want to happen to a girl.

1645
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:28,540
Why would you want to happen to a boy?

1646
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:32,200
But I think it's a very
different phenomenon for a
30 year old man to sleep with

1647
01:32:32,201 --> 01:32:34,690
a 30 year old gay man to sleep
with a 16 year old gay man.

1648
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:36,970
As far as 30 year old boy.
Sure.

1649
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:41,620
As opposed to 30 year old gay straight
man to sleep with a 16 year old straight

1650
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:45,220
girl. I think you can make that argument
that it is a little bit different.

1651
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,010
I still don't think it's okay.
I'm not saying it's okay.

1652
01:32:48,011 --> 01:32:51,330
I'm just saying clearly it's different.
It's different and yeah,

1653
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:54,610
especially if the boy is like very gay,
very obviously gay,

1654
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,410
which you know everyone or high school,
remember it's not a virgin. Right.

1655
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:00,550
That true to that first,

1656
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:03,430
that first guy for that girl will
fuck with her head for her life.

1657
01:33:03,431 --> 01:33:06,620
For many women. For him it could
be, it wasn't his first. Yup.

1658
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,240
That's a very big difference too. Yeah.
Yeah. You don't want to be that first guy.

1659
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:15,130
That's a lot of work.
I don't even mean with gay.

1660
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:18,430
I mean it was straight to, I don't
think I ever had a virgin of my life.

1661
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:23,170
I've never had a virgin. Thank God
so much work. I say I connected.

1662
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:28,150
You'd be like forever basically
be too much work. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1663
01:33:28,151 --> 01:33:32,020
I mean, yeah, I should probably clarify.
I mean being connected to the upper,

1664
01:33:32,021 --> 01:33:34,510
it's too significant.
You want to be like the third guy.

1665
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:37,060
You don't want to be the
first car girl has sex with.

1666
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:39,790
You were always my first Michael.
I'll never forget,

1667
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:42,730
I always thought that we were supposed
to be together forever and never,

1668
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:45,940
because I believe in movies
and fairy tales that you were,

1669
01:33:46,270 --> 01:33:50,290
and I listened to the Queen Songs
with a nice lyrics to work chooses.

1670
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:55,180
He was concert cheeks, plane,
everything is like a movie. Yeah.

1671
01:33:55,181 --> 01:33:58,240
You uh, yeah. That's a thing, right?

1672
01:33:58,241 --> 01:34:03,241
Like people do get emotionally attached
to romantic stories that they see in

1673
01:34:04,991 --> 01:34:08,800
movies and they want their life to
play out like this fictional narrative.

1674
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:12,850
And the left uses this a lot because
they'll have all these leftist ideas in

1675
01:34:12,851 --> 01:34:16,300
culture and movies and that's where a
lot of people get their programming. Uh,

1676
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:18,040
and then it's like, you know, for example,

1677
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:22,330
here's an idea you don't see in culture
that people very often knowingly and

1678
01:34:22,331 --> 01:34:25,180
consciously do the wrong thing.
And that happens every day.

1679
01:34:25,210 --> 01:34:26,740
People know they're doing
something fucked up.

1680
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:30,920
You don't really see that that much in
like TV and movies and that's a right

1681
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:35,590
wing message that like, you know,
people sometimes are basically evil. Um,

1682
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,980
and you can run into someone at that
point in their life, they're evil.

1683
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:43,080
That's a fact. And I'm sure that exists
all over the world. Or like it, I, I,

1684
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,980
it's also evil on a small scale.

1685
01:34:44,981 --> 01:34:49,981
Like if you're in an office and someone's
getting chewed out and they're getting

1686
01:34:50,141 --> 01:34:51,490
bullied for whatever reason,

1687
01:34:51,491 --> 01:34:54,100
and you're sitting there and
you're keeping your mouth
shut, you're not Hitler,

1688
01:34:54,340 --> 01:34:57,350
but you know, you're doing
the wrong thing, but you're
trying to protect your job,

1689
01:34:57,351 --> 01:34:57,990
right?
Sure.

1690
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:01,250
The boss to come down on you let a lot
of times that you have that space and you

1691
01:35:01,251 --> 01:35:05,300
still won't do it. And that's
knowingly doing the wrong thing.

1692
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:07,670
And I'm not saying you should
be thrown in the garbage,

1693
01:35:07,671 --> 01:35:09,110
but I'm saying people
do that all the time.

1694
01:35:09,111 --> 01:35:12,930
These little sacrifices they make with
their conscience. That's true. Yeah.

1695
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,930
And you don't see that really represented.

1696
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:18,530
And that's an important idea for people
to understand that people are often weak.

1697
01:35:19,370 --> 01:35:23,900
Yeah. And always, especially
if you're going check to
check. Always worried. Yeah.

1698
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:26,480
Losing your job. Losing your Gig. Yeah.

1699
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:30,320
That's a real big thing with people till
I was on vacation once and there's this

1700
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:32,870
guy who's a boss and he was there
with his employees, employees,

1701
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,910
family and he was mean to his
employees daughter are to watch it.

1702
01:35:36,911 --> 01:35:40,940
The guy had to take it. He's just
talking shit. He to her and it was just,

1703
01:35:40,941 --> 01:35:43,550
it was really gross cause you
can see the dynamic play out.

1704
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,220
He was just this mean old guy,
just really shitty.

1705
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:50,030
It was disturbing to see this week man,

1706
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:54,890
like just having to accept the fact that
this guy is my shitty to his daughter

1707
01:35:54,891 --> 01:35:59,220
and he was giving her a
lecture and berating her and
doing it publicly like are

1708
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:03,740
the poem God? Is this who you want it
to grow up to be? Is this job worth it?

1709
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,980
It was so gross. I W I wanted
to step in. I was like,

1710
01:36:07,150 --> 01:36:10,160
I just want to tell this guy to shut
the fuck up. It's driving me nuts.

1711
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:15,080
I remember when I was back before
I started me out being an author,

1712
01:36:15,081 --> 01:36:19,470
I was working at Goldman and it
was a very stressful job and they,

1713
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,920
I had my review and
they said, oh, you know,

1714
01:36:21,921 --> 01:36:24,560
if you have downtime sometimes
we see like going online,

1715
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:29,200
we want you to help the laptop lab.
And I just go, no. And she goes, what?

1716
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:34,070
I said I wasn't hired to do laptops. I'm
not interested in, in learning laptops.

1717
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:37,940
And there are,
the job is very intense and high stress.

1718
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:42,230
So if I have downtime I'm going
to, you know, use the downtime.

1719
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:46,670
And the look on her face was just like
as if I just added myself as a pedophile.

1720
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:50,180
What did it mean by use the law? I
was doing laptop, the laptop lab,

1721
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:54,110
I was doing tech support.
So like Microsoft word,
Excel. People had problems.

1722
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,960
They would call on the fly. You've got
to have an answer for them. It's very,

1723
01:36:57,050 --> 01:37:00,680
it's like a quiz show. You're living in
quiz show and then there's a laptop lab.

1724
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:03,050
People are checking out laptops,
they're setting up laptops,

1725
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:05,680
which is a very different skillset.
Something I didn't really know.

1726
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:08,870
Setting up in terms of like
downloading. Sure. Yeah. I,

1727
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,520
you know like where and I didn't know
then I still don't know. I didn't,

1728
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,770
I don't fuck with you. Like, no,

1729
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:16,940
it's not my job now I'm not and I'm
not interested in working as hard as

1730
01:37:16,941 --> 01:37:17,390
possible.

1731
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:21,470
While also like when you have downtime
with did they want you to work extra it,

1732
01:37:21,471 --> 01:37:24,950
the point is the phone rings or it
doesn't ring. Right. It's your job.

1733
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:25,790
That's my job.

1734
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:28,940
My job's to get off the phone as fast as
possible because their problem solved.

1735
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:33,140
So there what they were saying was
while you were doing this other job and

1736
01:37:33,141 --> 01:37:34,580
waiting for something to come up,

1737
01:37:34,581 --> 01:37:38,690
we want you to keep you working
specifically different jobs. Correct.

1738
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:43,100
Yeah. No, it's corporations, man.
That's right. Squeeze that rock. Right.

1739
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:43,731
And it's like,

1740
01:37:43,731 --> 01:37:48,731
why am I busting my ass to make
Goldman Sachs that extra $5 of value?

1741
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:53,660
Fuck you.
And I'm so proud of myself that far.

1742
01:37:53,661 --> 01:37:57,300
You after that they fired me because I
refused to work in Thanksgiving because

1743
01:37:57,301 --> 01:38:01,740
my great grandma had died. So I wanted
you to work on thanksgiving. We were 24,

1744
01:38:01,741 --> 01:38:06,000
seven but we're 24. It's a,
it's a help desk. Oh Wow.

1745
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:10,560
But you must've shifts. I was second
shift, 4:00 PM to midnight, right?

1746
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:15,240
Every night. Monday through
Thursday or Friday. Monday,
Thursday. Okay. And they go,

1747
01:38:15,241 --> 01:38:19,650
oh, we're having you in on, um, Thursday
during the day, Thanksgiving Day.

1748
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,690
And I'd promised my and
I work second shift.

1749
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:24,840
So they wanted me four to midnight
then in there at nine. And I said, no,

1750
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:28,710
I promised my grandma I'd have
Thanksgiving dinner with lunch with her.

1751
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,690
I could've called my
grandmother's schedule.

1752
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:33,360
I didn't want to be that guy cause I
knew this was one of those, you know,

1753
01:38:33,361 --> 01:38:37,290
things that like, this is the fork road,
a crossroads in your life. And they go,

1754
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:39,930
we'll find someone else to
cover your shift. And I asked,

1755
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:43,440
everyone else had plans and they go,
well we need you midnight, you know,

1756
01:38:43,490 --> 01:38:46,830
the second next day for
lunch. And I said, no.

1757
01:38:47,790 --> 01:38:50,340
And they fired me. And I'm
very, very glad I did that.

1758
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,300
And I had lunch with grandma.

1759
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:55,500
Her mom had just died or they allowed
to fire you for that if it's not your

1760
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:59,600
shift. Yeah, of course they
are. Of course. Well, no,

1761
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:04,050
the shift every week they would get the
calendar, right. So this week, right? Oh,

1762
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:07,120
I see. So you wasn't, you didn't
have a specific shift came Michael,

1763
01:39:07,270 --> 01:39:10,770
every day you come in at eight o'clock,
I usually did.

1764
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:14,730
Or forklift when you had holidays,
things had to change. And I'm like, well,

1765
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:19,440
I don't care. And I, and no
regrets. Well worked out. It did.

1766
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:22,620
But did you ever think that you'd
be like this? Uh, what are you,

1767
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,270
what do you opened it? I'm a, I'm a,
what am I an author? Media personality,

1768
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:30,960
I think is the word central
though. Immediately I went
right to it about myself.

1769
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,340
I saw that you wanted to be a troll.

1770
01:39:33,530 --> 01:39:37,470
Like first thing you think on it is like
if someone says like, what do you do?

1771
01:39:37,471 --> 01:39:42,020
You like trouble. Ah, I'm an author now
what? Actually, you know what I say? Uh,

1772
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,960
when people ask me what I do,
I say, you know, those, uh,

1773
01:39:43,980 --> 01:39:48,840
obnoxious people who have a job giving,
they're uninformed opinion. That's me.

1774
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:52,920
That's what I usually say. Interesting.
Yeah. Isn't that funny that that's a job.

1775
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:57,090
All you have to do is be
kind of entertaining and
have an interesting way of

1776
01:39:57,091 --> 01:39:57,924
looking at things.

1777
01:39:58,410 --> 01:40:02,250
It's great that this is what I'm talking
about being blessed and I don't take it

1778
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:05,600
for granted and the fact that like people
pay my rent because of my sick burns

1779
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:09,180
on Twitter. Unpatriotic Burn,
burn. I love my sick birds.

1780
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:14,210
And you used to be a Microsoft help
representative for Goldman Sachs wanted?

1781
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:19,080
Yeah. Was it Microsoft? Just
Microsoft or at, yeah, all
the Microsoft products. Yeah.

1782
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:23,520
Yeah. Do you use windows? I do. Do you?
Yeah. You don't use apple? I don't,

1783
01:40:23,740 --> 01:40:27,120
I you seem like a guy.
You seem like I use an android phone too.

1784
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:31,080
I haven't enjoyed filling. Ah, I
do a little bit of a contrarian.

1785
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:33,870
I have a little bit,
yeah. Do you like windows?

1786
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:37,590
Because the people that use macs are
just like following the sheep herd.

1787
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:41,100
I use windows because that's
what I was professional on,

1788
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:45,060
so I haven't changed in all this time.
The only thing that bugs me about windows,

1789
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:48,960
I have to constantly be updating.
You turn that shit off.

1790
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:52,130
You have to turn that shit off.
Why? Because on the uptake,

1791
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:56,260
sometimes it's crashed my computer. Oh,
when it updates, so I'm not rolling.

1792
01:40:56,410 --> 01:41:00,190
That fear of the computer, we start.
How often do you update your software?

1793
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,970
But what if they fixed like vulnerability?
They're going to invent new words.

1794
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:07,780
It's fine. It's fine if they get the
squiggly line. When I write the word meme,

1795
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,810
why would I worry about is like
vulnerabilities to the system.

1796
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:15,520
I have everything backed up in three
places. Oh, I'm a crazy person like that.

1797
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:20,140
Okay, so you're ready to rock
and do you run some run a VPN?

1798
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:24,820
No. No. Ooh. Then I'm, and I'm
piloting that shit too. I would you,

1799
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:28,000
I would you say that on there?
I'll shit, they're gonna.

1800
01:41:28,001 --> 01:41:31,330
I think I'm going to get swatted down and
get you gotta get Swat. A real pirate.

1801
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:35,000
They're gonna fucking [inaudible]
me and Madonna with the eyepatch.

1802
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:39,070
Madonna has an iPod. Yeah. You
didn't see that thing. See,

1803
01:41:39,071 --> 01:41:42,620
I think it's a fashion thing, but
it could be a glaucoma thing. One

1804
01:41:44,480 --> 01:41:48,160
just got an eyepatch. Mm. Yeah.
Maybe she's just a fan of slick Rick.

1805
01:41:48,610 --> 01:41:52,630
Do you know who's you know my favorite
comedian? You'll hamburger. Yeah, sure.

1806
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:56,350
I love Neil. He's my absolute favorite
comedian. And one of his jokes is,

1807
01:41:56,530 --> 01:42:00,730
what do you call a senior citizen who
can't help but expose their genitalia in

1808
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:02,590
public?
But Donna,

1809
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:06,490
and he says it all sad.
Oh,

1810
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,640
he's got such a weird act. He's so
funny. Oh, he's the best. It's a strange,

1811
01:42:12,641 --> 01:42:16,240
strange act. Well, he's just basically
like Tony Clifton. Yeah. As as a stand up,

1812
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:20,590
but better but better material. Much
better material. Better presentation.

1813
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:22,810
I talk about Kauffman in the book
because he's the first troll.

1814
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:26,560
[inaudible] Andy Kaufman was
the first chore. Yeah, I agree.

1815
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:29,620
And there's this great, he
had this character, Tony
Clifton. People don't know.

1816
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:34,240
He's just like angry lounge singer. And
Tony did this bid. He would perform,

1817
01:42:34,241 --> 01:42:36,370
I think it was in Atlantic city.
And he said, hey, my wife died.

1818
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:39,640
Whenever I look at my daughters, you
know Stephanie's eyes, I see her.

1819
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:42,160
So that's seven and come out
and do a song, sits on his lap,

1820
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:47,410
they sing her voice cracks, he
smacks her across the face. He goes,

1821
01:42:47,411 --> 01:42:50,580
are you fucking it up? The audience
is booing and goes, don't blow it.

1822
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:54,280
You just got to make her cry more. And
it wasn't even a kid. It's an actress.

1823
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:58,900
You know what I mean? Quarterly. That
is just beautiful. Trolling. Yeah.

1824
01:42:59,290 --> 01:43:03,520
Well he used to cough means to go on stage
and sing the mighty mouse theme song,

1825
01:43:03,730 --> 01:43:08,470
but just the mightiness part. Yeah,
you, you're welcome to save the day.

1826
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:12,670
He did the special, and I think it
was ABC, refuse to air for two years.

1827
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:15,160
And one of the parts, it was like
peewee's playhouse, where piece piece,

1828
01:43:15,161 --> 01:43:17,770
play a house. He had a girl from
sound of music and she's like, oh,

1829
01:43:17,771 --> 01:43:20,530
she's starting to, you know,
restart a career. He called.

1830
01:43:20,531 --> 01:43:23,320
It has been quarter and she comes out.
He goes,

1831
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,830
so at what point did you realize you
weren't gonna make it and show this, this,

1832
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,520
it's just, she's in on it,
you know, but it's just,

1833
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:34,510
you're sitting there, you're like,
oh my God. Even if you're in on it,

1834
01:43:34,511 --> 01:43:37,990
it's kind of staying. And she's like, Oh,
real, I'm trying to restart my career.

1835
01:43:37,991 --> 01:43:40,210
He goes, well, I don't think it's
going to happen for you, but good luck.

1836
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:44,740
And you're just like, oh my God. Well,
how about when he was wrestling women?

1837
01:43:44,860 --> 01:43:47,850
That was this thick of sexual
thing, but yeah, I'm sure. Yeah,

1838
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:52,190
but it was also trolling, isn't it? Yeah,
yeah. Yeah. Was screaming and yelling

1839
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:55,340
and I know that part, but
yeah. Yeah. But I did that.

1840
01:43:55,341 --> 01:43:58,520
I'm not a fan of the fucking
people at the wrestling arenas.

1841
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:01,540
They wanted to kill him. Yeah.
They wanted to fucking kill him.

1842
01:44:01,930 --> 01:44:06,230
They thought it was real. I got Dolph
Ziggler coming up on my show tomorrow. Um,

1843
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:07,940
and he's like,
he come,

1844
01:44:07,941 --> 01:44:11,450
came out once dressed as the
undertaker and the audience,

1845
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:13,110
what he pulls off the head
where like bullying goes. Oh,

1846
01:44:13,111 --> 01:44:15,290
you thought it was really good about him.
You only see once a year,

1847
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,380
so he fucking comes dressed this other
wrestlers just to troll the audience.

1848
01:44:18,381 --> 01:44:23,300
I love that shit. Well, when you got to
think also when coffin was doing this,

1849
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:27,260
there was real discussion as to whether
or not wrestling was real. Yeah.

1850
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:30,500
This is a different
time. Yeah. It's amazing.

1851
01:44:30,501 --> 01:44:33,230
You can look back at these arguments
that people are like, oh yeah, yeah,

1852
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:36,680
it's totally fucking real. He was
taken. Do you know? It's really though,

1853
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:39,200
what's fascinating though, because
with the rise of the MMA, yeah,

1854
01:44:39,201 --> 01:44:41,690
I just saw like the WWE
admass square garden.

1855
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:44,660
We know what the dynamics of
fighting it looks like. Right? Right.

1856
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,230
But the wrestlers,
it's still the same motions.

1857
01:44:48,231 --> 01:44:52,880
It's like we know that if you hit someone
here how they actually react because

1858
01:44:52,881 --> 01:44:54,550
we've seen it thousands of times for real,

1859
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,980
but you guys are still like if
someone punches you in the neck,

1860
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:59,780
you're not going to be
passed out on the floor.

1861
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:03,230
Will also somewhere else who's got upset
because I was explaining that a figure

1862
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:06,260
four leg lock doesn't work.
Not only does it not work,

1863
01:45:06,261 --> 01:45:09,190
but you're setting yourself
up for, he'll hook. Okay. I'm
like, let me explain. Yeah,

1864
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:13,730
and they were mad like how dare
you disrespect for wrestling. What?

1865
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:18,590
It's also like if you close
slides, someone that's going
to hurt you. No, no, no.

1866
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:21,020
That's not true.
If someone 200 pounds hits me here,

1867
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:24,800
it's not going to hurt my
shoulder. No, no, looks fine. Okay,

1868
01:45:24,801 --> 01:45:26,210
then not know what the fuck
I'm talking about this issue.

1869
01:45:26,211 --> 01:45:30,170
I'll fuck you up with a clothes
line. How that's like, dude,

1870
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:32,640
you just hitting someone in
the head with your forearm.

1871
01:45:32,641 --> 01:45:36,620
You could fuck somebody able to close
on really a hundred percent in the neck

1872
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:40,790
one, but it's not going to hurt.
You know? I mean mine. Okay.

1873
01:45:40,950 --> 01:45:44,120
You haven't taught you punched. Somebody
could break your I'm sure, but no.

1874
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:46,590
Are you close on someone? That
shit's totally legit. Okay,

1875
01:45:46,620 --> 01:45:50,330
let me that people get code from that
all the time. It's like a, like a leg.

1876
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:54,020
Like if you kick someone in the neck,
right? Like if someone gets net kicked,

1877
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,940
they go out. Sure. You could do that
with your arm. Same thing. Same motion.

1878
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:02,210
Your Shin is stronger for
sure than your forearm,

1879
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:06,170
but especially this way. See,
there's two bones, right?

1880
01:46:06,171 --> 01:46:10,410
There's the owner and what's the Tibia?
Fibia? No, that's your leg. Okay.

1881
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:14,080
I don't know. Tibias I
broke the fibula. The, the,

1882
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:17,420
the smaller one or the Tibia.
Which one? I broke the little one.

1883
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:22,220
Which one's the Big One? Which one's
your Shin? Your tea. Your femurs.

1884
01:46:22,221 --> 01:46:27,110
The top. And then I left Fibula.
I think it's the fibula. I broke.

1885
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:31,330
I broke the one. What's that? Tibi is the
bigger one. Yeah, I broke the smaller one.

1886
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,720
Okay.
It's fucking gross.

1887
01:46:32,721 --> 01:46:35,450
It was really painful and they
couldn't do anything about it. It just,

1888
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:40,280
it was just a hairline fracture. Oh, see
that guy just close line by this dude.

1889
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:44,300
Boom. Okay. Wow. But the cop
doesn't know how to land it. Look,

1890
01:46:44,301 --> 01:46:46,430
you went down with it too.
He probably broke his fucking arm.

1891
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,820
That's how you fuck that
up top. Broke his arm. See,

1892
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:54,930
it's barely using his arm.
Oh, it definitely works out.
Okay. Yeah, like in the UFC.

1893
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:59,550
Well, the thing is like my point was
I think the big, where's the big bone?

1894
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:03,570
Where's the little bone? I think in
the front this happens all the time.

1895
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,060
Guys get kicked in.
This bone breaks,

1896
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:08,280
well actually sometimes
both of the bones break,

1897
01:47:08,610 --> 01:47:13,320
but it with a spinning back fist when
they're landing at a lot of times they're

1898
01:47:13,321 --> 01:47:15,420
landing it with their,
with their forearm,

1899
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:19,470
what not landing it with the actual fist.
What about Randy Savage?

1900
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:22,860
If you're jumping out the top row on
your elbow when you break your elbow or

1901
01:47:22,861 --> 01:47:24,840
kill the person,
if you're landing on his neck,

1902
01:47:25,410 --> 01:47:30,410
you will hurt him for sure and
you're slamming down the elbow.

1903
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:32,520
It's definitely got more force,

1904
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:36,420
but when you're getting on top of
someone and you're smashing with elbows,

1905
01:47:36,421 --> 01:47:39,750
which you can do an MMA, you can
generate incredible amounts of forest.

1906
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:43,020
If you ever watch a guy work out on the
heavy bag where the heavy bags on the

1907
01:47:43,021 --> 01:47:45,750
ground, they worked the ground
and pound, just boom, boom.

1908
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,900
I mean you think about that being your
fucking head. It's incorrect, but,

1909
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:52,110
and if you're 200 pounds to 50
jumping off a rope on an elbow,

1910
01:47:52,111 --> 01:47:55,560
it's a small point. I would think that
would, I mean, break something in there.

1911
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:58,690
It could, it could just really
hitting him though. He's, yeah,

1912
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:03,300
he doesn't hit him chest, but if that were
for real, but just that, first of all,

1913
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:05,670
the reality is just that alone.
I mean,

1914
01:48:05,671 --> 01:48:09,390
even though he only liked bounces
off of them a little bit. Yeah, he's,

1915
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,360
he's just got it down where
he lands first with the feet.

1916
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:17,070
If you watch the impact, if you
slow down the feet, land first,

1917
01:48:17,071 --> 01:48:21,940
and then he's absorbing all
of it and just, he lands the,

1918
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:26,730
the, the side of his body on the guy's
chest, but it's a secondary impact.

1919
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,660
Boom. See? Oh he collapses
to, it's like a one,

1920
01:48:30,661 --> 01:48:34,230
two and he doesn't hit him that hard,
but he hits him hard enough that it sucks.

1921
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:38,760
Like it ain't fun to be around, so it's
a tough gig. But that shit would work.

1922
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:41,550
Clothes lining, someone would
work. It's just not ideal.

1923
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,360
The ideal thing to do for someone's,
it's just palm them in the face.

1924
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:49,950
If you get close lie on, you could also
just pop them in the face. That's that.

1925
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:53,190
The good thing about the palm and
the face is that first of all,

1926
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:56,550
it's extremely difficult to
break your palm like this.

1927
01:48:56,970 --> 01:48:58,620
Think about what you can do.
Okay,

1928
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:02,520
this is the Oak table and I'm slamming
my hand into it. I have no pain at all.

1929
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:06,240
You can't do that with any other part of
your body. You can't kick it like that.

1930
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:10,080
If with your Shin, you know you can't
punch it like that with your knuckles.

1931
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:13,770
Even your elbow or kind of hurts
more than your palm. The Palm,

1932
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:16,630
you can really fucking smack
the funny bone to. Yes. Yeah,

1933
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:18,730
but you could fuck somebody up
on an elbow and though sure,

1934
01:49:18,731 --> 01:49:22,560
like in Moitai it's one of the eight
points of contact, but a palm strike.

1935
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:24,600
If someone's charging at you,
just smack him.

1936
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:28,830
You could have a tremendous impact on
your hand and still get away with it and

1937
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:33,660
knock someone out. John Hackleman who
is a chuck Liddell's former trainer,

1938
01:49:33,661 --> 01:49:36,660
trainer of um, um, I
actually current trainer for,

1939
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:41,160
he still works out trainer
Glover to sharer just one
of the best guys in MMA. He,

1940
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:43,890
uh,
has these little videos on his Instagram,

1941
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:48,891
I think it's the pit or
pit master pitmaster on
Instagram talking about street

1942
01:49:49,181 --> 01:49:52,650
self defense things and he's
always advocating hitting
people with your palm so

1943
01:49:52,670 --> 01:49:54,550
people break their hands, all the
tonic. Isn't that the whole thing?

1944
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:56,860
He hit him in the nose to kind of,
that's not real. That's not real.

1945
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:00,730
The idea of drive the bone up,
you'll break their nose.

1946
01:50:00,740 --> 01:50:01,630
Not that you're gonna kill them,

1947
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:04,540
but like that's the easiest self defense
anywhere. Even the side of the head.

1948
01:50:04,541 --> 01:50:06,790
But the idea is hitting
them with the palm.

1949
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:08,380
I thought you were going to say
when I said that's not real.

1950
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:11,470
There was one where kids, it
was like a, in a karate movie,

1951
01:50:11,940 --> 01:50:15,490
the guy would hit the palm up to the nose.
The nose bone would go into the brain.

1952
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:17,950
It would kill some ones that
happened in like a Seagal movie.

1953
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:21,190
Smash him in the nose.
I thought you were gonna say that,

1954
01:50:21,191 --> 01:50:25,300
but the idea is that you could
just without worry of consequences,

1955
01:50:25,330 --> 01:50:28,900
you could palm strike someone in the face
like really hard and never break your

1956
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:31,330
hand.
A regular person throwing a punch,

1957
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:35,380
you have a real good chance of breaking
your hand. Okay. Real good chance.

1958
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:37,300
Like if you crack someone in the forehead,

1959
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:40,090
most likely you're gonna break your
hand or your wrist or something else.

1960
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:43,540
But with your palms you can
just fucking waylay somebody.

1961
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:46,060
You could smack the shit out of somebody,
but you're going to look kind of silly.

1962
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:49,540
There was, uh, an organization,

1963
01:50:49,541 --> 01:50:52,210
the MMA more organization back in
the early days called pancreas.

1964
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,400
I think he might be still around,
but they have modified rules.

1965
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:58,810
But pancreas back in the day they were
wrestling shoes with Shin pads and they

1966
01:50:58,811 --> 01:51:03,250
wore like little tiny little speedos and
they would smack each other with their

1967
01:51:03,251 --> 01:51:06,460
hands so they'd kick and punch
and do submission techniques.

1968
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:11,080
It was fairly crude in
comparison to today's MMA. Sure.

1969
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:13,720
But we got to see a lot of leg
locks back then. And there was,

1970
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:15,580
there was some fishy fights too.

1971
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:20,080
But my point is like boss route and was
the first guy figured out how to really

1972
01:51:20,081 --> 01:51:22,150
fuck people up with palm strikes.

1973
01:51:22,570 --> 01:51:27,250
And what he did is he has
a really flexible wrists
and he's a bad ass striker.

1974
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:31,000
So he learned how to pull his hands way
back and he would just throw them like

1975
01:51:31,001 --> 01:51:34,480
punches. He would just do the same
motions that he would do with a punch,

1976
01:51:34,690 --> 01:51:37,330
but just smash guides with his,
with his palms.

1977
01:51:37,630 --> 01:51:40,790
And he was lighting people up like a
Christmas tree in Pancrase with that

1978
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:45,400
horrific to what he fucked. He came out
a bunch of people with his palms. Huh?

1979
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:50,430
See if you've watched boss Rutan Kao
put put boss route and Kaos Funai he

1980
01:51:50,861 --> 01:51:55,861
catered food [inaudible] who is a like
an elite MMA fighter who was a Hixon

1981
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:59,050
Gracie's last opponent and
Hickson was fighting MMA.

1982
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:04,410
But for Nakia I think started out in
pancreas and boss route and code them.

1983
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,430
And the way K Odom was like,
like like a punch,

1984
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:13,330
but he was doing it with his palms,
just smashing people.

1985
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:15,640
So it's like your hand,

1986
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:19,300
like there's a lot of things that you
think wouldn't work. Clothes lines,

1987
01:52:19,301 --> 01:52:22,920
one of them. That shit would work. Okay.
That's my point. Not The hockey talk.

1988
01:52:22,921 --> 01:52:24,760
Bands move though.
What's the a hundred on a shake?

1989
01:52:24,761 --> 01:52:26,830
Rattle and roll and it just
flips him on his back. It's like,

1990
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:29,530
why does this even hurt?
You don't remember this.

1991
01:52:29,531 --> 01:52:32,290
You didn't watch wrestling in the
eighties no. Well, how about the DDT here?

1992
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:37,030
So here's bacilli that knee, but the
knee, you have a backup before that.

1993
01:52:37,031 --> 01:52:40,930
Back Up. Before that. Here, watch.
Watch how he's hitting him. He's so,

1994
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:44,110
he's using like a boss was a fucking
gorilla back. They look the size of them.

1995
01:52:44,230 --> 01:52:47,380
See smacking shit out of him.
He's using his head.

1996
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:50,090
She always hitting him
with his [inaudible]. He's
thrown them like punches.

1997
01:52:50,091 --> 01:52:53,930
But this knee is what did it.
Boom. Yeah. Boss was a beast, man.

1998
01:52:53,931 --> 01:52:55,700
He was a fucking beast.

1999
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:01,840
He was probably the first really elite
striker that we saw an MMA where you're

2000
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:05,330
like, whoa, like this is what can happen.

2001
01:53:05,331 --> 01:53:08,990
Like when he was kicking people in
Pancrase, everybody was like, whoa.

2002
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,900
Like this is this guy can fucking kick.

2003
01:53:12,140 --> 01:53:15,830
Like you're seeing a lot of guys who are
kicking that were kind of like karate

2004
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:20,690
bay. Maybe they didn't have as much power,
but boss was, he was a Dutch kickbox.

2005
01:53:20,691 --> 01:53:24,120
He was smashing people.
Boom. He looks scary.

2006
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:28,670
He was a bad motherfucker.
Bad motherfucker. He won
the UFC heavyweight title.

2007
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:30,950
He was the first guy ever,

2008
01:53:30,951 --> 01:53:35,951
I think in my recollection to win
a title off of his back by uh,

2009
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:41,960
from strikes. He fought Kevin Random
and Kevin ran him as a badass wrestler,

2010
01:53:41,961 --> 01:53:45,890
kept taking them down and boss was beating
the shit out of him from the bottom,

2011
01:53:46,100 --> 01:53:48,230
throwing elbows and,
and they gave him a decision,

2012
01:53:48,260 --> 01:53:50,330
which a lot of people disagreed
with. But I was like, man,

2013
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:54,920
you look at the volume of strikes
landed then way more you, you just,

2014
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:56,330
just being on top side.
Good enough.

2015
01:53:56,331 --> 01:54:00,020
You have to actually do something
with the position. Huh? Okay.

2016
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:05,290
This is not a subject expert road.
Yeah, yeah. Hey, yeah, this is,

2017
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:08,630
this is the old school, but you got to
really look at whole body kick. Fuck,

2018
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:13,460
fuck people up, man. Boss.
Ruin was no joke, man. Dude,

2019
01:54:13,461 --> 01:54:17,310
he was fucking people up. They had,
nobody had seen anything like that. This,

2020
01:54:17,570 --> 01:54:20,600
those guys just couldn't strike like that.
They didn't have that kind of power.

2021
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:24,830
You'd see the impact, but then, you know,
like all things, it caught up. Yeah.

2022
01:54:25,890 --> 01:54:28,610
Oh good Lord. The USC, then they got, um,

2023
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:32,870
there was some elite fighters to start
showing up in the UFC or Lando Veit

2024
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:37,190
smashing machine. Mark. Mark. Yeah. Well
he was different man. He was a wrestler.

2025
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:42,360
He was a wrestler slash science project.
Like, yeah, he was used up real good.

2026
01:54:42,670 --> 01:54:44,850
God, that's to put it mildly. Yeah.

2027
01:54:44,851 --> 01:54:48,260
There's a great documentary on the special
machine. You saw it. Yeah. It's amazing.

2028
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,260
It caught him. They, they
were that documentary,

2029
01:54:51,261 --> 01:54:55,640
the purpose of it was initially to
catch him as the scariest fighter on the

2030
01:54:55,641 --> 01:55:00,260
planet. This guy who was just this Goliath
who just dominating people in Japan,

2031
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:04,940
but in the process of documenting
it, he was falling apart. That's him.

2032
01:55:04,941 --> 01:55:09,500
When he was his biggest, he would say
his, his neck would start at his ears

2033
01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:14,870
and he was very skillful as well.

2034
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,420
I mean just really gives all
American wrestler before that, right?

2035
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,270
The elite wrestler and um,
just,

2036
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:24,170
just gigantically that upper left hand
picture. Upper left. Look at that one.

2037
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:28,460
Same One. Yeah, but click on that. That's
the one I started with. No, why is it? No,

2038
01:55:28,461 --> 01:55:31,340
that's different. It's very different.
The same photo. No, it's not.

2039
01:55:31,341 --> 01:55:33,450
It's just different effects.
Photo. Yeah, but look at them.

2040
01:55:33,451 --> 01:55:35,540
But that one looks like shit.
Go to the other one again.

2041
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:39,500
That's a different version of it.
Look at that fucking Jesus Christ.

2042
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:44,100
That is insane. The fact that a
person could get to look like that.

2043
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:47,820
That is insane. There's guys
that look like that at my gym.

2044
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,350
Fuck you all at Harvard fitness are
listening to this show in the locker room

2045
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:55,290
while my scrawny ass is right there.
And you don't even notice me.

2046
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:58,770
You wonder like what? It's like
walking around looking like that. Well,

2047
01:55:58,771 --> 01:56:02,400
you can find out if you took all those
same steroids, but they're also like six,

2048
01:56:02,490 --> 01:56:05,850
you know? Yeah. You would do a
mini version of that. Yeah. Yeah.

2049
01:56:06,190 --> 01:56:10,050
We're likely priests. Yeah.
Do you lift weights? Yeah.
What kind of Shit do you do?

2050
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:15,270
I have a split, uh, six days
a week. Do you have a trainer?

2051
01:56:15,420 --> 01:56:19,410
A yeah. Oh, look at you like a wolf.
You try shout out to Michael Wolf. Yeah,

2052
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:21,840
he's like a deadlift guy.
Yeah, he's a dead lift.

2053
01:56:21,841 --> 01:56:25,710
But it's also important for
me psychologically and for
people who are depressed

2054
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:29,400
or anxious. Uh, I've sometimes
have a lot of downtime.

2055
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:34,830
So if I go to the gym,
I can tell my brain I'm objective Lee,

2056
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,770
a better person than yesterday
and I did something today.

2057
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:40,710
So it really helps with
keeping you mentally grounded.

2058
01:56:40,711 --> 01:56:43,650
I'm never going to get jacked, but
I could see, I learned this from um,

2059
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:46,610
Matt Hughes now. He was the first
one to take me to Jim. Really? Yeah.

2060
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:51,730
Matthew first want to take you to a author
author's book and I realized I don't

2061
01:56:52,501 --> 01:56:56,940
have to look like Mark Kerr. I could still
look like a better version of me. Yes.

2062
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:00,840
And when you have that realization,
it's, it's very liberating.

2063
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:04,800
The mental health benefits and
people need to realize that.

2064
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:07,230
And the thing is other people who are
like, really, like the first day I went,

2065
01:57:07,231 --> 01:57:10,710
I was all nervous and I know what I'm
doing and there was a guy I wish I could

2066
01:57:10,711 --> 01:57:13,320
thank him. He's like, are you done with
this machine? And I'm like, yeah. He goes,

2067
01:57:13,380 --> 01:57:16,320
thanks brother. I'm like, all
right. No one hears judging you.

2068
01:57:16,321 --> 01:57:19,080
Everyone's doing their own shit
and if you're, if you're happy,

2069
01:57:19,081 --> 01:57:22,620
you're working out and if you're fat,
everyone's cheering you on. Yeah, yeah.

2070
01:57:22,690 --> 01:57:25,680
They were like, fuck yeah. You're
getting good for, you know,

2071
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:30,450
the opposite of what people would
think. Yeah. So no one cares.

2072
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:33,300
Uh, it's, I really recommend it. Yeah.

2073
01:57:33,301 --> 01:57:36,030
There's a lot of gyms have
a good culture of support,

2074
01:57:36,210 --> 01:57:38,760
a good culture of encouragement.
You know,

2075
01:57:38,761 --> 01:57:43,740
like this is the reason why a lot of
people that are on Instagram are fitness

2076
01:57:43,741 --> 01:57:48,090
people that are also motivational. Yeah.
This is the culture of these communities.

2077
01:57:48,091 --> 01:57:51,210
Like when you see people doing reps, like,
come on, come on. You got it. You got it.

2078
01:57:51,211 --> 01:57:55,710
You got it. Like that sort of
support. Is it, there's something too,

2079
01:57:55,711 --> 01:57:58,830
there's endorphins that get released when
you're all pushing each other together.

2080
01:57:59,010 --> 01:58:02,840
I mean this one of the big rushes of
martial arts training is that you're,

2081
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:03,720
you're pushing each other,

2082
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:06,420
you work out together and
then afterwards over you just,

2083
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:11,480
everything seems to be more normal and
I seems more rational and I have people

2084
01:58:11,791 --> 01:58:15,290
follow me on Twitter, Insta, like Jack
paypal and they give me advice and,

2085
01:58:15,291 --> 01:58:18,030
and they're very supportive
that, yes, and that's the thing,

2086
01:58:18,031 --> 01:58:20,580
that's the real big misconception
I guess from those movies.

2087
01:58:20,581 --> 01:58:21,380
The sales of Rent Rom,

2088
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:25,800
Rom coms will tell you that the guy who's
like a big guy's a bully and sometimes

2089
01:58:25,801 --> 01:58:28,410
he is, but most of the people who
were like serious about fitness,

2090
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:32,730
they want other people to be like, come
on this, this'll be great for you. Yeah.

2091
01:58:32,731 --> 01:58:36,390
I think most people's experience
with bullies is really
high school stuff, right?

2092
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:39,750
It's like jocks in high school and lot
of them are just, as we were saying,

2093
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:41,740
insecure and a lot of
them are also probably,

2094
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:45,790
it's probably their experience
experiencing at home from their dads.

2095
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,640
And I think that's changed a lot
because thanks to the Internet now.

2096
01:58:48,641 --> 01:58:51,850
I think the jocks respect
the nerds a lot more.

2097
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:54,280
When I was working with Hughes
and I met all those fighters,

2098
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:58,840
they could not be friendlier or more like,
Hey, you're, you're doing your thing.

2099
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:03,460
I do my thing. I can relate to that.
That's awesome. So there was no,

2100
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,750
uh, I'll look at this pussy or
whatever like that, you know. Well,

2101
01:59:07,751 --> 01:59:10,690
fighters are a lot nicer
than people think, but there,

2102
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:13,240
cause they're so disciplined
is that for sure.

2103
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:16,270
And they know what it's like to get their
ass kicked. And it's humbling muscle.

2104
01:59:16,271 --> 01:59:19,540
Jamo who's a famous, a karate guy, he, uh,

2105
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:24,310
he said it's not that fighters are any
nicer, is kind of Tika. He was calling it,

2106
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:27,130
you know,
karate practitioners were any nicer.

2107
01:59:27,131 --> 01:59:28,480
It's just they're tired from training.

2108
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:36,100
He might be right, but they,
they do behave nicer because
of that. It's, it's both.

2109
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:40,330
But I think it's also one of the things
I love about the Internet is that if

2110
01:59:40,331 --> 01:59:41,800
you're doing your thing now,

2111
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:45,310
people respect someone else's doing their
own weird thing as opposed to when we

2112
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:47,920
were kids, there'd be that one
Weirdo. Like I had this tweet.

2113
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:52,210
There's two types of people, right? If
you learn someone is a Guinea pig breeder,

2114
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:55,570
there's two approaches. You're weird.
What the Fuck's wrong with you?

2115
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:59,290
Or sit down and tell me
everything and I'm very much,

2116
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:02,200
and people who follow me are the second
one. It's like you're doing your thing.

2117
02:00:02,201 --> 02:00:05,560
It's gives you joy and passion.
I've never heard of it. Let me know.

2118
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:10,330
I want to know too that I watched an
episode of Anthony Bourdain's old show was

2119
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:15,220
called no reservations and he was in,
I forget what country it was,

2120
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:20,320
but these people bread Guinea pigs for
food. Oh yeah. Sounds like Erica cabbies.

2121
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:20,621
Yeah.

2122
02:00:20,621 --> 02:00:24,310
They had Guinea pigs running around the
house or they were all over the place.

2123
02:00:24,311 --> 02:00:27,040
Yeah. And then when they wanted to
cook something, they reached down,

2124
02:00:27,041 --> 02:00:29,970
grabbed Guinea pig,
just picked it up and killed it,

2125
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:32,880
cooked it all the other kidney
pigs and you fucking know. Oh yeah.

2126
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,820
They said domestic. They're nearly
dumb, but they don't, it's, it's,

2127
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:40,960
it's a good argument for eating Guinea
pigs so they don't seem to miss their

2128
02:00:40,961 --> 02:00:45,820
friend. I just got, uh, someone just
paypaled me a contribution. 300 bucks,

2129
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:50,770
Adam. And he says, go out to dinner or
buy something stupid. Probably Guinea pig.

2130
02:00:50,830 --> 02:00:54,610
Hold on. Not Better. If someone says this
is for stupid things. I'm like, all right.

2131
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:58,850
It's an ardor. It's your money. So I
bought some stupid things. You some money

2132
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:05,230
I got, I got this. And I'm
like, elephant is unethical.

2133
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:08,740
Mm. There's, they recognize themselves
and mirror, they have a social structure.

2134
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:12,660
This is draft. It's stupid. I got draft
a leather wallet. Let me see that.

2135
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:17,520
There you go. Wow. But it's nice and
it's stupid. Wraps are so nice. They're,

2136
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:21,790
they're dumb. They're like cows or that's
dumb. They're just dumb. They're dumb.

2137
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:25,120
They're dumb. Are you sure? I'm
positive to run some tests on.

2138
02:01:25,121 --> 02:01:28,200
My friend owns my friend's parents,
each own a zoo and I've gone,

2139
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:31,600
I've gone with him to different zoos.
Drafts are very dumb,

2140
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:35,890
but they're so peaceful that they
let little kids feed them at the zoo.

2141
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:39,590
That's one of the only animals where
they let people feed them. That's true.

2142
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,540
And they just reach out with their tongue.

2143
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:45,740
Like I'll never forget that my daughter
was like to take it into the zoo and her

2144
02:01:45,741 --> 02:01:47,480
giggling and laughing.
When the naysayers,

2145
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:49,760
the big crazy tongue comes
out and grabs the lettuce,

2146
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:54,560
they can clean their ears with their
tongue boob. Yeah. Um, I would,

2147
02:01:54,590 --> 02:01:58,070
that was a joke that I used to have
about how they are the only animal that I

2148
02:01:58,071 --> 02:01:58,881
could point to.

2149
02:01:58,881 --> 02:02:02,360
That's a wild animal that doesn't seem
to have any problem with domestication.

2150
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:03,830
Yeah.
When they're at the zoo,

2151
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:07,670
that like another day with no
lions and just strolling around.

2152
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:10,610
Did you ever say that to eat though that
blue planet where the lines are trying

2153
02:02:10,611 --> 02:02:14,330
to kill the giraffe and the desert and
she's just kicking him in the face? Dude.

2154
02:02:14,360 --> 02:02:16,640
Shit, they kick them and
break their fucking jaws.

2155
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:21,670
It's really dangerous for lions when they
fuck with zebras or eat your ass drab

2156
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:24,890
zebras as well. But whenever they
fuck with any animal with hubs,

2157
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:29,720
that's probably one of the
reasons why they have hooves.
Yeah. It's like a weapon.

2158
02:02:29,750 --> 02:02:31,370
Same like they have antlers.

2159
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,900
I mean it certainly helps them traverse
difficult terrain and helps them run,

2160
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:36,080
protects her feet.
Where do you,

2161
02:02:36,081 --> 02:02:39,440
where do you draw the line when it comes
to like leather or different animals?

2162
02:02:39,470 --> 02:02:43,060
It's a good question. Yeah. Um, I,

2163
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:47,540
I've gotten very, very interested
in elephants, you know,

2164
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:52,100
in terms of like their social structure
and what they're like and learning about

2165
02:02:52,101 --> 02:02:54,410
how intelligent they are and
how long their memory is.

2166
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:59,411
And I don't want to have anything to do
with elephant leather or ivory prebate a

2167
02:02:59,640 --> 02:03:04,640
queue a long time ago that
had a elephant ear as a wrap.

2168
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:09,540
Okay. And I didn't think anything
of it, but now I think, yeah, I, I,

2169
02:03:09,541 --> 02:03:13,280
that's my line. I like, they have
elephant wallets and I was like, no,

2170
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:17,720
I'm not comfortable with this. Here's the
thing, man. Pigs are super fucking smart.

2171
02:03:18,230 --> 02:03:21,200
Pigs are real sweet.
And when you domesticate them,

2172
02:03:21,530 --> 02:03:24,590
like people have domesticated
pigs that as they're well fed,

2173
02:03:24,591 --> 02:03:26,210
they behave a lot like dogs.

2174
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:29,150
The only difference being of
course if you fall in the pig pen,

2175
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:33,410
they will fucking eat you. Yeah. And
they had to often, that happened.

2176
02:03:33,411 --> 02:03:35,780
That's a very common
way for farmers to die.

2177
02:03:36,050 --> 02:03:39,410
They fall in the pig pen in the file, like
scraps at clothes and like, oh my God,

2178
02:03:39,770 --> 02:03:43,790
I'm just a puddle of blood. My
Buddy, the fuck is left there. Yeah.

2179
02:03:43,791 --> 02:03:47,840
So I know now, thankfully they're coming
out with this kind of synthetic food,

2180
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:52,090
synthetic amaze people know
that mimics pork or chicken. Oh,

2181
02:03:52,190 --> 02:03:55,360
mimicking it's actual chicken cells
or pork cells or whatever. Yes. Yes.

2182
02:03:55,361 --> 02:03:57,810
And that's going to be a great
day. Yeah. That brings me the,

2183
02:03:57,811 --> 02:04:00,310
the beyond burger that people keep.

2184
02:04:00,311 --> 02:04:03,200
It googled this cause I want to make
sure this is true because someone sent me

2185
02:04:03,201 --> 02:04:08,060
this, I didn't have the time
to check, uh, beyond meat, uh,

2186
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:11,180
test positive for glyphosate,
glyphosate.

2187
02:04:11,181 --> 02:04:13,360
Glyphosate is roundup masonic hall.

2188
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:16,880
It's very fucking dangerous
that trying to pretend it's not.

2189
02:04:16,881 --> 02:04:20,990
But meanwhile the addition out
fucking lawsuits when one couple got,

2190
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,820
was it $2 billion,

2191
02:04:22,821 --> 02:04:27,440
they got a $2 billion ruling
against Monsanto and another
guy got 5 million to 2

2192
02:04:27,440 --> 02:04:29,690
billion cause they got cancer being
pesticides. I'm like, yeah, give me the,

2193
02:04:29,691 --> 02:04:32,510
I'll drink this shit.
I've got a good lawyers were big,

2194
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:35,320
they're probably going to lose. And I
mean that seems like a lot of money. Yeah,

2195
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:38,190
of course. Um, but I was reading

2196
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:40,020
that uh, that, you know, fits a,

2197
02:04:40,021 --> 02:04:44,550
it's a meat based in a non meat based
Burger that's supposed to taste pretty

2198
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,160
similar to me.
I haven't had one yet,

2199
02:04:46,161 --> 02:04:48,480
but what I'm saying is now they
figured out how to take yeah.

2200
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:53,250
Sales and replicate that it actually is
meat. No. Right. No animals being killed.

2201
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:56,790
Right. Which is the ideal. I just wonder
if there's any, it's dangerous for you,

2202
02:04:57,030 --> 02:04:59,820
but this glyphosate thing,
I need to find out if this is correct.

2203
02:04:59,850 --> 02:05:01,710
That's the only reason why I
brought it up. I just remembered.

2204
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:03,990
And I think it's important
for people to have,

2205
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:07,650
this is one of the best things about
that whole kind of a Paleo whole foods

2206
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:11,970
situation of no way. If you're going to
act in a certain way towards your food,

2207
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:16,290
know what you're doing and be happy
to draw that line about, okay,

2208
02:05:16,291 --> 02:05:20,760
what are you comfortable with and
defend your decision. Yeah. Yeah. What,

2209
02:05:20,761 --> 02:05:25,280
what are you willing to kill? You know,
uh, my friend Chris Pratt? Hell yes. Um,

2210
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:26,880
he's got a farm,

2211
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:31,740
he's got his own thing that he does
and he takes lamb and you know,

2212
02:05:31,741 --> 02:05:35,550
he,
he puts the rod on their head and yeah,

2213
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:37,680
and puts him to sleep and they have
no idea what's going to happen.

2214
02:05:38,070 --> 02:05:39,840
And then they just die instantly.

2215
02:05:39,841 --> 02:05:44,841
And he made this like really detailed
post on Instagram about it and people got

2216
02:05:44,881 --> 02:05:46,710
super upset with them.
You know,

2217
02:05:46,720 --> 02:05:51,480
that he talked about this as a peaceful
thing and that he has these animals that

2218
02:05:51,481 --> 02:05:55,680
he loves and cares for and you can see
pictures of him like touching them and

2219
02:05:55,681 --> 02:06:00,480
holding them and then later they're
packaged up as meat. And I'm like, but,

2220
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:05,040
but you've, you saw just a steak,
you wouldn't have a problem with it.

2221
02:06:05,160 --> 02:06:07,620
Like if someone said, look, I cook the
steak, you'd get a lot of people are like,

2222
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:08,483
Ooh,
that looks good.

2223
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:12,540
But if it's like I killed this
animal and now I'm going to cook it,

2224
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:14,400
people are like,
you're a monster.

2225
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:16,770
Everyone has to other than
getting hit by a car son.

2226
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:20,830
And people have to put down their dogs and
their cats. Yeah. So maybe this is not,

2227
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:25,380
and that lamb is being bred for that
purpose and it's being done painlessly.

2228
02:06:25,410 --> 02:06:26,370
That's the important thing.

2229
02:06:26,430 --> 02:06:29,790
And I'm sure that Lam had a good life
and it wasn't a factory crowded shoulder

2230
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:33,240
to shoulder existence is torture
situation. Yeah, I'm sure.

2231
02:06:33,241 --> 02:06:36,780
But it's a very quick life, you know.
And Lamb is a baby lambs, a baby.

2232
02:06:36,781 --> 02:06:40,680
She nature's about us eating babies.
Yeah, I have no, I haven't had mutton.

2233
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:44,550
I haven't had like a sheep, sheep,
you know, that's such a British thing.

2234
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:47,430
And it's always like in these old
storybooks you read. But like now,

2235
02:06:47,431 --> 02:06:49,590
I don't think he'd get become
adult unless they're for,

2236
02:06:49,591 --> 02:06:54,120
they're for or their hair.
Well, I, I've had wild sheep.
My Friend Remy, Remy Warren,

2237
02:06:54,121 --> 02:06:58,860
he gave me some, um,
some, um, wild sheep. Um,

2238
02:06:59,010 --> 02:07:03,490
backstrap it was very good. Some wild
sheep that he killed. I'm going to,

2239
02:07:03,780 --> 02:07:07,600
while I'm here, I'm big on dry.
Um, hagfish have you ever had that?

2240
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:11,910
That's that weird fucking slimy
thing at the bottom. The ocean.

2241
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:15,940
How do they cook that? I,
it's Korean barbecue. There's
one place here that has it.

2242
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:20,400
I like, oh, super legit Korean barbecue.
Yeah. They're cooking. Hagfish yeah.

2243
02:07:20,520 --> 02:07:22,810
While I'm cooking it, I guess
technically. What does it taste like?

2244
02:07:22,830 --> 02:07:26,640
Like I haven't tried it yet. I can't wait.
What's the reports? Uh, not that good.

2245
02:07:27,870 --> 02:07:30,180
I'm not surprised to like
sign me up. Well, I like,

2246
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:33,120
since I have a zoology
background, I like, I'm like Noah,

2247
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:36,040
but I want to eat at two of every
animal, you know? Have you had yet? I

2248
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,580
have it. It's tasteless. It's
weird plastic. Yeah. It's
the sauce that hasn't chest.

2249
02:07:39,581 --> 02:07:40,414
Yeah.
Strange.

2250
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:45,310
I ate at a restaurant that's in the win.
Yeah.

2251
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:50,400
It's in the win and it's the only five
star Chinese restaurant in the country or

2252
02:07:50,981 --> 02:07:55,870
in North America. It's insanely
good. Like you realize like wow,

2253
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:59,380
it's true. Like you don't see
a whole lot of gourmet, right?

2254
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:03,760
Like super high end Chinese restaurants.
What? Did you have anything weird there?

2255
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:07,930
Yeah, I had that. I had jellyfish
cucumber had no, I didn't have that.

2256
02:08:07,931 --> 02:08:10,510
I had abalone. That was
really, I was not that.

2257
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,910
A lot of times it's like credit cards.
Abalone. Yeah. It wasn't the taste. Yeah.

2258
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,800
I've had abalone before and I liked it.
I liked it. I don't, I don't love it.

2259
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:19,600
It's expensive too.
What do you got Jamie?

2260
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:23,830
So from a couple of articles I just
found the, the issue seems to be,

2261
02:08:23,831 --> 02:08:27,700
and pea protein, which is what is
used to make these burgers and dark.

2262
02:08:27,940 --> 02:08:31,660
What I've found about what you were
saying is the impossible Burger actually

2263
02:08:31,661 --> 02:08:36,661
tested 11 times higher when tested for
glyphosate than the beyond Meat Burger,

2264
02:08:36,671 --> 02:08:39,160
which is, there's two different
versions of what's in very light weight.

2265
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:42,400
I eat pea protein, protein chips
every day. Is that a problem?

2266
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:45,790
So there's an article that you're getting
some glyphosates. What does that mean?

2267
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,990
Bloomberg not good says pea protein could
have its own concerns. Detox project,

2268
02:08:49,991 --> 02:08:53,290
a research organization looking into
pesticides of glyphosate has been looking

2269
02:08:53,291 --> 02:08:56,910
into it for every year. It says
that there is an issue, there's hot,

2270
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,410
we can hardly find a
clean protein anywhere.

2271
02:08:59,530 --> 02:09:03,520
The results like those for other products
tested for the popular pesticides

2272
02:09:03,521 --> 02:09:05,530
aren't pretty.
It's a very,

2273
02:09:05,680 --> 02:09:09,100
we can hardly find the clean
pea protein source anywhere.

2274
02:09:09,160 --> 02:09:12,160
Jesus Christ's all got glyphosate.
There's,

2275
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:15,070
but I still don't know what
glyphosate does to Kate glyphosate.

2276
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:16,540
This was the idea.
Okay,

2277
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:21,660
and please Google this
because the argument was
glyphosate is great because it

2278
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:26,230
just kills the weeds and bacteria
and it doesn't kill people.

2279
02:09:26,300 --> 02:09:29,560
You actually drink it with a problem
they're saying is, no, no, no.

2280
02:09:29,860 --> 02:09:34,390
You have bacteria in your body,
so if you're taking in glyphosate,

2281
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:38,110
you're killing the bacteria in your body.
It might not kill you,

2282
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:41,590
but it's not good for you and
it fucks up your system. Okay.

2283
02:09:42,130 --> 02:09:46,300
This is the argument, I guess,
that they use to present in court.

2284
02:09:46,330 --> 02:09:51,070
They must have used this to, to get the
jury to award them $2 billion in damage.

2285
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,030
Cancer. Yeah. Yeah. That's
not a Monsanto parent company.

2286
02:09:55,031 --> 02:09:59,770
Bayer fee faces thousands of roundup
cancer cases after $2 billion verdict.

2287
02:10:00,430 --> 02:10:05,410
13,000 cases right now. Yeah. Listen
man, this thing, I don't know.

2288
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:08,740
See there's this, this is what the
problem, first of all, I'm a moron.

2289
02:10:08,890 --> 02:10:12,010
I don't know anything about any of the
science behind this. When I read this,

2290
02:10:12,011 --> 02:10:14,650
I see two different camps.
Just like so many other things.

2291
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:18,580
I see people saying there's no evidence.
This is just, they're all hysteria.

2292
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:22,180
But is that the people
that work for Bayer,

2293
02:10:22,210 --> 02:10:25,720
is that like their PR firm that's
putting this out there to try to like

2294
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:29,440
alleviate people's concerns and
stopped some lawsuits in their tracks?

2295
02:10:29,441 --> 02:10:33,590
They try and do influence public opinion
on this or is there real that shows

2296
02:10:33,591 --> 02:10:34,820
that this stuff is very bad for you,

2297
02:10:34,821 --> 02:10:38,690
but there's definitely a bunch of people
online that are telling you that it's

2298
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,730
horrible for you here,

2299
02:10:40,010 --> 02:10:44,420
exposure to glyphosate based herbicides
in a risk for non Hodgkin Lymphoma,

2300
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:46,940
a Meta analysis and supporting evidence.

2301
02:10:47,450 --> 02:10:49,940
I don't want to switch up my pea protein.
[inaudible] good bro.

2302
02:10:50,070 --> 02:10:54,530
[inaudible] hemp protein.
Good. That should get tested
too then. What am I saying?

2303
02:10:54,590 --> 02:10:58,550
Just start eating steak. I
can't, it's hard for me to
eat much. What's the problem,

2304
02:10:58,551 --> 02:11:00,540
bro?
That's

2305

2311
02:11:30,491 --> 02:11:31,324
um,

2312
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:36,550
I have a fight companion
Twitter feed that's going,

2313
02:11:36,610 --> 02:11:40,330
I'm not Twitter feed. Um,
text message group text.

2314
02:11:41,500 --> 02:11:43,880
Here it is. Robert
Frank. Hold on a second.

2315
02:11:46,670 --> 02:11:50,320
Abortion. Yeah, it's here. I'm going
to send this to you. Hang on a second.

2316
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:56,020
Do you know what it is, Jamie?
Robert Frank. Six one five private.

2317
02:11:56,470 --> 02:12:00,850
It is, yeah. Oh No. Oh, so he's got
a sign up. Got million followers,

2318
02:12:00,851 --> 02:12:02,740
but like I don't follow him.
Oh,

2319
02:12:02,741 --> 02:12:07,630
it's one of them deals because he says
a lot of crazy shit. All right, so, um,

2320
02:12:08,560 --> 02:12:11,710
how long does it take to be
the length? Fabulous yet. Okay.

2321
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:15,340
Hold on a second.
I'm going to text it to you right now.

2322
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,020
How long does it usually
take for what those people,

2323
02:12:17,021 --> 02:12:20,230
they have to be either one of those
dorks and sit in front of the computer or

2324
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:24,640
someone's doing it for, yeah.
Yeah. He must've allowed me in.

2325
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:29,920
All right. I'm sending it
to you right now. Bam. Okay.

2326
02:12:30,250 --> 02:12:32,380
It went through.
Do you go through

2327
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:40,060
anyway? It's hilarious
in post. It's hilarious.

2328
02:12:40,061 --> 02:12:41,190
This is no taking anything out.

2329
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:47,120
No need to.
No need to try and make it smoother.

2330
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:50,930
It's hard to put the calories
down though, is my point. No,

2331
02:12:50,931 --> 02:12:54,810
it's not open your mouth chew
swallow what? Your baby, your,

2332
02:12:54,811 --> 02:12:57,530
your grandfather would have died
for a steak like this. Jesus Christ.

2333
02:12:57,531 --> 02:12:58,364
Listen to yourself.

2334
02:12:58,610 --> 02:13:01,070
You saying all this shit that you would
get mad at people if they were saying

2335
02:13:01,071 --> 02:13:04,970
about any other subject. It's hard. It's
hard to eat all that food. It's hard.

2336
02:13:05,150 --> 02:13:07,520
It's hard to get by in this
world. It's hard. It's hard.

2337
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:11,450
It's hard to get up every morning.
It's hard. I work hard. I work hard.

2338
02:13:11,870 --> 02:13:15,980
How fucking hard is the deed steak? Look
at me, Bro. Just eat it. Cook it. Eat it.

2339
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:19,340
Put some salt on it.
D licious maybe like some steak sauce.

2340
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:22,670
Do whatever you gotta do to get
that steak down your stomach, sir.

2341
02:13:23,180 --> 02:13:27,050
Get some grass fed. Grass
Fed, grass fed, grass raised.

2342
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:31,640
It's got a darker, richer taste. It
seems like a lot of work. Grass Fed. No,

2343
02:13:31,680 --> 02:13:35,330
just cooking steaks all the time. Slot
that hard. You learn how to do it.

2344
02:13:35,331 --> 02:13:39,030
It's easy. Is it? Get yourself a nice
grill. All right. I'm in Brooklyn though.

2345
02:13:39,060 --> 02:13:43,080
You're in Brooklyn. You got a yard?
No, no. Oh, hang on Brooklyn. Come on.

2346
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:45,930
Get a cast iron skillet. I can
get one. That's all I need.

2347
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:48,810
It's not going to think of my house.
Yeah, it'll stick up your house. Okay,

2348
02:13:49,160 --> 02:13:52,860
meg steak. Yeah, go man's house.
Smell good. People will be like,

2349
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:57,090
tease that Michael's live
in. Good. He's got the steak.

2350
02:13:57,091 --> 02:14:00,560
Life could be knocking on doors that
butcher box bros at grass fed and legal.

2351
02:14:00,561 --> 02:14:03,030
Oh look, just cut it for me. Let me see
what you got. You got a medium rare.

2352
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:07,170
Oh yeah. Kosher salt. Yeah. Crushed. Well,

2353
02:14:07,171 --> 02:14:10,680
I got to be kosher so it's a thicker,
so that's why I use,

2354
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:14,800
I like the pyramid salt. What's that?
It's shaped like a pyramid that crystals.

2355
02:14:15,230 --> 02:14:18,230
Yeah, they do it a certain
way. No, it's crunchier.

2356
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:22,110
If you want to cook a steak like a man
correctly, you need to kosher salt. Okay.

2357
02:14:22,290 --> 02:14:26,580
How many, how much grams of protein
or a steak? A lot. So I need to know,

2358
02:14:27,060 --> 02:14:29,220
shut your fucking mouth.

2359
02:14:31,350 --> 02:14:33,870
I followed my macros
every day. Oh, do you?

2360
02:14:33,871 --> 02:14:35,250
Are you really getting serious about that?

2361
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,990
I've always been cause I
have an eating disorders,

2362
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,860
so this is a way to put that in a
good direction. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um,

2363
02:14:41,040 --> 02:14:43,890
you'd have to look, I mean it's,
it's certainly more for wild game,

2364
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:48,540
which is mostly what I eat than it
is for a store bought meat. Okay.

2365
02:14:48,570 --> 02:14:49,740
But store bought meat,
I would,

2366
02:14:49,770 --> 02:14:54,770
I would guarantee you that there's
more nutrients in grass fed meat.

2367
02:14:54,810 --> 02:14:58,080
I don't know if there's more protein.
That doesn't seem to make sense.

2368
02:14:58,350 --> 02:15:01,740
But if you look at like it could be more
protein because they might be less fat

2369
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:03,990
or whatever, but more
fat. Yes, that's true too.

2370
02:15:03,991 --> 02:15:06,330
Of course it would be more
protein if it was leaner. Yeah.

2371
02:15:06,360 --> 02:15:09,720
For the same amount of ounces.
Yeah. But there's also, um,

2372
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:14,750
a bunch of other shit am tour
and essential fatty acids
that exist and grass fed

2373
02:15:16,501 --> 02:15:18,900
meat. It's all good. It's
all good stuff. Okay,

2374
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:22,400
let's get some state stop with the pea
protein, bro. Okay. Sorry. Approach.

2375
02:15:22,410 --> 02:15:25,440
I'm not eating your people. It might
be fucking you up, man. I wonder,

2376
02:15:25,441 --> 02:15:26,830
I wonder how many people
are getting fired.

2377
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:31,800
What are the dangers of
consuming glyphosate other
than non Hodgkin's lymphoma?

2378
02:15:31,860 --> 02:15:35,340
Maybe this is what you're seeing over
and over and people kill my gains.

2379
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:39,570
There was my date. I don't think
pea protein is helping your gains.

2380
02:15:39,571 --> 02:15:42,660
There's something about knowing that
you're getting all your protein from peas,

2381
02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:46,200
all of it.
Some of it just makes you 60 grams a day.

2382
02:15:48,210 --> 02:15:51,150
What do you got to an endocrine
disruptor. Oh, that's no joke.

2383
02:15:52,590 --> 02:15:55,800
That's what glyphosate, oh, fuck.
Liver disease. Birth defects,

2384
02:15:55,801 --> 02:15:59,130
reproductive problems and animals.
Oh Christ.

2385
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:02,720
What does this from a just typed
in dangerous of glyphosate.

2386
02:16:02,740 --> 02:16:05,040
I don't want to get you,
I don't want to get a birth defect.

2387
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:08,850
I don't know what that is.
Pull up whatever you RTKL is fine.

2388
02:16:08,851 --> 02:16:12,450
It might be horseshit. We
should otherwise. Dot Org.

2389
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,940
You ask us right to know,
right? To know that doesn't,

2390
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:21,660
that doesn't mean anything. Like what
does it, what does that based on Virginia,

2391
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:26,760
look at that top news on the right
trial for Monsanto. Hometown.

2392
02:16:27,090 --> 02:16:29,160
It's all Monsanto.
Everything's Monsanto.

2393
02:16:29,590 --> 02:16:32,590
This is another genomist just news stories
from today. They're all over the news.

2394
02:16:32,620 --> 02:16:35,800
Right? But you gotta be carry this.
This is not real story though.

2395
02:16:35,801 --> 02:16:40,110
Look at all the top news is all my
contact. I bet you it's just some,

2396
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:45,190
it should have, uh, some dude,
GMOs are low. What is it?

2397
02:16:45,260 --> 02:16:49,610
Or Litigation. Oh, they're
litigating. This is from the
lawyers. Mm. Could be. Yes.

2398
02:16:50,170 --> 02:16:53,260
Pushing for Truth and transparency. This
is the lawyers. Yeah, the food system.

2399
02:16:53,261 --> 02:16:56,470
This is looks,
and if there are $2 billion rulings,

2400
02:16:56,471 --> 02:16:59,890
you can bet your sweet ass shit.

2401
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:02,680
People that are swarming on this subject,
what would it be?

2402
02:17:02,681 --> 02:17:05,860
A better source of information? I
don't know, man. It's a good question.

2403
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:09,910
What do we got here, Alex? Let's
call Alex Salmond. Kill. No, he,

2404
02:17:09,911 --> 02:17:12,190
I dunno if he's up on food stuff.

2405
02:17:12,191 --> 02:17:14,950
He knew about the plastic
wrap that gives you racist.

2406
02:17:14,951 --> 02:17:19,951
You're kind of estrogen ones that makes
the frogs get scientific American.

2407
02:17:20,500 --> 02:17:25,150
Yeah. Okay. That's good.
That's good. That's good.
2009 weed whacking herbicides.

2408
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:29,230
It's deadly to human cells. Used in
gardens, farms in parks around the world.

2409
02:17:29,230 --> 02:17:33,310
The weed killer roundup
contains an ingredient that
can suffocate human cells in

2410
02:17:33,311 --> 02:17:35,320
a laboratory. Researchers say, yeah,

2411
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:39,700
so we'll kill my gains if it's suffocating
myself. Fuck that. Whatever that is.

2412
02:17:39,940 --> 02:17:42,820
Whatever, whatever has that
on it. Fuck that stuff. Okay.

2413
02:17:42,821 --> 02:17:46,210
I'm going to go more weight than
carnivore. Die. That's your move. Okay.

2414
02:17:46,440 --> 02:17:51,070
And I'd like Jordan Peterson. Jordan on
cardboard. Yes. Okay. Over a year. Huh?

2415
02:17:51,610 --> 02:17:54,290
It's helped him tremendously.
How so? Well, first of all,

2416
02:17:54,291 --> 02:17:58,240
and intellectually he says it's really
alleviated a lot of his autoimmune issues

2417
02:17:58,241 --> 02:18:02,170
that he thinks we're slowing him down
and wearing him out and making him tired

2418
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:04,480
and he has more energy for things.

2419
02:18:04,481 --> 02:18:07,180
He says he's at his peak
intellectually and he credits that.

2420
02:18:07,181 --> 02:18:11,350
A lot of that through this diet. He's
lost 50 pounds. All he eats is meat.

2421
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:14,830
When I'm saying all eats is meat, I
mean that's it. What about drinks?

2422
02:18:14,831 --> 02:18:17,380
I brought stuff. There is none.
He doesn't have any of that.

2423
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:21,430
He drinks water and he eats meat. And for
the below you all what? I've heard this,

2424
02:18:21,431 --> 02:18:24,810
I heard that. Okay. You know what
else I heard? I heard that uh,

2425
02:18:24,890 --> 02:18:28,180
the food pyramid was all green at the
bottom and that's not the case anymore,

2426
02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:29,800
right?
There's a lot of shit.

2427
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:32,530
And I'm not saying this is for everybody
because it's not for everybody.

2428
02:18:32,531 --> 02:18:34,870
It's not even good for everybody.
There's a lot of people,

2429
02:18:34,871 --> 02:18:37,690
if they ate meat every day, all
day, probably be terrible for them.

2430
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:39,950
But for some people in PR,

2431
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,730
it seems that particularly people with
autoimmune disorders, they achieve some,

2432
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:48,010
at least anecdotally, some
really positive results. Um,

2433
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:50,200
Jordan Peterson has
gone as far as to take,

2434
02:18:50,201 --> 02:18:55,201
I think he took three blood tests when
he had a one year in for insurance

2435
02:18:55,361 --> 02:18:57,880
purposes and which things
showed because you know,

2436
02:18:57,881 --> 02:19:02,881
obviously you're going to ensure a guy
who's 55 years old just eat steak all the

2437
02:19:02,951 --> 02:19:06,340
time. Like, Oh my God, this guy's
going to die. No, everything's fine.

2438
02:19:06,370 --> 02:19:10,690
Everything's healthy. Um, no
coronary artery disease, no plaque,

2439
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:13,180
no cholesterol levels are all fine.
Everything's fine.

2440
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:16,630
This sounds like it would be exorbitant
though too. Financially. Yeah.

2441
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:20,350
I'm maybe not the cheapest
way to eat the world. I mean,

2442
02:19:20,351 --> 02:19:25,210
you can get Costco steaks. You get, uh,
some supermarkets have cheaper cuts.

2443
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:27,350
I'd really depends on what know.

2444
02:19:27,351 --> 02:19:31,940
You could also eat just ground beef
that's not as bad. You don't eat as much.

2445
02:19:32,090 --> 02:19:34,910
And that's one of the
reasons why when you're on a,

2446
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:37,910
what they call an elimination diet,
one of the, one of the coolest,

2447
02:19:37,940 --> 02:19:41,630
you eliminate base basically everything
that might be fucking with you except

2448
02:19:41,631 --> 02:19:43,760
the one thing that you can consume easily.

2449
02:19:43,761 --> 02:19:46,070
And this is one of the things that
they're calling the carnivore diet

2450
02:19:46,280 --> 02:19:50,960
elimination and elimination diet. Um, when
you do, do you wind up eating less food,

2451
02:19:51,470 --> 02:19:54,860
which is one of the reasons why these
people just eat steak and wind up losing

2452
02:19:54,861 --> 02:19:58,890
weight. They don't, they don't take in
any car. Let's they're off basically.

2453
02:19:58,891 --> 02:20:02,060
It also kind of Atkins if they're
not taking a car, sort of,

2454
02:20:02,090 --> 02:20:05,450
but there's a thing called
glucogenesis and uh,

2455
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:08,930
like not necessarily sort
of Atkins but sort of Quito,

2456
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:13,520
but it's more Atkins than Kido and that,
that Atkins Diet works.

2457
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:15,860
You stick to it,
it does work.

2458
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:18,620
And when you stepped away and when
your piece starts to smell, it's great.

2459
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:23,060
That's when you know the party started.
You're in Quito. Genesis. Great. Yeah,

2460
02:20:23,061 --> 02:20:26,030
ptosis, ptosis. And when
you're in Ketosis, man,

2461
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:29,930
you really do have energy throughout
the day because your body is not craving

2462
02:20:29,931 --> 02:20:33,200
carbohydrates. You don't have this
up and down blood sugar crash.

2463
02:20:34,010 --> 02:20:37,070
The thing about the carnivore diet
is it's not even ketogenic really.

2464
02:20:37,071 --> 02:20:40,160
I mean you're in Ketosis sometimes,
but you're not eating that much fat.

2465
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:43,370
You're just eating a lot of
meat and a lot of it with fat.

2466
02:20:43,400 --> 02:20:47,360
Some of it without fat. That's not
ketosis is look, when you have no carbs,

2467
02:20:47,361 --> 02:20:49,250
it's not a function. No. Here's why,

2468
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:54,020
because when your body eats a lot of steak
and you don't have any carbohydrates,

2469
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:58,970
you, your body does something
called glucogenesis where
it'll convert stake into

2470
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:04,000
glucose so it actually convert protein
into glucose and it actually knock you

2471
02:21:04,041 --> 02:21:08,390
out of Ketosis. If you take in too
much protein and not enough fat,

2472
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,830
it's got a portion.

2473
02:21:09,890 --> 02:21:14,710
Ketosis is I think somewhere
in the 80% range. If you you,

2474
02:21:14,711 --> 02:21:18,080
you should be consuming like
80% of your calories from fats.

2475
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:22,060
He'd be kind of amazed and actually
can fuck with some people's gains.

2476
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:25,040
They don't think they're getting enough
protein because they're getting a lot of

2477
02:21:25,041 --> 02:21:27,380
fat in a smaller amount of protein,

2478
02:21:27,381 --> 02:21:31,040
like less grams of protein might not
be ideal in terms of like a physical

2479
02:21:31,041 --> 02:21:34,550
performance for athletes they think.
But when you,

2480
02:21:34,880 --> 02:21:38,090
when you do do that and you just eat
steak, your body says, all right,

2481
02:21:38,091 --> 02:21:40,550
this asshole doesn't want to eat apples.
You know,

2482
02:21:40,551 --> 02:21:41,830
we have to figure out how to get our,

2483
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:44,240
our carbs and we have to get it
figured out how to get our sugar.

2484
02:21:44,241 --> 02:21:47,600
So we're just going to get it through
the steak, Huh? Yeah. It's a weird thing.

2485
02:21:47,630 --> 02:21:50,180
It's like people,
some people are unaware of that,

2486
02:21:50,181 --> 02:21:55,181
but your body literally produces it turns
protein into like a glucose substitute

2487
02:21:57,010 --> 02:22:01,280
or glucose actual glue. It's
Glucogenesis. Hmm. Yeah, you can do it.

2488
02:22:01,281 --> 02:22:04,490
I've done it for several days. I've
never done it for a long periods of time,

2489
02:22:04,491 --> 02:22:06,650
but I was, I wanted to try it. Um,

2490
02:22:06,800 --> 02:22:09,810
when they're there were doing national
carnivore monthlies knuckleheads.

2491
02:22:10,240 --> 02:22:13,490
This people are so into it. Carnivore
diet is a lot like the Vegan diet is,

2492
02:22:13,491 --> 02:22:17,240
they can't shut the fuck up about being
a carnival or my buddy Michael Goldstein,

2493
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:20,810
who is the first percentage of know
who's a bitcoin is that bitcoin, bitcoin,

2494
02:22:20,840 --> 02:22:24,920
bitcoin. Same thing with
cognitive, all the cargo,
cargo, cargo or like, all right.

2495
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:26,070
So I tried it for

2496
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:26,940
a couple of weeks.

2497
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:31,410
I think I went from like close to two
weeks and after awhile I was like,

2498
02:22:31,411 --> 02:22:35,940
Jesus Christ 20 eat regular foods.
I'm not being, I'm not joking.

2499
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:38,610
I would think it'd be a
problem with getting it stuck
in your teeth all the time.

2500
02:22:38,940 --> 02:22:41,290
No, you just brushed your teeth. What do
you disgusting. What's wrong with you?

2501
02:22:41,291 --> 02:22:43,410
You don't have a toothpick at home.
Excuse me.

2502
02:22:43,411 --> 02:22:47,990
I have every flavor of Marvis on
my shelf right now. Marvis oh,

2503
02:22:48,070 --> 02:22:49,980
interesting.
Now who doesn't know about tooth care?

2504
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:53,670
What's Marvis is the like
Italian toothpaste, Brad.
And it looks really cool.

2505
02:22:53,760 --> 02:22:57,540
Although the, uh, this flavors and
subpar, the point is brushing your teeth,

2506
02:22:57,541 --> 02:23:01,110
not going to get, not stuck
in between your teeth. That's
not gonna help. Flossing.

2507
02:23:01,260 --> 02:23:02,880
Yeah. Flow. You got to be
up to flossing all the time

2508
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:09,280
or just bite off bigger chunks like a
man. Just swallow it. I, oh, can I tell,

2509
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:12,300
can I tell you a story about this?
This just happened to me. Yes.

2510
02:23:12,470 --> 02:23:16,200
And this is when I realized that, uh,
most people, there's no mind there.

2511
02:23:16,230 --> 02:23:20,250
I am at a buffet. I'm eating
steak. I was eating steak.

2512
02:23:20,460 --> 02:23:24,810
Congratulations. I, it's gets stuck
in my throat. I'm like, all right,

2513
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:29,160
it's just too big a piece. I'll just
wash it down. It's not going anywhere.

2514
02:23:29,430 --> 02:23:30,570
And I realize I'm choking.

2515
02:23:31,500 --> 02:23:36,500
And it was a very scary situation in the
sense that mentally I knew there is a

2516
02:23:36,811 --> 02:23:40,440
percent chance that I'm going to die. Did
you try to throw up, hold on, hold on.

2517
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:44,520
Let me tell the story. Joe Rogan. So
I'm sitting there, I'm like, Holy Shit,

2518
02:23:44,521 --> 02:23:48,060
I'm choking. And I'm like, all
right. I was calm, but I'm like,

2519
02:23:48,061 --> 02:23:49,560
it's your life is currently in danger.

2520
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:53,160
And there's a co three
people at the next table, um,

2521
02:23:53,550 --> 02:23:56,310
to got to two women in their
50s and got in their sixties.

2522
02:23:56,610 --> 02:23:57,900
I go up to them and I'm like,

2523
02:23:57,901 --> 02:24:02,010
I know what to do cause I was at school
and I go to them and I go, I'm choking.

2524
02:24:02,190 --> 02:24:05,880
And I did the hand motion and I
make eye contact with each of them.

2525
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:09,870
No, no effect on their face. And I'm like,

2526
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:13,830
at the very least you have a crazy person
coming up to your table doing a neck

2527
02:24:13,831 --> 02:24:18,560
motion. Are you in New York? Yeah, that's
a problem. I Ip, we're desensitized.

2528
02:24:18,580 --> 02:24:22,260
Did this to myself and it's shot out.
And then I go, how'd you do it yourself?

2529
02:24:22,261 --> 02:24:25,590
Show me how I just did this.
And I saw Heimlich, like,

2530
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:27,450
I don't know if it was
the call for whatever it,

2531
02:24:27,480 --> 02:24:30,720
it popped out and all the liquid to
after it. And I go to them, I go,

2532
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:34,890
I was just choking. And they're like, oh
well you should show your food better.

2533
02:24:35,100 --> 02:24:38,840
I'm like, someone was just, Chuck
said that to you one the ladies,

2534
02:24:38,850 --> 02:24:39,990
she get that lady's name,

2535
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:43,110
she doesn't happen to you because
there's not a human being there.

2536
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:46,800
There's no mind. And I'm like, Holy Shit,

2537
02:24:46,830 --> 02:24:51,180
if I saw this happen and I didn't help,
I would be like, oh my God, you just, oh.

2538
02:24:51,181 --> 02:24:53,760
I'm like, Holy Shit. Are you okay? It
was like, oh, she should your food.

2539
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:54,930
You're not a soul.

2540
02:24:55,540 --> 02:25:00,430
How old was this lady in her fifties
somebody probably just true. Your bad man.

2541
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:03,840
Not Bad enough. Bad
relationships. It was scary.

2542
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:08,430
The reaction was scarier than the
choking. Yeah, I would imagine. Well,

2543
02:25:08,431 --> 02:25:12,060
I think that's a really common thing
with big cities that that sort of,

2544
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:15,990
there's a diffusion of responsibility,
but there's so many people,

2545
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:16,921
there's so many.

2546
02:25:16,921 --> 02:25:19,440
You don't feel responsible for this
guy with his hands on his neck saying,

2547
02:25:19,441 --> 02:25:22,320
I'm coughing like somebody else.
Go Tech, somebody handle this.

2548
02:25:22,440 --> 02:25:24,220
I've got to go to work.
I would be fine

2549
02:25:24,220 --> 02:25:27,430
if they had shrugged and then
like, yeah, whatever. In a sense,

2550
02:25:27,431 --> 02:25:30,760
but there was no reaction.
She's probably so jaded.

2551
02:25:32,110 --> 02:25:34,960
So whoever you are, lady, I hope
that things happen to you. Fuck you.

2552
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:39,490
I hope you go back in time and you have
a better daddy and a better mommy and

2553
02:25:39,491 --> 02:25:43,250
better friends. Yeah. And he grew up
to be a nice person and I, and yeah,

2554
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:47,680
in her fifties maybe she could be a
yoga teacher in her mind and be like,

2555
02:25:47,681 --> 02:25:50,590
I saved someone's life today.
I can go on to heaven. Yeah.

2556
02:25:50,591 --> 02:25:53,890
Maybe she thought you were nuts and you're
just trolling her, but if I was nuts,

2557
02:25:53,891 --> 02:25:55,810
you would think they'd pull
back and be like, Holy Shit,

2558
02:25:55,811 --> 02:25:59,160
there's a crazy person or a table. Maybe
it's because of your troll. Likewise.

2559
02:25:59,300 --> 02:26:04,060
[inaudible] lesson. The universe has sent
your way. You're the boy who cried wolf.

2560
02:26:04,210 --> 02:26:05,020
No, no, no, no, no.

2561
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:10,000
The lesson is you're invincible and
nothing bad will ever happen now. Oh,

2562
02:26:10,001 --> 02:26:11,890
because you survived. I survived. Oh,

2563
02:26:12,310 --> 02:26:14,920
do you know how to do that to someone
else though? If someone was choking,

2564
02:26:14,921 --> 02:26:18,060
do you know to give a high like, I think
I do it. We all think we do. Right.

2565
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:20,350
That's the thing, but it's like
you have to get it right here,

2566
02:26:20,351 --> 02:26:23,020
like right where the rib cage,
the stardom and you push up.

2567
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:25,990
I think people get the ribs broken
all the time that they're supposed to.

2568
02:26:26,410 --> 02:26:29,670
You're supposed to do as hard as you
can. Oh, you don't want that? Well,

2569
02:26:29,770 --> 02:26:32,950
the alternative, the ads are Matthew's
doing that to you. Sorry. As you can.

2570
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:34,300
That would be very painful.

2571
02:26:37,220 --> 02:26:39,940
It would just be like an old
chicken. Yeah, no pea protein.

2572
02:26:39,941 --> 02:26:41,860
Then you get in trouble
for helping and hurting.

2573
02:26:41,950 --> 02:26:45,020
Of course you can 100%
of chorus or something.

2574
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:46,960
You can get in trouble
for shooting a burglar.

2575
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:50,590
Especially if you're a strong person.
Like if you're like a that Robert Frank,

2576
02:26:50,591 --> 02:26:55,070
are they approved you yet? No, no,
no. I'll check Twitter account.

2577
02:26:55,080 --> 02:26:58,930
I couldn't tell what the video was. You
might have it on Twitter. Maybe it's a,

2578
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:03,670
yeah, I bet he does write well,
but isn't he like, um, he's um,

2579
02:27:03,671 --> 02:27:05,830
I don't know what the topic was
because he had a couple of videos up,

2580
02:27:05,831 --> 02:27:09,260
but it could have been, this is what
it looks like. I'll show it. Oh,

2581
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:14,530
it's for some reason now Instagram wants
to send me Twitter wants to send me to,

2582
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:15,670
um,

2583
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:20,670
the Instagram from the web
and not from what happens.

2584
02:27:20,860 --> 02:27:21,693
And you're in an apple.

2585
02:27:21,790 --> 02:27:24,520
One of the do that should've been
in a wet mess it up on an android.

2586
02:27:24,670 --> 02:27:28,010
Why does it do that? But does Andrew
would work better for that for today?

2587
02:27:28,030 --> 02:27:31,570
For the purpose of it, for the purpose
of the show but doesn't, doesn't know.

2588
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:33,930
The thing about Google though is the goop.

2589
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:36,930
I have android to look up an
android phone as well, but don't,

2590
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:41,920
doesn't Google a collect way more data
than apple does? I think they, uh, yeah,

2591
02:27:42,040 --> 02:27:44,710
it's my understanding there's this
gathering data and selling it.

2592
02:27:44,711 --> 02:27:47,650
Where's apple is kind of trying
to avoid that. I want to support,

2593
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:48,640
apple did a great,

2594
02:27:48,641 --> 02:27:52,540
great thing where they had that set up
where they can't even break into their

2595
02:27:52,541 --> 02:27:56,830
phone if they want it to. And define law
enforcement. That was really wonderful.

2596
02:27:56,860 --> 02:27:59,200
Not just that, but your
information, right terms,

2597
02:27:59,201 --> 02:28:02,410
you relocation information and where
you're going and what you're doing.

2598
02:28:02,410 --> 02:28:04,960
Like Google, every time you're getting
online, they're just trying to do like,

2599
02:28:04,961 --> 02:28:06,580
where are you at? What do
you want, what do you need?

2600
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:10,510
There's a great documentary
called the creepy line. Um,

2601
02:28:10,570 --> 02:28:11,680
and they talk about like,

2602
02:28:11,681 --> 02:28:16,480
let's suppose face on Facebook and I want
to influence elections, right? What if,

2603
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:19,840
if I have an ad that says get out and
vote, it's going to crush people vote.

2604
02:28:20,380 --> 02:28:24,650
What if I've ran that ad on Donald Trump
fans? People who like Donald Trump,

2605
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:26,420
right?
Don't run on Hillary fans.

2606
02:28:27,080 --> 02:28:30,330
That would sway the election
and no one would know. Mm.

2607
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:35,380
So what they do with this information
is very quiet and there's not that much

2608
02:28:35,511 --> 02:28:38,270
transparency. And it can really
lead to, especially with the sheer,

2609
02:28:38,271 --> 02:28:41,300
with foreign countries, how with
China, how they're like, you know,

2610
02:28:41,301 --> 02:28:43,790
being perfectly happy to kind
of sensor stuff. This is,

2611
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:46,400
these are things that need to be asked.
Yeah.

2612
02:28:46,401 --> 02:28:49,910
I was talking to a wound
was as an executive and her
position was that if they

2613
02:28:49,911 --> 02:28:51,740
didn't do at Google is
going to copy it anyway.

2614
02:28:52,040 --> 02:28:57,040
So might as well just let Google sensor
and this way Google won't invent their

2615
02:28:58,341 --> 02:29:01,750
own Google. Sure. And just copy
all the codes and steal the code.

2616
02:29:02,030 --> 02:29:03,230
And that's a fair response.

2617
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:07,820
But these are things that people I think
should think more about. Yeah. Well,

2618
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:12,230
especially with something like China
where the government and the industry are

2619
02:29:12,231 --> 02:29:13,370
all tied in.
Right.

2620
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:18,470
This is why I was really weirded out by
this Walway thing today when it came to

2621
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:22,400
Google and Google because you want to say,
well,

2622
02:29:22,401 --> 02:29:25,580
if Google's doing this, clearly
there must be a real reason for it.

2623
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:28,940
But then you know about the Google
memo and James Demore and you're like,

2624
02:29:28,970 --> 02:29:32,780
oh yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why Nay?
Oh yeah. Cause when you've done that,

2625
02:29:32,781 --> 02:29:36,350
I've got to go, okay. The guy just
provided scientific information,

2626
02:29:36,351 --> 02:29:40,130
didn't say anything sexist. You're just
talking about the facts of studies. Right.

2627
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:40,530
And you,

2628
02:29:40,530 --> 02:29:45,530
you fired them for what you called like
was it reinforcing sexist stereotypes?

2629
02:29:46,850 --> 02:29:48,980
And it wasn't the case at all.
It's not what he did.

2630
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:54,100
But so many people were complaining about
his report on the data that they were

2631
02:29:54,651 --> 02:29:55,550
asking about.

2632
02:29:55,580 --> 02:29:59,350
Well also saying that he doesn't know
math and statistics when that was,

2633
02:29:59,370 --> 02:30:04,180
this isn't even MIT to cre. Yeah, well
he's a, he's a coder. Yeah. So it's,

2634
02:30:04,181 --> 02:30:08,150
it's what happens is when you
have this fundamental is faith.

2635
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:11,990
You start with the conclusion and you
reason your way backward and if you're

2636
02:30:11,991 --> 02:30:14,480
contradicting my conclusion,
you're not only wrong,

2637
02:30:14,481 --> 02:30:17,540
you're a liar and a sinner and have to
be driven from the face of the earth.

2638
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:21,920
Well that's why I would ordinarily
defer to them. I'm like, wow,

2639
02:30:21,921 --> 02:30:23,030
this must be pretty serious.

2640
02:30:23,031 --> 02:30:28,031
If Google is looking to take Gmail off
of the new Walway phones and not update

2641
02:30:28,581 --> 02:30:32,090
the operating system, but then I
go, well no, that's on this story.

2642
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:34,350
What's going on at all?
Yeah. I don't know.

2643
02:30:34,351 --> 02:30:36,050
We don't know what's going
on and we might never know.

2644
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:39,920
That is a problem when you
do one thing like that,

2645
02:30:40,070 --> 02:30:43,700
like there's giant consequences for
what they probably thought it was a PR

2646
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:47,150
disaster. Probably have to get rid of
this change to more guy. Let's just do it,

2647
02:30:47,390 --> 02:30:50,070
will justify it and I think the culture
of the company probably support it.

2648
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:52,030
It's probably very leftist mandates.

2649
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:55,340
It didn't support it and demand that it
was my understanding the company. Yeah.

2650
02:30:55,400 --> 02:30:59,580
Even though it does logically and did the
rest of that was really interesting to

2651
02:30:59,581 --> 02:31:03,170
just see outside of the bubble where the
rest of the world that people actually

2652
02:31:03,171 --> 02:31:05,360
read his memo and looked
at it and we're like, okay,

2653
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:11,030
what is wrong with what he's saying?
He's not saying anything bad about women.

2654
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:16,190
He's in fact he had a page and a half
talking about strategies to get women more

2655
02:31:16,191 --> 02:31:20,010
interested in tech. He was just
relaying the information as a stance

2656
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:24,060
in terms of the studies that have
been done that show what women tend to

2657
02:31:24,061 --> 02:31:26,430
gravitate towards,
what men tend to gravitate towards.

2658
02:31:26,670 --> 02:31:27,900
These aren't sexist studies.

2659
02:31:27,901 --> 02:31:32,100
These are studies where they're just
trying to figure out why do more women go

2660
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:36,330
into healthcare? Why do, is it
opportunity? Is it designed like is it,

2661
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:39,970
is it just natural cultural?
It's cultural.

2662
02:31:40,270 --> 02:31:45,140
I mean sure there's a lot of
things and so data is not sexist.

2663
02:31:45,141 --> 02:31:48,570
This guy was just talking about data and
then when you looked at his own ideas,

2664
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:53,240
those rent sexists either he was just
talking about strategies that women might

2665
02:31:53,270 --> 02:31:54,103
disagree with you.

2666
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:58,620
They will say data is sexist because
it has conclusions that contradict what

2667
02:31:58,621 --> 02:32:02,880
they air quotes know to be true. So
therefore, if the data contradicts this,

2668
02:32:02,881 --> 02:32:06,420
the data is sexist.
That's so crazy that that's the left.

2669
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:11,430
The left used to be science driven and
now the logical ones that are left has,

2670
02:32:11,431 --> 02:32:13,020
this is one of the big myths,

2671
02:32:13,021 --> 02:32:16,800
and I talk about this in the book they
have from Woodrow Wilson on have this

2672
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:19,410
evangelical fundamentalist faiths,
a segment of the left.

2673
02:32:20,010 --> 02:32:23,010
There's many people on the left who are
very science driven, who are like, look,

2674
02:32:23,011 --> 02:32:24,150
these are the facts.
Let's work on that.

2675
02:32:24,360 --> 02:32:28,560
But there's a big segment of them
which are very prevalent where they're

2676
02:32:28,561 --> 02:32:31,650
basically like jihadis and you
have this on the right as well,

2677
02:32:31,710 --> 02:32:32,281
where it's just like,

2678
02:32:32,281 --> 02:32:35,160
these are my conclusions and we're
going to force everyone to fit said

2679
02:32:35,161 --> 02:32:36,680
conclusions.
Mm.

2680
02:32:37,110 --> 02:32:41,220
So you think that even like
when you go back to, um,

2681
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:42,430
what was that fucking,

2682
02:32:42,450 --> 02:32:47,410
there was the terrorist organization
that Obama's professor was involved in.

2683
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:51,750
The weatherman. The weatherman. Yeah.
Like that. You go back to that similar,

2684
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:55,950
almost like an educated version of Antifa.
I'm going back to Woodrow Wilson. Yeah.

2685
02:32:55,951 --> 02:32:59,280
But I mean if you went belly, yeah. It's
real similar to what we were. Absolutely.

2686
02:32:59,340 --> 02:33:01,780
Yeah. Uh, and they, that's,

2687
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:05,760
there's a book called days of rage and
it talks about how in the early seventies

2688
02:33:06,060 --> 02:33:08,460
there were bombs going off I
think every week in America.

2689
02:33:08,790 --> 02:33:10,970
And they weren't trying to kill
people. It was political. They,

2690
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:13,830
they called him the bomb threat and be
like, look, we're going to set up a bomb.

2691
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:15,200
But the point is they,

2692
02:33:15,210 --> 02:33:18,390
there are other Symbionese Liberation
Liberation Army that had patty Hearst,

2693
02:33:18,860 --> 02:33:22,560
a few of them. Yeah, the
weather underground. They
really, this was their thing.

2694
02:33:22,590 --> 02:33:25,560
And they blew up a townhouse
in New York City, you know,

2695
02:33:25,561 --> 02:33:28,440
killed a bunch of people and now
they're walking around and they're fine.

2696
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:31,620
It's a fast and,
and it's all been swept under the rug.

2697
02:33:31,890 --> 02:33:36,250
Like people always think that no matter
what's happening now is like regardless

2698
02:33:36,300 --> 02:33:39,450
to like these like New York
Nazi types and the outright, oh,

2699
02:33:39,451 --> 02:33:40,590
this is the worst time ever.

2700
02:33:40,591 --> 02:33:44,820
It's like the Klan used to be like a major
part of both political parties. Like,

2701
02:33:44,821 --> 02:33:45,990
what are you talking about?

2702
02:33:46,020 --> 02:33:50,310
Things used to be re Woodrow Wilson is
playing birth of a nation at the White

2703
02:33:50,310 --> 02:33:53,670
House. Things were really,
really dark before. Um, and,

2704
02:33:53,671 --> 02:33:56,550
but people don't have the
historical context. No.

2705
02:33:56,551 --> 02:34:00,660
It's easy to not know
what happened before,

2706
02:34:00,661 --> 02:34:03,600
but just to think about what's going
on now and where you want things to go.

2707
02:34:03,601 --> 02:34:07,890
Yeah. So therefore it's really, really bad
and different. Must be the worst. Yeah.

2708
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:12,210
There's a better,
there's a better way to live for sure.

2709
02:34:12,660 --> 02:34:14,050
But I think we went,

2710
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:18,250
went into real problems when you
start telling people what they can

2711
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:21,310
and can't do. Yeah. No matter
what it is, no matter what it is.

2712
02:34:21,311 --> 02:34:24,640
And you tell people that what they can
and can't do. You sort of reinforce,

2713
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:27,980
I think one of the things that's
going on now, um, in terms of, uh,

2714
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,790
like these abortion rulings.
Oh Gosh. Yeah. Yeah.

2715
02:34:31,160 --> 02:34:35,320
Which is very sketchy, very
scary. And the Alabama one,

2716
02:34:35,321 --> 02:34:37,360
which essentially just outlaws abortion,

2717
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:42,800
they're making it where your punishment
for abortion is far greater punishment.

2718
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:50,740
Then the punishment for raping someone
and causing them to get an abortion. So,

2719
02:34:50,741 --> 02:34:52,780
well, they don't punish the woman.
I thought the players, the doctor,

2720
02:34:53,170 --> 02:34:56,080
the law punishes the doctor.
Was that what it is? Yeah. Yeah.

2721
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:58,390
I think doctor gets 99 years
or something like that.

2722
02:34:58,690 --> 02:35:00,760
It's the doctor who's being charged,
not the woman.

2723
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:04,570
That's the question is in Georgia
and Alabama, maybe baby. Right.

2724
02:35:04,571 --> 02:35:06,010
But the question is why do you want this?

2725
02:35:06,460 --> 02:35:09,250
If you regard this mother
as a potential murderer,

2726
02:35:09,450 --> 02:35:12,420
do you really want her raising that kid?
Right.

2727
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,520
Forced her to go ahead 99 years in jail.

2728
02:35:17,070 --> 02:35:22,030
Oh yeah. That they thought.
The other thing is that I
am very torn in this issue,

2729
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:24,250
abortion on Twitter.

2730
02:35:24,251 --> 02:35:28,390
It's such a cesspool of people who don't
understand each other. One group saying,

2731
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:31,990
oh, it's all about, uh, uh, you
want to control a woman's body.

2732
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:34,480
And the other would be like, oh,
you want to murder babies? No, no.

2733
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:37,570
They don't want them or to babies
and they don't care about the woman.

2734
02:35:37,571 --> 02:35:39,250
They care about what they
perceive to be the infant.

2735
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:44,110
So I try to talk to both and
it's, it's just noise. Yeah.

2736
02:35:44,111 --> 02:35:47,200
These are rigid ideologies
and they're not persuasive.

2737
02:35:47,350 --> 02:35:51,820
If you tell someone who is pro choice
could wait otherwise be amenable to your

2738
02:35:51,821 --> 02:35:55,240
point of view. Well, you just want to
murder kids. It's like, well I don't,

2739
02:35:55,241 --> 02:35:56,710
so there's nothing to talk anymore.

2740
02:35:56,830 --> 02:35:59,950
Did you see that at state representative
that was walking around, um,

2741
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:01,270
in front of a,
um,

2742
02:36:01,640 --> 02:36:06,640
a abortion clinic and was trying to get
the names of these kids that were there

2743
02:36:07,091 --> 02:36:10,960
that were oh yeah. He's still on Twitter.
Yeah. No consequences. That's crazy.

2744
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:13,510
He was trying to docs kids.
He was asking for,

2745
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:16,570
he was going to be offering
money bribing though. Yeah. $100.

2746
02:36:16,600 --> 02:36:20,940
$100 to get the names of whoever
these people are. It's insane.

2747
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:25,660
Gets to this one boy. And he puts his
boy's face on Twitter. Just some meek,

2748
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:28,330
shy Christian Rice,
a big guy.

2749
02:36:28,690 --> 02:36:32,910
He's big and aggressive and he's getting
in people's face with the camera. Right.

2750
02:36:32,950 --> 02:36:37,120
And then he's putting them online and
he's getting a lot of attention and fame

2751
02:36:37,121 --> 02:36:41,380
for it. And it's crazy. And
meanwhile, my buddy Mike,

2752
02:36:41,381 --> 02:36:45,580
he has a parody account of AOC. He
gets kicked off. That's crazy. Yeah.

2753
02:36:45,610 --> 02:36:48,700
And it says parody. Yeah. Why
can't you do that? I mean,

2754
02:36:48,730 --> 02:36:52,390
I don't think what he did was even
rough. It wasn't, it wasn't anything.

2755
02:36:52,391 --> 02:36:54,910
I don't really awful like I've read
some of the tweets. I was like,

2756
02:36:54,911 --> 02:36:58,270
they're just kind of funny. They're at,
they're a parody. What about site alive?

2757
02:36:58,390 --> 02:36:59,460
I think come on quickly.

2758
02:36:59,560 --> 02:37:04,510
Exactly what w Alec Baldwin does to the
president every fucking day on Saturday

2759
02:37:04,511 --> 02:37:09,270
night live every week. He's doing a
fucking Trump impression. All this. Well,

2760
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:13,600
he should, that's their job.
Exactly. So it's, it's a
complete double standard. It's,

2761
02:37:13,601 --> 02:37:16,040
it's, and the other thing, I'll defend
jack in this regard we were talking

2762
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:19,130
about earlier,
I'm sure the pressure he gets internally,

2763
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:22,460
oh my God is off the charts and
he even said this explicitly goes,

2764
02:37:22,461 --> 02:37:25,920
they were all at, my whole company was
yelling at me to kick off Alex, you know,

2765
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:29,150
for a long time. He refused to
do it for a while. Yeah. It's,

2766
02:37:29,420 --> 02:37:31,310
it's weird that they don't
see the consequences.

2767
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:34,200
They don't understand that this is
going to go to a bad place, but this is,

2768
02:37:34,220 --> 02:37:38,270
they do see the positive consequences
where they're preaching to their own tribe

2769
02:37:38,930 --> 02:37:43,550
and basically the people who aren't
like us get to go out in the ghetto,

2770
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:45,410
in the ghetto, in the wilderness. Well

2771
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:50,300
I think human beings are way better at
expressing themselves today than they

2772
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:51,800
ever have been in the past.

2773
02:37:51,860 --> 02:37:56,860
And I think one of the reasons why is
the free expression that we so enjoy and

2774
02:37:59,661 --> 02:38:00,770
that we have enjoyed.

2775
02:38:01,820 --> 02:38:02,750
You know,
like

2776
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:06,520
if you, if you look at the,
the history of what you could,

2777
02:38:06,521 --> 02:38:10,090
the message you could get out just 40 or
50 years ago as opposed to what you can

2778
02:38:10,091 --> 02:38:10,924
get out today.

2779
02:38:11,080 --> 02:38:16,080
And then you looked at how culture has
radically evolved over the last 40 or 50

2780
02:38:17,051 --> 02:38:22,051
years versus where if everything was
stagnant like it was in 1950 we would,

2781
02:38:23,170 --> 02:38:27,790
we would think if you watch like 1950s
films are read books about the 1950s the

2782
02:38:27,791 --> 02:38:31,480
behavior that people got away with was,
it was way different than it is today.

2783
02:38:31,481 --> 02:38:33,040
Of course things are getting better.

2784
02:38:33,190 --> 02:38:36,490
But one of the reasons why these things
are getting better is because people can

2785
02:38:36,491 --> 02:38:39,520
see everything.
You can talk through all the details,

2786
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:42,460
have you think you could
just cut off the ugly stuff,

2787
02:38:42,510 --> 02:38:46,090
cut off the Nazi stuff and cut off this
stuff and you're going to keep people

2788
02:38:46,091 --> 02:38:47,050
from getting recruited.

2789
02:38:47,051 --> 02:38:49,450
So you're going to kill this and
you're going to DIY platform this.

2790
02:38:49,690 --> 02:38:50,800
You're also gonna,

2791
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:56,760
you're gonna enforce assholes to say
like there's a reason why their silencing

2792
02:38:57,311 --> 02:39:00,740
us. There's a reason why instead
of having people going, hey, no,

2793
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:04,460
you guys are shit heads and
this is a stupid idea, right?

2794
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:08,010
And you guys are all ignorant fools and
your perception of things is so often

2795
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:11,440
we're going to explain to you while it's
off and we're going to all like work

2796
02:39:11,441 --> 02:39:12,310
this out together.

2797
02:39:12,340 --> 02:39:15,970
And when they say there's a secret elite
who's running this country and wants to

2798
02:39:15,971 --> 02:39:20,770
control your life, they made Jews
don't they? Shit Jig is up. They know,

2799
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:23,320
shut it down this,
but this is their proof.

2800
02:39:23,470 --> 02:39:27,280
They can point to Twitter and
Facebook and they could also say, Hey,

2801
02:39:27,910 --> 02:39:30,640
they're picking off the same
exact people and every platform.

2802
02:39:30,641 --> 02:39:31,880
It's not a coincidence.
Yep.

2803
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:35,200
Whereas David Duke is still on Twitter
isn't brilliant. Yeah, of course.

2804
02:39:35,290 --> 02:39:40,150
That's hilarious. Is it? No, but it's
telling no, it's not hilarious. Like, oh,

2805
02:39:40,151 --> 02:39:44,440
I know they got rid of Pharacom. They
didn't get rid of David Duke. Right,

2806
02:39:45,010 --> 02:39:47,830
right. Cause David Duke serves
a purpose. What purpose?

2807
02:39:47,890 --> 02:39:51,430
Because he's a good foil for the left
because when David Duke endorses a

2808
02:39:51,431 --> 02:39:54,190
Republican look, oh, the
Republicans are racist.

2809
02:39:54,191 --> 02:39:58,330
When David Duke Endorses Ilhan
Omar or Keith Ellison crickets,

2810
02:39:58,510 --> 02:40:01,930
though he'd be a good,
bad guy on payroll.

2811
02:40:02,290 --> 02:40:06,070
Like if I was the Democratic Party, I'd
say, look, Dave is the Jig is up. Okay,

2812
02:40:06,130 --> 02:40:08,440
everybody knows you're never
going to be president right now.

2813
02:40:08,441 --> 02:40:11,530
We're going to really run for office
or anywhere or legitimate blah.

2814
02:40:11,860 --> 02:40:13,060
She's not that good with that.

2815
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:18,240
How about this, David? We'll
give you $400,000 a year.

2816
02:40:18,270 --> 02:40:21,120
All you have to do is every now
and then I'm going to call you up.

2817
02:40:21,121 --> 02:40:23,460
But I'm just saying, Dave, you
know, it'll be interesting.

2818
02:40:23,461 --> 02:40:28,080
It would be interesting if David Duke
endorsed this asshole and then David Duke

2819
02:40:28,081 --> 02:40:31,110
just starts talking about this person
being a fine American and a white

2820
02:40:31,111 --> 02:40:32,370
nationalists and all these different,

2821
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:36,270
just make up a bunch of quotes and
have David Duke put it up there.

2822
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:39,000
A lot of people when that
have a shake that off.

2823
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:41,900
A lot of people think he's controlling
like not him specifically and trawl

2824
02:40:42,060 --> 02:40:45,570
oppositions controlF is
this. Oh, that's my favorite.
Right. When someone's not bad,

2825
02:40:45,571 --> 02:40:48,110
they must be controlled opposition.
That is one of my favorites.

2826
02:40:48,140 --> 02:40:49,410
I love their CE dork theory.

2827
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:52,710
That control up position is someone who
you don't like who hasn't been banned

2828
02:40:52,711 --> 02:40:57,150
yet. Yeah. Controlled
opposition. Is it useful? Idiot?
Yeah. Controlled opposition.

2829
02:40:57,520 --> 02:41:00,990
It's like when people get into these,
uh,

2830
02:41:01,050 --> 02:41:03,120
I've been accused of being a CIA plant.
Oh,

2831
02:41:03,160 --> 02:41:06,540
you probably are probably
one of these ace for anarchy.

2832
02:41:06,680 --> 02:41:11,370
You know the term cognizanti like
those in the know know. Yeah. Yeah.

2833
02:41:11,430 --> 02:41:16,020
That's a great term. And that's like,
that's perfect for this. It's like, oh,

2834
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:19,530
useful idiot. All controlled
opposition. I'm in the know,

2835
02:41:19,531 --> 02:41:23,340
I'm one of the cognitive symptoms. You're
not sneak this by me. I understand,

2836
02:41:23,430 --> 02:41:26,430
but me, while sometimes they're right,
which is why it's really fucked up.

2837
02:41:26,730 --> 02:41:28,890
It's like sometimes there
is controlled opposition.

2838
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,850
Sometimes there is sometimes just fake
websites could talk to somebody because

2839
02:41:32,851 --> 02:41:37,740
somebody wants, probably somebody wants
a win, a lawsuit. You know, look at this.

2840
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:39,000
I'm dear,
dear,

2841
02:41:39,180 --> 02:41:42,420
let this case that you're working on
come and look at this website I've found,

2842
02:41:42,990 --> 02:41:44,400
but that's why killing babies.

2843
02:41:44,430 --> 02:41:47,310
That's why it's so important for
there to be venues for those people.

2844
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:51,180
If someone is crazy or brilliant,
bright off, it looks the same. Right?

2845
02:41:51,181 --> 02:41:55,200
But how does a person know whether
or not that websites, right or well,

2846
02:41:55,260 --> 02:41:58,830
once we got to scientific American, we
all go, you're like, okay, this is legit.

2847
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:02,220
This is legit claim. They're
basically talking about cells though.

2848
02:42:02,221 --> 02:42:04,680
They were talking about human cells.
Um,

2849
02:42:04,710 --> 02:42:06,900
I don't know any better way
drawing human cells. But here's,

2850
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:10,800
here's a problem with that, with what
was going to say is at what scale?

2851
02:42:11,100 --> 02:42:11,731
Cause by the way,

2852
02:42:11,731 --> 02:42:16,731
they've shown that certain elements and
plants in laboratory environment will

2853
02:42:16,831 --> 02:42:20,180
destroy cells even like phytonutrients.

2854
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:24,600
And there was some something, um, one
of the head guys for the carnivore diet,

2855
02:42:25,170 --> 02:42:25,830
uh,

2856
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:30,830
Sean Baker posted on his Twitter
a while back showing that,

2857
02:42:31,411 --> 02:42:35,280
um, that you can make a lot of
weird arguments based on cells.

2858
02:42:35,281 --> 02:42:38,760
Like how things respond to cells doesn't
necessarily mean once it gets through

2859
02:42:38,761 --> 02:42:43,500
the organism. Yeah. They
only way, in my view,

2860
02:42:43,501 --> 02:42:44,850
and I'm not an expert on this,

2861
02:42:44,910 --> 02:42:49,910
is discourse and having a platform where
people can argue at each other and you

2862
02:42:50,731 --> 02:42:53,850
could stand by and watch an NC things
through. Otherwise if you're silencing,

2863
02:42:53,851 --> 02:42:58,280
it's, it's, it's a very, as
we talked before and I think
any right might've person.

2864
02:42:58,300 --> 02:43:00,810
I agree it's a very, very
slippery slope. I agree.

2865
02:43:00,900 --> 02:43:05,370
Did you see the Ben Shapiro
meltdown on the BBC? I did,

2866
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:10,560
yeah. Yeah. That's a good example. That's
a good example because I don't look,

2867
02:43:10,590 --> 02:43:11,530
he didn't handle it well.

2868
02:43:11,531 --> 02:43:14,260
He knows he didn't handle it well
and I like them like them a lot.

2869
02:43:14,261 --> 02:43:16,810
I think he's a really nice guy.
I like talking to him.

2870
02:43:16,811 --> 02:43:19,000
I don't agree with him on many things,
but I really like him.

2871
02:43:19,090 --> 02:43:20,740
He's a really good guy and
if he's a very smart guy,

2872
02:43:21,010 --> 02:43:22,900
I think he's smart enough
to admit that he fucked up.

2873
02:43:23,230 --> 02:43:25,540
He went on Twitter and instantly I,
here's the thing,

2874
02:43:25,541 --> 02:43:26,980
I didn't mean making fun of him,

2875
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:30,190
it's on my insta and people are white
knighting for him. And I'm like,

2876
02:43:30,310 --> 02:43:34,820
he owned that, he played it wrong, he's
fucked up. And he's like, yeah, I got God.

2877
02:43:35,030 --> 02:43:36,700
And that's to his credit.
Yeah.

2878
02:43:36,730 --> 02:43:41,200
And it highlights to me
more so than anything.

2879
02:43:41,230 --> 02:43:45,430
The problem with two things, one doing
remote show. Sure. Where you're from,

2880
02:43:45,460 --> 02:43:46,460
you're in Los Angeles,

2881
02:43:46,461 --> 02:43:51,461
they're in the UK where he was
talking to him like he wasn't there,

2882
02:43:52,180 --> 02:43:55,090
the British guy was because
he wasn't really there. Right.

2883
02:43:55,300 --> 02:43:59,350
And then the other part is that short
time format, you don't have enough time.

2884
02:43:59,650 --> 02:44:03,610
You have at a time to have a conversation
and just talk that Ben knows this then

2885
02:44:03,611 --> 02:44:06,490
is that a pro?
He knows what the BBC is too,

2886
02:44:07,030 --> 02:44:08,920
but he's also a pro at doing those things.

2887
02:44:09,110 --> 02:44:12,260
You just shout talking points at
each other and talk over each.

2888
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:14,350
And Ben talks super fast because
when he talks to profess,

2889
02:44:14,530 --> 02:44:17,430
it's really hard to keep up with him
and he sounds smarter than you like he,

2890
02:44:17,520 --> 02:44:21,490
he's very smart and articulate and
he talks fast. I was like, whew.

2891
02:44:21,491 --> 02:44:25,540
It's hard to him. He rose to prominence
when he was on piers Morgan. Yeah.

2892
02:44:25,541 --> 02:44:28,470
Talking about guns.
If he thought that BBC interview was rude,

2893
02:44:28,471 --> 02:44:31,150
peers at one point just goes,
you're real stupid man, aren't you?

2894
02:44:31,151 --> 02:44:34,540
Like that's your line, Benton
storm off. He was just like, no,

2895
02:44:34,541 --> 02:44:37,000
I just think with a governor that
comes to your patients that it's very

2896
02:44:37,001 --> 02:44:40,270
important for the citizens had the, you
know, and he handled the good impression.

2897
02:44:40,820 --> 02:44:44,140
We go to the same shul,
he handled it amazingly.

2898
02:44:44,360 --> 02:44:48,910
So for him as he admitted for him to
lose his shit and also to be like,

2899
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:53,320
I'm popular and I've never heard of
you just because you've never heard of

2900
02:44:53,321 --> 02:44:57,130
someone. And I'm sure he would admit
this is of no relevance to their, uh,

2901
02:44:57,131 --> 02:44:58,680
the validity of what they're doing.
Yeah.

2902
02:44:58,750 --> 02:45:02,590
That's why I was shocked when I went to
Jojo Siwa last night and it was sold out.

2903
02:45:03,210 --> 02:45:06,700
I don't know the phone. I literally
didn't know she was until a week ago.

2904
02:45:07,240 --> 02:45:10,240
A lot of people know her.
I'm the Seg bore so than Ben Shapiro.

2905
02:45:10,270 --> 02:45:12,760
I'm the second most famous Joe
here. What the fuck? Athens

2906
02:45:14,470 --> 02:45:18,550
and she's 16 I was like, Ben Shapiro
did a speech at the Microsoft Center.

2907
02:45:18,551 --> 02:45:22,660
I don't know how many tickets he sells if
he does speeches, but it's a hard sell.

2908
02:45:22,690 --> 02:45:24,250
7,000 people to hard.

2909
02:45:24,251 --> 02:45:27,310
So I don't think Ben Shapiro could still
sell thousand tickets. That's a lot.

2910
02:45:27,340 --> 02:45:29,590
Yeah, but that's basically you're
getting a two hour speech in one hour.

2911
02:45:29,591 --> 02:45:32,260
So that's, you know, I already
have the double the value. No,

2912
02:45:32,261 --> 02:45:35,350
but it's getting people out of their
house to pay money to come see or hear

2913
02:45:35,351 --> 02:45:40,330
people talk. Like most of these, like
when these guys are doing these talks,

2914
02:45:40,331 --> 02:45:43,600
unless it's Jordan. Jordan can kind
of do a football stadium right now,

2915
02:45:44,110 --> 02:45:47,200
but a lot of these guys are
doing like 2000 seaters.

2916
02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:51,100
This is 7,000 this is a big
jump. Okay. She was seven people.

2917
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:56,100
I bet you he can fill it. Maybe. Maybe
it's possible. I don't know. I'm like,

2918
02:45:56,160 --> 02:45:57,890
I don't know if he's
doing live ones like that.

2919
02:45:57,900 --> 02:45:59,620
There's a lot of people
doing live shows now.

2920
02:45:59,621 --> 02:46:02,650
It's very interesting because they're
doing the whole time. You too.

2921
02:46:02,770 --> 02:46:04,810
Very old timey. Yeah, but it's also,

2922
02:46:04,811 --> 02:46:09,680
it's cool to see people that
are interested in intellectual
dis like Sam Harris,

2923
02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:12,440
some fantastic and I like some,

2924
02:46:12,490 --> 02:46:16,950
what is some of Sam's live ones too?
Because he's funny in them. Yeah.

2925
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:20,900
Which she's, he gets a chance to
actually work to the crowd. You know,

2926
02:46:20,901 --> 02:46:24,110
I was talking to them about, I'm like
you have good timing. Yeah. Like a comic.

2927
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:28,070
Like some of the stuff you say actually
makes me laugh when he does live ones as

2928
02:46:28,071 --> 02:46:32,570
opposed to he's very like rational and
somber when he's doing straight, you know,

2929
02:46:32,571 --> 02:46:36,110
just, just conversation.
Once you know, this is a
performance stayed with me. Like,

2930
02:46:36,111 --> 02:46:38,930
if you're in front of that audience and
the laugh is out of proportion because

2931
02:46:38,931 --> 02:46:40,730
there's so many of them and
just have that one liner,

2932
02:46:41,050 --> 02:46:43,040
it makes you want to be more on.

2933
02:46:43,041 --> 02:46:45,650
And it's like it's this meeting its
tail and it's really, really exciting.

2934
02:46:45,680 --> 02:46:49,430
It's also like a nod to the crowd that
you know that they're there and you're

2935
02:46:49,431 --> 02:46:51,590
trying to entertain them.
You appreciate them.

2936
02:46:51,591 --> 02:46:54,020
Like you say something
fun like you're doing it,

2937
02:46:54,080 --> 02:46:57,650
they know you're doing it because
they're there and it's funny, you know,

2938
02:46:57,770 --> 02:46:59,540
and let us Improv.
That's much more intimate.

2939
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:02,540
You know when you've got that one liner
that you knew was in part of his speech,

2940
02:47:02,541 --> 02:47:03,290
it's great.

2941
02:47:03,290 --> 02:47:06,830
So they're doing their their way
where it's just conversations and it's

2942
02:47:06,831 --> 02:47:10,340
interesting cause they're getting
these giant crowds and you know, um,

2943
02:47:11,030 --> 02:47:13,280
they're also like do produced ones too.

2944
02:47:13,281 --> 02:47:16,730
Like radio lab does a produced live
one and it's really interesting.

2945
02:47:16,731 --> 02:47:20,270
They'll bring someone out and they'll
play sound clips and I dunno if they have

2946
02:47:20,271 --> 02:47:23,240
a video element of it. I
don't see, I think they do.

2947
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:25,130
I think they have like visuals too,

2948
02:47:25,490 --> 02:47:29,960
but they're doing it all in these big
ass theaters and people love it and come

2949
02:47:29,961 --> 02:47:30,471
out to see it.

2950
02:47:30,471 --> 02:47:34,250
So for someone who listens to like radio
lab every week and they get a chance to

2951
02:47:34,251 --> 02:47:38,090
go and see it live, it's like,
wow, I can't believe it's
here as a part of my life.

2952
02:47:38,091 --> 02:47:41,120
And this is the danger of the help them
write their Twitter, Facebook stuff.

2953
02:47:41,150 --> 02:47:45,170
People are desperate and
excited to hear new ideas.

2954
02:47:45,750 --> 02:47:49,220
It's thought provoking people,
even if you disagree. Right.

2955
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:53,150
Two of my favorite people,
like a lot of times if you hear them talk,

2956
02:47:53,180 --> 02:47:55,400
even if you don't care what they're
saying or disagree with them,

2957
02:47:55,670 --> 02:47:58,820
the energy and it's like this is
fascinating. It's such provoking for me.

2958
02:47:58,821 --> 02:48:00,320
It's just nothing's better.

2959
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:04,430
I think there's something really cool
about people coming out to see these

2960
02:48:04,431 --> 02:48:06,320
really interesting discussions to look,

2961
02:48:06,321 --> 02:48:10,970
Jordan had a debate with this lava Jijak
yeah. Thank you for saying his name.

2962
02:48:11,300 --> 02:48:15,170
I think I pronounced it right.
Maybe you better you than me. Um,

2963
02:48:15,290 --> 02:48:18,670
about Marxism and it's sold out.
Yeah.

2964
02:48:19,460 --> 02:48:21,500
And then they had paper view.
People were buying.

2965
02:48:22,140 --> 02:48:24,260
This was like the dub WWII of our time.
It's like,

2966
02:48:24,470 --> 02:48:26,120
how are these two people
in a room together?

2967
02:48:26,121 --> 02:48:29,900
I want to see this and they actually want
to agreeing on quite a few things and

2968
02:48:29,930 --> 02:48:34,190
just, it was really an
interesting discussion. But
it's also interesting that,

2969
02:48:34,430 --> 02:48:35,050
that,

2970
02:48:35,050 --> 02:48:40,050
that Marxism is such a attractive
subject that they're willing to host this

2971
02:48:41,181 --> 02:48:45,950
giant event and pay to see
people debate this topic.

2972
02:48:45,980 --> 02:48:50,980
It's like this is this idea that you
could fill up a whole arena for an

2973
02:48:53,211 --> 02:48:56,810
intellectual discourse or a theater. I
mean, I don't know how big the place was.

2974
02:48:56,811 --> 02:48:59,510
And then you could also sell
paper view tickets for like,

2975
02:48:59,511 --> 02:49:02,270
what the fuck are you talking about?
Who the hell is going to pay to hear that?

2976
02:49:02,380 --> 02:49:05,150
But that school get outta
here with that shit. It's not,

2977
02:49:05,180 --> 02:49:07,040
I wish school was like that or wish.
Right?

2978
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:10,080
There's no better way to get kids
to hate learning than school.

2979
02:49:10,890 --> 02:49:14,510
Every kid is so excited about
the world, you know, uh,

2980
02:49:14,590 --> 02:49:17,730
go on us to go to the museum.
Well not every kid a lot read books.

2981
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:21,840
Then you go to school and that all goes
away. You're a factory worker. So this,

2982
02:49:21,960 --> 02:49:23,460
anything that reinvigorate your show,

2983
02:49:23,461 --> 02:49:27,120
does this do reinvigorates your love of
learning and about how there's so much

2984
02:49:27,121 --> 02:49:30,210
interesting, crazy shit out
there. I who doesn't love that?

2985
02:49:30,370 --> 02:49:31,770
And that's the creative,

2986
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:36,480
the jocks back in the day didn't have
that space and now thanks to you and

2987
02:49:36,481 --> 02:49:38,940
people like you, it's like, you know
what? I don't like reading books.

2988
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:40,050
Readings enough for me.

2989
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:43,380
I could sit here and listen for three
hours and I'm going to be a smarter person

2990
02:49:43,381 --> 02:49:45,480
than I was three hours ago and learned
stuff. Who Doesn't love history?

2991
02:49:46,170 --> 02:49:48,450
Even if you're the biggest meathead,
it's like this shit's interest.

2992
02:49:48,460 --> 02:49:52,230
Or like these crazy animals. He, the
biggest meat had to be like, oh shit,

2993
02:49:52,231 --> 02:49:53,580
that's cool to hear about this.
You know,

2994
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:56,670
just there's a raft weevil which has a
hinge on its neck, but only the males.

2995
02:49:56,670 --> 02:50:01,590
And it's from Madagascar. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Don't thing it is a real thing.

2996
02:50:01,620 --> 02:50:06,330
And I was going to say this, like
it's fuel for your curiosity. Yeah.

2997
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:09,780
And for your creativity,
it's going to give you ideas.

2998
02:50:09,810 --> 02:50:13,440
It's gonna like there's so much
fuel for creativity right now,

2999
02:50:13,470 --> 02:50:15,570
like more so than any other time.

3000
02:50:15,720 --> 02:50:20,370
There's so much information
and interesting shit you
can learn and do it easily.

3001
02:50:20,371 --> 02:50:22,390
Like you could just find a po, like, um,

3002
02:50:22,530 --> 02:50:25,920
I need to learn about economics and you
just find an economics podcast and start

3003
02:50:25,921 --> 02:50:28,930
playing it. And if the person's
good, you know, they're,

3004
02:50:28,950 --> 02:50:31,740
they're interesting to talk to
and they can do it in a fun way.

3005
02:50:31,741 --> 02:50:36,300
Like you are listening to Peter
Schiff guy, he knows his shit.

3006
02:50:36,301 --> 02:50:38,910
Like I've had them on a few times.
And the way he describes things,

3007
02:50:38,911 --> 02:50:42,810
it's like he's entertaining
as well as factual as well.

3008
02:50:42,810 --> 02:50:46,140
It's just a compelling charismatic person
while he's talking about these things,

3009
02:50:46,320 --> 02:50:49,860
he's getting fired up and you're like,
oh, okay. So that's how it works.

3010
02:50:50,290 --> 02:50:53,940
It's so much better than absorbing it.
And they're dry,

3011
02:50:53,941 --> 02:50:58,520
stale manner. And if, and then you go
from that like, Oh, let me tell you,

3012
02:50:58,530 --> 02:51:00,900
he mentioned this thing.
Let me learn about this. Oh,

3013
02:51:00,901 --> 02:51:03,690
there's a youtube video about this and
you go down this rabbit hole and it's

3014
02:51:03,691 --> 02:51:06,150
just like hours of
entertainment and you're a,

3015
02:51:06,270 --> 02:51:08,970
and you could have better
conversation with the people,
Hey, I learned about this,

3016
02:51:08,971 --> 02:51:12,970
this and that. I feel so far
behind kids these days. I'll go,

3017
02:51:12,971 --> 02:51:15,900
I mean an 18 year old today feel
like a 30 year old when I was a kid.

3018
02:51:16,210 --> 02:51:20,010
In what way? They're smarter. They
have more info. Yeah, more data.

3019
02:51:20,011 --> 02:51:21,360
They know it's horseshit and what's not.

3020
02:51:21,630 --> 02:51:24,180
When we were in our twenties we didn't
know what the fuck was real and what was

3021
02:51:24,181 --> 02:51:26,820
fake. There was no youtube,
there was no Google.

3022
02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:30,580
There was books and you didn't read
them all. I read them. I you might do,

3023
02:51:30,581 --> 02:51:34,020
I've read a lot of Joe. Yeah, I'm
older than you. Yeah. You had books

3024
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:40,470
about like to find out whether or not
something's true. Right, like we do today.

3025
02:51:40,890 --> 02:51:41,723
You know what I'm saying?

3026
02:51:41,850 --> 02:51:45,810
Like when I was in my twenties like I
wasn't like researching subjects and I've

3027
02:51:45,811 --> 02:51:47,400
read a few books here and there,

3028
02:51:47,580 --> 02:51:52,470
but I wasn't researching things on
every single aspect of the world.

3029
02:51:52,680 --> 02:51:53,560
The way the,

3030
02:51:53,570 --> 02:51:58,470
the access to this information just so
radically different that you just have a

3031
02:51:58,471 --> 02:52:00,570
thing in your pocket that
answers your question.

3032
02:52:00,780 --> 02:52:04,440
What else is fascinating is Google and
other organizations have digitized entire

3033
02:52:04,441 --> 02:52:08,800
libraries. So many of these books that
are old are public domain and for free.

3034
02:52:09,190 --> 02:52:13,090
You can read this book from 1910 where
these ideas got started and instead of

3035
02:52:13,091 --> 02:52:14,560
hearing someone's interpretation of it,

3036
02:52:14,561 --> 02:52:19,090
now you can see where this idea developed
in how they looked at the world back

3037
02:52:19,091 --> 02:52:23,350
then. Now here's the real question.
Yeah. Is that acts? Absolutely.

3038
02:52:23,351 --> 02:52:27,160
We both agree incredibly
valuable resource.

3039
02:52:28,600 --> 02:52:31,540
Is that worth giving up the data?

3040
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:34,990
Like maybe we should just accept the fact
that they gave us something to change

3041
02:52:34,991 --> 02:52:38,140
the worlds. Of course they got
super rich. Hey, mark Zuckerberg,

3042
02:52:38,141 --> 02:52:41,170
I know what you did. It's okay.
So can you take that data?

3043
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:44,570
You're taking ticket pitch. Yeah. You
like the shaking urges person. Well,

3044
02:52:44,571 --> 02:52:49,120
you deserve it. You shouldn't,
you shouldn't just give
it away for free. Well,

3045
02:52:49,150 --> 02:52:51,610
I used the world in a better way.
Nah,

3046
02:52:51,611 --> 02:52:54,850
he should've take advantage of the fact
that you changed the world in a better

3047
02:52:54,851 --> 02:52:58,390
way to profit in some insane,

3048
02:52:58,391 --> 02:53:02,860
spectacular way. We generate
billions and billions of dollars.

3049
02:53:03,110 --> 02:53:06,460
The thing we don't know is how they are
generating that profit. That's the issue,

3050
02:53:06,530 --> 02:53:09,760
you know? So if they're doing it in a
certain way that we know about, all right,

3051
02:53:09,761 --> 02:53:10,480
if they don't,

3052
02:53:10,480 --> 02:53:13,750
this is where it gets tricky because
there's an element of fraud in it. Well,

3053
02:53:13,751 --> 02:53:18,520
I think they must be terrified,
but both Twitter and Facebook,

3054
02:53:18,670 --> 02:53:22,450
there must be terrified at their influence
of culture. The actual, yeah, of course.

3055
02:53:22,480 --> 02:53:25,060
There's no way they can't.
The responsibility must be insane.

3056
02:53:25,090 --> 02:53:26,110
Do you know how you know this?

3057
02:53:26,230 --> 02:53:30,100
Because a lot of people
who were Republicans during
the Gulf War, the Iraq war,

3058
02:53:30,580 --> 02:53:33,190
and now look back on it who
are beating the drum beats,

3059
02:53:33,340 --> 02:53:35,980
and I'm not gonna name names.
You watch interviews and they're like,

3060
02:53:36,250 --> 02:53:37,240
that shit was fucked up.

3061
02:53:37,600 --> 02:53:40,930
And when you look back and you
realize you had a part to play in this

3062
02:53:40,931 --> 02:53:42,070
unnecessary war,

3063
02:53:42,250 --> 02:53:44,980
and if you're someone who cares about
human beings as a Christian or whatever,

3064
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:49,360
that will fuck you up for life because
it's like, I had a little part in this,

3065
02:53:49,390 --> 02:53:53,380
like when I do my work with North
Korea, right? If I help 10 people,

3066
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:57,730
that's a huge fucking deal and I don't
take that shit lightly. I've had,

3067
02:53:57,920 --> 02:53:59,650
and here's the power of social media.

3068
02:54:00,130 --> 02:54:04,630
I've had people three or four tell me
I'm going through chemo and I read your

3069
02:54:04,631 --> 02:54:09,250
Twitter and it makes me laugh throughout
the day. That's fucking huge. Conversely,

3070
02:54:09,400 --> 02:54:14,320
if you're on the side of Hillary Clinton
and you realize that your website,

3071
02:54:14,830 --> 02:54:17,980
Mike would be contributing
to her, the mines. Oh yeah.

3072
02:54:18,130 --> 02:54:23,130
And all he had realized that
other countries might be
posting fake accounts that

3073
02:54:24,521 --> 02:54:28,240
are there. You know, they have these
groups, these discussion groups,

3074
02:54:28,570 --> 02:54:32,200
and they're based in Russia and they want
to talk about black lives matter. Yeah.

3075
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:35,800
Or they want to talk about abortion
or they want to talk about southern

3076
02:54:35,801 --> 02:54:37,600
separatism,
her all kinds of,

3077
02:54:37,750 --> 02:54:40,960
you know that IRA
research group in Russia.

3078
02:54:40,990 --> 02:54:45,130
When you find out this is all happening
on your platform and that your platform,

3079
02:54:45,190 --> 02:54:45,760
yes.

3080
02:54:45,760 --> 02:54:50,320
Likely being used to manipulate
how the world is run,

3081
02:54:50,321 --> 02:54:53,890
how financial markets are
run international politics,

3082
02:54:53,891 --> 02:54:58,180
and you just wanted to help college kids
get laid. Yeah, yeah. Right, right, right,

3083
02:54:58,390 --> 02:55:01,330
right. And kind of Jack
the idea to, right.

3084
02:55:01,510 --> 02:55:04,010
What about the kids when they
were torturing that retarded

3085
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:07,790
kid and was a Chicago and
there was streaming and our
Facebook, that's your site.

3086
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:10,910
That's got to fuck with your head.
It's God. Well, there's been murdered,

3087
02:55:11,020 --> 02:55:13,160
I live streaming in New Zealand.
He was live streaming.

3088
02:55:14,470 --> 02:55:18,460
I mean, there's many, many
cases of horrible things
that had been put on there.

3089
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:22,420
Isis beheadings and you know, I mean,
there's no way they can catch it all.

3090
02:55:22,690 --> 02:55:23,980
There's no way.
And we,

3091
02:55:23,981 --> 02:55:27,480
when you talk to Twitter or you talked
to Facebook or youtube or you'll,

3092
02:55:27,481 --> 02:55:29,540
they'll tell you the, just, just,

3093
02:55:29,660 --> 02:55:34,660
I want everyone to just think about
the idea that 7 billion people,

3094
02:55:35,400 --> 02:55:39,360
yeah, let's be real conservative.
Potentially 3 billion. Sure.

3095
02:55:39,520 --> 02:55:40,510
Just 3 billion.

3096
02:55:40,960 --> 02:55:45,460
3 billion people can all
send something at once.

3097
02:55:45,870 --> 02:55:46,830
Wow.

3098
02:55:47,220 --> 02:55:52,220
At the speed of light is of bits of
information headed towards youtube or

3099
02:55:52,651 --> 02:55:55,260
Twitter or Facebook. I,
they trying to catch it all.

3100
02:55:55,350 --> 02:55:59,870
Some of it's Nazis and some of it's frogs
and an Alex Jones, Ben, his name, blah,

3101
02:55:59,871 --> 02:56:02,990
blah, blah, blah. And they just,
everything's flying it out. I'm like, oh.

3102
02:56:03,270 --> 02:56:07,830
And then congress is like, Mr Zuckerberg,
you know what you're doing. It's like,

3103
02:56:08,040 --> 02:56:09,390
hold on, let me drink her water. Hold on.

3104
02:56:11,230 --> 02:56:15,850
Uh, Mr Senator, yes. We know
what we're doing. I think,

3105
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:20,860
I think Mr. Senator, no, that isn't
no special or knows what he's doing.

3106
02:56:20,900 --> 02:56:24,610
Also, he's, he's not, he's not a
monk, right? He's not some scholar.

3107
02:56:24,611 --> 02:56:28,540
He's not a genius. He's not
enlightened. He's a guy. He's just like,

3108
02:56:28,541 --> 02:56:31,750
he's not a stupid guy. He's a
smart guy, but he's just a person.

3109
02:56:31,840 --> 02:56:36,840
Just a human and has an
insane connection and insane.

3110
02:56:38,770 --> 02:56:43,770
He's the CEO of one of the biggest groups
on the planet where people exchange

3111
02:56:46,180 --> 02:56:46,980
conversation,

3112
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:49,320
which still hasn't verified
me on Instagram. By the way,

3113
02:56:49,710 --> 02:56:52,740
let it remind not because they're not
seeing how many followers you got.

3114
02:56:52,830 --> 02:56:56,490
Only 7,000 Instagram.
That's my weakest one borough.

3115
02:56:56,650 --> 02:56:59,490
You touched the fuck up,
but uh,

3116
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:03,660
but it's also like Lucy, Lucille ball
when she's working the chocolate factory,

3117
02:57:03,690 --> 02:57:07,260
right. The chocolates are coming out and
then they go faster and faster. Oh yeah.

3118
02:57:08,340 --> 02:57:09,900
There's a certain point where you,

3119
02:57:09,901 --> 02:57:13,320
you're not going to be able to process
this much information and scan it and any

3120
02:57:13,321 --> 02:57:15,300
filter, any filter, by its nature,

3121
02:57:15,310 --> 02:57:18,690
any coder will tell you is going to be
imperfect and it's going to weed out

3122
02:57:18,691 --> 02:57:21,550
people. It doesn't want to eat
out and and leave people in the,

3123
02:57:21,551 --> 02:57:24,300
you don't want to leave it like any
filters only as good as its creator.

3124
02:57:24,750 --> 02:57:26,180
That's what I wanted

3125
02:57:26,260 --> 02:57:29,800
people to kind of understand from Jack.

3126
02:57:29,801 --> 02:57:34,600
And he did a pretty good job of explaining
that and then saying that it just

3127
02:57:34,601 --> 02:57:39,601
shows you the problems with
trying to monitor these things,

3128
02:57:40,001 --> 02:57:40,150
right.

3129
02:57:40,150 --> 02:57:40,830
Scale.

3130
02:57:40,830 --> 02:57:44,790
But the thing I would say to Jack is one
work around if someone is a high enough

3131
02:57:44,791 --> 02:57:48,330
platform where they're contributing
like the, the laws against obscenity,

3132
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:52,650
the ruling was if there's some cultural
benefit here, it's not regards of scene,

3133
02:57:52,651 --> 02:57:53,610
right?
That's a blue pool.

3134
02:57:53,970 --> 02:57:57,630
If someone is big enough in terms of
their part of the public conversation,

3135
02:57:58,170 --> 02:58:01,860
you should have a manual person, double
check or triple check. They're blocked.

3136
02:58:02,190 --> 02:58:04,530
You could give them a warning.
Explain why.

3137
02:58:04,920 --> 02:58:08,100
Because it's important for [inaudible].
Here's the question for what it does.

3138
02:58:08,490 --> 02:58:10,170
If there's gotta be rules,
but you are getting blocked.

3139
02:58:10,171 --> 02:58:12,870
If you're threatening violence
against someone like you,

3140
02:58:13,620 --> 02:58:16,440
if you're sending like Dick Pics to
report or you should be blocked. I mean,

3141
02:58:16,441 --> 02:58:21,420
and if you're, if you have,
uh, you're putting up people's
information, find doxing,

3142
02:58:21,660 --> 02:58:22,970
putting people's address out,
right?

3143
02:58:22,980 --> 02:58:26,820
When you go to your home telling people
you want to pay someone $100 to take the

3144
02:58:26,821 --> 02:58:30,750
photo [inaudible] photo and video of
someone who's not giving you permission,

3145
02:58:30,930 --> 02:58:35,200
you're uploading in an offering. This
is what that guy did is offering $100.

3146
02:58:35,250 --> 02:58:39,390
That's crazy. So with sunglasses,
that work. Yes. Kim, I'm not jack.

3147
02:58:39,391 --> 02:58:42,990
How could that work? I
don't know Jack get it. Um,

3148
02:58:43,380 --> 02:58:46,170
but he very easily that people like that.

3149
02:58:46,171 --> 02:58:48,990
You should tell them you could that way
you'd be banding if you're doxing people.

3150
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:52,530
Yes, but someone is doing a parody. You,
it could be like, take this down for x,

3151
02:58:52,531 --> 02:58:54,120
Y and z reasons do.
The thing is,

3152
02:58:54,121 --> 02:58:59,121
I think they tried to make a
differentiation between doxing someone and

3153
02:58:59,731 --> 02:59:04,290
threatening to dock someone.
This is how the kept Kathy Griffin on,

3154
02:59:04,410 --> 02:59:08,340
right? Remember when she was
saying, I want names of his
kids. Yeah. For these kids.

3155
02:59:09,030 --> 02:59:12,640
You know, imagine if
they did and the, the,

3156
02:59:12,650 --> 02:59:16,080
the kids eventually all their information
did get wind up getting online.

3157
02:59:16,110 --> 02:59:19,500
But when you watch the full video
and you saw what actually happened,

3158
02:59:19,501 --> 02:59:20,730
you're like,
God damn.

3159
02:59:21,270 --> 02:59:24,210
Like you'd be able to have really
shifted the narrative gets,

3160
02:59:24,211 --> 02:59:28,200
I posted a picture of myself holding up
a bloody Clinton Hillary Clinton head

3161
02:59:28,590 --> 02:59:33,420
that I wouldn't be banned. Ooh, I'm not
going to find out, but that's a big deal.

3162
02:59:33,960 --> 02:59:36,270
And I didn't even don't,
she was obviously doing as a joke.

3163
02:59:36,270 --> 02:59:37,110
I didn't find it offensive.

3164
02:59:37,111 --> 02:59:39,540
I think it'd be funny if she was
wearing a hijab while she did the photo,

3165
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:44,130
but the point of shit, no consequences
on Twitter. None. Um, yeah,

3166
02:59:44,131 --> 02:59:48,420
I think you would be banned. Yeah.
Almost positive. You'd be banned.

3167
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:52,380
It's for whatever reason,
it's more disturbing. See a
guy holding a woman's head.

3168
02:59:52,500 --> 02:59:56,220
Sure. That's true. Um, in the,
see, even if it was Obama,

3169
02:59:56,520 --> 03:00:00,060
the idea is like Kathy Griffin probably
wouldn't be able to cut Trump's head off.

3170
03:00:01,020 --> 03:00:04,540
Like he kick her ass. He's a
big dude. If she, you know,

3171
03:00:04,550 --> 03:00:05,670
she came at him with the knife.

3172
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:07,740
I mean she'd have to shoot
him and then cut his head off,

3173
03:00:07,741 --> 03:00:11,010
which I guess you could do. It's not as
long as she's got to use the palms. Oh,

3174
03:00:11,011 --> 03:00:14,880
the palm to the nose. Tom's at the nose,
nose bone in the brain. Would you do that?

3175
03:00:14,881 --> 03:00:16,980
I'm just trying to like
run the numbers in my head.

3176
03:00:17,010 --> 03:00:20,160
There's 126 million
daily users on Twitter.

3177
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:23,490
How many people should they hire?
Remember when we were asking me.

3178
03:00:23,500 --> 03:00:26,310
I know that's like, I'm just remember.
I'm like, that's going back over my head.

3179
03:00:26,311 --> 03:00:29,760
Like how that cue, if someone
could get through a hundred a day,

3180
03:00:29,850 --> 03:00:33,360
if they could get through a hundred a
day and spending five minutes on each of

3181
03:00:33,361 --> 03:00:36,010
them, that's 500 minutes.
That's more than there.

3182
03:00:36,110 --> 03:00:39,300
That's [inaudible].
No way you're going to do,

3183
03:00:39,710 --> 03:00:42,790
I'm going to have to use the
reporting system is smart. Yes.

3184
03:00:42,900 --> 03:00:46,860
Like you're relying on the users to report
things that are initiative that smart,

3185
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:50,550
but it falls victim to trolling because
then someone can just decide to attack

3186
03:00:50,551 --> 03:00:55,040
Jamie Vernon. Don't do it. Got
Charles at the worst. Yeah,
those. Fuck Oh that's you.

3187
03:00:55,260 --> 03:00:58,290
Oh my goodness.
That's the bad kind of trolling.

3188
03:00:58,560 --> 03:01:00,130
That's just being an asshole dude.
We

3189
03:01:00,130 --> 03:01:02,620
already did three hours. Oh, how
are they? How's that possible?

3190
03:01:02,910 --> 03:01:07,060
I'm just adorable and charming. I guess
that's something something happened.

3191
03:01:07,090 --> 03:01:09,380
I'll go with that. It's
good to answer is any, um,

3192
03:01:09,550 --> 03:01:13,960
your book is called the New Right.
We barely talked about it. Um, more,

3193
03:01:13,961 --> 03:01:16,440
more stuff for people to
read. Yeah. A journey to the,

3194
03:01:16,480 --> 03:01:18,160
how's the first 12 pages inside joke.

3195
03:01:18,520 --> 03:01:23,500
A journey to the fringe of American
politics, Michael Malice. And,

3196
03:01:23,501 --> 03:01:26,620
uh, thank you, brother. Thank you, man.
That was a pleasure, Jeff. Thank you.

3197
03:01:27,190 --> 03:01:28,023
Bye everybody.

3198
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:35,400
That was [inaudible].

3199
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:43,010
Mm.
