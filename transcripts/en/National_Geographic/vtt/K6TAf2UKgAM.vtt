00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.238
( intro music )

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:37.137 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.512 line:0%
Sanga: Imagine if your
sister or daughter

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:49.181 line:0%
had to miss school twice a week

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:52.151 line:0%
to walk 10 kilometers
to gather wood

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.520 line:0%
for your family to cook with.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.657
Millions of girls across
the African continent

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.193
go through this every day.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.395
As a matter of
fact, my own sister

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:05.298
had to miss school
twice a week, every week

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:08.634
to go and gather
wood for my family.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.704
But at first,
I thought this wasn't

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.907
a problem for me to solve,

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.441
until one day.

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.543
I used to work for one
of the biggest banks

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.779
in Uganda as an accountant.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.149
In Uganda, after
you finish school

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.352
you leave your village and
go to find a job in the city.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.155
So that meant that
I was away from home

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:31.490
for long periods of time.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.659
After six months
without going home,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.095
I made the journey to
go and see my mother.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.831
On my way home,
I met my kid sister

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.867
carrying wood on a day she
was supposed to be in school.

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.602
At first I wasn't surprised,

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:45.604
because I also
carried wood as a kid.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:48.141
But when she saw me,
she started crying.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.177
She cried so hard that
at first I got confused.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.179
I thought maybe my
mother was sick,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.547
or something terribly
wrong had happened to her.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:57.883
Or I even thought that maybe she

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.819
was overwhelmed with joy because

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.720
I had not come home
for a long time.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.356
( laughter )

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.791
But when I helped her put
the wood down and asked her,

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.193
"Why are you crying?"

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:11.597
she said, "I'm tired of
missing school to gather wood."

00:02:11.597 --> 00:02:14.934
She told me, "You see, all
the forests here are gone,

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.236
so the distances
keep increasing.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:18.904
First of all,
I can't go to school,

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:22.708
but I am also physically
tired of doing that.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:23.976
It's hurting me."

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:25.544
So I told her, "Don't worry."

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:26.746
I gave her a promise.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.448
"Let's go home.
I will tell mother,

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:30.950
and convince her to allow me

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.753
to take you back with
me to the capital city

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.721
where I worked,
and I will find you

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:39.058
a boarding school where you
don't need to gather wood."

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.960
She was happy,
so we went home.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.363
But when I proposed
this to my mother,

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.864
she rejected it.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.166
She said, "All you
guys are grown."

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:52.271
I have five sisters, but
all of them are married.

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:57.377
Most of them married
between the age of 13 and 15.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.213
So she was the only
one left at home.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:02.915
My mother said,
"Do you want me,
I'm an old woman.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:04.417
Do you want me to be the one

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:06.486
going to find this wood?"

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:08.454
So that failed.

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.355
After my visit I went back

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.458
to my normal job in the city.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.927
But I'm a strong
believer in education.

00:03:14.927 --> 00:03:16.696
Education has changed my life.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:19.465
I wouldn't be here if
I didn't go to school.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:24.103
And 99% of kids
I started life with

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:27.440
didn't get a chance to
continue with education.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.910
When I go to the village
and see the lives they live,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.578
it's so heartbreaking.

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:35.347
Most of them look like
five times my age.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.216
They have 15 children already.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:39.685
They are stuck in poverty there.

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:42.655
So seeing my sister
on the verge of missing

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.791
the only opportunity
she had to improve her life,

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.661
broke my heart,
and I couldn't sleep.

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.764
I would see her
at night in dreams,

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.533
calling my name,
asking me to help her,

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.535
until I couldn't
take it anymore,

00:03:56.535 --> 00:03:57.870
and I left my job.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.472
But I'm an accountant
by training.

00:03:59.472 --> 00:04:00.807
I'm not an engineer.

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:02.208
So my first question was,

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.442
"What are you going to do?"

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:08.414
But then I asked myself,
"If I stay here in this bank,

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.882
I'm busy all the time.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.184
I can't find time
to research anything.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:14.086
Let me just go and see

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:15.321
if I can find a solution."

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:17.656
Actually my boss,
when he was signing

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.558
my resignation letter, said,

00:04:19.558 --> 00:04:22.761
"Sanga, you are
acting like a madman,

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:24.730
but I am going to
sign your resignation.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:25.798
Go and fail.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.733
I've given you
a period of six months.

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.135
If you fail, come back.

00:04:29.135 --> 00:04:30.570
Your job will be here."

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.770
I said, "Thank you, sir."

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.807
I went, but in my heart I knew

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.809
I wasn't going to come back.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:37.910
So I went...

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.112
The first thing I did is I went

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:43.116
to one of the
universities in Uganda,

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.250
which I attended,
called Makerere,

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.353
and went to the
engineering department,

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:49.655
and looked for the
professor that headed

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.324
the engineering department,

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:54.159
and told him that I was
trying to find a solution

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:57.262
to the energy crisis in Uganda.

00:04:57.262 --> 00:04:59.131
The first thing he
told me, he said,

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.467
"Young man, I am a professor.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.169
I know many things,
but I have actually

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.304
never done anything
with my hands,

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.606
so I also don't
know what to do."

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:09.574
( laughter )

00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:11.210
"But what I will do for you is

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.845
I will give you literature.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.713
I have a lot of papers.

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:16.249
I have magazines."

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.351
So he went to his
office and got a box

00:05:18.351 --> 00:05:19.786
full of papers, and said,

00:05:19.786 --> 00:05:21.220
"Go and read.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.922
If you find
something interesting,

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.590
come back to me.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.091
I will maybe help you."

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:30.295
So I took the box and spent
an entire week in the house,

00:05:30.295 --> 00:05:32.198
reading through these papers,

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:35.435
until I came across an
article that talked about

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.170
some trials that were
done in the Amazon forest

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.374
where indigenous people
were turning waste,

00:05:41.374 --> 00:05:45.877
like leafy materials,
into fuel and fertilizers.

00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:47.547
That was very exciting to me.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:50.116
As a matter of fact, as
I was reading through that

00:05:50.116 --> 00:05:52.151
I could see a pile
of sugar cane waste

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.586
outside my window.

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:55.655
Uganda is predominantly
agriculture.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.323
Everyone has a farm.

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:59.592
They grow food,
mostly subsistence.

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:01.794
But there is a lot of
waste that no one uses.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:03.395
I was very excited.

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:05.231
I went to the
professor and said,

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:06.798
"I found a solution."

00:06:06.798 --> 00:06:08.400
He said, "Calm down, young man.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.135
I told you I'm a professor.

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:12.171
I don't know how to help you.

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.939
But I will take
you to my class."

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.708
So he took me to his class,

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:17.443
and made me stand in
front of the class,

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.578
and said, "This young man
is crazy enough to think

00:06:19.578 --> 00:06:22.314
that he can solve the energy
crisis of this country.

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:23.549
Who wants to help him?"

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.617
And everyone's hand went up.

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:26.919
( laughter )

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:28.754
So he took me out and said,

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:31.190
"Okay, I'm going to
choose 10 students

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.526
that I'm really
sure are very good,

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.394
and you can use
our facilities here.

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:38.530
But I warn you, we don't
have any research budget

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.298
for that kind of work here.

00:06:40.298 --> 00:06:42.635
So you have to fund everything.

00:06:42.635 --> 00:06:45.371
If there's need
for buying things,

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:46.739
be prepared to fund that."

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:47.807
I said, "No problem."

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:52.778
We started with the 10 students.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:55.447
We tried many things
that didn't work.

00:06:55.447 --> 00:06:57.182
I actually left
the bank with about

00:06:57.182 --> 00:06:58.985
1.5 million Uganda shillings.

00:06:58.985 --> 00:07:00.685
That's roughly $500.

00:07:00.685 --> 00:07:03.389
It was gone in like two months,

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:08.093
and we had not really found
a solution that worked.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.564
As a young man, I had bought
a few expensive things,

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:17.303
like a television set,
a refrigerator, a sofa set,

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.638
those things that when
you are coming out of red

00:07:19.638 --> 00:07:21.773
you are like,
"If I first get my job,

00:07:21.773 --> 00:07:23.475
I will get all these things."

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:26.678
I first watched some
television when I was 15,

00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:28.880
so the first thing I
bought was a television,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.517
because I had never
really had a television.

00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:35.888
I went home and phoned a buyer,

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.623
brought him to my house,

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.224
said, "This is what I have.

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.592
How much are you giving me?"

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:43.095
I found a good buyer.

00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:45.531
He brought a pickup
and took everything,

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.233
and I had some money.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:50.002
The challenge came when my
girlfriend came to visit...

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.304
( laughter )

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:54.840
... and found me in an empty
house, and asked me,

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.142
"What is the problem?

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:57.876
Have you moved?"

00:07:57.876 --> 00:07:59.211
( laughter )

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.512
"You didn't tell me."

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:02.381
I said, "No, I sold everything."

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:04.150
She said, "Are you
out of your mind?

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.819
I thought you were mad
when you left your job,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.655
but now I am totally
sure you are crazy.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.057
You need to check yourself
in a mental institution."

00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:13.659
( laughter )

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:15.127
She slammed the door.

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:17.696
I didn't see her
again for six months.

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:22.667
But the good story is,
I got the money.

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:25.271
I went back to the university,

00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:28.440
and with the help of those
10 university students,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.877
we built two pieces
of technology.

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:36.182
One is a kiln, and another
one is a briquetting machine.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.750
I will be telling
you about those

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.653
pieces of technology later.

00:08:41.653 --> 00:08:43.355
But that was the foundation.

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:47.326
And with that, I was
able to start my company,

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:49.228 line:0%
Eco-Fuel Africa,

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:52.865 line:0%
which basically works
with local communities

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:55.901 line:0%
to turn locally sourced
farm and municipal waste

00:08:55.901 --> 00:08:58.871 line:0%
into clean cooking fuel
and organic fertilizers,

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.806 line:0%
and this is how
the business works.

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.808 line:0%
The business is
based on basically

00:09:03.808 --> 00:09:05.278 line:0%
the two pieces of technology.

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.511
One is a kiln.

00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:10.049
These are very basic
pieces of technology.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:13.085
The kiln is made out
of old oil drums.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:16.455
We go to slums and townships

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:19.158
and collect or buy
old oil drums,

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.660
remodify them and
give them a chimney,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.495
and design them in
a way that limits

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:27.166
the amount of oxygen that goes
into the combustion process.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:28.868
We go back to the villages,

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.269
find farmers with the
help of local leaders,

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:33.738
train these farmers
how to use these kilns,

00:09:33.738 --> 00:09:36.141
and after the training
we give them a kiln

00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:37.910
on a lease to own basis.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.945
The farmers take
these kilns back

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:44.383
and start converting their
farm waste into a powder.

00:09:44.383 --> 00:09:47.219 line:0%
We call this powder a char,

00:09:47.219 --> 00:09:48.753 line:0%
and we teach these farmers

00:09:48.753 --> 00:09:50.889 line:0%
to sieve this powder on screens.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:54.192
Approximately 80% of
the powder they make

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:57.663
goes through the sieve, and
we buy that from the farmers.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:10:01.267
The coarser portion that
remains on top of the screen

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.735
can be used--

00:10:02.735 --> 00:10:05.537
We teach farmers how to
mix that with compost,

00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:07.872
and they can return
it to their gardens

00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:09.942
as a fertilizer called bio-char.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.277
So they don't have
to buy fertilizers,

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:16.716
and they can renew their soils

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:18.650
and increase their
soil fertility.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.153
As a matter of fact,
recently we made a survey,

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:22.988
and most of these
farmers were able

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:26.225
to increase their
harvest by over 30%

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:28.527
using these fertilizers.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.929
After buying this
powder from the farmers,

00:10:30.929 --> 00:10:34.432
we take it to our
production facilities.

00:10:34.432 --> 00:10:36.301
We built a number of
production facilities

00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:39.405
in these villages, where we
use the briquetting machines

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:41.773
that the students
helped us build,

00:10:41.773 --> 00:10:43.976
to compress them into briquettes

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.444
that people can use to cook.

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.313
Our briquettes are
50% cheaper than

00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:50.783
traditional charcoal from wood.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:55.020
They burn cleaner, and
they burn 30 minutes longer

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.457
compared to wood,
so people can save money.

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:03.362
Users of our fuel save
about $200 a year,

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.497
because of using this fuel.

00:11:05.497 --> 00:11:09.135
Because of that, they
can cook regular meals.

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:13.405
They don't have to deplete
forests to cook food,

00:11:13.405 --> 00:11:18.143
and they don't have to suffer
from indoor air pollution.

00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:22.113
But we don't sell our fuel
directly to the consumers.

00:11:22.113 --> 00:11:24.482
We've created
a distribution network

00:11:24.482 --> 00:11:26.685
where we work with local women

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:29.121
to sell this fuel back
to the communities.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.422
These are everyday women.

00:11:30.422 --> 00:11:32.491
We go to these communities.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.292
We talk to local leaders.

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:36.862
They help us identity
marginalized women.

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:40.499
Most of our women retailers
are single mothers,

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.901
widows, people who
would not ordinarily

00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:46.539
find any other job,
have no marketable skills.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:50.709
We train them and build
them a well-branded kiosk,

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:55.513
which acts like
a one-stop shop center...

00:11:55.513 --> 00:11:57.282
<i> I think my English is right.</i>

00:11:57.282 --> 00:12:00.652
... in the village, and people
can come and buy fuel,

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:02.654
but we also allow them
to sell other things

00:12:02.654 --> 00:12:05.924
like tomatoes, oranges, food,

00:12:05.924 --> 00:12:10.595
so that people get that one-stop
center shopping experience.

00:12:10.595 --> 00:12:13.898
It makes it easy for them
to sell enough briquettes.

00:12:13.898 --> 00:12:17.936
We've already created
460 women retailers

00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:19.571
in these communities.

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:24.042
These make about $152
a month in income.

00:12:24.042 --> 00:12:26.444
This is middle-class
income actually in Uganda.

00:12:26.444 --> 00:12:28.880
It's more than what
the government of Uganda

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.983
pays primary school
teachers, for example.

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:33.485
With this income,
these women can

00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.054
send their children to school.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:36.955
They can buy food
for their families,

00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:38.623
take their children to hospital,

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:40.926
and improve their livelihoods.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:43.395
We have made some strides.

00:12:43.395 --> 00:12:46.398
We started from scratch
a few years ago.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:50.002
We now have over 2,500
farmers with our kilns,

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:51.469
the kilns I showed you,

00:12:51.469 --> 00:12:54.839
that supply us with the char.

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:59.144
We have 460 women distributors,

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:04.249
and over 100,000
people use our fuel

00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:06.118
on a daily basis in Uganda.

00:13:06.118 --> 00:13:08.553
But we are still
a drop in the ocean,

00:13:08.553 --> 00:13:11.757
because currently our
biggest challenge is

00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:16.995
the demand for our fuel
exceeds our supply by far.

00:13:16.995 --> 00:13:19.498
Uganda has 35 million people.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:23.435
We are now reaching
only 100,000 plus.

00:13:23.435 --> 00:13:26.972
We are still very small compared
to the demand out there.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.341
The biggest challenge
we have is that

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:32.744
Africa has an
infrastructure problem.

00:13:32.744 --> 00:13:35.380
Some of these villages
cannot be accessed.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.882
There is no road.

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:38.550
So people come from
a village and say,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.186
"We want your fuel."

00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:43.321
But there's no road
connecting to that village.

00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:45.324
So that has been a challenge,

00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:46.625
how to collect all that.

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.528
But I want to thank National
Geographic very much,

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.930
because last year
they gave us a grant

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.100
that helped us rethink
our business model.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.335
We created something
called franchising...

00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:59.271
( laughter )

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.407
... which helped us,
micro franchising.

00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:06.578
It's not a term we created,
but the model,

00:14:06.578 --> 00:14:09.715
we call it micro franchising.

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:12.351
Micro franchising
basically enables us

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:15.988
to eliminate shipping
and transporting things

00:14:15.988 --> 00:14:18.890
over long distances.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.595
It enables us to
decentralize our production.

00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:25.364
We go to villages.

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:29.535
We find local people who
can manage this business.

00:14:29.535 --> 00:14:32.504
Because there are so many
scattered production centers

00:14:32.504 --> 00:14:34.306
we can't own all of them.

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:37.075
We will become insane.

00:14:37.075 --> 00:14:44.382
So we empower local communities
to manage those businesses.

00:14:44.382 --> 00:14:47.486
What National
Geographic did for us

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:50.856
is they gave us money to
create a revolving loan fund

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.958
that enables us to
provide the technology

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.762
those communities need to
launch these micro businesses,

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.130
and within six months
they pay us back,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.132
and then we go to
the next village.

00:15:01.132 --> 00:15:03.235
With this, we think we can reach

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.737
over 100 million people,

00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:09.108
that is slightly over
16.6 million households,

00:15:09.108 --> 00:15:12.144
by the year 2030,
stop deforestation,

00:15:12.144 --> 00:15:15.046
stop indoor air pollution,
and change the world.

00:15:15.046 --> 00:15:16.615
I invite you to our journey.

00:15:16.615 --> 00:15:17.882
Thank you very much.

00:15:17.882 --> 00:15:22.021
( applause )

00:15:22.021 --> 00:15:25.224 line:0%
