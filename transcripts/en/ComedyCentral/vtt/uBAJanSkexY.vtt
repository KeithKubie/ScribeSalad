- Born and raised, from
the west side of Chicago.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.977
Where the Chicago
Bulls played at.

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.311

Michael Jordan.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.048
- Heard of him.

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:49.315
- He's the greatest ever.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.817
- He just turned 50
and he's still going.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.552

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.726
Number one, you said my
fucking name wrong, okay.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.161
It's Lil Rel.

Michael Jordan's on drugs.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.197
Let's move on.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.832
- I'm off my game, forgive me.

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:08.768
I don't have my notes, my
writers dropped the ball.

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:10.703
Where are my notes?

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:12.806
You're embarrassing me.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.308
Okay, it says here you were on

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.877
BET Comic View.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.379 align:start size:88% position:13%

- That's not a surprise.

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:20.713 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But why did you have,
I'm looking at your notes.

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:21.881 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Well.
- Why did you have

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:22.982
to start with BET though?

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:24.417
There's other shit before that.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.753 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is at the bottom,
there's other stuff on top.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.988
Why did you start with BET?

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.891
Okay, we know I'm black,
I'm not light-skinned.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.626
I'm not your color, look
put your hand next to mine.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.128
We know what it is.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:36.396
You didn't have to
start out with BET.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.664
I'm embarrassed about this.

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.498
- Okay.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:39.666
- You know?

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yell at my writers,
they'll take it.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.335
- Who wrote BET down?

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:43.536
Okay!

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You changed your
name, your real name is

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:47.841
it says here, Milton Howery.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.842
Am I saying that right?

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:49.676
- Right.
- Howery?

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:50.977
Okay I said it right.

00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:52.512 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I haven't changed it but--
- Thank God.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:53.947 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Understand this, 'cause it's
easy for you to say Milton.

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:56.716
Milton, I come from a
long line of Miltons.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.085
So my father's name is Milton,

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:00.954
my grandfather's name is Milton,

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.555
his father was named Milton.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.023
I'm really Milton the fourth.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.859

Cruising in Chicago.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.067
You got it.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Why did you bring up Kanye?
- He's from Chicago.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:16.269
- [Lil Rel] I don't give a fuck.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.203
- "Call a man."

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:17.937
- This is my moment, okay?

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.405
- [Brody] Okay.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:19.973
- You think Kanye talking about
me in his fucking interview?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:20.807
- No.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.041
- No, he ain't.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:22.809
Don't bring Kanye
up no fuckin' more.

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.743
- [Brody] Yes.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:24.477
- Go on to the next thing.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.311
- Okay.

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:28.014
- Why you shaking, you nervous?

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:28.948 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm a little nervous.
- Why?

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:30.183
Why you scared of me, huh?

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:31.718 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't even have
fucking facial hair.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.153
I'm wearing glasses.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:34.053
I'm scared of you.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.522
- Why?

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.324
- You have a kidnapper shirt
on, you got a kidnapper's beard

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.559
- This shirt is 818 till I die.

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.427
- I don't know what the
fuck that means man.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.662
- San Fernando Valley.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.830 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't know what San,
see that sound like a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.331
kidnapper city, I'm sorry.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.366
You gonna kidnap me after this.

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.567
- No, no.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.401 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is not Comedy
Central is it?

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.435
Who are you people?

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.770

Jazeera Network.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.406
And you are on hidden camera.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.507
Yes!

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:56.309
I'm kidding about that.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:57.510
Where were you in 1999?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.511
- In high school.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:01.181
- Okay, I was on Premium Blend.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:04.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So it took you over,
let's see, 14 years

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.553 align:start size:97% position:3%
to come up with a good
half-hour for Comedy Central?

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:08.021
- I hope it's good.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.722

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:11.991 align:start size:84% position:16%

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.961
Let's protest, let's

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:18.064

is wrong with that?

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.666
How dare you!

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.402
- Why the fuck you, I'm Baptist.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.370
I'm not a fucking Muslim.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.572

We're there too.

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:39.285
Friendship?

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.253
I know you got that.
