00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.876
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:05.000
- Judy, that was exquisite.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:05.870
Thank you so much.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.630
Thank you all for being
here, and thanks especially

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.560
to my Radcliffe fellow Fellows
and to the Radcliffe staff that

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.630
have humored me when I
said, could we possibly

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.022
make it a more inviting space?

00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:19.480
So it's really an
honor to be here,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.980
and I'm going to start
by saying, forgive me.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.900
Forgive me if I miss the
mark or otherwise disappoint.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.460
Think about that phrase.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.870
Forgive me.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.850
How often have you said it?

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.790
These are the words that
we use when we arrive late,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.130
when we need someone to
repeat a phrase that we

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.430
didn't hear well, when we do
something much more egregious.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.070
These are the words that are
familiar in the prayers of so

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.940
many religions.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.800
These words are steps towards
repentance and redemption.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.990
Is forgiveness between
people something

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.690
so worthwhile that government,
courts, legislatures, juries,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.030
public officials
ought to encourage it?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.580
Should law itself be forgiving?

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.830
Forgiveness as I
use it means letting

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.710
go of justified
resentment or grievance.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.110
The justified part
is pretty important.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.780
It's not forgiveness
if there's a defense,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.270
if there's an excuse,
if there's a ground

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.170
to blame the other one.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.580
Requests for
forgiveness fill art,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.700
including lyrics of pop
culture, detailing mistakes

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.360
and apologies between lovers,
parents and children, citizens

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.900
and governments,
individuals and their gods.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.800
Victor Hugo's classic novel
Les Miserables-- who's read it?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.300
Who's seen the show?

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.730
OK.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.200
The story illuminates the human
costs of an unforgiving law.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.260
It imposes those costs not
only on the criminal defendant,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.540
but also on the law enforcer.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.930
In its climax-- spoiler alert--

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.840
the escaped convict,
Valjean, mercifully

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.630
spares the life of the police
chief who has spent years

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.600
pursuing him, shocking
the man of the law

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.730
with the power of forgiveness.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.120
Whether to forgive and why
is a theme in entertainment,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.729
in relationship advice,
in religious counseling

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.600
and political drama.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.400
And when a high
government official

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.460
is caught in a personal
or political scandal,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.540
journalists and philosophers and
bloggers and family and friends

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.020
discuss whether and when such
a figure should be forgiven,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.000
and if so, by whom.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.930
Forgiveness expresses
a generosity of spirit

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.270
and a constructive
focus on the future.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.110
It's potentially a
non-depleting resource offering

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.710
physical, psychological, and
practical relief for wrongdoers

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.540
and for victims of wrongdoing.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.659
And it's not just for people.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.950
One thing that I've been able
to do during my Radcliffe

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.610
fellowship is read about
how animals strengthen

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.520
their social relationships
through acts of consolation

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.640
and attentiveness, often
taking the forms of grooming

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.220
and stroking and sexual conduct.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.510
Not exactly what
people do all the time.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.500
But it reduces tension and
strengthens community and peace

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.670
and social integration.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.730
And maybe, maybe
biological evolution

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.100
developed forgiveness
as a survival tactic.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.700
But forgiveness has its limits.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.190
Mass murders, rapes, abduction
of children, genocide.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.080
Some acts defy conception,
not to mention forgiveness.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.960
In these circumstances,
private or public pressure

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.430
on a victim to forgive looks
like a new victimization,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.010
denying the victim
her own choice.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.550
Pressure to forgive
unfairly targets some people

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.060
more than others.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.240
Some people may not
feel very forgiving.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.610
And I know about that
because I drive in Boston.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.980
It's even harder to figure
out whether and when law

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.960
itself forgives.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.590
Can a government forgive
on behalf of its citizens?

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.910
If courts or prosecutors forego
warranted legal consequences

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.190
for instances of
wrongdoing, does that

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.030
jeopardize adherence to
rules, to deterrence,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.540
and the commitment to
treat like cases alike?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.170
My work asks whether and
when law should encourage

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.280
people to forgive one another.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.010
Should law itself
be used to encourage

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.060
people to forgive each other?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.240
And should law itself forgive?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.750
I am focused on criminal law,
both in the United States

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.060
and internationally.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.880
And internationally, that
means crimes against humanity

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.330
or other very serious offenses.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.250
And I'm also focused on debt.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.440
It may seem like
an odd conjunction,

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.400
but think about it.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.430
It's not by accident.

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.700
We talk about forgiving a debt.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.140
And in my efforts, I'm looking
at consumer debt, debt produced

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.320
by the legal system itself
like fines and fees,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.410
and sovereign debt,
debt incurred by states

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.810
and municipalities and nations.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.980
Also of interest
everywhere I look

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.570
I see questions of forgiveness.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.560
Should the government forgive
violations of immigration law?

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.910
Are there limits on the
pardon power of the president?

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.180
Will the growing use
of algorithms in law

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.320
permit more forgiveness
or restrict it?

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.200
Now lawyers like to focus
on particular cases.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.730
This gives us context.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.360
It also means that we actually
realize at the end of the day,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.990
there has to be a
practical decision.

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.940
Let me share with
you a tough one.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.330
Like many legal problems,
it has disturbing elements.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.780
It involves a killing of a
person with disabilities.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.900
It presents troubling
legal and moral questions.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.780
And warning, I'm going to
ask you your views very soon.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.260
Louis Repouille, an
immigrant to this country,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.800
sought to become a
naturalized citizen.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.060
The governing law then and now
requires that such applicants

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.370
demonstrate, and I
quote from the statute,

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.070
"good moral character.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.520
Good moral character
during the five years

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.450
preceding the application."

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.920
Unfortunately, four
years and 49 weeks

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.070
before his application,
Mr. Repouille

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.780
engaged in an act that led to
his prosecution for murder.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.280
What was the act?

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.120
He used a drug to put to death
one of his five children.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.770
The child was then 13 years
old, had severe brain damage,

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.950
was blind, unable to
communicate or control

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.840
his bodily functions,
feed himself, or move.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.780
Mr. Repouille was
indicted for manslaughter

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.830
in the first degree.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.630
That means that the
prosecutor viewed it

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.260
as a serious offense, but
less serious than murder

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.180
or first-degree homicide.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.900
He was charged with the crime
of killing a person when there

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.480
are mitigating circumstances.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.150
A jury agreed and disagreed.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.640
The jury convicted
him of manslaughter

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.240
in the second degree, which
means a killing reflecting

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.090
recklessness or negligence
rather than an intention

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.260
to murder.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.410
Not exactly suited
to the circumstance.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.830
The jury did something very
unusual even beyond that.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.940
The jury wrote the judge a
note and said to the judge,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.880
please use the utmost clemency.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.410
The judge in turn stayed
the sentence, which means

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.050
suspended any punishment,
and placed Mr. Repouille

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.110
on probation, which he served.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.990
And that was the end
of the criminal case.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.550
Four years and 49 weeks
after he killed his son,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.360
Mr. Repouille applied to
become a United States citizen.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.360
And now we come to the
question, what would you do?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.280
If presented with
his application

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.020
to become a United
States citizen,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.380
how should we view what happened
in light of the legal standard

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:58.640
requiring the applicant to
prove "good moral character"

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.070
in the prior five years?

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.240
Yes or no?

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.700
"Good moral character,"
enough to become

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.360
a naturalized citizen, and why?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.160
OK.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.300
I'm going to ask you to talk
to your neighbors about this.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.630
At least one other person, no
more than three others, OK?

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:26.360
All right.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.181
Are we ready?

00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.320
What did you think?

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.620
I mean, actually, there's
several questions here, right?

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.604
So what did you think?

00:08:34.604 --> 00:08:36.020
And you can tell
me what you think

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.059
the questions are too, right?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.650
What do you think?

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:42.700
Well, and what's
the right answer?

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.061
But you can also
frame the question.

00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:46.560
Liz.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.380
- I was going to say, the
law doesn't say legal.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.290
It says moral.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:50.790
- Correct.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.917
- And so one then would be
making a judgement about what

00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:57.274
the moral situation was.

00:08:57.274 --> 00:09:01.556
And clearly, the jury was
making the recommendation

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:03.488
based on a definition
of morality

00:09:03.488 --> 00:09:05.420
that they felt that
they [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.318
have been [INAUDIBLE]
moral choice, right?

00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:09.290
Moral choice.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.820
- So you would say, go ahead
and grant him citizenship.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.150
OK.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.931
Yes?

00:09:14.931 --> 00:09:18.298
- Is it more or less horrible
because the child had brain

00:09:18.298 --> 00:09:22.630
damage, as opposed to
someone in a [INAUDIBLE]??

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.350
- Right.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.801
That's a tough question.

00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:29.236
- Did he-- this is my
husband's question.

00:09:29.236 --> 00:09:30.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:35.080
Did he turn himself in
and say, I did this.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.489
I know it's against the
law, but please have mercy.

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:42.220
Or did he try to conceal
his killing of a child?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:42.720
- OK.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.130
Good question.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.540
- I have a question.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.147
What was his intent
for killing his child?

00:09:50.147 --> 00:09:52.230
Was it really that he felt
it was a mercy killing,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.250
or was he just
sick of the burden?

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.750
- Right.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.250
OK.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.020
So people want to know more.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.328
Michael.

00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:01.681
- Was it actually requested
by the child in whatever

00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:03.480
form he could communicate?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.750
- This child could not
communicate in any way.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.839
That one, I know the answer to.

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:12.505
- Can we please wait
for the microphone?

00:10:12.505 --> 00:10:13.749
- Oh, mic is coming to you.

00:10:13.749 --> 00:10:14.290
Sorry, sorry.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.520
- No.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.240
I asked the question,
cultural context.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.610
So his actions in
a different culture

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.121
may have been
considered ethically OK.

00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:28.120
- Such a great question.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.180
And after all,
he's an immigrant.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.250
And so by which country's
standards should he be judged?

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.520
- Sorry.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.603
What did the mother think?

00:10:39.603 --> 00:10:40.980
- What did the mother think?

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.310
It's a good question.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.680
And one more.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.690
- Besides the circumstances
of his killing,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.310
the question before
us is whether he

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.200
should get citizenship.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.560
And considering
how many citizens

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.560
we have that are wingnuts
and running around, killing

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.790
people on a daily basis--

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.790
--a weekly basis, apparently.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.710
You know, it's hard to draw
the line on the citizenship

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.740
question here.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.190
So to me, besides what
we might interpret

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.199
into the case about the
condition of that child,

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:14.740
the citizenship
question is separate,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.500
and I have no problem
granting him citizenship.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.850
- And should the morality
be tethered to the average

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.680
of existing citizens?

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.220
Or should it be something
quite different, right?

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:27.720
Yeah.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.390
- I'd also say, with respect
to the legal, moral component,

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:39.160
the jury, what they convicted
him of implied no malintent

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.440
in that it was negligent
as opposed to first-degree

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.800
manslaughter, which
is malintent oriented.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.240
So that also probably plays
into the moral-- you know,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.580
I don't know if we
can use the conviction

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.770
as a standard of his
moral conduct in that

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.130
what he was convicted of has
no moral component to it.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.630
- Great.

00:12:00.222 --> 00:12:00.970
- Does it matter?

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.840
And I would think it does
of, what was the method?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.210
I mean, he didn't do
something cruelly.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.740
He didn't have a machete.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.620
- Chloroform.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.120
- OK.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.550
So it was a painless death,
as far as we would know.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.400
- As far as know.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.440
That's right.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.210
- I would like to know what
else he did during the five

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.890
years, not just this one issue.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.070
And secondly, to
really think about

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:30.370
whether good moral character
is merely the absence of bad.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:31.780
- These are deep questions.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.480
Look at this.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.070
Look at this.

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:36.320
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.800
- The way you framed the
question is, what would you do?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.020
And I would not let
him in the country,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.674
because I think that this is
so beautiful as a discussion,

00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:46.840
but there's so many people
who want to gain entrance

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.850
to the US, and you gave
us such an extreme case,

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.340
which is very ambiguous.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.230
I think it's a
very clear answer.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.156
- OK, great.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.092
Lisa.

00:12:59.092 --> 00:13:01.050
- I think it's also a
very fundamental question

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.940
about the nature of criminality
and whether the occurrence

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.620
of a criminal offense is likely
to indicate that there will

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.350
be criminal behavior
in the future,

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.990
whether there is almost a notion
of a propensity to immorality

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.230
that is indicated by
a previous offense.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.010
- Great.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:22.990
Great.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.750
We obviously could
spend the entire time

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.800
talking about this case.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.020
It's a very fascinating
and hard case,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.770
and you have done better
than the court did.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.380
The appeals court
didn't know what to do.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.770
I really want to
tell you, this is

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.860
one of the most puzzling
decisions I've ever read.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.130
I think we have before us
so many wonderful questions

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.280
that you've asked, and at
least one set of questions

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.170
is what, if any, role should
that prior criminal case have

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.370
in interpreting the standard
for the immigration case?

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.660
Another question is, what
is good moral character?

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.310
And even behind that,
how would we know it?

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.580
Is it philosophic?

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.890
Is it sociological?

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:12.520
And of course, would you
grant the citizenship or not?

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.530
So I can tell you
that what actually

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.620
happened, if that's of
interest-- is that of interest?

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.880
Yes.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.340
So the case first
went to a trial

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.370
court, the federal district
court, which said, yes.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.230
He has demonstrated
good moral character

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.180
and ordered that he be
granted citizenship.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.480
Very much, as Liz
suggested, in looking

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.010
at what the prior jury had
done and what the judge had

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:38.790
done in that case.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.100
The district attorney
appealed the case,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.620
and it went to the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.200
where three judges
clearly disagreed

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.350
with each other over what
was good moral character,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:53.160
over whether courts could
answer it, and over what to do.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.360
And I'm going to read to you
from the majority opinion.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.970
"Left at large as
we are without means

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.120
of verifying our conclusion
and without authority

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.670
to substitute our
individual beliefs,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:09.020
the outcome must
needs be tentative."

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.480
It gets worse.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.910
"And not much is
gained by discussion."

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.000
The court basically said,
this case is too hard.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.560
We can't decide.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.560
And then because
it was unclear--

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:27.760
this is where lawyers have ways
to deal with things like this--

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.020
he loses.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.030
Because it's not
clear, he has failed

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.880
to persuade the court
that he demonstrated

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.150
good moral character for
the prior five years.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.920
It was his burden
to persuade us.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.250
But the appeals court goes on.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:47.221
They say, but three weeks can
go by, and he can file again.

00:15:47.221 --> 00:15:49.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.430
Then the conduct falls
outside the five-year period.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.100
What are we to make of this?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.880
It's authored by a distinguished
judge with a very curious name.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.657
The name is Learned Hand.

00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:04.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.470
Can you imagine being
in elementary school

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.270
with that name?

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:12.330
Anyway, the court did not
forgive the lawyer's mistake

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.580
in filing the petition
three weeks earlier.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.550
Clearly, this was a mistake
by the lawyer, right?

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.310
The court was not
forgiving about that, OK?

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.120
Point one.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.240
However, the court offered
forgiveness in saying,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.910
file again.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.980
Without prejudice,
the court specifically

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.170
said, allowing it
to be filed again.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.240
The dictionary actually
defines forgiveness

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.290
as allowing for a
degree of imperfection.

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:37.330
This is allowing
for imperfection.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.350
So yes, the majority on the
court, two out of three,

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.440
were forgiving in dismissing
the case without prejudice

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.460
and allowing a new
petition to come.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.080
The statute itself
is kind of forgiving.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.640
Five years.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.670
Why does the inquiry
stop at that point?

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.940
Practically, there's
a kind of, we

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.220
have to make the
fact finding not too

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.814
difficult for the government.

00:17:00.814 --> 00:17:02.730
But I think there's also
an implicit, whatever

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.829
you did five years ago,
you're a different person

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:06.180
in the meantime.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.640
And yet, I have to
say, I wonder what

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.270
a court would have done if
the person applying even

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:17.790
had waited five years
after committing genocide?

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.710
Would the court then say,
we're not going to look at it?

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:24.200
Aren't some acts unforgivable?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.089
And to know what's
unforgivable, let's

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.480
start by looking hard
at what forgiveness is.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:34.070
And then what does legal
systems and rules currently do

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.750
to seek or promote forgiveness?

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.850
So by forgiveness, as
I've already indicated,

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.820
I mean a conscious,
deliberate decision

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.020
to forego rightful grounds
for grievance and resentment

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:48.520
against those who've
committed a wrong or a harm.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.620
A grievance is a
justified complaint.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.130
And I have to say, the
notion of resentment

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.320
has resonated with me
right now, because I

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.680
don't feel very forgiving
at this moment in the world.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.540
But there are a lot
of resentments flowing

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.310
in lots of
directions, and it has

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.010
made me feel even
more how important it

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:11.030
is to try to find ways to
relieve the resentments that

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.450
have occupied us in this
country and in others.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.210
Forgiveness can offer
benefits to an offender.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.230
It can relieve a
sense of isolation.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.160
It can offer solace
and acceptance.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.020
It can benefit even the
victim, because letting

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:31.540
go of resentment is
a huge liberation.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.780
Even for some, regaining a
connection or simply feeling

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.970
empowered by the
choice to forgive.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.390
But to forgive cannot
be an obligation. .

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:44.780
It has to be a choice held
by the one who was harmed.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.880
And declining to forgive
itself is empowering.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.890
It's a way of saying, no.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.190
I have one thing left, which
is the ability to forgive,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.300
and I'm not going to.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.950
It may be a way to
demand accountability.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.130
Some people may find it
impossible to forgive

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.499
if the wrongdoer
has not apologized.

00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:03.790
This came up in the discussion.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.540
What has the wrongdoer done in
the meantime, or made amends?

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.730
And even when a
wrongdoer apologizes,

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.460
a wrong has been
done, and the desire

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.720
for consequences, even the
desire for revenge I think

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.080
should be honored.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.050
I think that's the source
of a sense of justice.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.410
It's only when you have a
sense that I have been wronged

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:31.150
is there a view that actually,
there is a better way,

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.115
and I am entitled to more.

00:19:33.115 --> 00:19:34.660
A wrong should be made right.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.180
An intended harm should
be met with a consequence.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.160
Pursuing rights,
correcting wrongs.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.500
This is the heartland of law.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.725
And crucially, some
acts are unforgivable.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.330
But then the legal system
itself often forgives.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.150
It creates time limits
on consequences.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.860
It creates amnesty provisions.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.630
It creates other devices.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.460
And here's a danger.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.670
The even-handedness of the
law may be jeopardized.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.539
With each act of forgiveness,
what about another case?

00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.080
Is that going to be
treated the same,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.060
or is that going to be
treated differently?

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.900
And courts and
legislatures, at their best,

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.220
speak to our highest
hopes for fairness,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.910
for predictability,
equality, freedom

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.890
from bias and corruption.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:22.490
And exceptions can
really mess that up.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.500
On the other hand,
let's be honest.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.410
Forgiveness is built in
to any legal system that

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.400
is run by human beings.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.350
There's the discretion of
police, prosecutors, judges,

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.090
juries.

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.330
They exercise their discretion
sometimes to let people off

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.890
without punishment.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.800
Governors and presidents
issue pardons.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.020
Courts reduce liabilities.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.160
Bankruptcy proceedings negotiate
reduced payments on debt.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.860
Legal discretion
permits flexibility,

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.740
and it also permits bias.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.930
Racial bias, other biases.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.120
Unpredictability, a
lack of transparency,

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.970
all at odds with the ideals
of fairness and equality.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.580
So what to do?

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:09.160
Well, it would be nice
to say I have an answer,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.400
but I have a year
to figure it out.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.720
What I do believe is that
law should serve human ends,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.010
and the purposes of law
should be our purposes.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.030
They're not some abstract
thing up in the sky.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.060
They're not a rulebook with
a set of answers somewhere.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:27.760
And we should use
law to help convert

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:30.440
suffering into opportunities.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.700
Those opportunities can
prompt forgiveness perhaps

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.760
by individuals, or
inject forgiveness

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.150
inside the operation
of law itself.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.220
So let's look a little
bit more closely

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.710
at how forgiveness
already operates,

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.570
at least in the
American legal system.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.580
And that's a step
towards considering

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.830
when it should be used,
when it should be promoted,

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.130
when it should be restricted.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.150
So legal institutions
and political actors

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.130
can promote forgiveness
by individuals,

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.130
but also promote it.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.260
But also discourage
it, I'm sorry.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.690
And law can itself
enact forgiveness

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:08.560
by foregoing consequences
for wrongdoing.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.080
Here are six examples.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.630
People who borrow too
much money to pay back

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.040
can informally seek forgiveness
from the creditor, the lender.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.210
Or they can file for bankruptcy.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:23.620
That's otherwise known
as a fresh start.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:27.790
It's much desired by people
in debt because of credit card

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.900
expenses.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.794
It's much desired by cities
and sovereign nations that

00:22:31.794 --> 00:22:32.710
are swamped with debt.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.170
And student loans come to mind.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.390
As I worked on this
subject last year

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.200
as the dean of a law school,
student loans came to mind.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.850
Right now, Puerto Rico is
very much in my thoughts.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.580
Puerto Rico does not
have the legal authority

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.600
to declare bankruptcy,
because it's not a state,

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.900
and it's not authorized
by the Congress to do so.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.070
That's one reason they are
in such terrible shape.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.440
And their struggle
to convince creditors

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.540
to restructure loan
payments and secure

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.780
extended time and actual
forgiveness, obviously

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.530
compounded by recent hurricanes
and a difficult economy,

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.810
currently $70 billion in debt.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.790
So can there be some
mechanisms beyond bankruptcy?

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:19.690
Second example.

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:23.770
Law can treat a doctor's
apology to a patient

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.340
as an admission of mistake,
exposing the doctor

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.290
to malpractice liability.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:32.540
Taking a different
tact, 36 states,

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.780
including Massachusetts,
have an apology law

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.080
which prohibits the
admission in trial

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.450
of expressions of
sympathy or apology

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.370
by a medical practitioner.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.740
Only lawyers would call
that an apology law,

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.030
but it's an apology law.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:52.490
It just exempts this language
from any subsequent trials.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.590
What the states adopting
this law want to do

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:56.840
is they want to remove
the disincentive

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.590
to have the normal human
interaction of an apology

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:05.990
and to encourage communication,
a release maybe of resentment,

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.370
grants of forgiveness maybe by
patients or a patient's family.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.830
This law, by the way,
is very much supported

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.080
by the medical profession,
because those states that

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.030
have it actually have a reduced
rate of malpractice cases.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.810
Third example.

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.810
Courts can require spouses
on the brink of a divorce

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:26.090
to try to mediate
their disputes.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.520
A good mediator will
call upon each spouse

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.310
to express their grievances and
desires of the other person.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.130
And even if they then
go on and divorce,

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.500
the spouses can become
more understanding,

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.360
more cooperative,
maybe even more

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.840
forgiving when they've tried to
see the world through the eyes

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.250
of the other person.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.610
I know a mediator who regularly
sets the very first session

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:50.600
with a divorcing couple at
a terrible, terrible time,

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.570
and then watches
with kind of a smile

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.115
as these fighting spouses
agree that the worst

00:24:56.115 --> 00:24:57.740
person in the world
is the mediator who

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.760
set this terrible time.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:01.660
A fourth example.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.160
Legal officials can ask a victim
of a physical assault whether

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.080
or not to prosecute.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.020
A victim who chooses
not to proceed strongly

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.780
affects whether or not the
law is going to forgive,

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.450
whether or not the law
is going to give up.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.420
Some states in the context
of domestic violence

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.580
have adopted what are called
no-drop rules, laws that

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:25.680
treat the assault as a
violation of public norms

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.980
and requiring the prosecutor
to go ahead, regardless

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.370
of what the victim thinks.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:33.759
You can probably imagine why.

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:34.550
Here's the problem.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.040
A victim can
decline to prosecute

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.240
not because of forgiveness,
but because of fear.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:47.120
And so these laws are efforts to
try to take the responsibility

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.220
out of the hands of the victim.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.620
And yet, the victim
can, of course,

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.530
come back into the process
at the sentencing time

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.140
to offer forgiveness
or its opposite.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.390
Fifth example, pardons.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.730
Executive power to
pardon an individual who

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.400
is charged with or
convicted of a crime

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.840
is a power that was
held by kings, still is,

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.894
and by government officials who
think of themselves that way.

00:26:12.894 --> 00:26:15.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:20.900
Judicial processes can also
operate in a kind of pardon.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.960
So you can move to have
a criminal record sealed

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.650
or to have it expunged so
that there's no record.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.550
No one can get it.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:31.370
That's a kind of pardon,
at least a limited pardon.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.910
And amnesties created
by statute or by treaty

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:39.410
can eliminate or reduce
the negative effects

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.860
of criminal charges or any
other kind of legal violation.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.840
Governments can also consider
barring consideration

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.030
of a conviction, a
criminal conviction,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:55.700
in other settings like
in an employment setting.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.730
Sixth example, I
mentioned amnesty.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.270
Amnesty, I think, it's
a whole other category.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:04.630
It can be used to bar
civil suits as well

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:06.130
as criminal suits.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:10.150
It can be used with
conditions on testimony

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:15.850
or after a civil war with rebels
surrendering their armaments

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.750
or providing reparations
or showing remorse.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:25.360
President Ronald Reagan in 1986
enacted an immigration law.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.450
It was dubbed Reagan's
amnesty, somewhat in the news

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.750
these days, permitting
about three million people

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.940
in the country who
were here unlawfully

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:35.110
to gain legal status.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.850
It was an amnesty.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.230
Amnesties can follow
armed conflicts

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.610
when nations may decide
not to have criminal trials

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:50.830
or to address violations
of human rights.

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.520
And part of the peace process
in Colombia right now,

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.730
human rights activists who've
been charged with rebellion

00:27:57.730 --> 00:28:00.670
have received amnesty,
permitting both freedom

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.370
and opportunity to
apply for employment

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.750
and go on with their lives.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.550
Similar proposal is pending
right now in Uganda,

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.980
and many people
see this as a way

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.740
to move on, to get
out of the mess,

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.220
while others criticize
amnesties because people

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:23.610
who may have committed
seriously violent crimes

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:25.980
go without legal consequences.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.900
And I just want to
underscore this.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.600
This is the heart
of forgiveness.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.400
It means letting go when
there's justification to punish.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.470
It's not forgiveness if
that quality is lacking.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.180
Novelist Doris
Lessing once said,

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.630
"If you understand something,
you don't forgive it.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:46.980
You are the thing itself.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.700
Forgiveness is for what
you don't understand."

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.500
In that context,
I think it's worth

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.680
having a little bit more
extended discussion of probably

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.840
the best example of
amnesty in recent memory,

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.390
and it's South Africa's Truth
and Reconciliation Commission.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.520
How many are familiar with that?

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.300
Most people are.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.140
Great.

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:13.630
So it's over 20 years ago on the
road to the peaceful transition

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:17.980
from apartheid to its
current democracy.

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:19.630
The Truth and
Reconciliation Commission

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.660
was adopted at the end of
the negotiation process

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.404
for the interim constitution.

00:29:26.404 --> 00:29:30.940
It was a word invented
by the negotiators.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.890
Instead of a prelude, it
was a postlude, or something

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:34.390
like that.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.170
A postamble.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:39.910
A postamble to the constitution,
that there will be a process.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.360
And then the legislature
enacted this process.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.190
Over three years
of its operation,

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:49.240
the TRC, as it's called, invited
victims to tell their stories,

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.870
and invited perpetrators to
apply individually for amnesty,

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.240
conditioned on showing
how their actions were

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.140
limited to and proportional
to political motivations.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.530
It granted ultimately
849 amnesties out

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:07.570
of 7,112 that were filed.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:09.340
And victims offered testimony.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.680
The designers hoped
that this process

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.950
would prevent cycles
of revenge and create

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.740
public acknowledgment
and a shared history.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.990
Its chair, Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, reflected on his work

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.380
and said, "Forgiveness
means abandoning your right

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.620
to pay back that
perpetrator in his own coin,

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.580
but it is a loss that
liberates the victim."

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.750
It has inspired a lot of
debate and discussion.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.300
As it proceeded, the political
cartoonist [? Zappo ?]

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.750
vividly demonstrated the
problem with the Truth

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.330
and Reconciliation
Commission by showing

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:49.320
Archbishop Tutu standing
in a cartoon on ground that

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.370
was labeled truth, and
then there's a chasm.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:55.350
On the other side
was reconciliation.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:59.610
Once you know the truth, it
may be even harder to forgive.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:03.180
And I think importantly, the
TRC was criticized by people

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.460
on all sides of the conflict.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:10.860
Studies show ambivalence,
disappointment, mixed reviews.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.390
And one study indicates that
very few people individually

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.350
forgave.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.900
Only seven people in
the study of about 500

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.970
said that they forgave.

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:23.280
And yet even with its
flaws, it provided

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.870
a kind of ritual, a marker,
a way, perhaps, to move on.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:30.840
I think we won't
know how actually

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.240
to evaluate the TRC
until we know more

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.570
about South Africa's future.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.960
It has, in the meantime,
inspired efforts

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.860
all over the world.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.260
There are over 40 Truth and
Reconciliation Commissions

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.630
in other countries
following conflict.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:48.550
And it's also inspired a field.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.980
Academic studies have exploded.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:53.590
I've asked myself,
why such emulation?

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.310
And I can't separate it out
from the leadership offered

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.330
by Archbishop Tutu and Nelson
Mandela, inspiring narratives

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.430
and images to communities
thirsty for hope,

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:08.080
particularly following violence.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.070
It offers a kind of third way,
I think, between no response

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.540
to atrocities and
costly or controversial

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.805
criminal prosecutions,
on the other hand.

00:32:18.805 --> 00:32:21.460
In the United States,
truth commissions

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.060
have occurred in
Mississippi following

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.880
racially motivated crimes in
Greensboro, North Carolina,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.600
following the murder of
anti-KKK, Ku Klux Klan

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.620
organizers.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:34.690
And in Maine,
investigating the abuse

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.360
of Native American children
by child welfare agencies.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.730
I have questions.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.640
I have questions about
truth commissions.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.470
I have questions
about forgiveness.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.700
Consider the woman whose husband
was imprisoned and tortured

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.190
during the apartheid era
in South Africa and said

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:59.390
to the TRC, and I quote her,
"A commission or a government

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.310
cannot forgive.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.540
Perhaps only I could do it,
but I am not ready to forgive."

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.360
When a government
says, we forgive

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.470
on behalf of the people, who
is the government to do that?

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.750
The government doesn't
have actually the authority

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.310
to forgive.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.720
So what the government can do
is the government can forego

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.130
punishment, but that's
not actually forgiving

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.440
in the interpersonal way.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.500
I asked the commissioners
of the South Africa Truth

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.150
and Reconciliation
Commission, as they

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:37.120
were holding their hearings,
about why didn't they

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.760
make the amnesties
conditional on apology?

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.550
It's like the question that
came up in our discussion.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.980
And they gave me an answer
that has haunted me ever since.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:50.380
They said, they decided not
to make amnesty conditional

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.360
on the offer of apology
because they said,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:57.080
then we could never know
if any apology is genuine.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.210
I thought that was
really insightful.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:02.720
And that's a window onto the
difficulties of using law

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.860
in this area, because there are
consequences and there's power.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.880
And therefore, if you're
trying to actually nurture

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.679
human communications,
you distort it.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.429
And yet, and yet, one of the
staff members of the Truth

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.310
and Reconciliation Commission
brought together informally

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:27.110
the mothers of young men who
are known as the Guguletu 7 who

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:31.730
were killed by the secret
police when a government

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:35.360
informant said, these
are revolutionaries.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.130
They're going to
do something bad.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:41.000
The informant came to the
TRC and applied for amnesty,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.929
and the mothers were separately
giving their own testimony

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.080
as victims.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:50.210
And the psychologist,
Pumla Gobodo-Madikezela,

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.356
brought them all
together, and just

00:34:52.356 --> 00:34:53.480
thought they ought to meet.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.250
The informant, a South African.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.139
The mothers, black
South Africans.

00:34:57.139 --> 00:35:00.680
And it happens to be captured
in a film, a documentary film,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.100
which I highly recommend called
Long Night's Journey Into Day.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:06.170
The mothers begin
the conversation

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:12.840
by yelling at this informant and
saying, how could you do this?

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.130
How could you turn
in your brothers?

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.670
How could you take away
our sons, our children?

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.980
They chastise him,
and he hangs his head.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.360
He apologizes.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.300
And then one by one, each
of the mothers forgives him.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.786
It's hard to understand.

00:35:33.786 --> 00:35:35.220
It's an informal setting.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.070
It's not compelled by the law,
not formally organized by law.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.020
It's moving.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.360
I think it would be very
troubling if it were compelled.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.290
And here's a troubling fact.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:47.760
30% of the participants in
the Truth and Reconciliation

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.150
Commission reported feeling
pressure to forgive.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.070
If you're in the presence
of Archbishop Tutu,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.290
you might feel
pressure to forgive.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.920
I think many of us
remember in 2015

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.800
in this country, an
extraordinary, memorable public

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.800
demonstration or forgiveness
as some of the family

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.400
members of the nine people
killed at the Mother Emanuel

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.460
AME Church in Charleston,
South Carolina

00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.900
offered forgiveness to
the shooter, Dylann Roof.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.410
Anybody remember this?

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:24.190
Other family members
expressed condemnation.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.640
One said she hoped that
he would go to hell.

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:35.640
Roof has remained unrepentant
about firing 77 shots.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.070
Came back to mind with
the terrible events

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.660
of this past weekend.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.150
He said at his bond
hearing that he

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.940
intended to start a race war.

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.330
Some members of the
families of victims

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.760
described how they were
working on forgiving him.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.730
And others said that
they forgave him,

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:57.630
but that did not mean he
should avoid punishment.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.430
The daughter of
murdered Ethel Lance

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.360
said, "I will never
talk to her again.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.700
I will never hold her again.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.400
You hurt me.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.370
You hurt a lot of people.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:09.830
But God forgives you,
and I forgive you."

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.370
It's a mystery.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.120
It reflects a kind of
disciplined religious practice.

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.000
Another surviving
relative explained,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.570
we have no room for hating,
so we have to forgive.

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.800
Now some people watching
this have now said,

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.880
this is how white people set the
terms for acceptable grieving

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.350
by blacks.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:37.150
This is a longtime
structure that

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:41.230
deflects anger that's justified
and treats systemic violations

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.150
as if they're occasional.

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:46.510
Philosopher Myisha
Cherry criticizes calls

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:50.830
by journalists, particularly
upon black victims

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:53.740
of white violence
or state violence,

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.270
to forgive because
the requests are

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.220
disrespectful of the victims.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.180
They normalize oppression.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.600
They underscore
racialized roles.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.790
She says, are white victims
ever asked to forgive this way?

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:10.670
Others warn that there's a
gender dimension of forgiveness

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:14.030
that raises cautions about
using law to encourage it

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.220
or to induce it.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:20.270
Studies suggest that women
are better at forgiving.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.100
Why is that exactly?

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.830
Is it that women
have had to forgive?

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.840
Studies of history
and literary analyses

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.870
of supplication and apology.

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:33.380
Western culture often connects
women with forgiveness,

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:37.220
and expectations that women
will perform emotional labor

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:41.150
in society grants
authority to men often

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.310
in ways that contribute
to pressures on women

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.770
to forgive and to
ask for forgiveness.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:50.270
And in this light, using law
to promote forgiveness risks

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:54.020
reinforcing already
existing hierarchies--

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.770
race, gender,
differential power--

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:02.150
in ways that put unfair
pressure on people's emotions.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.230
And on the other hand--

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.270
I'm running out of
hands-- on the other hand,

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:08.660
some people, due to their
religious tradition,

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.450
their personal beliefs,
view forgiveness

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:13.220
as a worthy aspiration.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:17.780
And by forgiving, they
express their own faith.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.070
So I'm running out of hands.

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:24.800
I do think it can be emotionally
draining not to forgive,

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.370
and I do think it's a mistake
to imagine that law has

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.710
no impact on people's
emotions, even

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:33.620
with no forgiveness
as part of it.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.660
Law can push people
towards adversariness.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:41.620
So it seems to me
not wrong to ask,

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:45.370
can law make space for
forgiveness, but how to do that

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.420
without putting pressure?

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.760
That seems a real challenge.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.260
But I'd separate that out.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.350
One question, therefore,
is when should law

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.470
make space for
individuals to engage

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.360
in apology and forgiveness?

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.060
From the question
when law itself

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.670
should forego the consequences
of wrongful action.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.987
And I do think on that one, we
should be pushing much more.

00:40:10.987 --> 00:40:12.820
We're living, at least
in the United States,

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.060
in a period of the
most incarceration

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.470
in the history of the planet.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:21.700
There has never been a society
with as many people criminally

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.017
convicted and incarcerated.

00:40:24.017 --> 00:40:26.350
I think forgiveness would be
a good thing for the system

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.750
to inject, and I'd say
the same thing about debt.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.990
The amount of
debt, and I'm going

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.450
to talk about both
of those things.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:38.950
I think that we can make some
progress on the big question

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.690
that I have, which
is, does it undermine

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:44.590
respect for the rule of law
to have more forgiveness

00:40:44.590 --> 00:40:48.340
by having less
adherence to the rules

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.410
as they're written
down by talking

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:51.640
about concrete examples?

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.510
And my two are child soldiers
with some general thoughts

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.940
then about juveniles
and criminal law,

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.150
and then debt with
sovereign debt and consumer

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.260
debt as the examples.

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.630
And I'll be relatively
brief about both,

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.380
because I really hope we can
have time to talk together.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.155
So child soldiers.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.350
International criminal law has
made a big advance recently.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.980
First time in human
history, there

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:25.440
is a crime recognized of
turning a child into a soldier.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.470
This was actually the subject
of the very first case

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.690
before the International
Criminal Court.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:33.870
And Thomas Lubanga, the
warlord in the Congo,

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:35.790
was convicted of this crime.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:39.060
First time ever recognized.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.780
Interesting.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.470
Convicted for 14 years.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:45.580
Compare that with criminal
sentences in the United States.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:48.520
How, though, should the
children themselves be treated?

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:51.310
When children are
abducted or coerced

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:53.440
or enticed into assuming
the role of a soldier,

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.800
they're victimized by adults
who take away their childhood

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.510
and make them instruments of
law, [INAUDIBLE],, and violence.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:04.240
But some join without
being abducted or coerced,

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.420
and some are drawn by the
ideology or the opportunities

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.410
for action, responsibility, the
thrill of committing violence,

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.880
the cause.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:19.250
Some who join under coercion
later engage in terrible acts.

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.040
They kill people,
they rape people.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:27.230
Some stay for decades,
well past their childhood.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.720
Should their exercise
of any degree of choice

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.190
make them culpable, or
should they be forgiven?

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:38.560
International law has created
a problem for us in this area.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.320
Every country in the world
except the United States

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.560
has signed the Convention
on the Rights of the Child.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.270
Every country except
the United States.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:48.460
I mean, every country
but the United States

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:51.730
says that anyone
under the age of 16

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.970
should not be tried
for any war crime

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.260
or crime against humanity.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:05.150
So an adult can be charged with
turning a child into a soldier.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:09.200
A child under the age
of 15 cannot be tried.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:13.280
But 15 and 16-year-olds,
17-year-olds, they

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:15.500
are not liable anywhere.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.400
And here's a problem.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.540
In many societies,
they're adults.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.260
And there's a problem
about reintegration

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:28.790
often when they return home,
and what should happen?

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:32.150
So legal theorists
would say, forgiveness

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:35.960
is not even the right concept
if we're talking about minors.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.180
They're presumed to
lack the intention,

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.070
the knowledge,
the control that's

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.050
necessary for criminal
responsibility.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.750
And certainly, this
makes sense if you're

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.490
talking about a three-year-old.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:51.204
But anybody here ever
talked to a 15-year-old?

00:43:51.204 --> 00:43:53.620
They have some capacities that
make them a little bit more

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.920
like adults than the
three-year-old. .

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.220
One adolescent soldier
explained to a researcher

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.660
that he planned to return
to Liberia so he could claim

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.380
the benefits available to
demobilize child soldiers

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.870
and then return to the fighting.

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.240
Some children in armed
conflicts demonstrate

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.400
choice in their involvement.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.980
And some find ways to
actually escape and come

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:19.520
back and escape and come back.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.090
It's a complicated story.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:29.000
And I have wondered whether we
do a service to these 15, 16,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.050
17-year-olds by saying,
you are innocent,

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.070
and no one's going
to ever talk to you

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.040
about what happened here.

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.860
We'll give you job training.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.780
Researchers who
work in this field

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.850
have informed me
more that I have

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:44.470
that for many of
the child soldiers,

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.470
the real challenge
is self-forgiveness.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.050
And Emmanuel Jal, who's a
former child soldier who's

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.020
become a very successful
musician and rapper,

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.150
has said this himself
in his lyrics.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:56.380
He says, "I'm in another war.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.100
This time, it's my
soul I'm fighting for."

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.150
And so I'm wondering if it's
possible to imagine developing

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.250
something like a
Truth Commission

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.080
where people who've
been child soldiers

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.080
have an opportunity
to tell their story

00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:13.210
and not be punished.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:17.320
But yes, explore the
ways in which they

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.840
had some responsibility or not.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.140
And nations and the
international community

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.720
could create a public
process for people

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.830
who participated in armed
conflicts before they were 18.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.650
And maybe in doing
so, the young people

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.194
can not only help themselves,
but help their societies.

00:45:37.194 --> 00:45:39.110
As I've thought about
this, I've thought, boy.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:41.526
This would be a good thing for
our juvenile justice system

00:45:41.526 --> 00:45:44.400
to explore.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.000
Our juvenile justice system
started in 1899 with the idea

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.880
that young people shouldn't
be treated the same as adults.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.040
There should be a
more forgiving place.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.620
Over time, it has
become, if anything,

00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:00.480
more onerous than the criminal
justice system for adults.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.090
And indeed, across
the country during the

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:05.510
get tough on crime
period from the '80s on,

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:09.870
there is now automatic transfer
of juveniles to adult court.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.480
Juveniles are regularly
put in adult prisons.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.800
It is a pretty
disturbing situation

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:18.415
for those who end up there.

00:46:18.415 --> 00:46:22.800
It is a likelihood
they will never, never

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:27.630
return to a path of success.

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.030
So many communities
are exploring

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.430
what's called restorative
justice, the development

00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:37.590
of opportunities for the
victims and perpetrators

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:41.640
to talk together, for wrongdoers
to provide services, repair,

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.840
repaint houses,
engage in restitution.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:50.490
Hate crime examples where
individuals are actually

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:53.070
invited to come and
speak in schools.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.010
And there might well be
opportunities for something

00:46:56.010 --> 00:46:59.880
like a Truth Commission also
to give these young people

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.040
a chance to explain,
what was going

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.500
on in their community that
made this conduct seem

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.000
like the right thing to do?

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:08.992
Just a thought.

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.840
I do think, of course,
once you go down this road,

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:18.920
you start thinking,
what about adult?

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.810
Why have this cutoff
for people under 18?

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.690
I think that's not a bad thought
to be having and exploring.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:29.780
So my second example,
forgiving debt.

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:33.380
The concept of debt infuses
Western and Christian morality,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.980
and it's not by accident that
we use the word forgiveness

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.510
in The Lord's Prayer and in
bankruptcy, restructuring debt.

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:43.550
And like spiritual
forgiveness, bankruptcy

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.160
represents the chance
to start fresh.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.340
In 1789, before becoming
the third president

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.050
of the new nation,
Thomas Jefferson

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:54.290
argued to his friend
James Madison for relief

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.700
of each generation's debt.

00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.300
Maybe because Thomas Jefferson
was in debt over and over

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.040
again, he really thought about
this a lot, and he worried.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.130
Because he was Thomas
Jefferson, he developed it

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.710
into a political theory.

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:10.070
And he worried that one
generation should not

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:13.940
burden the next with its debts.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:17.690
And well aware of the debts
incurred by the colonies

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:21.590
en route to becoming a nation,
he argued that with respect

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:23.480
to future debts,
would it not be wise

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:24.986
and just for the
nation to declare

00:48:24.986 --> 00:48:26.360
in the Constitution
there forming

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:30.110
that neither the legislature nor
the nation itself can validly

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:33.650
contract more debt than they
can pay within their own age

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:36.050
or within 34 years?

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.270
His friend James
Madison said, you

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:41.660
have got to be out of your mind.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:46.000
This would jeopardize
law, private property.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.560
We can't do this.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.184
And despite that
argument, the Constitution

00:48:50.184 --> 00:48:51.100
of the United States--

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.120
read it some time--

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:58.450
actually guarantees that there
will be a right of bankruptcy.

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.760
And in the business
world, this has

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.630
been perhaps one of the keys
to the story of innovation

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.540
in the United States,
because declaring bankruptcy

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.090
is often viewed as a
cost of doing business,

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.910
and there's not much
shame involved in it.

00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:14.760
Individuals another story.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.710
The individual still
undergoes shame

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.720
and personal difficulties,
and some of that

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.830
has to do with the loss.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.380
Some of it has to
do with society.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.280
Big Apple Circus.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.660
Anybody see the news today?

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.790
It's back a year after
declaring bankruptcy.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:32.500
It can be a lifeline for
businesses and families,

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.380
even though it can be difficult.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.970
And cities.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:38.590
Detroit, Michigan.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.630
Jefferson County, Alaska.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.190
San Bernardino, California.

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.390
Stockton, California.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:46.600
Each have declared
bankruptcy, and each is doing

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.520
much, much better financially.

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.090
But some debts lie
outside of bankruptcy.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:57.860
In the United States currently,
student loans cannot be

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.910
discharged in bankruptcy except
in the instance of death.

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:03.151
Isn't that generous?

00:50:03.151 --> 00:50:03.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:06.870
So think about this.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:09.030
In the United States,
for-profit companies

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:13.260
that create student loans
to target for-profit schools

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.800
can declare bankruptcy.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.330
But the students cannot
declare bankruptcy.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.730
Sovereign nations are another
group that cannot declare

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:26.710
bankruptcy, and their debts
can be forgiven by creditor

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:30.610
nations, private lenders, but
it is very difficult to organize

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:31.420
that.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.850
And only severe
crises that threaten

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:37.990
to spill over into the region
pushed the European finance

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:40.600
ministers to help
Greece reduce its debt

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.510
and extend its
schedule of payments.

00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:45.640
And while defaulting
on debt can seriously

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.160
damage a nation's credit
ratings and its access

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:51.540
to capital, larger financial
trends and improved

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:55.780
domestic governance, pragmatic
attitudes about the future

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:59.770
mean that Argentina
of all countries,

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.340
which has been one of
the most indebted nations

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:08.230
in the last 200 years,
just successfully floated

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.520
a 100-year bond.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.750
Had no trouble selling it.

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:13.660
So it is possible to
have a fresh start,

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.370
even after something
very difficult.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:22.200
I'm really interested in
how the Pope and Bono have

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.150
made this a cause.

00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:26.760
They are using the biblical
notion of jubilee year

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:30.120
to clear a state of
all of its debts,

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.600
and advocating for
the forgiveness

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.810
of the debt of the
world's poorest countries.

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:40.560
And they've made some progress
on a multilateral debt relief

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.730
initiative.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:44.250
Philanthropic efforts
in the United States

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:48.090
have taken a page from the
practices of commercial debt

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.230
companies.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:51.270
You know, the
secondary debt market,

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:54.960
they buy debt for pennies
on the dollar, right?

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.810
That's what the companies do,
and then they go after people

00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.920
and they garnish their
wages, and so forth.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.380
So philanthropies now are
buying consumer debt and student

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:08.160
debt and medical debt
and forgiving it.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:11.490
I think that's a
pretty good charity.

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:14.820
One group started during
Occupy Wall Street

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:16.860
calling itself Rolling Jubilee.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:20.220
It raised $700,000
for four years,

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:23.245
and it used it to
buy $30 million

00:52:23.245 --> 00:52:28.030
of debt, which it forgave.

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:30.970
I think that the government
could promote that.

00:52:30.970 --> 00:52:33.850
The government could create
tax incentives for people

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.470
to do that.

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:39.225
There could be other ways to
make this kind of forgiveness

00:52:39.225 --> 00:52:40.600
more available,
and that would be

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.340
true for municipal debt,
consumer debt, and so forth.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.160
So I'm going to close.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.920
I want to say that implicit
in my discussion there

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:51.370
is another question, which is
some wrongs are unforgivable.

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:52.290
What are those wrongs?

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.740
Philosopher Hannah Arendt
claimed that we cannot forgive

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:04.660
absolute evils that are too
large and too radical punish.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.680
Others say that's exactly
when you need to forgive.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:13.140
I find it a really hard
question, as Judy said.

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.690
This is a kind of sequel
to a book I wrote before.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:18.120
And people have
asked, ever since I

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.970
wrote a book called Between
Vengeance and Forgiveness,

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:22.130
well, why not forgiveness?

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:24.540
So that's what I'm
struggling with.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:30.720
I do think that a focus
on forgiveness in the law

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.940
will help us expose
the imbalance

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.090
of the current practices.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:36.810
So for example, we have a
doctrine called harmless error

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.340
in criminal law.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.730
Guess who gets to claim it?

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:42.840
The government.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.140
Criminal defendants never
get to claim harmless error.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.930
Or another imbalance,
during the subprime crisis,

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.920
banks were allowed
forgiveness for not

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.350
being able to have
their paperwork,

00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:58.740
but the consumer
was not allowed.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.830
I think a focus on forgiveness
could be very helpful,

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.710
and it might actually help
us specify the circumstances

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:10.500
under when it should be
promoted, when it should not.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.350
A group of social scientists
asked Latin Americans

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:15.270
and Western Europeans
about forgiveness,

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:18.750
and found that a majority
of people in both regions

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:22.650
favor forgiveness, even
without a change of heart

00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:24.990
or an apology, anything on
the part of the violator.

00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.420
But interestingly,
those in Latin America

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.970
were more likely than
those in Western Europe

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:32.790
to accept as the
forgiver someone

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.730
other than the offended person.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:38.490
So this issue I said before,
that the government cannot

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.160
forgive, that may be
culturally specific too,

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.470
and worth thinking about.

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:47.190
I think we have to guard against
turning to forgiveness solely

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:51.720
when more robust justice
is not available.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.840
And we should be careful
not to use the law

00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:00.360
to distort private emotions
or to undermine the commitment

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.870
to treat similar cases alike.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:07.380
And yet, I think we should
consider how and when law

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:12.100
can usefully make space for
forgiveness or forgive itself.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.650
I've been thinking
about Mr. Repouille.

00:55:14.650 --> 00:55:17.740
I think he deserved
consequences for his actions.

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.610
But how striking it was
that the jury and the judge,

00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:24.970
all the judges thought
some forgiveness was due.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.590
There's a man named Paul Boese.

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:29.110
I don't know who he
is or was, but he

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:32.320
loved to craft sayings
that would be quoted.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.820
He wrote before Twitter,
but he would have loved it.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:38.390
And now he'd have
double the letter space.

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.610
Here's one of his quotations.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.401
I like it so much I'm
going to end with it.

00:55:41.401 --> 00:55:44.140
He said, "Forgiveness
does not change the past,

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.320
but it does enlarge the future."

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.530
Ultimately, forgiveness points
towards the future, not just

00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:53.710
the past, and I think it
offers an important dimension

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.620
for designers and
agents of the law.

00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.120
Thanks.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.745
