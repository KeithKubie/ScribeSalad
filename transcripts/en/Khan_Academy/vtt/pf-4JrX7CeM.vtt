00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:02.244
- [Instructor] In the last
video, we began discussing

00:00:02.244 --> 00:00:04.926
some of the similarities and differences

00:00:04.926 --> 00:00:09.072
between the English colonists
who landed at New England

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.570
versus those who landed in Virginia.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.324
Thanks to different reasons
for migrating to the New World

00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.886
and a much colder, rockier environment,

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:22.632
New England society was based
around mostly small farming

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:25.592
and led by the Puritan church.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:29.675
Another consequence of
the unique environment

00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:32.330
and society of New England was that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.350
it was unusually democratic for that era.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.980
Now, when the pilgrims first
came over on the Mayflower,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.469
they agreed in what was
called the Mayflower Compact

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.353
to kind of work together

00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:48.302
and hold each other in mutual esteem.

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:51.025
And some people say that
this is one of the first

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:55.897
founding documents showing
democracy in the New World.

00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:58.517
New Englanders, like Virginians,

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:01.459
were very far from the mother country

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:03.936
and they had to fend for themselves.

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:06.216
So, English colonists learned

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:09.271
to make decisions by themselves,

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:13.257
'cause asking for help
from across the ocean

00:01:13.257 --> 00:01:16.715
wasn't very easy and
took a really long time.

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:19.609
So, because England was so far away

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.184
and really not paying much attention

00:01:22.184 --> 00:01:24.294
to the American colonies at all,

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:27.006
there was a tradition of self-government

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.006
among English colonists.

00:01:30.352 --> 00:01:33.835
But what was different about
democracy in New England

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:35.816
than democracy in Virginia

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:39.820
was that most people in New
England were middle class.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.195
They were small farmers.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:46.690
Most people were about
the same social station

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.920
and that meant that they were used

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.042
to having about the same
amount of political power.

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:56.773
So, in New England, most
towns had town meetings

00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:59.067
where the men of the town would gather

00:01:59.067 --> 00:02:01.133
to solve local problems.

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:04.907
Now, this was, of course,
a very limited democracy

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:07.898
where only white men have a say,

00:02:07.898 --> 00:02:10.315
but for the era of the 1600s,

00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:14.114
it was very democratic indeed.

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:16.183
For all the ways that New England

00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:18.064
and Virginia were very different,

00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:20.953
there was one way in which
they were virtually identical

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.642
and that was their treatment
of Native Americans.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.918
Just as early compromise and cooperation

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:30.398
with the Powhatan tribe
turned into the English

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:33.322
attempting to eradicate Native Americans

00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:34.778
from the eastern seaboard,

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:38.283
New Englanders originally cooperated

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:42.283
with local Algonquian
tribes like the Wampanoags

00:02:44.176 --> 00:02:46.176
or Narragansett Indians.

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:52.183
But as English demands for
more land and more food

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:56.350
began to disrupt Native ways
of life, relationships soured

00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:00.904
and cultural misunderstandings
between the two groups

00:03:00.904 --> 00:03:02.732
soon led to outright war.

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:06.758
When English settlers made
treaties with Native Americans

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:09.827
asking for land, Native
Americans thought that they

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:13.592
were asking for the rights
to hunt on that land,

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.766
not the rights to fence in that land

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.763
and not allow Native Americans on it.

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:23.930
So, because English ideas
of property did not align

00:03:25.247 --> 00:03:27.786
with Native ideas of property,

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:30.781
soon, when Native Americans went to hunt

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:32.585
on their traditional lands,

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:36.449
they found the English
prosecuting them as intruders.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.731
And because Algonquians
practiced Three Sisters farming

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:44.820
where corn, beans, and
squash were grown together,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.675
English people, who
separated all their crops,

00:03:47.675 --> 00:03:50.429
didn't recognize that those fields

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.575
were actually Native agriculture

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:56.490
and allowed their cattle and
pigs to roam through them,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.406
destroying Native crops.

00:03:58.406 --> 00:04:01.782
With so much pressure
on their source of food,

00:04:01.782 --> 00:04:05.136
Native people began to
lash out at English people

00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:07.493
who thought of themselves as the victims

00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:10.232
of senseless Indian attacks.

00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:12.899
By 1675, many tribes in the area

00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.132
decided to work together
to oust the English

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.531
led by a man named Metacom.

00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:22.796
In fact, I think Metacom
was only one of the leaders,

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:25.437
but the English called him King Phillip

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:28.504
and believed that he was
the instigator of this war.

00:04:28.504 --> 00:04:32.348
So, in 1675, Metacom and other groups

00:04:32.348 --> 00:04:34.617
began to attack English villages.

00:04:34.617 --> 00:04:38.029
But in 1676, the English recruited

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.500
Indian allies of their
own and turned the tide,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.750
so that by the end of 1676,

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:48.260
about 3,000 Native Americans had died

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.177
to about 1,000 English.

00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:53.911
And those that were remaining,

00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:57.994
the English either executed
or sold into slavery.

00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:02.278
So, in this way, they
were not very different

00:05:02.278 --> 00:05:05.861
from the English people
of Virginia at all.

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.723
Metacom's war, like the
Anglo-Powhatan Wars in Virginia,

00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:15.454
really marked the end of
Native American resistance

00:05:15.454 --> 00:05:18.705
to English colonization on the east coast.

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.205
Survivors fled further inland or north

00:05:21.205 --> 00:05:23.545
and joined other tribes that continued

00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:28.241
to resist the English
for many decades to come.

00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:30.866
I wanna finish by just briefly summarizing

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:33.656
some of the similarities and differences

00:05:33.656 --> 00:05:35.942
between English settlement in New England

00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:38.567
and English settlement
in the Chesapeake Bay

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:41.398
that we've been talking about
throughout these videos.

00:05:41.398 --> 00:05:44.139
Here, I've just made a quick chart

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.395
comparing some of the aspects
that we've talked about,

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:52.039
and, as I see it, there
are three real differences

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.237
between New England and the Chesapeake,

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:56.955
and two real similarities.

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:59.806
Now, one thing that was
really different between them

00:05:59.806 --> 00:06:01.887
was just their environment.

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:04.728
New England was far
north of the Chesapeake,

00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:07.285
so it was much colder and rockier,

00:06:07.285 --> 00:06:10.683
which didn't permit the
settlers of New England

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:14.486
to conduct plantation
agriculture at a large scale

00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:16.163
like we did in the Chesapeake.

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:20.023
So, instead, they had small
family farms, they fished.

00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:21.956
Compared to the Chesapeake Bay

00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:25.425
where although it was very hot and marshy,

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:28.067
not a healthy environment at all,

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:31.117
it was, with its very
long growing seasons,

00:06:31.117 --> 00:06:34.303
a great place for plantation agriculture,

00:06:34.303 --> 00:06:36.483
particularly growing tobacco.

00:06:36.483 --> 00:06:39.226
Another major difference
between the two regions

00:06:39.226 --> 00:06:43.270
was who came to each of
these places and why.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.319
In New England, settlers
came for religious freedom

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.512
for the most part.

00:06:48.512 --> 00:06:52.051
Puritans attempting to
escape persecution in England

00:06:52.051 --> 00:06:55.663
hoped that they could set up
their Puritan city on a hill

00:06:55.663 --> 00:06:57.064
in Massachusetts Bay.

00:06:57.064 --> 00:07:00.002
So, consequently, they
were middle class families

00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:02.228
who came as a family unit.

00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:05.299
They had a lot more women in New England

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.831
than they did in the Chesapeake,

00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.398
which meant that their
natural rate of growth

00:07:09.398 --> 00:07:11.233
was going to be higher,

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:13.369
because they could have more families

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:15.517
and more families could
have more children.

00:07:15.517 --> 00:07:17.595
In the Chesapeake, by contrast,

00:07:17.595 --> 00:07:20.339
most settlers were single men

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.797
who were coming to seek their fortune,

00:07:22.797 --> 00:07:26.239
either white men, often
as indentured servants,

00:07:26.239 --> 00:07:29.183
or enslaved Africans who were forced

00:07:29.183 --> 00:07:31.431
to migrate to the Chesapeake Bay

00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.184
to labor in tobacco plantations.

00:07:34.184 --> 00:07:36.073
So, there were fewer women

00:07:36.073 --> 00:07:38.583
and the kind of rate of population growth

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:42.499
really only depended on more
and more people immigrating

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:46.363
as the unhealthy environment
led to quite a bit of death

00:07:46.363 --> 00:07:48.093
from tropical disease.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:49.877
The last major difference I see

00:07:49.877 --> 00:07:53.579
is in the labor systems
of each of these regions

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:56.868
and the kinds of class
systems that they generated.

00:07:56.868 --> 00:08:01.663
In the Chesapeake Bay, as
a group of early planters

00:08:01.663 --> 00:08:04.765
became more and more prosperous

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:08.394
and brought in more and
more enslaved laborers,

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:11.543
there was a great disparity of wealth,

00:08:11.543 --> 00:08:15.710
as the poorest were at the
bottom of the social hierarchy,

00:08:17.617 --> 00:08:21.534
including enslaved people,
indentured servants,

00:08:24.848 --> 00:08:29.015
a few small farmers who were
independent and had made it,

00:08:30.062 --> 00:08:33.979
and then, at the very
top, the tobacco planters

00:08:35.344 --> 00:08:38.537
who held most of the
wealth, but made up, really,

00:08:38.537 --> 00:08:41.829
quite a small percentage
of the population.

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:43.820
In comparison, people in New England

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.570
had a general equality of wealth,

00:08:47.532 --> 00:08:51.180
meaning that most people
were small farmers

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.800
getting by comfortably.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.503
There weren't many people who were

00:08:55.503 --> 00:08:58.806
at a distant top of the social hierarchy

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:02.342
and not that many people who
were stuck at the very bottom.

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:05.568
Most people in New
England were middle class,

00:09:05.568 --> 00:09:07.837
but there were some similarities

00:09:07.837 --> 00:09:10.026
between New England and the Chesapeake.

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:12.238
In both of these regions,

00:09:12.238 --> 00:09:16.754
local government was unusually
democratic for the era.

00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:20.185
In New England, the citizens of a town

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:25.007
would meet in town meetings
to discuss local issues

00:09:25.007 --> 00:09:29.445
and pretty much all white men
had a say in those meetings.

00:09:29.445 --> 00:09:31.971
In the Chesapeake, there
were also local assemblies

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.737
like the House of Burgesses in Virginia.

00:09:34.737 --> 00:09:38.368
And although most of these
democratic institutions

00:09:38.368 --> 00:09:40.690
were dominated by elites,

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.485
these elected assemblies
were still considerably

00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:46.238
more democratic than
the monarchy of England.

00:09:46.238 --> 00:09:48.702
And the last way that New
England and the Chesapeake

00:09:48.702 --> 00:09:50.376
were quite similar to each other

00:09:50.376 --> 00:09:54.221
were in their attitudes
toward Native Americans.

00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.594
In both New England and the Chesapeake,

00:09:56.594 --> 00:09:59.625
the English carried on wars of extinction

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.108
against local Native American tribes,

00:10:02.108 --> 00:10:05.944
whether it was the
Wampanoags in Metacom's war,

00:10:05.944 --> 00:10:09.947
or the Powhatans in the
Anglo-Powhatan Wars.

00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:13.303
English colonists simply
could not imagine a world

00:10:13.303 --> 00:10:16.931
in which they coexisted
peacefully with Native Americans

00:10:16.931 --> 00:10:21.151
or in any way incorporated
them into their societies.

00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:24.677
Now, I started this video
series with a question

00:10:24.677 --> 00:10:26.861
about who was the real

00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:29.803
spiritual ancestor of the United States.

00:10:29.803 --> 00:10:33.680
Was it the New England
colonies with their pilgrims

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.732
and search for religious freedom,

00:10:35.732 --> 00:10:38.367
or was it the Chesapeake colonies

00:10:38.367 --> 00:10:41.653
with their search to find fortune?

00:10:41.653 --> 00:10:44.986
Well, perhaps the evidence
that we've taken a look at here

00:10:44.986 --> 00:10:47.303
has persuaded you one way or another,

00:10:47.303 --> 00:10:51.389
but myself, I think, that
comparing the two of them,

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:53.772
we can see that, in many ways,

00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:57.231
English colonization was directly impacted

00:10:57.231 --> 00:11:00.726
by the environment and by the individuals

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:03.227
who came to each of these settlements.

00:11:03.227 --> 00:11:08.061
But there are some larger
trends about English settlement.

00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:10.269
In both the cases of
the New England colonies

00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:12.089
and the Chesapeake colonies,

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:14.487
English people who came to the New World

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:17.795
had unusually democratic
forms of government.

00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:21.405
They were independent, used
to taking care of themselves,

00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:25.012
but they were also united
with their approach

00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:26.697
to Native Americans.

00:11:26.697 --> 00:11:29.661
Unlike the Spanish, who incorporated

00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:33.302
Native Americans into society,
even if at the lowest rungs,

00:11:33.302 --> 00:11:34.922
and the French or the Dutch,

00:11:34.922 --> 00:11:38.680
who cooperated very much
with Native Americans,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.602
English people saw Native
Americans as an obstacle

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:44.907
and one that needed to be removed.
