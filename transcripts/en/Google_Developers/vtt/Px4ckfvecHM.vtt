[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.190
TODD KERPELMAN: Hey
there, I/O Live.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.280
I am Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.710
And I am here inside the very
crowded and popular Flutter

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.960
Firebase Dome talking
to Michael Thomsen,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.940
Product Manager of Flutter.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.630
Hi, Michael.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.560
MICHAEL THOMSEN:
Hi, how are you?

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.100
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm doing well.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.730
Thanks.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.430
So there's a lot going
on here inside the dome

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.210
as well as some stuff
going on outside.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.479
Tell me, what are
we looking at here?

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.616
What's going on behind us?

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.490
MICHAEL THOMSEN: So this
is our showcase wall

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.490
that illustrates
the wide selection

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.340
of different types of apps
you can build with Flutter.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
So Flutter, of course, is
Google's multi-platform SDK

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.920
for building mobile apps
for both iOS and Android.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.810
So what we're seeing
here are some apps

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.440
that look very traditional
iOS look and feel.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.570
We're seeing an app
from Google, over here,

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.050
from our Atlas team, that has a
much more traditional material

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.160
look and feel.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.810
And we're seeing
a number of apps

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.315
that have a much more
custom look and feel,

00:01:06.315 --> 00:01:07.940
where they've tried
to create this more

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.640
brand-specific extension and
where the layout of the app

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.890
really is an extension
of that brand.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.890
TODD KERPELMAN: And so
what else can an attendee

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.880
find if they are exploring
the Flutter Dome?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.380
MICHAEL THOMSEN:
Yeah, so what we're

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.514
seeing here is the end
result. And the thing

00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:24.180
that's really interesting
is that's just

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.720
one of our key components
of our offering.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.480
The other thing is we have a
great developer experience.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.170
So when you try and
create a UI, whether it's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.720
more traditional
or more custom, we

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.330
found that there's a lot
of iteration going on.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.380
You may have one notion of what
your screen should look like,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.020
but it's really helpful
to take that and tweak it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.640
and, step-by-step,
to build up your UI.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.380
So for that, we built
something called

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.870
hot reloads, which
is the ability

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.840
to update the current screen
you're looking at and in just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.570
a few hundred milliseconds,
push a small change

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.080
to that running
application, preserving

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.742
the whole state without
having to re-navigate back in.

00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:07.200
And that's actually an example
of all the great engineering

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.090
we do in this project.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.130
So when you use
hot reload, you're

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.950
running it against a virtual
machine, which is how

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650
we can do those quick reloads.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.420
Plus, when you're running
these apps in production,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.280
very importantly,
we compile these

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.230
to a native ARM machine code.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.270
So you get the combination
of fast iteration speed,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.510
at development time, with fast
execution speed and production

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.010
rates.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.100
TODD KERPELMAN: The
thing about hot reload

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.310
that I think maybe not
everyone gets at first

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.780
is this is actually
running on a real device.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.160
You're editing real code.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.380
MICHAEL THOMSEN:
Yeah, so we do a lot

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.710
of really cool engineering
in this project, I think.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.870
So when you run during
development time,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.690
with your Flutter app, you
run on a virtual machine.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.360
So we can push these tiny
updates to the running app

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.440
and see that effect right away.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.600
But when you're running
all these apps behind us

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.360
in release mode, we
actually compile straight

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.880
to native machine code.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.589
So we get the combination of
this fantastic performance,

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:05.840
with sixty frames a
second in production apps,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.240
and amazing stateful
hot reload, where

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.857
we can update the UI in just
a few hundred milliseconds.

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:11.690
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:12.856
I have to say that is great.

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:14.690
As a developer,
I know sometimes,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.290
it takes 30, 45 seconds
to compile a new version.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.422
And those are like the longest
30, 45 seconds in the world.

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:22.880
MICHAEL THOMSEN:
So one of the sort

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.838
of expressions we use
for this is you can paint

00:03:24.838 --> 00:03:26.480
your app to life in Flutter.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.440
So you can sit down and
collaborate with the designer.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.190
And they can ask you
to tweak the app.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.590
And you're just making
those tweaks on the fly.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.860
And in less than a second,
they could see the effect.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.375
It enables you to experiment.

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:39.500
And I think that's actually
one of the main reasons

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.260
why we're seeing all these
creative layouts come out

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.320
is that tight developer loop
you are getting with Flutter.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.400
TODD KERPELMAN: So I
know a lot of developers

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.390
I've talked to have been
very excited about Flutter.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.306
Everyone I've talked to,
who's really used it,

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:53.470
has walked away super-excited
about the potential.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.680
What's new in Beta 3 that
developers can look forward to?

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.630
MICHAEL THOMSEN: There's a
number of new things in Beta 3.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.100
We're announcing a couple
of new partnerships.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.730
I mentioned
2Dimensions here, which

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.850
have great tooling for
two-dimensional animations.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.480
We have Infragistics that
announced some tooling

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.019
for doing prototyping and doing
co-gen from that into Flutter.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.970
Then we announced a
number of new partners.

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.194
We have Alibaba
that's using Flutter.

00:04:21.194 --> 00:04:25.440
We have Groupon working with
using Flutter and a few others.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.750
And then lastly, we
announced that we really

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.530
think Flutter is now
ready for production.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.480
So I talked about apps here.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.980
Most of these apps
are in production.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.120
So we invite developers
to take a look at Beta 3

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.170
and see if it matches
their requirements.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.110
And then go ahead and
use it in production.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.890
TODD KERPELMAN: Well
that sounds great.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.870
And if people want to find
out more about Flutter, where

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:45.900
should they get started?

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.610
MICHAEL THOMSEN: They should go
to Flutter.io on our home page.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.410
They can see the
Showcase tab that

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.570
has a selection of
these apps for them.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.100
You can click Get Started and
get quick installation tips.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.380
Or you can proceed to any
of a number of code labs,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.580
that we have prepared here
for the Google I/O event,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.660
that you can do at the comfort
of your own home or office.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.930
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.520
Well thank you for taking the
time to give me the quick booth

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.110
tour.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.901
If you want to find
out more about Flutter,

00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:11.900
go to Flutter.io.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.220
Try out a code lab or two.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.690
Bet you'll learn something new.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.739
And thank you so much for
joining us on I/O Live.

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:17.280
Thanks again.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.380
MICHAEL THOMSEN:
Thank you very much.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.505
TODD KERPELMAN: Absolutely.
