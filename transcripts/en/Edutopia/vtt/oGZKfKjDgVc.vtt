&gt;&gt;Roger Weissberg: I don't think
that children have advocates,

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:16.236
and my goal always has been
to do what can be done,

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:20.546
so that students are successful
in school, and in life,

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:23.166
so they feel good about
themselves, so they feel good

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:26.506
about where they live, and their
families, and they have a sense

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:32.306
of optimism and they feel that
they're going places in life,

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:36.766
and they matter to others, so that
is part of the passion that I feel,

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:39.376
doing things that can
improve the lives of children.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:44.026
&gt;&gt;For a number of years, people have
said, "Oh, if we spend time focusing

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.436
on the social and emotional
side of things,

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:49.106
it might be at the
expense of academics."

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.676
But we've found something
entirely different

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:52.686
in the work that we've done.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.736
We've found that if you focus
on the social and emotional,

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:57.516
it improves children's behavior,

00:00:57.866 --> 00:01:00.506
and it also improves their
academic performance.

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:04.386
So this is a two-fer now,
if you address kids' social

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:08.586
and emotional growth, you'll also
be benefiting them academically.

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:13.106
And this translates in terms
of achievement test scores,

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.066
so that one of the
things that we're finding,

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:18.256
and we were really quite surprised
when we began this overall study,

00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:25.966
is that children improve
11 percentile points.

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:30.716
In other words, with some of the
other studies that have been done,

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:35.476
that look at the impact of class
size, or other kinds of programs

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.176
that even try to promote
academic performance,

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:43.396
this increase of 11
percentile points is a big deal.

00:01:44.216 --> 00:01:47.266
&gt;&gt;In Illinois, we have social
and emotional learning standards

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:49.296
that are part of the
Illinois Learning Standards.

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:52.256
These are things, now
social and emotional skills

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:56.196
that children are expected to know
and be able to do and the fact

00:01:56.196 --> 00:02:00.646
that there is a policy environment
that is supportive for doing social

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:04.186
and emotional learning
instruction, commits teachers

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:07.926
to doing the work more effectively,
because they feel it's something

00:02:07.926 --> 00:02:12.646
that is supported, and
encouraged by policy makers.

00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:16.406
&gt;&gt;We talk about three Ps that
are going to be necessary

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:20.336
to make effective social and
emotional learning a reality.

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:24.906
One thing is policy, federal
policy and state policy.

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:27.796
A second thing are
principals in the building,

00:02:27.796 --> 00:02:32.536
we find are extremely important to
make this work, and come together,

00:02:32.876 --> 00:02:37.336
so for leadership, which
does not begin with a P,

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:39.576
but principals do, that's important.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:43.166
It's also important, of
course, to have superintendants

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.816
and district people involved in
supporting this effort, and finally,

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:48.446
there's the professional development

00:02:48.446 --> 00:02:50.896
and technical assistance
and support to teachers.

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:54.826
If we're going to do this work well,
there needs to be good guidance,

00:02:54.896 --> 00:03:00.286
sound policy, and support, and an
investment in teachers doing this

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.276
in the most effective way.

00:03:02.606 --> 00:03:06.496
That kind of support is going to lead
to students who are knowledgeable,

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:11.456
responsible, caring and ready to be
successful at school and in life.

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:15.446
&gt;&gt;It's one thing to collect the
information and to do the science,

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:19.496
and to see what the findings
are, it's another thing to think

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:24.056
about ways to share this
more publicly with educators,

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:28.616
with parents, with communities, with
policy makers, so that we can begin

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:30.766
to do what is the most
effective programming

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:32.706
that we can, on behalf of kids.

00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:35.346
