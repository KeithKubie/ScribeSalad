00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.900
[dramatic music]

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.667
NARRATOR: This pup has
strayed too close to the edge.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:17.567
Now, it's out of its depth.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.834
[seagull cawing]

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:43.333
A pup can outmaneuver a
shark, but only for so long.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:06.066
Half of all such encounters
end badly for seals.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.533
[seals calling]

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:16.300
The adults must deal with
this persistent menace.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.266
But how?

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:33.166
It takes one brave
seal to lead the way.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.333
Others join.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.980
Soon, they are a mob
harassing the intruder.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.233
It's a risky strategy.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.400
Sharks can turn on a dime.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:39.166
Together, they've
overcome a giant.
