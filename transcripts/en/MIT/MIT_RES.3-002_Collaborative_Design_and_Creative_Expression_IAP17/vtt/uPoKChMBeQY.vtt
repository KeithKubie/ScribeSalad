00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.780
SPEAKER 1: We created
a lock system.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.390
And so this lock, it
works through sound.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.750
So we have a
microphone here, and it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.160
detects a specific rhythm.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.890
See it have the right tempo
and right space between beats

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.910
for it to detect the--

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.140
for it to unlock.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.827
So let me just plug this in.

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:35.160
So it starts in an unlock state.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.480
We have a server right here.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.040
This is for concept.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.400
It's not the most sturdier
things, little cardboard

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.280
little flap.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060
So I'll put that
here to demonstrate.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.620
So plug that here.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.270
So let's say we
want to set a code.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.670
So we're going to hold the
button for two seconds--

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.250
or that.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.620
HARRY: So it detects it
three times in a row,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.300
both to make sure you can
enter the code repeatedly,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.115
and also to average
your results together.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.240
So that if you were a little
quick or a little slow

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030
on one of the taps,
that you don't

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.700
have to do that consistently,
that it knows what you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.514
meant to do after a few tries.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.180
SPEAKER 1: Luckily
we replace that code,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.130
so instead of boring you
all, we'll just lock this,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.260
but we'll lock the safe.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:33.120
HARRY: Let's reset.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.621
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.870
HARRY: We were having hardware
issues with our button.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.510
SPEAKER 1: This button
is not very cut.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.875
SPEAKER 3: It was
working really well.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:40.708
SPEAKER 1: Oh, geez.

00:01:46.302 --> 00:01:48.010
HARRY: And beat to
set it to easy unlock.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.280
His single clap is always--

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.190
SPEAKER 3: So now if
we press the button--

00:01:58.167 --> 00:01:59.750
SPEAKER 1: Well,
this is embarrassing,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.250
because this worked
two minutes ago.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.570
SPEAKER 3: It worked
two minutes ago.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.214
Can you come back to us?

00:02:06.214 --> 00:02:07.708
SPEAKER 4: Some
too tight in there.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.150
Now the lights.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.910
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.850
Yeah, so the lights--

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.630
basically, we have a lot
of light and sound systems

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.960
that denote different things.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.629
That's if it works.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.170
Let's say we put a
code that's wrong.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.332
So let's do that a couple
more times incorrectly.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.430
So now on the third
fail, it'll kind of lock.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.930
It's a simulated
calling the police.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.102
Let's just try programming.

00:03:09.102 --> 00:03:10.310
We'll try programming a code.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:16.459
It's OK.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.972
Hold on.

00:03:16.972 --> 00:03:18.430
Let me just reset
this whole thing.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.990
[INAUDIBLE] This'll work.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.990
OK, let's try
programming a new code.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.610
No.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.110
Not that.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.870
[INAUDIBLE] Unfortunately,
the sensor--

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.450
to determine what kind of sound
it's supposed to register--

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.783
there are a lot of difficulties.

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:45.250
And Harry can talk about those.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.375
HARRY: The sensor has a
tremendous amount of drift,

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:49.490
about five times as
much drift is actually

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.090
the sensitivity to sound.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.570
So before every
sound measure, we

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.090
have to take a
background reading.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.060
It also only detects
low pitched claps.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.335
If you hit your
fingers to your palm,

00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:00.460
it won't detect that noise.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.330
If you palm to palm, it
will detect that noise.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.500
It also requires
fairly loud claps.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.830
A gentle clap won't set it off.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.789
You have to really make
a fair amount of noise.

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.788
Also, depending on how
your hands come together,

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:12.690
the sound comes out in
different directions,

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.457
causing it to detect
they're not detected.

00:04:14.457 --> 00:04:17.040
So obviously, part of phase two,
if we were to expand on this,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.190
is to get a better piece
of sound-sensing hardware

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.870
that is capable of detecting
a broader range of sounds,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.400
with a little more sensitivity.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.260
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.390
That's our project.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.140
HARRY: But it worked
for proof of concept.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.650
SPEAKER 4: Number
one [INAUDIBLE]..
