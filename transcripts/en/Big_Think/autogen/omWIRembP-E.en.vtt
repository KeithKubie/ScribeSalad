now when we talk about science of
 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.849
now when we talk about science of
compassion it's also tied up with

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859
compassion it's also tied up with
 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.740
compassion it's also tied up with
science of empathy you know empathy

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750
science of empathy you know empathy
 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.129
science of empathy you know empathy
compassion altruism kindness they are

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
compassion altruism kindness they are
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.950
compassion altruism kindness they are
all very interrelated and much of the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
all very interrelated and much of the
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.400
all very interrelated and much of the
current scientific studies really fall

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
current scientific studies really fall
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.160
current scientific studies really fall
into two main categories one is a study

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170
into two main categories one is a study
 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.470
into two main categories one is a study
of altruistic behavior particularly in

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
of altruistic behavior particularly in
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.599
of altruistic behavior particularly in
animal and very young children and the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
animal and very young children and the
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.160
animal and very young children and the
thinking is that if we can see

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
thinking is that if we can see
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.339
thinking is that if we can see
altruistic behavior in animal and very

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
altruistic behavior in animal and very
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.839
altruistic behavior in animal and very
very young children that it must have

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
very young children that it must have
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759
very young children that it must have
very deep biological roots so that's the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
very deep biological roots so that's the
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.770
very deep biological roots so that's the
kind of logic behind why they are

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
kind of logic behind why they are
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.870
kind of logic behind why they are
focusing more on animal studies and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
focusing more on animal studies and
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.110
focusing more on animal studies and
children the other important area that

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
children the other important area that
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090
children the other important area that
overlaps the science of compassion is

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
overlaps the science of compassion is
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.990
overlaps the science of compassion is
the study of empathy and again here a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
the study of empathy and again here a
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.610
the study of empathy and again here a
lot of the work has been done on

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
lot of the work has been done on
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920
lot of the work has been done on
non-human primate studies there is an

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
non-human primate studies there is an
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.709
non-human primate studies there is an
American professor at Emory by the name

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
American professor at Emory by the name
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.260
American professor at Emory by the name
of France de Waal and he was one of the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
of France de Waal and he was one of the
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.439
of France de Waal and he was one of the
pioneers many you know people might have

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
pioneers many you know people might have
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.970
pioneers many you know people might have
seen the video of you know apes in you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
seen the video of you know apes in you
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.380
seen the video of you know apes in you
know there were two juvenile Apes

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
know there were two juvenile Apes
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.289
know there were two juvenile Apes
apes fighting and one of them loses

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299
apes fighting and one of them loses
 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.060
apes fighting and one of them loses
another ape who's not a blood relation

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
another ape who's not a blood relation
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.640
another ape who's not a blood relation
comes over and hugs him and gives and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650
comes over and hugs him and gives and
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740
comes over and hugs him and gives and
consoles him so it clearly is an

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750
consoles him so it clearly is an
 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.289
consoles him so it clearly is an
indication that empathy can be found in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
indication that empathy can be found in
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480
indication that empathy can be found in
non-human primates as well and then

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
non-human primates as well and then
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580
non-human primates as well and then
there are some interesting studies

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
there are some interesting studies
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.310
there are some interesting studies
coming from the studies of meditators

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
coming from the studies of meditators
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.010
coming from the studies of meditators
who meditate many hours on compassion

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
who meditate many hours on compassion
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.890
who meditate many hours on compassion
and then looking at their brain you can

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
and then looking at their brain you can
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.580
and then looking at their brain you can
actually see the brains expression in

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
actually see the brains expression in
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.399
actually see the brains expression in
action so this is called functioning you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
action so this is called functioning you
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.370
action so this is called functioning you
know MRI which is which has the ability

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
know MRI which is which has the ability
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.730
know MRI which is which has the ability
to look at the brain in act in action as

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
to look at the brain in act in action as
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100
to look at the brain in act in action as
it were at least the claim is that the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
it were at least the claim is that the
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.950
it were at least the claim is that the
meditators are unlike novices like us

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
meditators are unlike novices like us
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.399
meditators are unlike novices like us
have some ability to consciously direct

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409
have some ability to consciously direct
 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.679
have some ability to consciously direct
their attention and thoughts so in the

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
their attention and thoughts so in the
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.899
their attention and thoughts so in the
scanner the brain imaging scanner you

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
scanner the brain imaging scanner you
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819
scanner the brain imaging scanner you
can ask the military can you do this can

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
can ask the military can you do this can
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.100
can ask the military can you do this can
you do that can you just stay on the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
you do that can you just stay on the
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260
you do that can you just stay on the
level of empathy and feel the pain now

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
level of empathy and feel the pain now
 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.020
level of empathy and feel the pain now
can you move on to compassion wishing

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
can you move on to compassion wishing
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.520
can you move on to compassion wishing
the other person to be free of suffering

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
the other person to be free of suffering
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.679
the other person to be free of suffering
and wanting to do something about it and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
and wanting to do something about it and
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.070
and wanting to do something about it and
try to tease out what brain signature

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
try to tease out what brain signature
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.130
try to tease out what brain signature
and brain regions

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140
and brain regions
 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.050
and brain regions
activated when you're just an empathy

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
activated when you're just an empathy
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.330
activated when you're just an empathy
feeling and when you are moving on to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
feeling and when you are moving on to
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.160
feeling and when you are moving on to
compassion when you are wishing to see

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
compassion when you are wishing to see
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.280
compassion when you are wishing to see
the relief in this way the whole mapping

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
the relief in this way the whole mapping
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.470
the relief in this way the whole mapping
of the brain regions that are involved

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480
of the brain regions that are involved
 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.970
of the brain regions that are involved
in an experience something like

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
in an experience something like
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.950
in an experience something like
compassion is beginning to be done
