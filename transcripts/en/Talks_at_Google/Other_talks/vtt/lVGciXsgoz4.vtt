00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.680
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Welcome everybody. So today I'm
happy to introduce Sam Calagione who is back

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.219
to visit us again for a second time here in
New York. So thank you, Sam.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.769
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Thank you.
[Applause]

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.840
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Thank you, bud.
[Applause]

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.539
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I'm gonna move around between
the podium and this chair. I'm wearing a girdle

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:40.220
not just to emphasize my girlish curves but
I've got a ruptured disc in my back. So I'm

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.890
gonna kind of be moving back and forth and
self medicating a bit

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.450
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: as we do this chat. I know

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:01.060
I'm in a place with many, with my brethren
when I walked in and I emailed Adam to say,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:08.369
I'm definitely still coming, I got this little
issue with my back. Da, da, da, da, it's hard

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:17.149
for me to stand for awhile. And it was kind
of like Goldilocks up there with like 4 different

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.549
chairs, this one's too soft, this one's just
right.

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.689
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: That one looks just right

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.780
so thank you for thinking about that, Adam.
Three members of the Google team that were

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.499
responsible for Urkontinent are with us; Cameron,
Keith and Adam. And as questions come up that

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:42.090
may be a little bit to technical on the Google
side for me to address during the Q and A

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.710
component of this very loose presentation,
I'm welcoming them up to answer those questions

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:58.119
as well. So very basically, I know a number
of hands went up of folks that were here the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:06.590
last time I got to speak in front of this
room, so I'll do real, real brief who is Dogfish,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.650
our company, in the context of the craft brewing
community and the beer industry at large then

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.010
I'll jump into the Urkontinent project and
then I'll jump from that into the story around

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.280
the other beer that we're serving besides
Urkontinent tonight which is our Positive

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.950
Contact. And then also kind of weave in just
the overall importance of collaboration in

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.579
our industry but more specifically in Dogfish
Head's approach to business. All these projects

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.420
are examples of collaboration. So, starting
with Dogfish, we are now 17 years young. We

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.940
opened in '95, I think I was about 25 years
old when we opened and we were the smallest

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.980
brewery in the country when we opened in Rehoboth
Beach Delaware. I know there's a number of

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.579
home brewers in this community and I was basically
just brewing beer on glorified home brew equipment.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:02.422
I had an early three keg brewing system that
we did some things to to make it more, you

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:05.450
know, volume friendly. But right from the
get go when there was all the first, the first

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.950
sort of, uh, generation of craft brewers,
some awesome ones, and they were brewing really

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.280
flavorful, intensely flavorful beer in comparison
to largest breweries selling in this country

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.860
which intentionally made their beer more approachable,
some would say dumbed down, uh, but very,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.189
very consistent but very samey. Frankly, most
of the largest breweries that sell beer in

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:31.819
this country make some slight variation of
the same style of light lager. And the first

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:38.830
generation of craft brewers came in and kind
of re embraced continental styles like Pale

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.879
Ales from England or Lagers from Germany.
So knowing we were starting small, we said

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.299
we're gonna do something very different, we're
gonna try and embrace the entire culinary

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.849
landscape for potential ingredients to brew
with and that's where that sort of motto of

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.349
'off centered ales for off centered people'
came from, was that philosophy of that kind

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.890
of global approach to ingredients for brewing.
If you look back in the longest history of

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.260
beer, the beer geeks in this room know the
Reinheitsgebot, the beer purity act of 1516.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.230
Bavarian government mandated beer could only
be made with water, barley and hops. Yeast

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.569
wasn't included cause it wasn't discovered
by Louis Pasteur in its context of how it

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.190
works in beer yet. And 90 something percent
of the beer sold globally, today, commercially

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.540
roughly is kind of done in accordance with
that Reinheitsgebot. I say roughly cause the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:32.230
biggest breweries use a lot of corn and rice,
cheaper adjuncts that, uh, instead of all

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:39.100
barley. But if you look back in the longer
history of beer, 1516, we've, human beings

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.800
have been drinking beer for about 9,000 years.
The first known, like by physical evidence,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.930
fermented cereal based beverage, i.e. a beer,
was discovered in the Jiahu dig site in China.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.100
We do that beer in collaboration with the
molecular archaeologists that vetted that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.000
discovery called Chateau Jiahu and it's made
with Sake yeast, Sake rice, Hawthorne fruits,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.319
so that is the longest history of brewing.
So this concept of beer really only being

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:16.680
four ingredients has only been with us about,
for, for ten percent of our human brewing

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.350
timeline in the history of civilization. Yet,
the recent generations just kind of assume

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.330
that beer is beer. That kind of happened until
the craft brewing renaissance in this country.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.990
The Europeans were a little bit better than
we were at preserving these traditions of

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.360
brewing very inspired, very flavorful beers
that were outside the light Lager, Juggernaut

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.730
style that dominates globally, but still they
were existing styles. And you look at these

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.729
cultures, almost every culture around the
world had its own indigenous beers and, of

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:58.060
course, they predated the Reinheitsgebot so
they too kind of just embraced this idea of

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.449
whatever could grow in their region or their
world, whatever they could pick out of their

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:08.629
terroir or their local ground, that's what
they made beer with. A project we did, I don't

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:13.289
know, probably now it's been, my son's 13,
it's been 9-10 years ago, was when the first

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.680
shock and awe bombing was happening and I
was watching a dinosaur video with my son

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.729
to stop watching CNN and the other stuff that
was dominating TV and there was, they showed

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.110
a picture of dinosaurs and da,da,da,da, before
continental drift there was the one super

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:38.550
continent and that gave us the inspiration
to do a beer called Pangaea. I was stuck in

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.729
this pretty remote little area in Montana
where we were on vacation with our family

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:54.590
and it wasn't like I could go, do too much
outside of ski and hang with my family. But

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:04.740
really once I watched that I put my son to
bed and for the next three or four hours I

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:12.970
sat there using Google as a resource and I
decided, you know, I wanna do a beer with

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.240
every continent included as an ingredient.
Kind of our way as putting the fractured world,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.990
that shock and awe bombing, messy world that
we live in, back into one thing, you know,

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:29.700
a sort of cohesive thing. I did that without
knowing that Antarctica was a continent, I

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.380
wasn't geography major.
[Laughter]

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.940
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I was an English major, not
geography major. So that presented some challenges

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.970
as I did my Google searches for what we could
include. Every other continent was fairly

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:46.699
easy but literally within four or five hours,
that evening, sippin' beers and looking out

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:52.560
at the snow, we came up with this recipe and
by the next morning I had emails back from,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.710
you know, I had penguin shit or water to choose
from in Antarctica.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: You'd be surprised which

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.599
one we chose.
[Laughter]

00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:08.030
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: But that night, searching
those ingredients, that was obviously the

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.851
real challenge. And through that search I
found a US military base down there and as

00:08:11.851 --> 00:08:17.740
I went further into their website world, I
found like a 'contact me' type thing and by

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.689
the next morning there was a "Hell yeah! We're
all home brewers down here cause we can't

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:24.789
get beer."
[Laughter]

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:29.919
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: "We totally know Dogfish;
if you send us some bottles of this we'll

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:35.490
take a picture of this on the actual South
Pole drinkin' it!" He's like, "We got this

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:40.520
awesome reverse osmosis machine that turns
icebergs into awesome water, we'll send you

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.320
that." I was like, alright, I got my ingredient.
[Laughter]

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.580
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: From Antarctica. So then
we worked out the shipping issues and, cause

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:51.850
at first we we're like it's brewed with 100
percent Antarctica water, that's what I wrote

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:57.000
that night, and by two days later looking
at UPS and da, da, da, da, da, we're like,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.420
and every bottle has a molecule of Antarctica
water in it.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:05.040
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So we get the four, five

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.050
gallon buckets every year of the Antarctic
water and it has crystallized ginger from

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:15.350
Australia and all these different ingredients.
And I, I've gotten to be friendly with Adam

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:22.190
through the years and got invited to speak
here again a few years ago and for small businesses,

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.290
the idea for this Urkontinent which is kind
of a word that I think has more Germanic history

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:34.120
and uses but it essentially also means Pangaea,
is I think an earlier word that predates it

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.750
for what this super continent was called.
When Adam approached me about seeing if we

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:45.990
had an opportunity to collaborate here, I
thought the best way into this, because the

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:51.601
moment that we're at in the brewing history
of America, we now have more breweries in

00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:55.779
America than we had pre prohibition, back
when every neighborhood had its own brewery

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:02.770
and it's impressive. In the year 2012 there's
now over 2,012 breweries in the country, average

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:13.820
American lives within 10 miles of a brewery,
amazing stats. But what's more incredible

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:19.089
is we're on the cusp of this, another giant
surge of brewery openings. So many of us,

00:10:19.089 --> 00:10:26.649
I'd say 98 percent of those of us that opened
those 2,000 breweries, started as home brewers

00:10:26.649 --> 00:10:34.410
and just turned our passion into our livelihood.
While there's 2,000 breweries open right now

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:43.290
there's also 800 people that are registered
in the startup phase of opening a brewery.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:54.050
So here we are as craft brewers with about
six or seven percent market share and we're

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:01.290
getting ready to have about 800 breweries
open. But instead of freaking out and the

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:11.620
biggest craft breweries being like, "Oh, we
gotta do what we can to stop them." We kind

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:18.720
of all came together as a community and do
what we can to help them open whether it's

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.300
through our work as an association called
the Brewer's Association that represents a

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:30.290
vast majority of small breweries in this country
or individually when a brewery like ours that

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.079
might be mid-sized reaches out to make a beer
with a brewery like Shorts in Michigan or

00:11:35.079 --> 00:11:39.649
the Brewery in L.A. that are maybe, you know,
less than one tenth of our size, even though

00:11:39.649 --> 00:11:44.839
Dogfish is only one fifteenth of one percent
domestic market share, we are sizable and

00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:51.540
established now that we can use our outreach
and our resources to engage with these smaller

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:57.589
breweries. And we learn as much as they do
when we do these projects. But knowing we're,

00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:02.211
at this moment, sort of a reflection point
of an explosion of good beer, I thought it

00:12:02.211 --> 00:12:07.490
could be really fun if we could do this project
together in a way that lets us celebrate and

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:14.010
do a sort of tutorial without it feeling teachey
or preachy on the ways that small companies

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:18.720
can use, not just Google, but technology that
is accessible to grow because Dogfish, whether

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:26.130
it was the Pangaea project or today, we don't
have focus groups, we don't have rooms full

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:35.380
of MBAs, when we decide to do a project we
just decide to do it ourselves and often times

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:45.130
that involves a lot of online research. And
much like the internet in general has been

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:59.329
a great leveler on the marketing side of beer;
a brewery like Dogfish Head can have a social

00:12:59.329 --> 00:13:07.139
media world that's nearly as robust as the
largest breweries. We're like, I don't know,

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:10.709
the 20 something biggest brewery in the country
but my wife, Mariah, who runs all our social

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:18.480
media has done such a great job at that world
that we have the presence of, I think, like

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:27.410
the fourth or fifth biggest American brewery
online whether it be gauge it by Facebook

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:35.040
and Twitter or whatever she's doing that day.
But the important thing is we recognize an

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.920
obligation to share with the other small breweries
that are just coming online or are smaller

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.459
than us now, the ways you can be successful
in business. And it's, again, not preachy

00:13:45.459 --> 00:13:49.130
because there's as many different approaches
to opening and starting and brewing beer as

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.600
there is great styles of beer that are out
there. Beer is a subjective thing, we all

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.320
have different palates, so there should be
a limitless, you know, landscape of different

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:03.540
beers that are out there. But what is important
is, you know, like I said, collectively all

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.889
the small breweries are seven percent market
share so we really need to stick together

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:15.829
and a kind of rising tide floats all ships
as it gets more competitive in the beer market.

00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:22.040
You know, a few weeks ago, Anheuser Busch
InBev reached out to purchase Modelo, it's

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:29.089
still sort of pending a Department of Justice
look at it, but for all intents and purposes,

00:14:29.089 --> 00:14:33.960
that most likely will happen. So they'll go
from having roughly a 47 percent market share

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:39.940
to 53, you know, overnight with one purchase.
That's six percent which is about the entire

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:46.139
world of craft beer, all 2,000 of us, but
that moment and that much market share shifted

00:14:46.139 --> 00:14:51.970
in the time it took for those two companies
to sign contracts to merge. So, God bless

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.920
em', it's a, there's competitive components
that I'm not gonna go into here, other than

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:03.570
to say our priority as small breweries, is
helping the other small breweries grow so

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:12.860
that small breweries can still exist. So,
that's my little preaching here about what

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:18.650
we wanted to do with this project. So then
moving into the project itself, basically

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:25.139
we try to make this as iterative and open
as possible. And while the Pangaea project

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:37.830
was so much fun to do, that was just me in
one room, sitting there for four nights doing

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:46.319
Google searches of ingredients that led to
that beer and that recipe. This one, instead

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:52.540
of a bunch of beer geeks from the Google and
Dogfish side just sitting down saying, "I

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:59.480
like this. I like that," we said why don't
we try and make not just, the reference point

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.550
of Urkontinent is obviously a global reference
point, let's make the actual conceptionalization

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:10.819
of the beer as global as possible. So what
I'll do is since it's hard for me to talk

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:17.269
in the actual, um, what products we used or
what kind of tools we used to do that, let

00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:24.639
me just get that list out of the way and then
I can go back to speaking the way I do. A

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:31.360
guy from our team, Trey, runs our IT department
and he was instrumental on our side in helping

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.839
these things happen because I don't often
speak the same language as my friends from

00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:41.050
Google that were on this project. So really
just moving through these, these, the products

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:48.060
that we used, we used, and these guys can
go further into how we used them as we do

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.970
this, we used Google search, obviously, for
ingredient research and searching the whole

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:56.940
way, we used Google Docs for the online spreadsheets,
documentation about the project, we used Moderator

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:02.110
for the initial idea submissions which I think
is just a really cool component of this that

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.870
I don't thinks been done in the beer world
before, and also for the voting and comments.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:12.190
The fact that you don't even, you can submit
something or not but you can also just click

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:17.810
on, if you like someone else's suggestion
and that way it just became this really democratic

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:24.010
view of the ingredients and the process. We
used Google chat as we went through this process,

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:31.670
we would meet up every month or so as we were
bringing this toward the test batch and then

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:37.190
from the test batch toward the market place.
We did Google Sites for the actual Urkontinent

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:43.080
website and we used Google Video, some people
submitted videos to go along with their ingredient

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:52.020
submissions. We also set up our Google+ business
page, my wife did, at some point during that

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.640
process and that's another important social
media tool that we use. So what was really

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:59.760
neat about this global component is you had
this influx of over 100, I think, ingredient

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:08.560
ideas, that came into our world, so you had
the one component of how many people in the

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:14.510
Google universe would have liked to see that
ingredient included in this beer and then

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.920
the other component of, oh shit, those things
would taste horrible together.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:22.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: for some of the things, every

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:30.280
single idea, if I could read you that list
it's like a free form poem of awesome ideas

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.810
for ingredients that don't usually go into
beer; all 100 of them had their merits. Really

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:41.800
then our job became sort of curators of that
recipe, the Google team sat down with the

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:47.040
Dogfish team and this over 100 list of ingredients
and we started whittling it away for what

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.240
things would work well together. So I forget,
can you remember any of the really weird ones

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.820
that we had to just throw out immediately?
Keith?

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.820
[Inaudible]

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.820
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Poisonous, right.
[Laughter]

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.610
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: We try to, you know, sort
of hallucinogens and things that kill you

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:01.081
were pretty easy for us to knock off of that
list. So there were a few of those. That wasn't

00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:06.260
my weirdest ingredient moment, I was in Cairo
a couple years ago sourcing some ingredients

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:13.710
for a beer we do called Ta Henket based on
ancient Egyptian beers and I was at the market

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:19.490
place and I was horribly ineffective trying
to use my Italian, gesticulating to describe

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:27.590
what I wanted and why and they're just kind
of, and then they're like "Yeah" and we made

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.680
the agreement and I'm walking away with deer
penis as an ingredient.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.310
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: because I was trying to get

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.020
dates and the words were very similar.
[Laughter]

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.890
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Dom fruit which is a palm
fruit and then I'm walking away and I'm like

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:48.620
that's really neat, you know, we're gonna
be able to use these dates and the one thing

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:54.260
I caught in translation earlier was that this
ingredient would also be very good for my

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.360
sex life.
[Laughter]

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.720
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: And I guess that's what the
deer penis does so, um

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.790
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: that's a bad digression but

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:06.300
let's get back to Urkontinent. Know that we
don't ever use that ingredient in any of our

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.950
beers.
[Laughter]

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:20.250
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So, oh the ingredients are
up there, the list is up there. So that's

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.970
an example of the page, is that also the actual
ones that we chose, Cameron, or is that an

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:24.970
earlier version?

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:25.970
[Inaudible]

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.130
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Okay, cool, so if you kind
of, you get the idea of range, and then to

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:33.720
the left is where people are saying, right,
whether they like that idea and then we tallied

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:41.380
that as well and that went into our decision
process. What was also neat was from around

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:48.500
the world, some of the ingredients were chosen
two, three or four times that were submitted,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:55.970
I think rooibos, right, was one of the ones
that came to us, we're still in the process

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:01.570
of getting the cases of beer, if you were
part of the Google community and your idea

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:09.450
got chosen we sent you, or are in the process,
some people already got theirs, a case of

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:16.330
the Urkontinent as, for having the ingredient
that was chosen. We had to narrow honey down

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:22.790
a little bit further 'cause there were different
kinds of honey, that was one of the ones that

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:30.050
multiple, multiple entries. But the other
part of this is how much of the editing process

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:35.950
informed what ended up being the recipe, especially
the things that we chose not to consider because

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.940
then really, Dogfish Head had value in this
beyond just the ingredients that we chose.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:45.800
It allowed us to get this global sourcing
of over 100 ingredients and some theories

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.280
behind why they might be good in beer and
believe me, we've kept that list and we refer

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:57.520
to it and think about it as part of our process
of coming up with additional recipes. And

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.310
really that's part of what we, as small business
people, how we use Google as well, particularly

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.380
in an industry, if you're a small business
person it means that you're most likely in

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:14.840
an industry where you're in a niche, you're
not gonna be able to compete on scale or on

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:21.310
volume with the biggest players in your industry
regardless of what they are. So in order to

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.450
stand out in an industry where you're tiny,
you have to do something really different.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:31.240
So I know other brewers, like myself, use
Google search to do that first phase of vetting

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:40.370
an idea, a creative idea because you can go
there and say I got this awesome idea for

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:46.150
beer with blah, blah, blah and you can do
a quick search, "Beer with blah blah blah"

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:52.570
and if it's already been done it's probably
not a good choice to try and stand out in

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.230
the world by doing that or beer names, you
might not have an IP lawyer on your staff

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:01.900
at a three person nano brewery but you can
come up, you can say hold on a second I'm

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:08.020
gonna call my brewing company, blah blah blah,
that's the name and you type in blah blah

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.620
blah brewing company and before you have to
go through all that official research to get

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:21.440
in use or trademarks and all that stuff, you
can quickly look, without lawyers, kind of

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:27.110
parse down or work through those options.
So, I know that's something that we all do

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:32.710
pretty regularly as small businesses. So,
at any rate, there's some great ideas for

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:40.480
recipes that, for ingredients that came out
of that, but back to our process was the hard

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.770
decisions of editing that and curating that
list which we did together over some of the

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:52.450
video conferencing that we did. And then these
guys came down to Rehoboth and we brewed the

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.560
test batch together, I don't remember what
month that was.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560
&gt;&gt;audience member: August.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:01.331
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: August. So that was kind
of nice. When we were down there we also took

00:24:01.331 --> 00:24:03.400
a lot of video. I think, Cameron, you were
wearing the crazy go pro head thing so there's

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:09.630
some neat shots in the video that we did together
that are super, you know, kind of Indie movie,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:16.060
jumping all over the place type stuff and
then we did some more nice, more formalized

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:23.270
editing stuff that became part of that film.
And then after the test batch we sent samples,

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:29.370
I think, or we discussed that and you guys,
some of you came back down didn't you when

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.740
it came on tap? Or didn't any of you come
down in between? No? Mike maybe? So the next

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.960
process was actually the sensory component,
not just did they all sound nice on a page

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.950
and we thought they could work together but
how they would work together. So that's why

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:50.650
we do these smaller test batches and, again,
not using focus groups, what we had when we

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:58.310
were talking about, you guys call it dog,
dog fooding an idea of kicking it around and

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:03.970
making sure, at least internally, that these
are gonna be, your coworkers are also the

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:08.840
best and most critical judges that you could
have. And we kind of do the same thing at

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.810
our pub where we always do a test batch before
we bring a beer to market, at least one sometimes

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:17.870
two, and I talked to my buddies at a chicken
company much bigger than us that also is kind

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:38.880
of near us, and they were saying, "Wow that's
so lucky that you get people that pay for

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:50.540
your R and D batches."
[Laughter]

00:25:50.540 --> 00:26:28.260
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: You know? They have focus
groups where people are paid to go try their

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:41.400
new ideas for chicken and they were frankly
like, you know, yes there's some good data

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:55.990
that comes from that process but let's face
it, someone's in a room getting' paid to eat

00:26:55.990 --> 00:27:04.940
some chicken they're like, "That's good! I
like that one! That's good!"

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: you're getting paid to do

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:19.790
that. You kind of reverse that idea and you
got hardcore beer geeks coming to our pub

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:27.510
in Rehoboth and now we get over 1,000 visitors
to our production brewery every week. These

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:34.700
people make a pilgrimage from Ohio or Kentucky
or there was some from Brazil there 3 days

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:41.990
ago cause they were showing the Brew master
show down there and they decided that's what

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:49.800
they wanted to do with their week's vacation.
If these people are gonna come that far to

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.490
the brewery then of course they're gonna say,
since Dogfish has a reputation for experimentation,

00:27:53.490 --> 00:28:00.710
of course when they get to the source they're
gonna say, "What's new? What haven't I tried?

00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:10.080
What's just being brewed in your pub right
now?" So then these people drove from Brazil

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:17.990
and I don't know what the currency is there
but they put out their money on the table,

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:25.360
I'd say about six bucks, and we give them
a beer, they're gonna tell us if it sucks.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:32.050
It's not like we're paying them to give us
opinion, that process of actually asking,

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:39.900
expecting people to pay for even your R and
D batches is wonderful in terms of getting

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.750
you very real feedback. So there were some
tweaks that we made to the test batch. I forget

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:45.480
which, which spice it was that we decided
was not coming through as much and we upped.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.480
&gt;&gt;Adam: [Inaudible]

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.440
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Oh, okay, as we made that
call, was that based on the teas? The water

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.880
teas that we made?

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880
&gt;&gt;Adam: [Inaudible]

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.760
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Shh! Adam, we're filming
here.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: That creative decision that

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:01.560
we made to go in a different direction.
[Laughter]

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:11.360
&gt;&gt; Adam: [inaudible] I'm just trying to say--.
I think you referred to it as the [inaudible]

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:17.260
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: We called it an audible.
[laughter] So, uh, what I really think actually

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:25.340
what we wanted to pull up forward was the
wattle seed which comes from Australia which

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:35.270
we now we, to get it here was not easy cause
it hadn't been acknowledged in a beer ingredient

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:43.670
before so that process of submitting that
label to the TTB, the feds that, the federal

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:53.550
arm that regulates us, it involves an SOP,
a statement of process and there wasn't really

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:58.550
a history of wattle seed and then finding
a wattle seed producer that could get us this

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:06.800
much in this volume, the first guys we called
in Australia was like, "Oh yeah, mate, I got

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.420
200 plants in my backyard." We're like, "We're
making 4,000 cases of this beer."

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: You got a bunch of neighbors

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:22.210
with 200 plants each, like, 400 neighbors
or so?

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:29.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So it led to us working with

00:30:29.010 --> 00:31:00.690
a consortium of wattle seed raising type people.
[Laughter]

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:55.220
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: And we had to over buy, we
had to commit to a certain volume which led

00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:00.180
to some really good wattle seed ice cream
at our pub.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: You had wattle seed salad

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:14.720
special, you had, we're tired of wattle seed
on its own, we like it in Urkontinent though.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:28.950
But at any rate it's what contributes the
almost, the dirt, it's almost it doesn't sound

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:39.370
good as a beer descriptor but there's a very
earthy, dirt like note to this beer that we

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:55.070
think is really unique in beer and the roasted
dark grains that give this the color in comparison

00:32:55.070 --> 00:33:10.000
to, say, Positive Contact, really complimented
that earthy notes that came from the wattle

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:21.280
seed. It was also a heroic effort done by
the Google team to get what I think was like,

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.080
you know, three fifths of the Mountain View's
honey supply that the chef keeps up on the

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:31.660
roof up there. But he was excited to be part
of this project as well so that was another

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.290
"Oh shit" moment of ingredients to say will
we really be able to get. So it's pretty ironic

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:41.610
that we have ingredients from around the world
and our anxiety was mostly around the honey

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:47.850
that was coming because we wanted to make
sure we used Google's honey cause that's how

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:54.090
we promoted it. So at any rate we do, there
wasn't one Urkontinent advertisement, we didn't

00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:02.140
pay in any traditional extent for any of the
marketing of Urkontinent. We served it at

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:10.100
GABF, the Great American Beer Festival which
is the largest single beer even in the country

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:18.839
put on by the Brewer's Association. I took
a couple sixtels to a couple special events

00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:30.050
that I knew would be very high impact whether
it was just 60 of us beer geeks in a room

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:37.980
I knew it would resonate online and then the
internal chatter of those folks won and the

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:48.840
true champions on the team getting the word
out about it and, of course, the film that

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:54.800
we made together. So really that film was
the centerpiece of sort of our marketing,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.910
bringing this beer to market plan. So it really
was just timed where folks from the Google

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.560
side shared the world, shared the word at
the same moment that Mariah, my wife, kind

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:08.760
of blasted it out through our social media.
As Adam mentioned, there was some anxiety

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.600
caused by that because, of course, the idea
is a Google brewing company and I Googled

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.500
that, someone's already got that, you can't
use that name.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.620
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: But there was some concern

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.630
because, obviously, Dogfish Head was making
the beer all ourselves as professional brewers

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:30.890
and we understood the liability was there.
My hats off to Google that they still allowed

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:38.970
this film to go out there it's one of the
most viewed YouTube videos that Dogfish has

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:46.560
ever made. So that in itself meant that by
the time the orders of this beer shipped they

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:55.280
were already 100 percent sold out. When it
came off the packaging line the demand from

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.350
the distributors was such that we probably
could have made twice as much and still immediately

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:04.850
sold it out before it actually got to retail.
So a wonderful challenge but intentionally

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:11.310
so and Dogfish does this all the time, we
don't wanna be just 60 Minute Brewing Company,

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:15.530
our flagship beer, we're probably the only
sizable top 20 craft breweries that high fives

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:21.810
each other when the percentage of our revenue
based on our best selling beer goes down in

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:30.570
a year. Like, we got down to 47 percent! You
know, you get fired if you ran a public company

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:35.200
for making these kinds of decisions I'm sure.
[Laughter]

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.440
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: But, again, if we really
believe in 'off centered ales for off centered

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:47.800
people' as a concept then we need to practice
what we preach. So our goal is to always put

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.340
as much efforts and energy into one off, you
know, single time a year release beers like

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.830
Urkontinent and Positive Contact as we put
behind 60 Minute. So, that process allows

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:03.210
us to have 30 something, 35 beers that we
package every year compared to maybe the norm

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:09.490
of a little less than half that for most brewers
but these beers act as a de facto marketing

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:16.850
or sales team because there's always something
to talk about if you're at a retail place

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:24.040
and someone says, "Hey, what's new from Dogfish?"
We try to make sure that every month, and

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:35.190
maybe two or three times a month, there's
something coming up that's a limited release

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:43.430
and we intentionally gauge our volume to make
sure that demand is higher than supply so

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:46.760
that these experiments continue to be exciting
for beer lovers who really kind of wanna come

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:57.680
on this journey with us and explore the outer
edges of what beer can be. So, the gang will

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:10.690
take questions when we get to the Q and A
part but I should probably move on, I'm gonna

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:23.580
take a drink real quick. Does anyone have
a question while I have a few ounces of beer?

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:30.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Go ahead. No? You wanna wait

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.510
til the end?

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:45.850
&gt;&gt;male #1: What's your favorite Dogfish beer?

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:56.010
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: It's usually the one I'm
drinking when I'm asked that question.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.710
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Um, I probably by volume

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:05.230
drink mostly Indian Brown, 60 Minute, Hellhound,
our IPA. In the summer I drink a whole lot

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:12.000
of our Festina Peche which is a tart light
4 ½ ABV beer, Namaste, which is like a Belgian

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.800
white we do with lemon grass. By volume those,
and then every week if something new comes

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:23.690
our packaging line I bring home either a 750
or a six pack or if it's one off we do every

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.351
year I still bring that home to see if it's
evolving and I have a nice little library

00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:35.190
at home and at the brewery to compare everything
that we've brewed again. So, it's a fun job.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:41.760
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So I'll move on to Positive

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:57.380
Contact and I guess in between them I'll talk
about that approach to collaboration for us.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:11.250
And, again, I mentioned it earlier when I
said collectively the small breweries have

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:28.030
less than seven percent market share so we
recognize the rising tide floats all ships

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:37.870
component of our niche, of the beer industry,
but collaboration in Dogfish is even more

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:48.010
central to our approach. You know, we think
that there's a lot of good karma that comes

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:55.640
with prioritizing collaboration instead of
competition and we catch ourselves in moments,

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:04.780
at meetings, talking about competitive subjects
and we consciously try to stop ourselves and

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:10.510
bring our discussion back to, you know, what
we can do that's positive. So, one of the

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:25.140
most positive things we think we can do is
work with other companies that we believe

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:32.580
in and regardless of scale. And sometimes
we take shit for that, you know, when we do

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:42.280
a beer called Theobroma, an ancient, an ancient
recipe we use a tiny company called Askinosie

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:50.890
Chocolate in Saint Louis and we got to tell
that story and share the word on Askinosie

00:41:50.890 --> 00:42:00.360
and bring some attention to them through what
we did and they shared the word and kind of

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.320
got their chocolate and our peanut butter
but our peanut butter's beer and it was kind

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:12.650
of a one plus one equals three as it is with
any collaboration because you're accessing

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:20.860
the group of people that love one company
and turning them on to the other company so

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:33.340
it kind of allows both those companies awareness
to grow exponentially when these new demographics,

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:43.200
or groups of people, are suddenly turned on
to something that they didn't know about.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:50.260
So, Askinosie's a no brainer, tiny little
artisanal company, but when we do a beer with

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:58.650
Sony music, Miles Davis Bitches Brew, you
know, we took some flak from that from a few

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:05.240
beer geeks, fellow beer geeks online saying,
"Oh, you're working with Sony that'd be like

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:13.190
if you were working with Budweiser." And our
theory there is yeah okay, but if you love

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:24.620
Miles Davis as an artist and he's kind of,
frankly, a little bit marginalized compared

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:34.680
to maybe where he was in recognition for really
exploring that fusion jazz, rock world that

00:43:34.680 --> 00:44:05.450
a lot of bands play in today, this is a nice
opportunity for us to celebrate that and kind

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:11.000
of bring Miles Davis to a bunch of hardcore
beer geeks in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, that

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.030
might not have been as familiar with his work.
So we make sure the opportunity to collaborate

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:21.990
makes sense and we've said no, there was a
mustard, big ass mustard company that wanted

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:30.320
to do a co branded thing with us and we basically
just said, okay we're gonna do this, this

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:36.360
and this and they're like, "Oh, no, we'll
use our own, a beer that we make here in this

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:43.270
Dogfish co branded thing just cause of the
way we produce." And that was a very short

00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:48.280
conversation cause there was nothing authentic
about that process. And then, uh, compare

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.430
that to recently we talked to two different
companies; I was eating pickles one night

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:54.620
and had
[Laughter]

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:59.100
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: with my 60 Minutes IPA,
[Laughter]

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:04.760
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: and I was like, dang, these
go really well together.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:09.000
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I was, and they were from

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:21.120
Brooklyn Brine, a small company here and that
led me to explore an opportunity to work with

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:33.190
Shamus and the gang at Brooklyn. And, meanwhile,
there's a big, there's at least one big cucumber

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:42.160
slash pickle company with big locations in
Delaware. We thought about that for a moment

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:48.340
but that one didn't seem like the right fit.
If they were big and local and locally owned

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:53.050
and weigh into the local Delmarva peninsulas
community, the scaled wouldn't have mattered,

00:45:53.050 --> 00:46:04.920
but the feeling that there was nothing that
we felt warm about and my HR director was

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:11.990
the one that was like, "This one doesn't feel
right." And that's kind of how we make these

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:16.360
decisions and our process at Dogfish is really
demo-, democratic. We have basically seven

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:21.100
people that I sit with, I'm the president,
my wife Mariah's the boss

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.090
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: the vice president, Nick,

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:27.330
is our chief operating officer and then VP
of sales, brewing operations director and

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:34.800
brewmaster and HR director, we all seven sit
at a table. And a few years ago they were

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.800
like, "Sam, we're all in. We don't want to
work anywhere else. The one thing we would

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:45.370
like, though, is a little more input on the
what we're doing next stuff. That's still

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.160
we know what you're good at and what you love
but for us to feel 100 percent all in at the

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:55.000
executive level of running this company, can
you kind of run these ideas [chuckles] by

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:05.050
us before you tell us this is what we're doing
next week?" So that was probably one of the,

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:10.150
in 17 years, kind of the biggest moment of
humility for me because I already felt like,

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:12.860
this is starting to feel like a self help
thing over here.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:15.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I should lay down. But, you

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.380
know
[Laughter]

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:20.420
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I should sit in the chair.
But, for me, what I recognized, a kind of

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:26.140
existential moment was that I'd done a pretty
good job of hiring people whose skills compliment

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:32.970
my own and that's what was really hard as
a small business, startups all about we don't

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:40.610
have cash, we don't have money, we gotta survive,
survival mode. And then as you grow the challenges

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:50.860
become more about people and finding the right
people to fit culturally and finding the right

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:59.210
people with the skill set to match your own
as you try and grow this company. And I'd

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:08.600
done a pretty good job at that so I could
just focus on what I'm good at which is a

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:14.940
new beer recipe, a new idea for an event,
a new idea for collaboration or a project.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:20.050
So I took great pride in saying I've got this
part of the company but then you also have

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:26.040
to realize that that's kind of one of the
fun parts of working at a small business and

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:32.760
being at the executive level, is being involved
in these giant risk decisions to do something

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:39.160
you haven't done before. So it was a real
challenge for me to listen to them and say

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:45.070
okay and now it's turned into this big dysfunctional
sort of Italian family approach to strategy.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:47.620
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Where it's like, ah, and

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:54.750
I basically have to whine and cry, I don't
cry but I whine and don't yell.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.540
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I whine and, like, I walk

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:07.930
up and down the room and the cliché is that
I rarely say I'm gonna put my president's

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:14.790
hat on for this one and you know it got bad
if that happened. And I rarely do it because

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:22.090
I know if I don't have all of them on board
and wanting to push with me in the same direction,

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:27.310
the project's gonna have a less likely chance
of succeeding. So the real goal is getting,

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:36.020
is convincing all, the six of them to want
to do what I do, what I wanna do. Then a lot

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:45.140
of times that leads to us altering that idea,
you know, when I did the pickle collaboration

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:51.860
with Shamus and Brooklyn my instinct was I
really like this guy let's just trust him

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.180
we don't need a contract.
[Laughter]

00:49:54.180 --> 00:50:01.410
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: And Nick, our COO, is like,
"I like him, too. I wanna do this project,

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:02.440
we need a contract."
[Laughter]

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:10.050
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So that's an example of that
process. So it's really also an example of

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:15.100
collaboration not just outside with companies,
but collaboration internally within our company

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:22.690
and how the seven of us try to work together
to move Dogfish Head in the right direction.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:29.190
So, I learn from them every day. So, the project
behind you is one that was pretty unified,

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:35.170
yes, that they were behind doing it because
it's not a giant label band and because, you

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:42.070
know, the idea to bring food into it hadn't
been done before and they really loved that

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:46.830
idea. So basically this beer, Positive Contact,
came from Dan the automator, the musicians

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:53.740
from, he's in Gorillas and Deltron 3030 is
the band that this one came about from and

00:50:53.740 --> 00:51:00.990
basically this album was a pivotal album for
me when it came out 11 years ago or whatever

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:07.860
it was, I just loved it cause it was so distinct
in the world of Hip Hop cause, again, it had

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:27.670
a lot of that jazz and orchestration components,
very like grand music for the world of Hip

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:36.480
Hop. And Del's like, Del the funky homo sapien
is also in this band, is an amazing rapper.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:47.320
So 

00:51:47.320 --> 00:52:09.550
I got the call from Dan and I was just walking
around the conference room on the phone with

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:18.590
Dan the Automator and I'm like yeah. And so
he told me, he's like, "I'm a big Miles fan."

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:25.510
He named his son Miles and he's like, "I love
what you guys did with that and with Robert

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:33.010
Johnson" we did a beer with and he was a big
fan of that and he's like, "Let's do something."

00:52:33.010 --> 00:52:42.120
So, as we walked into that he wasn't a huge
beer geek he was more of a foodie and so he's

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:49.690
like, basically I sent him every beer we make,
it was about $400 worth of beer, I think 40

00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:54.540
different beers from different vintages and
it was more in shipping than just the beer

00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:02.070
cause I wanted to make sure it got there in
really good shape so I overnighted it from

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:08.380
Delaware to his home in San Francisco, like
$600, I don't remember what it was to ship

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:10.930
it but it was a lot.
[Laughter]

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:19.460
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Shipping it overnight was
not an idea I brought in front of the seven

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.140
people that I work with.
[Laughter]

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:29.580
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I don't think it would have
gone well. I think I would have had to put

00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:40.590
on my president's hat. So, anyway, he was
awesome about it. The idea was I asked that

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:50.410
he drink each beer and then send me a little
diary entry on his impressions of that beer

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:57.250
and it was also a canary in the coal mine
to see if this was a project that he would

00:53:57.250 --> 00:54:03.920
take seriously cause I know he's a very well
regarded musician and probably gets pulled

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:11.040
in a million directions. So this is a way
to see if he was really engaged and it would

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:22.510
be really an authentic equal sort of collaboration
the way it was when we did Urkontinent with

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:34.410
the folks at Google. And it was neat, every
single day he would, he wouldn't necessarily

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:41.820
finish them all cause it'd be a big champagne
bottle and he'd say, "I had four or five ounces

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:50.521
of this. This is what I liked, this is what
I didn't " and then I just asked for him to

00:54:50.521 --> 00:54:55.720
do free form list your favorite culinary ingredients
and then I met him here in New York City at

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:03.530
Birreria, the brew pub that Dogfish and two
Italian breweries do the brewing, we're the

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:11.770
brewing sort of collaborators on the Birreria
project, we just opened another one in Rome

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:18.630
with Eataly stores here and in Rome. So I
met Dan the Automator up on the roof, I brought

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:26.840
a bunch of the ingredients that I thought
from his list would work well in a beer, I

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:31.310
had cheese graters and tea steepers and paring
knives and we just sat there and I took the

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:43.780
base beer of his four favorites beers of the
40 that we use and we just sat there and put

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.530
the different ingredients in those four beers.
Alcohol acts as a solvent, strips kind of

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:52.510
the flavors and oils out of that ingredient
and gives you a rough idea of how it'll contribute

00:55:52.510 --> 00:56:01.390
to that beer. So, from that we were able to
kind of do what our process was and figure

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:06.590
out what ingredients worked well together
and really Fuji Apples, Cilantro and Cayenne

00:56:06.590 --> 00:56:12.180
pepper actually proved to go really well together.
And we've never commercially done anything

00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:17.250
that's cideresque and to do this beer with
a very high percentage of apple, making it

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:26.930
a hybrid between the worlds of a cider and
a beer was something new and exciting for

00:56:26.930 --> 00:56:36.560
us so, again, an opportunity to learn from
our collaborator of something we might not

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:43.340
have known ourselves. So then the idea was,
you're a foodie, how about this, if you come

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:50.400
up with four original sort of dub versions
of the songs on the next album, let's, for

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:57.000
now, put them on CD, we'll do the test batch
at the pub, we'll send out bottles of the

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:05.650
test batch to our favorite chefs, you pick
a few and I'll pick a few, with the music

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:17.820
and we'll ask them to put the music on, drink
one of the bottles and then think about the

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:24.590
other, the, the beer and the music and what
food would go well with that. So we chose

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:32.980
five chefs from Mario Batali to David Chang
and some great chefs and they all, again,

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:39.760
were all in on the project and sent us their
notes and their thoughts and we asked to do

00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:46.690
a recipe for six people, cause the idea was
we wanna sell this as a box set, like you

00:57:46.690 --> 00:57:51.660
would with music but our box set came with
six beers, a vinyl album, on the sleeve of

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:56.060
the album was recipes from six people from
the five chefs. And you can imagine the dozens,

00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:02.100
no, hundreds of hours that my co workers and
I had to spend putting a vinyl record into

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:07.000
a six pack, hand taping it with duct tape
that we wrote

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.880
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Positive Contact on the duct

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:23.020
tape. We sent out four cases around the country
on pallets randomly to test that vinyl would

00:58:23.020 --> 00:58:30.400
last, if it made a trip to Arizona and back,
again, a shipping decision that I did not

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.400
vet
[Laughter]

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:35.950
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: through the seven of us.
And it worked. And then we even policed through

00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:40.390
social media what happened once that beer
was released in the market place, meaning,

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:46.310
that one UPC code on it, our intention was
for it to be one product but some retailers

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:52.670
were a little less than ethical and chose
to open that bottle, open that case up, sell

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:58.720
them individually which means those people
would not get the album, would not get the

00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:02.630
opportunity to do that among their friends,
so what was so awesome, again, about harvesting

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:09.830
that world of social media as a small company,
as Mariah sat there for days after that release

00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:12.500
and watched beer lovers narc on the retailers
that did this.

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:13.600
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: And then all we could do,

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.840
cause it would be price fixing if we called
them up said you can't do that, you assholes,

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:22.160
we can't do that cause it would be price fixing.
So our message was, "We'll be very disappointed

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.880
in any retailer that decided to do this and
we hope you guys, as beer lovers, will voice

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.990
your disappointment as well." And other than
like a couple regions of the country, most

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:33.870
people were pretty good at respecting that
decision to keep that as one whole beer. Now,

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:41.700
will we ever do that again and go through
that bottling and putting an album in? Perhaps

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:42.750
not.
[Laughter]

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:51.120
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: But our commitment, we have
other, we have 'off centered ale for off centered

00:59:51.120 --> 01:00:02.380
people' and 'analog beer for the digital age'
and those are sort of our two rallying cries

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:10.890
and we will continue to do projects with the
vinyl and with other musicians we love. So,

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:19.920
I think I'm pretty close to the Q and A part
of the presentation and I'd rather just, let's

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:28.180
just open it up and if you guys have any questions
at all, this will give me another opportunity

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.700
to have another sip of beer.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:35.619
&gt;&gt;male #2: So the Google collaboration beer
seems to be sold out everywhere, hard to get,

01:00:35.619 --> 01:00:43.790
are there any plans to increase production
and get this into the hands of people looking

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:44.790
for it?

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:50.030
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: We would love to. From what
I understand, Keith is mostly responsible

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:51.200
for that.
[Laughter]

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.570
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I don't know from here how
he's buying them in Kentucky but that's pretty

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:58.190
cool. Again, this is one that we love keeping
demand in front of supply but we realize the

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:03.700
challenge when most of, a lot of folks from
within the Google community couldn't get access

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:12.960
to this as well. We tried to send out to what
areas, you know, we tried to send more to

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:19.470
New York, we intentionally found retailers
around your California location and asked

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:27.400
them to stock up but it's a real challenge
cause, again, at retail we have to make the

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:33.820
beer available to everybody, that's also federally
mandated. It's barely answering your question.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:41.660
The better answer would be we'd love to do
this beer again someday and I don't know when

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.020
that day will come.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:49.140
&gt;&gt;male #3: Dogfish Head has a really distinctive
look in branding. Do you guys have an in house

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.440
designer that makes all your labels?

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:59.210
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: It used to be me and then
two years ago we hired our first graphic design

01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:12.300
guy and I loved that job and it was kinda
like a, and I still, I painted the Urkontinent

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:21.090
type face and then brought that word in all
the different fonts, kind of representing

01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:29.630
all the different folks that, each letter's
from a different font and then I brought that

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:41.060
to our graphic designer and from that, you
know, using that color scheme the label developed.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:51.260
So I still love staying very involved in that.
I came up with our sort of ransom letter type

01:02:51.260 --> 01:03:01.770
font called doggy, which was basically a 19th
century stamp set that I just cut and paste

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:14.290
and scanned in 
to create a font and then I came up with our

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:24.650
logo and that outer broken edge kind of, you
know, trying to talk about the, you know,

01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:32.700
looking kind of rustic. So I still love being
involved in that art project. Our challenge

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:41.780
at our company is you don't want just the
art on the label to be perceived as the art

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:48.960
of what we do so we kind of need to recognize
that every different department contributes

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:55.900
toward that perception of how unique our brand
is. So we don't really put on a pedestal,

01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:03.540
the brewers or the guys that do the art, everyone's
kind of helping to get that beer to market.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:07.250
So, yeah, I don't know if that answered it
but.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:09.110
&gt;&gt;male #3: Yeah, thank you.

01:04:09.110 --> 01:04:10.230
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Yep.

01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:15.290
&gt;&gt;male #4: I'm a few drinks in so forgive
me if this comes our slurry.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:19.740
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #4: You talked a lot about the different

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:27.260
ingredients you use at Dogfish, can you talk
a little bit about the ways you make beer.

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:34.730
I'm thinking specifically about cast gauging
or whiskey casts that are really popular,

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.960
some of the ways you're thinking about expanding
that.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.080
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Yeah, we're, right now the
vast majority of the commercial brewing equipment

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:49.109
is stainless steel because it's sterile and,
you know, easy to clean, very durable, but

01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:55.790
long before stainless steel there were lots
of other materials used in the world of brewing.

01:04:55.790 --> 01:05:00.180
We do, we have the largest brewing wooden
vessels built in America since before prohibition,

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:07.890
we're adding another palo santo wood which
is a Paraguayan dark wood, 10,000 gallon wooden

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:13.450
brewing vessels. But we are playing around
outside of that. We just did an ancient ale

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:22.590
with our Italian, the two brewers that we
do Eataly with and we went to ruins, Etruscan

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:29.980
ruins outside of Rome and we vetted, sort
of looked at those tombs and the materials

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:36.099
that were either written about coming from
that culture or actually still had evidence

01:05:36.099 --> 01:05:43.341
at the tombs were bronze, wood and terracotta
and so our three breweries are doing the exact

01:05:43.341 --> 01:05:45.540
same recipe but fermenting the beer with different
material. So, Baladan's doing their fermentation

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:50.970
on wood, we're using bronze in our fermenters
and then Birra Del Borgo just built these

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:56.750
beautiful huge terracotta fermenters. So in
a way you kind of look at the whole culinary

01:05:56.750 --> 01:06:01.950
landscape for ingredients we need to also
kind of be looking at, you know, every potential

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:04.390
surface to use for beer as well.

01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:10.119
&gt;&gt;male #5: How did a guy from Delaware get
involved in Eataly?

01:06:10.119 --> 01:06:12.990
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Okay, um, yep.
[Laughter]

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:14.420
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Well,

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:19.619
&gt;&gt;male #5: You seem the only non Italian company
down there.

01:06:19.619 --> 01:06:25.610
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Yeah, well that basically,
that relationship didn't start with like Mario

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:31.000
Batali or what was happening here, it started
with Salon De Gusto which is the bi annual

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:37.580
slow food conference that happens in Turin
which is the, you know, birthplace of that

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:45.099
movement, that movement slow food was kind
of in response to them trying to put a McDonalds

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:47.880
in downtown Rome and the Italians rioted.
[Laughter]

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:53.150
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Which is pretty cool. So
it kind of birthed a modern era of sort of

01:06:53.150 --> 01:07:03.440
the locavore thing, or at least the earlier
modern version, I mean, again, craft brewers

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:15.119
were brewing beer with whatever was indigenous
and local 10,000 years ago so locavore wasn't

01:07:15.119 --> 01:07:19.460
invented by fucking hipster in Brooklyn three
years ago.

01:07:19.460 --> 01:07:23.800
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: It's been going on for 10,000

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:32.480
years. So I was invited to speak at the Salon
De Gusto maybe every other year for maybe

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:38.950
the last 7 or 8 years and there's an awesome
Italian craft beer pavilion over there and

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:44.460
I, of course, would have some beers with these
guys and just realized that they were, you

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:53.890
know, brothers in arms and very creative and
using tobacco and rare grains and tree resins

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:58.119
in their beer. So I really hit it off with
two of them and then those are two brewers

01:07:58.119 --> 01:08:04.410
that are involved in Eataly, the retail company
that's owned by a family over in Italy and

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:10.560
when Eataly, as a family, started to decide
to open one in New York as their first American

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:15.130
Eataly, they said we love these Italian brewers,
we love, you know, we get along really well

01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:21.870
with Sam even the owners of Eataly I hung
out with over there, they're like, "how about

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:25.810
you three open a brewery in this Eataly instead
of just having a real good craft beer program?"

01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:30.500
So, then, and Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich
their American partners, so that's when I

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:37.480
got to know them. But it mostly started with
a relationship with the Eataly family owners

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:41.130
and those two Italian brewers. And the one
we opened in Rome, I think it's the biggest

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:45.750
single retail location in the world, the store
in Rome just took over a giant train station

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:51.960
and we have a similarly sized brewery in the
one there. I really kind of helped, I kind

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:56.839
of oversaw the installation and vetting the
brewing equipment decisions here since I'm

01:08:56.839 --> 01:09:02.339
a lot closer and they're doing that for Rome.
It's a fun project.

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:09.790
&gt;&gt;male #6: So, what percent of beer batches
would you say don't make it past the testing

01:09:09.790 --> 01:09:11.980
phase at the brew pub?

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:18.130
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Um, let's see, um, we always
have a program where we're just kind of throwing

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:24.180
stuff against the walls to see what works
without a goal of considering it for potential

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:29.960
wide distribution. Those are just like fun,
creative flex your muscles, get input from

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:35.290
other brewers and make sure there's always
fun small batches that we only do at the pub.

01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:41.870
So a lot of them that we do at the pub are
never brewed with the intention of national

01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:49.850
distribution, they're one off, just fun. But
usually it is, I usually work on what I think

01:09:49.850 --> 01:10:01.090
would work well to come to market and there's
usually two or three test batches. We did,

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:08.810
you know, and sometimes they don't work, I
tell the story often about one we did with

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:16.800
wheat and lavender and peppercorns and there
was way too much lavender and the first comment

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:23.580
card from someone that bought it came back
and said it tastes like tongue kissing Laura

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.580
Ashley.
[Laughter]

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:28.860
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So there's another where
we did, a beer called Immort Ale, 11 percent

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:34.910
alcohol and aged on wood and the first comment
was, this was in '96 we were doing wood age,

01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:40.900
peat smoke and barley beers and some of them
were maybe ahead of their time and some of

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.230
them just sucked.
[Laughter]

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:48.960
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: We're doing one right now
that, I don’t think it's on tap right, yet,

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:56.520
but it's called Hot Thoup, T-H-O-U-P exclamation
point, and I got the idea for it when my nephew,

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:04.690
who's only like 3, my sister was buying, they
were buying a, they were getting a Labrador

01:11:04.690 --> 01:11:11.380
Retriever dog and they asked the kids what
they wanted to name the dog, they decided

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:17.510
on another name but the 3 year old kept saying,
"Hot thoup! Hot thoup!"

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:20.650
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: And they're like, "It's not

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:23.810
time to eat" and he's like, "No, doggie! Hot
thoup!"

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:25.930
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: So I laughed at that and

01:11:25.930 --> 01:11:29.460
I'm like, wait a second, you know, so we did
a beer with carrots and ginger that we think

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:39.989
would be really good soup, obviously used
a lot in soup recipes, but we got the fermentables

01:11:39.989 --> 01:11:45.450
from carrot juice, pure, unpasteurized carrot
juice and the beer has an awesome orange hue

01:11:45.450 --> 01:11:51.340
to it. Whether a beer called "Hot Thoup" made
with carrots is gonna sell, I don't know.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.020
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: The brewers aren't psyched

01:11:54.020 --> 01:12:00.180
about it. They don't wanna see us do thousands
of batches of Hot Thoup beer.

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.720
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: but that's one that I hope

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:03.720
people like.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:09.590
&gt;&gt;male #7: So, what actually is it about the
really large mass market that makes them taste

01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:11.210
so bad? Why is it?
[Laughter]

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:16.550
&gt;&gt;male #7: What practical part of the brewing
process is it that is difficult to scale up?

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:21.410
Cause everyone seems to agree that the small
microbreweries, craft breweries, have much

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:22.410
better beer.

01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:26.630
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Right, well, I mean, that's,
you know, the biggest breweries make some

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:31.660
of the most consistent, quality consistent
oriented beers in the world, that's how they

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:39.290
got to be the biggest breweries. I'm, I'm,
I'm a beer geek and I'm not a beer snob, I

01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:47.470
might not buy the beer from a giant brewery
but after mowing the lawn or after a hockey

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:54.100
game, I love an ice cold can of Labatt's and
I'll drink, I'll drink pretty much any beer

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:58.660
that's in someone's fridge if I'm having beers
that night and I'm at their house.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.739
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: But, the perception that

01:13:00.739 --> 01:13:07.340
the larger a brewery gets the less good their
beer is is a real challenge cause even a brewery

01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:13.940
of Dogfish's size has giant tanks, relatively
big tanks outside and we look, to the local

01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:17.110
community, like a big brewery and there's
other much smaller breweries within 100 miles

01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:23.960
of us but the danger becomes, you know, if
you go to the hardcore beer geek websites,

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:29.460
there's some unfortunate correlation between
the scale of a craft brewery and their perception

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:36.550
online. It's kind of that phenomena of no
one eats at that restaurant anymore, it's

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:40.180
too crowded. You know, where there's a reason
that restaurants crowded and it's cause a

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:50.750
lot of people like it and just cause an early
adaptor can't get in the door anymore to that

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:59.680
restaurant doesn't make that a bad restaurant.
But there is sort of a minority voice of hardcore

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:07.130
beer geeks that are always, you know, we also
excited for what's new but to be excited for

01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:12.330
what's new while still championing the breweries
that trail blazed on doing really exciting

01:14:12.330 --> 01:14:21.300
stuff is really important for our community
to stay healthy. And I'm sure you guys face

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.260
this in the tech world, too. If it's ubiquitous
and everywhere, it's suddenly less cool but

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:32.440
ubiquitous and everywhere in our industry,
you know, again, we're one fifteenth of one

01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:38.390
percent market share and we get some of that
backlash. So, you know, scale shouldn't play

01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:39.390
into it.

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:45.320
&gt;&gt;male #7: But are there actual problems in
the brewing process to make it bigger, like,

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:53.350
do you guys taste a little bit of it and adjust
things along the way, things that you just

01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:55.630
couldn’t do if you were-

01:14:55.630 --> 01:15:01.450
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Oh, scaling our batches,
you mean? Oh, I answered that question totally

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:02.450
wrong.
[Laughter]

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.760
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: But I'm glad I shared that
stuff.

01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.510
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Uh, yeah, we intentionally

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:15.920
go, we training wheel our beers, you know,
dog food them at our pub in five barrel, 10

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:23.670
keg batch to test that. We have a 10 gallon
batch that we can even test further just when

01:15:23.670 --> 01:15:28.610
we're trying to tweak one recipe in that but
we don't wanna do a bigger scale thing, we

01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:36.520
do a little tiny one. And then we jump up
to the 100 barrel brew house and now we're

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.420
building a 200 barrel next to the 100. So
we've got a nice, you know, litany of brew

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:42.120
houses of different scales to play around
with those recipes. And, yes, it's not, brewing

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:45.190
recipes are not just proportionally extrapolated
up, you know, you still tweak hops and barley

01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:46.340
and different things in different scale batches,
it doesn't all just go up equally, you know,

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340
when you scale the recipe.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.000
&gt;&gt;male #8: A lot of us here are engineers
so we're very concerned about efficiency.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.530
So, what's the highest alcohol percentage
beers that you

01:15:52.530 --> 01:15:53.530
[Laughter]

01:15:53.530 --> 01:16:00.670
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: The front part of your question,
I didn't know it was going in that direction.

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:01.670
[Laughter]

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.590
&gt;&gt;male #8: And that you've ever made.

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:10.650
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Right, we had a fun, back
and forth in the late '90s, early 2000s, I

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:18.830
guess, where we were in coastal Delaware and
it's pretty quite in that era, demand for

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:26.790
beers than what it is now so we spent a lot
of time working on how we can make beer stronger.

01:16:26.790 --> 01:16:29.930
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: by just learning, we used

01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:38.250
it as let's learn about yeast and, you know,
why aren't, you know, so we made a beer that

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:45.670
was 18 percent and that became the strongest
beer in the world, it was Triple Bock from

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:53.300
Boston Beer before that, we came out with
World Wide, then they came up with Millennium

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.690
and then we came out with, I don't know what
but we got out of the arms race.

01:16:56.690 --> 01:16:59.850
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: And we're still very proud

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:05.000
of our stronger beers for really holding all
the details, I brought Adam a seven year old

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.060
bottle of our World Wide Stout and beers that
are over nine percent alcohol, the most important

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:18.380
thing to say is these aren't meant to be like,
"Oh, it's strong I'm gonna da, da, da drink

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:31.780
way too much of it really fast, look at me."
And that happens on YouTube, you occasionally

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:42.280
see a person and it makes me cringe, nothing
makes me cringe more because these beers,

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:50.200
you know, a light Lager or light wheat beer,
light wheat ale takes about 10, 12 days to

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:57.900
brew, this beer doesn't even go into the bottle
till it's about 2 months so as an engineer

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:02.530
you'll appreciate this lack of efficiency
where we're tying up a tank that could have

01:18:02.530 --> 01:18:08.030
been turned over, you know, eight times, to
makes something like this and then we put

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:14.780
it on a shelf and now it's seven years old
before it was opened to share it with a friend.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:21.460
So, these beers are meant to be sipped and
savored and so we do, I think we do more volume

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.790
of beers and more styles of beers over, say,
11 percent alcohol then any brewery in the

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:29.700
country between 120 Minute, World Wide, Fort,
Old School Barleywine, so we're always, we're

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:36.460
very considerate of that yeast process and
we, I think we're still at the point where

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.000
our quality control department is larger in
people than our sales are in the field sales

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.380
people. And the last question here?

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:46.719
&gt;&gt;male #9: Musicians can be very influenced
by other musicians. How much would you say

01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:51.900
you're influenced by other breweries and what
other people are doing versus just stuff you're

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.969
coming up with purely on your own?

01:18:53.969 --> 01:18:59.320
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Um, I'm definitely spurred
on by the passion of other brewers and I'm

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:04.800
really proud of the collaborations that we've
done with the brewers that we've done. That

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:17.340
beer, Extreme Brewing, that some of you got
tonight, the recipe's from all kinds of amazing

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:22.560
breweries, from Allagash to the Brewery, from
Shorts to Portsmouth Brewing. So many breweries

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:24.850
excite me and inspire me but what I really
try not to do is be, like, is take what they're

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:27.800
doing and somehow absorb it into something
that we're gonna do. So we only advertise

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:36.370
in beer geek publications and, frankly, I
never read them. If they're doing an interview

01:19:36.370 --> 01:19:46.239
I'm really proud to be part of it cause I'm
doing it to support the industry that supports

01:19:46.239 --> 01:19:58.250
us but I also really don't wanna be influenced
by what else is already happening cause our,

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:07.320
our approach at Dogfish is really there's
no use in doing what's already been done.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:13.450
So in the case of, okay, Sam you're a hypocrite
the volume of what you sell, your biggest

01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:19.050
selling beer is an IPA, that's an established
style, and that might be fair but we try to,

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:21.360
we came up with a very unique hopping approach
where instead of just one or two or three

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.360
big additions, we dose continually for 60
minutes in small volumes equally, or 90 minutes

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.360
or whatever. So that was our way into an existing
style that allowed us to still approach, you

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:27.210
know, from an off centered perspective and
kind of put our little thumb print on at least

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:31.940
what we do. So, I really love seeing breweries
that are going for it. Probably my favorites

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.600
are just the other ones like us that are,
you know, brewing outside the Reinheitsgebot

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:42.410
box type thing. So, I won't say their names
but that's kind of the ones that I'm psyched

01:20:42.410 --> 01:20:46.370
for and then, of course, the first generation
brewers like Ken Grossman from Sierra, Nevada

01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:49.210
who I kind of recognize as a real patriarch
of our movement, Anchor Brewery was a little

01:20:49.210 --> 01:20:50.830
bit earlier and deserves mad props but that
was taking over an existing, but ailing, regional

01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:53.410
brewery that never went out of business. Ken
Grossman's the first guy that kind of was

01:20:53.410 --> 01:21:00.610
a bike repairman, sat down with a drill, built
his own mash tun, started in a room this big,

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:03.060
so for me that was really the starting point
of our movement.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.280
&gt;&gt;male #9: Thank you very much.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:09.350
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Wow, this has been fun. I've
learned a lot.

01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:11.590
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: I should sit now.

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.840
&gt;&gt;male #10: Thank you so much, really appreciate
it.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.000
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: This is great.
[Applause]

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.890
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: Thank you Keith, thank you
Cameron.

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:22.410
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Sam Calagione: You forgot your beer.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:22.770
[Applause]
