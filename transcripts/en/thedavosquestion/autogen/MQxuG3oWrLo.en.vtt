to press for the nuclear energy I don't

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189
to press for the nuclear energy I don't
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310
to press for the nuclear energy I don't
think the nuclear energy is a renewable

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
think the nuclear energy is a renewable
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.750

energy to jump out of the fossil fuel we

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
energy to jump out of the fossil fuel we
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.599
energy to jump out of the fossil fuel we
really have to go into the renewable

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
really have to go into the renewable
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600
really have to go into the renewable
issues and all the government all the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
issues and all the government all the
