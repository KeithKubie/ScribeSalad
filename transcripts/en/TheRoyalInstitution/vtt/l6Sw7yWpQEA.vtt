00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
I'm going to show you an effect
of quantum physics, which

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.980
is currently being investigated
to actually include

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.200
in computers.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.040
Now, what Ilya is
bringing on is a tray

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.750
containing something
called a high-temperature

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.130
superconductor.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.160
That's that grey
blob in the middle.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.560
But the high-temperature
superconductor

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
only behaves as a superconductor
at very low temperatures.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.060
That's why he's poured in
liquid nitrogen into this.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.620
Because what happens
is as follows.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.540
As you lower the temperature
of the superconductor,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.080
the electrons in the
material get a chance

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.770
to actually act as a crowd.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.260
Usually they're kind of
to being buffeted around

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.540
by the other atoms
in the material.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.880
But when you lower things
down in temperature,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.380
they can act as a crowd.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.920
In fact, what they do, and
hence the word superconductor,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.730
is that this crowd
is so strong that it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.650
can kind of march
through the material

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.300
without any resistance.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.880
In fact, that's the key.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.230
There's no resistance.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.004
It's a superconductor.

00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:07.540
And we're going to see
what the effect of that is.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.600
Because if there are electrons
marching around as a group,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.140
that's actually like a current.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.940
And the current gives
rise to magnetic field.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.380
So I'm going to put
on these goggles.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.540
I'm actually going
to check out what

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
magnetic field and whether
there's a magnetic field coming

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.130
out of this material
and therefore,

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.380
if it's acting as
a superconductor.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.920
What I'm taking here
is a tiny magnet

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.700
that I'm actually going to place
on top of the superconductor.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.940
Oh, although, I tried
to place it on top,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.940
and it's actually floating.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.660
Now, this is bizarre.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.310
But that's what you get
in the quantum world.
