That's the only thing. He came to LA with me. I just had this blue. I had this blue Whoa Mustang. I bought about 150 to drive to LA, a hunting $50 car drill tail all the way to LA. Wow. You know, I was determined to get out there and get me some of that money.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Leaked all the transmission fluid. I had to get out every 200 miles to fill the car back up with all and transmission fluid every 200 miles on a mouse. I bet that night man, Oh, Oh. You hear this shit and it's donating only light. You see headlights on the car. I've got at that point got, I'm going to stick. I had to stick with me and put your head little funnel. Put that all in that car looking around. You know I'll be doing, yeah. Uh huh. And got to California. No, I actually went to the Las Vegas person. I'm fucked. You got stuck. I got stuck in LA. He told me about that. What happened? That blew his money. I had a guy tell me to keep this thing in front of you. Can you grab that? Oh, here. Yeah. Tell me my friend, he rich boy. He said, look, just go to go to Las Vegas per se with the comics are doing.

Speaker 1:          05:12          Then you go to LA di, you know what they're doing and they get, that's the comics. They work in Las Vegas all the time. I went there, the old ass joke, Jewish joke. They planned to tell it and, but gay Kaplan, this old, funny big head look. Ain't funny. He's a good actor, but he, he was, I waste all my time. He told me stay there half an hour. I mean halfway half of 30 days, stay there. So I paid up my rent for 30 days and I went that night I met my new man Navy suit on him and shot up his, I can beat boy Marlene close. You know what I mean? Standing around, you know, had a big old Afro man. I lost every dime I had at that fucking horseshoe casino. I was, I went back home crying. So now I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do here.

Speaker 1:          06:03          I didn't, I drove two and a half days across the country and so I, I called people in Detroit, try get some money, but you know when you call them, you don't always wait. Hey, nobody got no money. People don't answer the phone. They say, Oh no, I ain't got no money. So I got some more borrow money from some of my friends in the state. Had to stay there for six months till I got no money to go to LA. Well you said that then you tell me that you hit, you did one of the slot machines in it. It hit with Adoree grant. I had $150 left. I saw Donna Rose. See what I would do, I would go at night and during the weekend, during the weekend mean you can go to the front of the uh, casinos and the guy in the front day say, I'm a comic.

Speaker 1:          06:45          I just want to sit in the back here and watch some the comic and I'm gone. They, they let you do that. Just sit there and wait to anybody. Nobody's sitting there. They've got 2000 seats in little places, something like that. So I had a dollar and a half left. I saw down. And Ross, he had a great show. So on the outlay, I said, I'm gonna play this fucking money. I just just be broke. My check is coming from the unemployment. Uh, it'd be here another day or two. I can go without food for a day.

Speaker 1:          07:14          Most of them. I said, burglar, you better put some down here, n****r. Yes. So I put that money in the machine. It rung up, I think it was 7,000 rarely. Yeah. I thought I fucked up something. Oh shit. Now what have I done? The guy came, well, he said, I just got on jobs. Just hold on, sir. I just got here. You had struck the jackpot today. Hustle jackpot. I, he gay. He came and just put them $100 in my hand. It was like a miracle. Even like, like Moses came down to hand me some money or something. They was so damn, that money felt so good. I went home and pack my stuff. I had about two more days on my rent. I got in that car, I got me some gas, Joe, you know how they have in Vegas? They got the little Island in the middle of the street, drove over that damn thing, going back, going the opposite direction.
