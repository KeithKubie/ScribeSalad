00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.698
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we have the linear equation,

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:07.698
y = 1/2x - 3.

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:13.077
So if we wanted to draw
the line that represents

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:16.560
the set of all points, all the
coordinates where the x value

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.743
and the y value satisfy this equation,

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:20.438
we could start off by just trying to draw,

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:23.990
by trying to draw a few of those points,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.591
and then connecting them with a line.

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:30.584
Let's set up a little table here x, y.

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:32.906
And we can just try a
couple of x values here,

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:35.878
then figure out what the
corresponding y values are.

00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:37.304
I'm going to pick x
values where it's going

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:39.175
to be fairly easy to
calculate the y values.

00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:41.846
Let's say when x is equal to zero,

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:44.144
then you're gonna have 1/2 x 0 - 3,

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.930
well then y is going to be -3.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.785
When x is, let me try x
= 2, because then 1/2 x 2

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:52.387
is just gonna be 1.

00:00:52.387 --> 00:00:55.184
So when x = 2, you're going to have

00:00:55.184 --> 00:01:00.184
1/2 x 2 = 1, -3 is -2.

00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:04.925
When x is equal to, let's try 4.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:09.925
So 1/2 x 4 is 2, and then -3 is -1,

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:14.375
and we could keep going but actually

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.674
all we need is two points for a line.

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:18.996
So we're ready to plot
this line if we'd like.

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:22.293
The point 0, -3 is on this line.

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:25.822
0, -3 and actually let me do
this in a slightly darker color

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:27.762
so that we can see it on
this white background.

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:32.091
0, -3 is on the line,
2, -2 is on the line.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:37.091
So 2, -2 and then we have 4, -1.

00:01:38.175 --> 00:01:42.006
So when x is 4, y is -1,

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:47.006
and I could draw a line
that connects all of these

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.831
so it would look something like...

00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:51.688
If I, let's see if I could do this.

00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:54.219
It would look something like,

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.219
it would something like, like that.

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:01.765
So this right over
here, this is literally,

00:02:01.765 --> 00:02:06.765
this is the graph of y = 1/2x - 3.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.006
Now when we look at a graph like this

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:13.839
an interesting thing that
we might want to ask ourself

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:18.228
is where does the graph
intersect our axes?

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:19.621
So first we can say, well where does

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.237
in intersect our x-axis?

00:02:22.237 --> 00:02:23.472
When you look at this, it looks like

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:26.212
it happens at this point right over here.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:30.159
This point where a
graph intersects an axes

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.924
this is called an intercept.

00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:35.917
This one in particular is
called the x-intercept.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:37.612
Why is it called the x-intercept?

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:38.820
Because that's where the graph

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.768
is intersecting the x-axis

00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:44.067
and the x-intercept, it looks like

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:47.898
this is at the .6, 0.

00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:49.520
Now it's very interesting, the x-intercept

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.846
happens when y = 0.

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:53.587
Remember, you're on the x-axis when

00:02:53.587 --> 00:02:56.884
you haven't moved up
or down from that axis

00:02:56.884 --> 00:02:58.927
which means y = 0.

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:02.828
So your x-intercept
happens at x = 6, y = 0.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.082
It's this coordinate.

00:03:04.082 --> 00:03:06.009
Now what about the y-intercept?

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.285
Well the y-intercept is
this point right over here.

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.467
This is where you intersect or I guess

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:13.462
you could say intercept the y-axis.

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:16.365
So this right over here, that over there

00:03:16.365 --> 00:03:19.128
is the y-intercept.

00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:21.705
The y-intercept is at the coordinate

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:24.329
that has a 0 for the x-coordinate.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.696
X is 0 here and y is -3.

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:30.157
X is 0 and y is -3.

00:03:30.157 --> 00:03:31.736
This was actually one of the points,

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:36.426
or one of the pairs
that we first tried out.

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:40.327
You can validate that 6,
0 satisfies this equation

00:03:40.327 --> 00:03:41.093
right over here.

00:03:41.093 --> 00:03:46.093
If x is 6, 1/2 x 6 is 3,
-3 is indeed equal to 0.

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:49.080
So now that we know
what an x-intercept is,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.006
it's the point where a
graph intersects the x-axis

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:54.514
or intercepts the x-axis
and the y-intercept

00:03:54.514 --> 00:03:58.282
is the point where a graph
intercepts the y-axis

00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:00.152
or intersects the y-axis.

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:01.777
Let's try to see if we can
find the x and y-intercepts

00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:05.562
for a few other linear equations.

00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:09.172
So let's say that I had
the linear equation.

00:04:09.172 --> 00:04:14.172
Let's say that I have 5x + 6y = 30.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.722
I encourage you to pause this video,

00:04:21.722 --> 00:04:24.578
and figure out what are
the x and y-intercepts

00:04:24.578 --> 00:04:27.620
for the graph that
represents the solutions,

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.312
all the xy pairs that
satisfy this equation.

00:04:31.312 --> 00:04:33.680
Well the easiest thing to do here,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.680
let's see what the y value is when x = 0

00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:42.201
and what x value is when y = 0.

00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:46.590
When x = 0 this becomes 6y = 30.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.354
So 6 times what is 30?

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.955
Well y would be equal to 5 here.

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:54.090
So when x is 0, y is 5.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.808
What about when y is 0?

00:04:55.808 --> 00:04:57.990
Well when y is 0, that's going to be 0,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.964
and you have 5x = 30.

00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:02.332
Well then x would be equal to 6.

00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:05.072
Then x would be equal to 6.

00:05:05.072 --> 00:05:08.462
So we could plot those points, 0, 5.

00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:12.084
When x is 0, y is 5.

00:05:12.084 --> 00:05:16.496
When x is 6, y is 0.

00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:20.490
So those are both points on this graph

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.958
and then the actual graph is going to,

00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.662
or the actual line that
represents the x and y pairs

00:05:26.662 --> 00:05:30.288
that satisfy this equation
is going to look like,

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.749
it's going to look like this.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.630
I'll just try.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.577
So I can make it go, it's
going to look like...

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:41.195
It's going to go through those two points.

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:44.126
So it going to...I can make
it go the other way too.

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:45.404
Let me see.

00:05:45.404 --> 00:05:48.004
It's going to go through those two points

00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:51.549
and so it's going to
look something like that.

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:54.451
Now what are its' x and y-intercepts?

00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:55.774
Well, we already kind of figured it out

00:05:55.774 --> 00:05:56.889
but the intercepts themselves,

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.979
these are the points on the graph where

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.231
they intersect the axes.

00:06:01.231 --> 00:06:03.669
So this right over here,
this is the y-intercept.

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.293
That point is the y-intercept

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:08.684
and it happens, it's
always going to happen

00:06:08.684 --> 00:06:13.491
when x = 0, and when x
= 0 we know that y = 5.

00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:15.859
It's that point, the point 0, 5.

00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:19.272
And what is the y inter...what
is the x-intercept?

00:06:19.272 --> 00:06:21.246
The x-intercept is the
point, it's actually

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:25.077
the same x-intercept for this
equation right over here.

00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:30.077
It's the point 6, 0. That
point right over there.
