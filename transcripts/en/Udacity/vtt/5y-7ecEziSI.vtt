00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.300
Now, when talking about the end-to-end argument, it

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.610
is worth remembering that the end-to-end argument is

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.560
just that. It's an argument. Not a theorem,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.660
or a principle, or a law. And there are

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.375
many things that have come to violate the

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:18.100
end-to-end principle. Network address translators, which we'll talk about

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.340
in the next lesson, violate the end-to-end argument.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.560
VPN tunnels, which tunnel traffic between intermediate points on

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.860
a network, violate the end-to-end argument. Sometimes

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.170
TCP connections are split at an intermediate

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.130
node along an end-to-end path, particularly when

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340
the last hop of the end-to-end path is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.688
wireless. This is sometimes done to improve

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:44.090
the performance of the connection because loss on

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.439
the last hop lossy wireless hop may

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:50.894
not necessarily reflect congestion, and we don't necessarily

00:00:50.894 --> 00:00:53.486
want TCP to react to losses that are not

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:57.462
congested related. Even spam, in some sense, is a violation

00:00:57.462 --> 00:01:00.182
of the end to end argument. For e-mail the end

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:03.080
user is generally considered to be a human, and by

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.116
the end to end argument, the network should deliver

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:08.890
all mail to the user. Does this mean that spam

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.350
control mechanisms are in violation of end to end and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.920
if so are these violations appropriate? What about peer to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.570
peer systems? Where files are exchanged between

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.020
two nodes on the Internet but are assembled

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.880
in chunks that are often traded among

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.250
peers. What about caches, and in-network aggregation? So,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.900
when considering the end to end argument,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.860
it's worth asking whether or not the argument

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.200
is still valid today. And, in what cases.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.840
There are questions about what's in versus out,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.980
certainly. And, what functions belong in the dumb

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.210
minimal network. For example, routing is currently in

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.250
the dumb minimal network, do we really believe

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.204
that it belongs. What about multicast? Mobility quality of

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:56.575
service. What about NAT's, and it's worth considering

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.875
whether the end to end argument is constraining innovation

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:02.779
of the infrastructure by preventing us from putting

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:05.947
some of the more interesting or helpful functions inside

00:02:05.947 --> 00:02:08.228
the network. In the third course,

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:11.252
we will talk about software defined networking,

00:02:11.252 --> 00:02:15.580
which in some sense reverses many aspects of this end to end argument.
