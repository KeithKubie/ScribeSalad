00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The correct answer are it ignores measurements and will likely fail.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It ignores measurements, because the measurement sets the weighting factor

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in this resampling process, but with only 1 particle

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the same particle will be resampled no matter what.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So the chances of the particle to be resampled is 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Therefore, it's independent of the actual measurement.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The robot truly ignores the measurements.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because it ignores the measurements, it'll likely fail, so works fine is incorrect.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For ignoring robot motion--that's not the case.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Even a single particle can be sampled forward.

00:00:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So these are the two correct answers over here.
