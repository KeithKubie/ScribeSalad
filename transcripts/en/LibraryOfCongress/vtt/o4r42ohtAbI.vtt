00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.470
[ Foreign language ]

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: Welcome,
we are very pleased

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.980
to have you here this evening
for this wonderful event.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.890
The first week of Italian Cuisine
in the World, so very exciting.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.650
And we are very pleased to have
two wonderful food historians

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.800
and chefs here.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.180
Before I introduce them, I
would like to talk a little bit

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.870
about the Italian collections
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.910
We have 450,000 items across
divisions in our collections.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.280
So it's quite a huge collection.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.140
And for Italian cooking,
I counted 1,900 books,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.260
for Italian cooking alone.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.500
So we have a small display outside.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.780
It shows a range of books
in our general collections.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.150
But one of these days, we
will also have a nice exhibit

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.170
of our rare books and
special collections.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.030
So I am Lucia Wolf.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.510
I work at the European division.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.960
I am responsible for the
Italian collections, of course.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.470
And also of Malta, Vaticano, San
Marino, and Italian-Switzerland.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.540
So those are my fields.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.860
If you ever have some
questions, please come and see me.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.720
Anybody can request and use our
books at the Library of Congress.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.590
So we're happy to be here
and to help you all out.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.600
But let's introduce our speakers.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.220
So, Domenica Marchetti.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.770
Domenica Marchetti grew
up in an Italian family.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.460
Her mother is from
Chieti, in Abruzzo.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.740
And of her family, Domenica
says, "At the dinner table,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.630
we spent more time talking about
what we should eat the next day,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.070
rather than politics and
the news of the day."

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.130
I can relate, being Italian.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.560
But I have to say that I had some
of my best political discussions

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.320 position:56%
with my father, at the dinner table.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.550
Domenica refers to
another experience.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.520
She says that her mother had her
sister and her shaping gnocchi

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.480
and ravioli by the time they could
see over the kitchen counter.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.810
This too, is a very common
experience in Italian families.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.650
Domenica graduated from
Columbia's School of Journalism.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.980
Started her career as
a newspaper reporter.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.500
And wrote about a lot of topics,
until she realized that writing

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.680
about Italian food was her calling.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.570
Her recipes and articles on
Italian cuisine are featured

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.280
in many national publications.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.820
Including <i>Cooking Light</i>,
<i>Fine Cooking</i>, <i>Food and Wine</i>,

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.120
<i>The Chicago Tribune</i>,
<i>The Washington Post</i>,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.040
and the list goes on and on.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.930 position:56%
So she is the author of seven books,
which we do have, I am happy to say,

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.080
in our collections at the Library.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.260
<i>Preserving Italy:
Canning, Curing, Infusing,</i>

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.080
<i>and Bottling Italian Flavors</i>

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.610
<i>and Traditions</i> is
her latest book, 2016.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.040
Thank you, Connie, for
bringing her personal copy over,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.630
because I had trouble
getting, requesting the book.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.130
<i>Ciao Biscotti</i>.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.770
<i>The Glorious Vegetables of Italy</i>.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.860
<i>The Glorious Pasta of Italy</i>.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.730
<i>Williams-Sonoma, Rustic

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.290
<i>Authentic Recipes

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.790 position:56%
<i>Big Night In: More Than 100

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.850
<i>and Friends Italian-Style</i>.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.090
And <i>The Glorious Soups
and Stews of Italy</i>.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.860
To learn more about Domenica,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.390
you can refer to her
blog, domenicacooks.com.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.030
Now for Amy Riolo.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.520
Amy Riolo is no stranger
to the Library of Congress.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.570
She has been here on various
occasions for various lectures.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.590
But, for those who do not know
about Amy, she is an award-winning,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.010
best-selling author, chef,
television personality.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.550
And in this case, too,
it goes on and on.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.770
I wouldn't have enough
time to talk about all

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.740
of Amy's achievements here.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.200
Amy comes from an American
family, originally from Calabria.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.310
Calabria is Southern Italy, the
tip of the boot, I like saying.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.760
So you guys have an
idea where that is.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.130
She graduated from
Cornell University.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.810
And set out to become one of the
most respected culinary diplomats

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.540
and advocates of the
Mediterranean diet.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.010
Her most recent book, <i>The Italian
Diabetes Cookbook</i> was released

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:23.040
on January, 2016, and is in our
display, among other books by Amy.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.310
Among them, <i>The Ultimate
Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</i>.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.770
<i>The Mediterranean
Diabetes Cookbook</i>.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.170
<i>Nile Style: Egyptian
Cuisine and Culture</i>.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.470
<i>Arabian Delights: Recipes &amp;
Princely Entertaining Ideas</i>

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.410
<i>from the Arabian Peninsula</i>.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.920
She makes -- Amy makes
frequent appearances

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.230
on many television
and radio programs.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.710
Including <i>Fox TV, ABC,
CBS, NBC, Nile TV</i>,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.320
and <i>Abu Dhabi Television</i>.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.020
She was in Morocco,
just before coming here.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.320
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.620
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: Yes.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.920
Her delicious recipes
grace the pages

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.200
of many newspapers and magazines.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.570
Including, <i>USA Today, Cooking
Light, The Washington Post,</i>

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.370
<i>CNN.com</i>, and <i>The
Wall Street Journal</i>.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.350
Again, the list goes on and on.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.480
If you would like to learn
more about Amy, her blog,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.150
amyriolo.com is full of interesting
information and wonderful recipes.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.570
Such as her mouthwatering
mussels and tomato saffron broth.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.150
That made me want to get
up and make it last Sunday.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.570
So it is impossible for
me to say more about Amy's

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.680
and Domenica's achievements
in such a brief introduction.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.080
And I will let the speakers
do it for themselves.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.480
And now to Domenica
Marchetti and Amy Riolo.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.280
Enjoy.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.950
[ Applause ]

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.250
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
Hi, thank you.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.690
Thank you, Lucia, for that
that lovely introduction.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.630
Hi everyone, thanks so much
for joining us this evening.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.950
I was contacted by Renato,
from the Italian Embassy,

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.750
to speak about Italian food.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.060
Which is a subject near
and dear to my heart.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.830
I have seven books
on Italian cooking.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.660
So it's something I think
about pretty much 24-7.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.270
And I was thinking about
the theme of this week,

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.010
Italian Food in the World.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.270
Italian Cuisine in the World.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.020
And so I'm just going to give
you a little bit of an overview

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.140
on my thoughts on that subject.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.480
And then Amy has prepared a
wonderful PowerPoint presentation

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.780
for us.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.820
I was thinking about my most
recent book, <i>Preserving Italy</i>.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.500
And the double entendre is
definitely on purpose there,

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.920
in the title of the book.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.900
On the surface, it's a book

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.240
about Italian preserving
traditions in the kitchen.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.460
[ Foreign Language ]

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.750
So foods preserved in oil,
foods preserved in vinegar.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.300
Marmalade's, jams, fruit
pastes, syrups, liquors.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.600
Everything from those things
to fresh cheeses and salami.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.590
Because if you think of the Italian
table, so many foods that come

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.590
to the Italian table, are
foods that have been preserved.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.510
Preserving the bounty
of Italian ingredients.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.780
And even if you're not Italian,
chances are, you are familiar

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.110
with most of these foods.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.070
If you go to just about
any supermarket these days,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.230
you will find jars of Giardiniera.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:39.210 position:56%
Or roasted peppers, or, pancetta and
guanciale in the deli department.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.300
When I was growing up,
these things were not quite

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.620
as common as they are now.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.700 position:56%
But they are pretty much everywhere.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.530
But beyond that, the book is also
about preserving these traditions.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.600
These ways, these food ways,
these ways of these techniques.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.400
And, you know, the world is
ever-changing, Italy is changing.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.290
And so it was important to me, as
somebody who loves Italian cuisine,

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.410
to try to maybe bottle
some of these recipes

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.090
and old traditions in this book.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.580
I have to say, though, ultimately,
it's a kind of a futile endeavor,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.870
because food is always evolving.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.400
Cuisine is always evolving.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.840
And when you think about
Italian food in the world,

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.410
you know, you really do see that.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.740
And the more I thought
about this subject,

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.970
the more I realized
that Italian food.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.000
Or the food of the
peninsula, I should say,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.860
before there was an Italy.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.960
There's always been the food of the
Italian peninsula out in the world.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.530 position:56%
Whether it was through the spread of
the Roman Empire, to food traditions

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.460
that traveled to France
with Caterina de' Medici.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.810
And also the foods that Thomas
Jefferson introduced to the U.S.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.640
after traveling to Italy.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.060
Including pasta, or
macaroni, gelato, ice cream,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.760
and even rice he brought back.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.440
Nowadays, we have chefs who,
you know, even here in D.C.,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.780
who travel to Italy in
search of authentic recipes.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.040
And they bring them back to their
own restaurants here in the U.S.,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.220
and elsewhere in the world.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.520
So that's a little
bit of an overview

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.420
about Italian food in the world.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.280
But, as I was thinking of
the subject, I thought,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.540
you know, it's not just that.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.810
If you turn it around, you
have the world in Italian food,

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.980
or the world of Italian food.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.600
And so that's kind of looking at
things in a different perspective.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.660
There's always been a
cross-cultural influences

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.030
in what we broadly refer
to as Italian cuisine.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.050
Whether this is a result
of war, invasion, religion,

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.140
migration, travel, and so on.

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.350
So, you know, you think
about Sicilian food.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.400
And the influence of
Arab and African culture

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.230
and ingredients on
the food of Sicily.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.470
And you think of the New World,
and the ingredients brought

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.410
from the New World back to Italy.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.010
Potatoes, peppers, tomatoes.

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.870
I mean, to me, the aroma of roasted
peppers is the aroma of Italy.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.640
But, of course, and you know,
in the history of the world,

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.520
peppers are a pretty recent
introduction into the cuisine

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.500
of the Italian Peninsula.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:22.050
So, and in the 18th
and 19th century,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.160
we had the so-called
British invasion of Italy.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.440
Where a lot of British people you
know, the poets, the romantics,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.560
moved to Italy, wrote about
the Italian landscape.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.400
And they brought with them,
things like roast beef.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.160 position:56%
So even today, if you go to Tuscany,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.060
you can find in the
trattorias, roast beef.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:47.610
Which is, basically, you know, the
Tuscan variation of a British food.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.250
So all of these things were kind
of rolling around in my head.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.440
And it's a very complex
subject, as we know.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.670
And, as I was thinking of it,
I thought of my friend Amy,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.210
who is a food historian
and a cookbook author.

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.300
And just a really a
font of knowledge

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.900
on the history of Italian cuisine.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.410
So I asked her to come with me
and delve into this subject today.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.200
And she's prepared a wonderful
PowerPoint, which we're going

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.330
to kind of get into slide by slide.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.260
And talk a little bit about the
evolution of Italian cuisine,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.120
from the beginning to now.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.590
And also kind of look
back at the evolution of,

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.060
or how world cuisine has
influenced the food of Italy.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.840 position:56%
So without further ado, I'd like to,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.920
for us to get started
on the PowerPoint.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.590
Please, we will be taking
questions afterward.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:34.910
We'd love to hear your perspective.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:36.730
We'd love to hear your comments.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.030
Your own experiences.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.670
You know, whether Italian or not,
I think pretty much everybody

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.100
in the world loves Italian food.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.670 position:56%
So, and everybody has an opinion
about it -- an opinion about it too.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.480
So, okay, Amy, come on over.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.890
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Thank
you so much, Domenica.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:54.570
Thank you all so much for
coming this afternoon.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.900
What a huge pleasure and honor
it is to have all of you here.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.680
As I look around, I see
a lot of familiar faces.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.890
Some of you from prominent
Italian organizations, the Embassy.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.130
Others, really important
Italian restaurants.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.920
And other restaurant's
chefs here with us today.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.580
And people from the Library of
Congress, who I've known for years.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.740
So it's great to be
in such good company.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.770 position:56%
And I'm really grateful to Domenica.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.700
And we've worked together for
years now, on different topics.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.000
And doing different discussions

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.050
for the National Italian American
Foundation, for [foreign word].

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.250
For different things
that we work with.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.840
And, if there's no other take
away than anything else today.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.230
What I would like for everybody
to remember, is that there is room

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.940
for more than one Italian.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.750
Because, you know, as an Italian,
or as an Italian American,

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.100
in any field, there is one box.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.210
And if it's filled, if Domenica
is doing it, I'm not doing it.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.510 position:56%
If I'm doing it, she's not doing it.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.810
Or vice versa.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.120
So there's so much to say, as
you're going to see, you know,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.420
on the topic of Italian cuisine.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.680
That there could be 50
of us, 5,000 of us here,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.380
and we would all have
something unique to say.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.680
And I thought of that last night,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.980
because we were talking
a little bit about today.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.870
And I said, you know, we're talking
about a very unique, niche topic.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.330
She has a complete
different view than me.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.460 position:56%
We're Italian American, we're women,
we're authors, but very different.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.230
So that's the first thing I'd
like to say, before we start.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.910
And the other thing is,
this is a very large topic.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.380
I'll start teaching a series in
January, every Tuesday evening.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.060
I'll teach an Italian culinary
appreciation certification series

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.420
at L'Academie de Cuisine,
in Bethesda.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.180
But it will take even more
than that one semester to talk.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:23.270
So please don't hate us if we
left out your favorite topic.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.000 position:56%
We can -- we'll address it in a Q&amp;A.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.740
So here are some things, if
anybody's on the Internet,

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.140 position:56%
and would like to use some hashtags.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.020
November 16th, officially,
is the start off

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.870
of the Italian Cuisine
in the World week.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.140
So feel free to use that hashtag,
since this is the first one.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.440
We've been trying to
get some traction

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.140
and make this a really
popular event.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.700
These are all of our handles.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.590
And then, a couple of fun facts.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.780
Italian food is now the
number one in the cuisine

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.670
in U.S. and in the world.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.240
More pizza is eaten per capita,
in the U.S., than in Italy.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.400
And pizzas served to Americans
on July 4th, in troops overseas.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.170
Italian food, of course, is
also the most misrepresented

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.470
and misunderstood in the world.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:05.980
So we're going to talk
a little bit about that.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.710
Made in Italy labeling,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.010
the geographic indicators
are very, very important.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.740
For that reason, we'll
talk about those.

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.630
And only a third of the
Italian foods that are eaten

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:18.060
in the world actually
come from Italy.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.200
So we're going to discuss
the history of Italian food.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.430
Some cultural events that
influenced the cuisine.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.200
We'll also talk about
Italian cuisine today,

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.030
and its influence in the world.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.110
So I'm going to start
back with the 8th century,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.410
before the Common Era,
[foreign word].

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.730
So this is my ancestral
homeland of Calabria,

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.140
specifically the town of Crotone.

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.220
And in Calabria and in Lucania,
the neighboring Lucania,

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.130
they had something called lagane.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.050
Which were the original pasta.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.070
So many, many centuries before
the Etruscans had pasta,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.370
and people were starting
their theories

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.860
about Marco Polo and
things like that.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:53.160
We had lagane in some of the first
indigenous settlements in Italy.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.920
That's the Temple of
Hera that you see,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.450
and this is Pythagoras, down below.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.400
Because they both had places
Crotone, believe it or not.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.950 position:56%
All of southern Italy, at this
time, was very important for Greece.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:04.250
It was called the [foreign word].

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:08.480 position:56%
And so a lot of famous foods came
from Greece, and went back to Greece

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.060
at that very, very early age.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.640
In addition to what was
already found there.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.770
And these pasta, this type
of past that's called lagane,

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.430
you can still find around today.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.010
As Domenica mentioned, people are
trying to preserve some recipes.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.820
And there are movements taking
place to preserve these recipes.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.890
Lagane comes from the
Greek word lagana,

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.500
which was a bread eaten
on Clean Monday.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.110
And so this idea of paste, or
dough, came over into Calabria,

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.010
and we started using that.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.600 position:56%
Then if we go into Rome, and we
look at places like Hadrian's Villa,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.340
and what the emperors were doing.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.010
We get a very good
glimpse into, you know,

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.020
quote Italian food culture,
very, very early on.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.680
Because the Romans were
great purveyors of food.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.830
And they really wanted
the best of everything.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.770
So they would send fleets out
into North Africa and into China,

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.680
bringing back the best
spices from China.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.090
They wanted the best shrimp,
from just the right time,

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.790
from the catch off
the shore of Libya.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.120
They had people tracking these
things so that they knew.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.140
They were great, great
purveyors of food, from early on.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.090
And here on the left,
we see Hadrian's Villa.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:10.110
And then, on the right, we can see
the Temple of Karnak, in Egypt.

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.100
So there was a lot of synergy
back then between ancient Egypt,

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.660
ancient Greece, and ancient Rome.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.900
Here are some, an example
from 180 of the Common Era.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.970
We can see what the trade
routes looked like then.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.540
So, you know, for people
who thinking,

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.590
we don't have transport,
people were landlocked.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:27.750
They didn't have the
globalization that we have today.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.550
This is how much influx
they had going and coming.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.010
Already, at that, time
the food was a fusion.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.400
And then we talk about
some different things,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.200
and really the development
of early Italian cooking.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.720
We can talk about Apicius.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.880
So Apicius was a Roman philosopher.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.720
He wrote the first cookbook that
we know about, in the west called,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.410
<i>De re Culinaria</i>, or <i>On Cooking</i>.

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.150
And this cookbook is
still around today.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.060
You can see are different
types of it.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.610
It's also been translated.

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:57.660
And Apicius was a poor philosopher.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.960
He loved food.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.270
He was a great, like, [foreign
word], as we say in Italian.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.570
But he couldn't afford
what his pallet.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.600
He had the pallet of an emperor,
but the budget of a philosopher.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.930
So he actually committed suicide,
because he couldn't afford

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.230
to eat the way he wanted.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.860
So he is believed to be the
father of all gourmands and chefs.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.700
We all admire him and
revere him for this reason.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.680
But, in Apicius' cookbook, he
wrote about a lot of things

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.980
from a lot of different places.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.490
And one of the things he
wrote about was Numidia,

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.350
and this place called
Numidia Quadrata.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.410
If any of you remember
taking the metro in Rome,

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.470
you might know there's a stop on
the Metro, called Numidia Quadrata.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.340
And it refers to this place,
which you see over on the right.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.940
It's the square area, from
Rome south, into North Africa,

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.300
which was Roman territory.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.530
So this was the breadbasket
for the Romans.

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.510
And with the wheat and different
ingredients that they got there,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.120
those were currency, an antiquity.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.820
So they could trade and they could
fund the entire Roman Empire,

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.390
all the way up to Great Britain,

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.600
just from what came out
of Numidia Quadrata.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.510
So this was like the
administrative capital.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.860
And when I was in Morocco, I
just came back Saturday night.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.150
One of the things -- places -- I
took my guests, was to Volubilis,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.930
which was one of the
Roman outposts in Morocco.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.450
Beautiful, you can see the olive
oil presses, and just, you know,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.050
the amazing infrastructure
that the Romans had.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.190
And how important food was
back then, and lifestyle.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:19.200
And then if we go forward, we can
go all the way to the 9th century.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.140
And talk about some of the
influences that were taking place

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.930
in Sicily, and in different places.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.860
But what I'd like to
mention also before that is,

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.840
there were many different regions,
and Empires, and places that,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.780
indigenous settlements, in Italy.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.770
Long before we had some
of these invading forces,

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.280
or new forces coming in.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.110 position:56%
We look at the Romans a lot, because
they were such an impressive Empire.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.270
They have so many things that
you can trace back and look

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.570
at them, and know what is Roman.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.190
And a lot of Italian Americans
really identified, and Italians,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.930
identify themselves
with what is Rome.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.990
Because Rome is so
important in the world.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.570
But there were a lot of other
indigenous tribes that were on too.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.320
Like the Etruscans in Tuscany.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.320
Like, in Calabria, we had the
Italian, the [foreign word].

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.750
In Puglia, they had the Apulians.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.920
So these people were already there,
already had their own culture.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.660
And then if the Romans
were to come into an area,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.200 position:56%
they were another culture coming in.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.680
It's not like everybody was Roman.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.220
So that's an important
distinction to make.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.170
And then if we look into the
9th century, two very important,

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:18.820
prominent groups came in from
North Africa, into Sicily.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.080
One was the Aghlabids,
and they came in in 827.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.610
The reason Sicily was so important,

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.480
is because it's the largest
island in the Mediterranean.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:27.780
It was the center of trade.

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:32.360
So any caliphate wanted to
claim Sicily before it claimed

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.660
other areas.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.500
And sometimes Sicily was
actually known as a caliphate.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.660
So the Aghlabids came from what was
now known as modern-day Tunisia.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.660
And they named Marsala,
which means Mars Allah,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.800
or the marsh of Allah,
the Port of Allah.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.100
They named it that.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.640
And they also brought in a lot of
different ingredients with them.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.940
A lot of lemons.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.240
A lot of mulberries.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.920
A lot of different citrus,
and couscous, and things like.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.360
And they would plant the fruits
on the base of Mount Etna.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.960
So all of that rich soil
really enriched a lot

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.390
of the products, and
made them superior.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.320
If you go to North Africa
today, the little lemons

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.720
and oranges are like this big.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.850
They're very delicious, they're
sweet, their own variety.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.780
But they took a whole new
thing once they got enriched

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.120
from the volcanic soil.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.560
So when, sometimes if you're
overseas, if you're in a store

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.860
and you see something, you know,

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.960
grown in the volcanic
ash of Etna or Sicily.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.330
And you're like, that's
just a marketing ploy.

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.040
If It really was, it really,
it's not a marketing ploy.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.340
It's unique, it's different.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.300
Those years and years of
ash really make a superior

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.630
and a different product.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.250
So that's interesting to know about
and interesting to talk about.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.060
And then in 917, the Fatimids came.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.620
And the Fatimids were
really, really important.

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.210
They were also, they were a Shiite
group, also from North Africa,

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.610
from what is now Tunisia.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.060
But they were important, because
they first claimed Sicily,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.360
Palermo, as their capital.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.140
And then 50 years later,
they claimed Cairo.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.370
So that's how important
Sicily was to them.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.630 position:56%
And there was a lot of synergy back
and forth, between Cairo and Sicily,

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.330
because of that in those days.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.510
Also the Fatimids were
really big into kind

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.590
of cross-cultural celebrations.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.920
So they would have
religious festivals.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:00.360
They didn't care if people were
Jewish, or Christian, or Muslim.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.660
They would have these festivals

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.570
and then they would make what
we now know as [foreign word],

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.560
or the sesame candy
and things like that.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.840
And those would be the sweats
of the different festivals.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.690
And they would encourage
everybody to eat them.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.500
So nowadays, if you go to the --

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.800
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
Well, he was going to --

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.840
you still see these sweats
at community festivals.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.140
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: That's right.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.440
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: The sugared
almonds, the [foreign word].

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.620
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: And if you go to, you
know, the feast of Saint Rosalia,

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.920
in Sicily, you'll see them.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.220
Or if you go to the
Prophet Mohamed's birthday,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.520
in Cairo, you'll see them.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.170
Nobody realizes that people
are, across the pond are,

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.800
especially the more
provincial people,

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.020
don't realize that people are
eating them for different reasons.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.630
But they're one of the very
early examples that we have,

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.050 position:56%
of a food that goes across cultures.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.290
And they became a very,
very powerful group.

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.030
And then, the next big time period
that we have, if we leap forward,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.820
that we can talk about,
is the Renaissance.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.550
And, as Domenica mentioned
earlier, Catarina de' Medici,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.380
when she married Henry
II and moved to Paris,

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.340
she brought with her
all of her cooks.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.620
So this huge brigade of pastry
chefs and regular chefs.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:05.800 position:56%
So what we now know, what became the
Grande Cuisine Movement, in Paris,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.060
was actually influenced
by Florentine cuisine.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.670
We couldn't call it
Italian at that time,

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.440
because we didn't think
of things as Italy.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.740
It was pre that.

00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:14.040
But it was Florentine.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.640
And many of the French
chefs will, you know,

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.970
have studied that, and history.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:19.740
So things like onion soup.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.540
Things like, that we
call French onion soup,

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.290
crepes, Duck a l' orange.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.570
These types things, the
amaretti cookies fused

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.450
into what we now know
as the macaron.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.830
So there were many, many
elevated dining styles,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:37.290
but also specific recipes that the
Medicis brought with them to Paris.

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:40.700 position:56%
And then another important thing to
think about, if we're kind of trying

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.690
to get our minds wrapped
around what was taking place,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.740
in the time of the Renaissance.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.040
And, you know, so much wealth,

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.970
and so much learning,
and so much knowledge.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.340
But still so much trade with
the East, that at that time,

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.810
an Oriental carpet was
worth more than the David.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.110
Can you imagine?

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.440
And kind of, if you took
it to nowadays standards,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.740
so you have to think about.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.400
So if an oriental carpet
was worth more,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.230
imagine how much spices were worth.

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.400
Imagine how much other
things that were [inaudible].

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.480
Blown glass, for example,
from Syria, was really close

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.780
to priceless at that time.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.080
They had so many knockoffs.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.580
And they used to write in fake
Arabic to try to sell them.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.480
And I say this as it
applies to food,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.790
because the food was also
influenced from those styles.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.710
So we see a lot of spices,
starting to come in.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.990
And people like, you know,
beyond the Medicis wanting

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.430
to show off at the banquet, even.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:28.960
And at the Papal banquets
and the things

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.260
that were going on at the Vatican.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.780
When they wanted to have something
luxurious, they added spice,

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.310
because it showed that
they had money.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.610
Spice was a form of currency.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.500
Spice was used as a
traditional medicinal.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.920
Spice was used as a show of
wealth, as a mood enhancer,

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.220
all kinds of different things.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.470
But at that time, Venice and
Istanbul, over top right,

00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:49.470
and Cairo, were all sister cities.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:51.770
And they were all involved
in the spice trade.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.300
All of those cities, the things
would go around and around.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.390
The merchants would just keep
bringing them back and forth.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.510 position:56%
Were all built pretty much on spice.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.250
All of the beauty that, you
know, all of the grandeur,

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:03.830
all of the wonderful wealth that
is hard to even comprehend today.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.770
Maybe we would think
about it with petroleum.

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.530
They were all built on spice.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.730
One of the unique things that
happened, though, to Venice,

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:11.820
in terms, that didn't
happen to other cities.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.970
Was when the Dutch later on found
a new trade route to the east,

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.440
they didn't need these
cities anymore.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.740
So they were all going
to go bankrupt.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.040
And they knew.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.340
There was like a little
bit of advanced warning,

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.640
that they all knew they
were going to suffer

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.940
from these new trade routes.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.240
And not needing the Mediterranean
and the Middle East anymore.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.140
But what the Venetians
did was really cool was,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.280
they took the residual
money that they had.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.580
And instead of holding onto it

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.170
because they were going
to go bankrupt.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:32.710
They actually spent
it on the frescoes

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.010
that you can see on the canal.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.820
So all of this additional
beauty came out of a time

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.900
that most people would have been
really worried about failure.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.340
And then, of course, Venice became
a popular tourist destination,

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.930
because it was so beautiful.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.380
So it helped us to kind of, you
know, live through that moment.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.590
And it's a really good
example of food and culture,

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.520
and kind of cities in the world.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.620
Then again, we have to
talk about Da Vinci.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.250
Because -- and I would've
loved to talk about,

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.690
you know, 500 different figures.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.750
But, to just choose
one, this is important.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.560
Because in the 15th century,
and the 16th century.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.690
When you're looking at all
of these titles that had --

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.990
Lucia was making fun of me.

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:09.230
Because I have three slashes
in my professional title.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.440
But look at his, and
they were all like that.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.030
And it wasn't the first
time, you know.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.800
There were many, many people
during the Renaissance.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.540
Hence, the term Renaissance man.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.930
In two centuries prior, in Baghdad,

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.010
many of those scholars
were also like that.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:22.400
They had all these same things.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.040 position:56%
And so, as we were taking many ideas
from the east, so was this idea

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.730
of being able to do many things.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.030
Of expanding the mind.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.330
Of no limits.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.710
Of not having to be so focused.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.000
Of science, and knowledge, and
learning, and math, and food.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.480
And all being intertwined.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.340
We also see more formal
ways of writing

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.150
about food and appreciating food.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.690
Because, for a while, you know,
that food was just something

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.210
that you would talk
about for the wealthy.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.760
For the upper-class.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.270
For the people in the palaces.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.380
And now we start to see it really
being looked at as a science.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.280
And it's thanks to people
like this, in addition to all

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:58.140
of the many wonderful advancements
that they made in society.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.120
And then, as Domenica
mentioned, Columbus.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.760
And, of course, coming
to the New World.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.810
And regardless of the individual
that came, or, you know,

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.260
what the reasons behind that were.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.740
There was definitely, with the
Spanish, all of this influx

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.590
of new ingredients
that came to Italy.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.220
And Italy really, really
embraced every single one.

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.970
What's interesting is some of --
because of the Turkish influence.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.620
And the Turks were in charge
of a lot of trade at the time.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:25.380
A lot of the products that were
new into Italy, got Turkish names.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.680
So like, you know, products
that are made with corn a lot

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.920
of times get called [foreign
word], or Turkish grain.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.280
And it has nothing
to do with Turkey,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.870
other than that the
Turks were the middlemen.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.130
Turkish coffee, you know, they
didn't get the coffee from Turkey,

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:36.430
but they were bringing it around.

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.730
So it got labeled as Turkish.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.920
And so we see these words
a lot of times in Italy.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.350
And it, you know, up
until very recently,

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:45.120
if someone in a very small
community came from another place.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.180 position:56%
A lot of French people called them a
Turk, because they came from a part.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.180
So you can't always use
etymology in food history.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.920
Sometimes it leads you
to something different.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.240 position:56%
It's just a little provincial thing.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.110
We have corn, tomatoes, potatoes,
vanilla, avocados, peppers.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.970
All kinds of things
coming from the New World.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.490
And here's an example of, you
know, some different dishes.

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.110
This one is a [foreign
word] dish on the left.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.900
They have a saying that if
it has peppers, and tomatoes,

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.750
and onions, it's [foreign word].

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:16.110
But, as we can see, a lot of
those ingredients, you know,

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.600
two of those ingredients, at
least, came from the New World.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.920
And many people don't realize
what Italian food would be

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.480
without tomato sauce,
prior to the 15th century.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.360
But, Domenica and I
actually have a colleague,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.380
who wrote a book called
<i>Beyond the Red Sauce</i>.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.780
His name is Chef Matt Finarelli.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.970
And it's all recipes
without tomato sauce,

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:34.760
that were done prior
to the 15th century.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.920
So you can find that if
you're very interested.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.610
Another thing that we have to think

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.800
about in Italian food
is the idea of realism.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.020
And the idea of showing
food like it is.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.750
And this kind of more
modern approach

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.050
in the way that we eat today.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.380
And the way that we eat today,
even if you go to a restaurant

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.000
and you look at a menu, it
will tell you the ingredients.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.490
It will say such-and-such salad.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.810
Then it will say
tomato/cucumber/onion,

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.150
and we list the ingredients.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.560
That would not have
happened in the Renaissance.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:00.370
In the Renaissance, they would want
50 million different ingredients

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.670
in there.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.360
You know, wrapped in a crust,
which has an animal in it.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.790
Which is stuffed with
something else.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.090
And really, you had to like guess.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.720
The food was like magic, and
a work of art, and a surprise,

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.020
and these kind of things.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.320
So --

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.620
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
Okay, but I have --

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.920
so, you're talking about
the Renaissance in Florence.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.220
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Sure.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.520
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
And all of that?

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.380
So what about the cucina povera,
and when did that come about?

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.350
I mean, was that always
there as well?

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:26.360
You know, you think of the
fagioli and just varied,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.540
I think of Florentine cuisine
today as very minimalist, almost.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:34.460
So when would that have come about?

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.220
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: We're going to get to
that in this slide in a little bit.

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.520
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Okay.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.820
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: It was always there.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.370
But it came about more as a force,
a couple hundred years later.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.440
So we're going to get to that.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.880
But a similarity with the
art, which we may be seeing

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.180
at the National Gallery,
if people go to that talk.

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.590
Is something about Caravaggio

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.010
and Titian using the
realism in their work.

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:56.670
And showing things, portraying
as they are, more than creating

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.860
like things that are
kind of a fantasy world.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.120
We're also going to
see that with the food.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.360
And then we have these,
some of the influences

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.000
that to start coming
into the United States.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.840
And we look at the different
influences on Italian architecture.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.000
And things that our
Presidents were looking at.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.790
And, as Domenica mentioned
earlier, definitely the food

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.120
and the wine of Jefferson.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.930
And there are even these clips
that you can find, of the influence

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:26.180
that Jefferson was
under, of the Italians.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.880
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: And he
had a winemaker who was Italian.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.180
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Right, Mazzei.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.480
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
[Inaudible] yes.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.780
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Exactly.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.080
So he brought Mazzei over, and he
hands this little letter to him.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.380 position:56%
It says, I thank you for obliging --

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.220
the obliging act of
your culture of wine.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.220
And I'm happy to hear
that your plantation

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.240
of them is in so prosperous a way.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.140
So also, he brought over
people to teach Italian,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.810
and to start an Italian
studies program.

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.320
So definitely a big
proponent of Italian culture.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.930
He also smuggled rice into
the United States [laughter],

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:53.430
from the risotto.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.180
So even though it has nothing
to do nowadays with risotto

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.870
and what grows in the south.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.420
But you can see the
similarities from them,

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.490
just because he got it
and he brought it in.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.910
So we have also our rice industry

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.840
to thank Jefferson
and the Italians for.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.660
And here we are, Library
of Congress.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:12.930
Go around, you know, some
of the different buildings.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.950 position:56%
And you can see just how beautiful a
lot of the Italian architecture is.

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.380
And here's when we start
to get more into the topic

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.360
about the cucina povera, and that
whole thing, and how it started.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.970
So 1892 is when we really see the
mass immigration into the Americas.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.470
And as Italians, as, you know,
people who are studying Italy.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:32.770
Anybody who cares about
Italy at all,

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.870
if you look at this time period,
that's all you're going to see.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.890
But there's a lot else
going on in Italy too.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.490
So we're going to present a
little bit of both of that today.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.280
So we see the, you know,
the immigration coming,

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.470
and people leaving, and
people having to leave.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.360
And that, of course, changes a lot

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.810
about what food is
known as, in the world.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:51.320
Here in America, if you study any
of the textbooks from, you know,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.410
what they were teaching in the
tenements and things like that.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.530
They would actually
send social workers

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.450
to the Italian neighborhoods
in New York.

00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:59.600
And they would have them
come with their clipboards.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.310
And, you know, they would
like analyze the families.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:03.230
And they say, oh, you
know, you came from Italy

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:04.530
and you've got these kids.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.120
And, you know, you're
just feeding them starch,

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.980
and there's no protein,
and vegetables.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.610
That's not good, they
need meat and potatoes.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:10.960
They're not going to live.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.950
This is America, this is
what we do, we're advanced.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.280 position:56%
There was a lot of propaganda to
get people to eat meat and potatoes.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.140
So, in addition to poverty,
being new immigrants, you know,

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.340
poor conditions, what
they were living in,

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.840
and food not being available.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.560
They were also being told, this
is the way you have to eat.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.350
So, you know, if anybody every
criticizes what happened to the,

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.980
you know, Italian-American food.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.410
There's a really strong reason
to it, and in a certain way,

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.050
I think it's amazing that
so many food trends stayed,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.520
despite everything that
people went through.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.820
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Right.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.120
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Now, again,
at the same time, you know,

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.550
not too much before, in Italy.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.230
As we're talking about
despair, and people talk

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.580
about why people had to flee.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.460
There was also a lot of
very great things going on,

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.150 position:56%
considering opera to be one of them.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.770
And Puccini was born
in 1858, in Lucca.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.450
So Lucca is in Tuscany.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.470
And what he ate would
have been known, he was --

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.370
would have been known as Lucchese,
or the specific food from his town.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:06.270
So here we see some more
examples of Tuscan food.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.760
And then, because it
was a feudal town,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.310
and it was known for its wealth.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.620
Later on, when it started
going through economic decline,

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.770
this is really when this term,
the cucina povera got coined,

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:19.090 position:56%
and people started talking about it.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.280
Because it was happening at the
same time as the mass immigration,

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.580
then it got brought here.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.900
And then anything that
came, you know,

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:26.730
with these poor people, was poor.

00:33:26.730 --> 00:33:30.050
And a lot of times what
was Italian was poor,

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.810
because it was coming with people.

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.310
But when it went around, you
know, through the opera starts

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.740
and through the other things, then
it had a different connotation.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.040
And also, it's important

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.760 position:56%
to note some very simple
ingredients, like beans, like wheat.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.920
Fava beans, for example,
world's oldest agricultural crop.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.220
Cheap as could be,
plentiful, and easy to find.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.870
But they were, you know,
very expensive at the time.

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.170
They were a currency.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:52.610
Lentils were a currency, they
were worth their weight in gold.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.470 position:56%
So things change at different times.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.500
And I like to be very careful
about what I call poor and rich,

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.000
because it's all in the matter
of the way you look at it.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.300
Plus, if it's good for you,

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.800
then it has a wealth, I
think, all of its own.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.420
So here are some of the
examples of the cucina povera,

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.860
that Domenica was talking about.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.840
We have the polenta and we
have the panzanella salad.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.180
We have the pancotto.

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:12.500
So the first two are
recipes made out of bread.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.360
So the pancotto on the bottom is
a soup made out of cooked bread.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.370
It's just leftover
bread made into a soup.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.420
You know, obviously very
cheap, inexpensive to make.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.270
But, when done well, there are
few things that taste as great.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.250 position:56%
And nowadays, a homemade, authentic,
honest stock is probably one

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.190
of the biggest luxuries, I
think, you know, in humankind.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.050
Then we have the panzanella
salad, which leftover bread.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.600
People are taking advantage
of the good bread

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.040
to turn it into the salad.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.540
And polenta, so polenta
comes from cornmeal.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:44.360
Corn, of course, was
brought back with Columbus,

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.760
often called [foreign word].

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.810
And made into this
dish called polenta.

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.300
This is our Italian
version of grits.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.600
But people didn't like it.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.900
It didn't catch on very quickly.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.210
People were suspicious of
it, it looked like food

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:55.760
that you would feed to the animals.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.690
And it really didn't have,
you know, much repertoire.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.840
But it caught on with the
Jewish community in the North,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.140
and they started eating it.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.600 position:56%
And then it, little by little, it
became a little bit more widespread.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.900
It spread to the south.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.200
And then in the south, a lot

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.520
of the farmers started
eating it before they went

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.820
out into the fields in the morning.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.120
So it would be a base.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.580
They would eat it with meat,
and they were these very big,

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.940
untraditional, not what we
think of as Italian breakfasts.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.870
Because they had to work the
-- they had to work the land.

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.660
And then in 1889, the
first pizzeria was born.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.330
So we all know, of
course, we don't have

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.240
to tell anybody how
popular pizza is.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:26.900
But it's very important
that it has -- the pizzeria.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.740
And it's important that you look
at the Queen Margherita, and why,

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.040
what she has to do with the pizza.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.650
Does anybody know this story?

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.400
Okay. Okay, so some of you.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.970
So, you know, it was
a very humble food.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.270
It was a street food.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.200
It wasn't something that
the Queen would order.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.890
But, how they used to
sell the pizza was,

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:44.320
if anybody's ever been
to Istanbul or Cairo.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.020
And you see the people walk around
with those big aluminum tanks

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.370 position:56%
that are, they're getting water or
juice or something from these things

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:50.670
that are strapped onto them.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.820
Well, they used to strap
ovens onto themselves, and go,

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.120
they were like human vendors.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.210
And they would heat the pizza
up and sell it on the street.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:58.860
It was very, very poor,
you know, food.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.410 position:56%
And the Queen had a craving for one,
so she ordered one up to the castle.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:07.110
They made the tri-colored one for
her, in honor of the Italian flag.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.310
And this is how we got
the Margherita pizza.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:11.750
So you can still go to
visit this Pizzeria Brandi,

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:13.980
if you go to Naples.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:15.490
And then also Verdi.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:17.480
So it's important to
think about opera,

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.270
once again, at this time period.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:21.680
Because opera was so important,
and I do whole lectures

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.390
on the influence of opera on food.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:27.220
But Verdi was very closely
associated with the Risorgimento.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.730
So his work was very political.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.470
And a lot of his writings

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:33.760
and his music had understated
political, hidden messages.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.660
And these are important,
because at the same time,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.960
all of this unification
was going on in Italy.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.170
So there was a need for
unification of food.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.120
They were actually looking for food

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.610
that would bring the
country together.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.680
Because, at the time, the
foods were all very regional

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.980
and very different.

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.820
And that's how we still like
to kind of look at it today.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.140
But they were looking, as
they were looking for a hero.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.910
A singer or a sports figure,
they also wanted food.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:58.850
And one of the things that
Verdi's legacy left was,

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.070
he created some songs, and
popularized some songs,

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.520
Italian songs around the world.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.010
That, you know, are,
people just hear the tune

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.310
and they start humming them.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:08.610
And that's one of the many things

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.060
that he gave us, in
terms of culture.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:13.960
So if you look at Milan in that
time, where the alla Scalla is,

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.490
and the teatro, and
very fine dining.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.730 position:56%
And wonderful things are happening
there today, in terms of gastronomy.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.420
We can also, you know,
way back in his time,

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.410
this wasn't that much
going on at that time.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:25.960 position:56%
So they had a lot of local products.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.550
They had the wonderful
dairy that they had,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.280
they had the farms
and things like that.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.330
Risotto, minestre, and
freshwater fish, this was the basis

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.170
of what was going on
in Milan, at the time.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.230
And Verdi also has a
risotto named after him.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:41.780
So you can look this up
online, if you're a Verdi fan,

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.260
and make this risotto when
you listen to the opera.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.940
But here are the regions, as
they are today, as I mentioned.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.510
So, you know, they weren't
exactly the same at that time.

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.290
But you can see kind of the
differences, and how they evolved,

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:55.630
and how they developed, and
what's unique to one another.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.580
Even within the regions, there are
still differences between the town.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.710
You know, a town one hour
away, two hours away,

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:03.620
will have a different dialect,
different food, different terrain.

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.310
And when you go, you get to see it.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:06.850
And this, as Domenica mentioned,

00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:09.500
really helped to shape the
different things of the food.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.700
So one region that we
know of very, very well,

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.700
for food in the world today, is
the region of Emilia-Romagna.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.480
And especially the town of Parma.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.390
So Parmigiano-Reggiano is the
most famous cheese from there,

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.320
and the most famous cheese
known around the world.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.380
It's said that Benjamin Franklin
even tried to get the recipe.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.320 position:56%
And it has an eight-century history.

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.740
Very meticulous process of what
they have to do to make it.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:32.400
And it's all governed by
the government and all

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.700
of these types of consortiums.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.540 position:56%
So you know you were getting an
authentic product when you go there.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.470
For those of you who like the
Prosciutto di Parma, the --

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:42.180
sorry for the small p on the Parma.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.240
For those of you who like it, you
will find that one of the things

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.040
that makes it unique, is that the
pigs are fed the leftover whey

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:50.650 position:56%
from making the Parmigiano-Reggiano.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.830
That's one of the reasons
why it gets so much flavor,

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.970
in addition to the different
breeds and the different things.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.610
These types of food
traditions are one of the things

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:59.280
that helps the Italian economy.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.010
That helps the gastronomy
around the world,

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.950
and it helps what makes the
Made in Italy brand strong.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:07.220
So nowadays, one of the things
that we're doing is really trying

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.290
to promote geographic indicators.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.900
A lot of times, people will come
and will have events here in D.C.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.610
from Switzerland, and from
U.N. and different places.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:16.880
If we can protect, for
example, the Idaho potato,

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:19.830
and the Prosciutto di
Parma, and things like this,

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:22.920
different economies do better.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.780
You know, there's a lot
more increased trade.

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.160
People know what they're buying
and they get authentic products.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.270
So it's a thing of the
future, that to look at.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.210
But getting back to the
unification of Italy.

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.180
So Garibaldi, who is
probably, you know,

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.060
considered to be the father
of the [foreign word].

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.120
And very important General
in the Italian Army,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.140
and in causing the
unification of Italy.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.910
He first ate Spaghetti
al Pomodoro in Calabria,

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.160
at this place that
you see over there.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.590
Melito di Porto Salvo.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.670
And he said to the
soldiers, "I swear to you,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:51.950
this will be the dish
that unifies Italy."

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.490
So for those of us who,
like, when we see the dish,

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.200
and we're like oh, no,
it's stereotypical.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.880
It's not. Garibaldi endorsed it.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.180
That's all we need.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.480 position:56%
We can have it for 5,000 more years.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.530
And then, of course, we start
to see the mass-produced pasta.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.150
And, you know, why was there such
a need for mass-produced pasta?

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.980
Well, this is when people
really started leaving Italy.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.280
So they're leaving Italy.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.990
They can't bring with them
their pasta making tools, maybe.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.140
They don't have maybe the new
ingredients to make pasta.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.440
They're going to need pasta.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.740
And one of the things

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.140
that [inaudible] the
way of packaged pasta.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.780
And pasta chuta, as we call
it, dried pasta in the world,

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:26.590
is this mass immigration.

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.550
So then we have this invention
of Italian-American cuisine.

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.920 position:56%
So nowadays, what people were
eating, maybe on a Sunday, in Italy,

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.050
as a, you know, luxury food.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.000 position:56%
We're eating more and more
commonly as a daily food in America,

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.300
because meat is cheap here.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.700
Meat still is cheaper than herbs.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.310
And then a lot of vegetables,
and very easy to get.

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.560
You know, dandelion greens, which
we used to eat by the bushel-full

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.270
when I was a kid, are expensive.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.350
Meat, on the other hand, is cheap.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.760 position:56%
And so there's a sort of, there's a,
you know, health component to that.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.940
Because you have, the name
for dandelion, in Latin,

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.850
is official disease remedy.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.290
And they're expensive.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.590
So, but --

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.890
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
But also portions.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:06.190
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Yes.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.130
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: I mean,
portions are a big issue, I think.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.640
And that's a problem here.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.190
Because everybody in
the U.S. seems to think

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:16.650
that Italians eat all the time,
you know, gargantuan portions.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:18.110
And, of course, if
you go over there,

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.210
that's not the way it is at all.

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.510
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Right.

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:24.430
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: You know,
look at that plate of spaghetti.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.250
That's a very American
way of serving.

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.490
[ Laughter ]

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:31.790
No offense.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.310
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: And then, in 1891,
there's a book that we actually,

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.970
Lucia provided for us
out there, you can see.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.230
<i>La Scienza en cucina e
l'arte di mangiar bene</i>.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:41.680
This was a very important
book, written by Artusi,

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:43.340
that all the Italian chefs study.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.680
And anybody who's interested in
Italian food should look at it.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.080
Because it talks about
verismo in the kitchen.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.500
So again, this ideal of
realism, like we were talking

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.600
about with Titian and
Caravaggio comes in.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.640
And this was written
for the middle classes.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.960 position:56%
So, unlike Apicius, who was
writing for, you know, the emperors,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.260
and he was a philosopher.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:01.140
And unlike, later on,
people who were writing

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.040
for the cooks of the kings.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.700
He was actually writing
for the middle classes.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.770
&gt;&gt; Domenica Macchetti: And,
one thing about Artusi is

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.510
that he was from, I
think, Emilia-Romagna,

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.500
but lived for years in Florence.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.840
So I guess the majority
of the recipes

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.250
in his book were from that region.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.460
But he did gather recipes
from around the peninsula.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:23.420
And so that was kind
of considered maybe one

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.480
of the first regional cookbooks.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:31.030
And it helped to unify, you know,
what we know of as Italian cuisine.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.330
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: That's
a really good point.

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.630
That's a very good point.

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:35.880
Because, prior to that, the
books would have been, you know,

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.180
from wherever they were written.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.480
Or from wherever the
author was written.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.540
In the 19th century, so with the
continuing changes that we see,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.550
are a lot more lighter,
more fresh ingredients.

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.750
Again, we're getting away
from those heavily spiced,

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.940
really intricate recipes
of the Renaissance.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.430
Then comes along Puccini.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:55.280
And now we're seeing verismo in
this idea of realism in the opera.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.630
And Puccini talking about
very middle-class scenes.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:59.510
And very everyday things
that you can see.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.130
And not trying to be so elevated.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:05.260
This, again, is something
that transformed

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:06.560
and it shows in the kitchen.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.100
And then also, Puccini,
because of his success,

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.490
and because of the different
global things that he talked about.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.790
He had things set in Asia.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.290
He had things set in Paris.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:16.680
So against the backdrop
of this mass immigration,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.690
and people aren't afforded to live.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.230
You also have people who are
really upholding the high end

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.530
of Italian culture.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:25.280
And telling people, okay, this
is really what we're capable of,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:29.510
in addition to some of the
problems that are going on.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.710
Then we have the futurist
movement in food.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:33.410
And I know you're going to be
hearing a talk on that very soon,

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:34.710
so I won't go in too much.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.010
But this is really fun.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.020 position:56%
I can't endorse it too much, because
the first one, no more pasta.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.280
Which, to me, life
wouldn't be worth living.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.080
But they did have some
kind of cool ideas.

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.650
One of them was that
the meals had to be

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.600 position:56%
in perfect harmony with one another.

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.690
They had these wonderful
table settings.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.910
They had all of these
kind of sculpted foods.

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.440
Some of the foods,
you didn't even eat.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.110
They were just placed on the table
for your eyes, and to attract you,

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:56.410
and as, you know, eye candy.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:57.720
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: This is
modernist cuisine, you know.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.020
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Yes, yes.

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.160
But you literally didn't eat them.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.070
They disallowed political
speech at the table,

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.570
which I think is a great idea.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.030
They also forbid music and
poetry, which is weird.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.480
Because a lot of the more
elaborate things up until that day,

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.980
they used to would
actually have people come

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.820
and recite poetry before you ate.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.120
Or sing a song or something
like that.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.190
And then they, probably
the most bizarre thing,

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.670
was that they would have these
little simulators of airplanes,

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:21.150
like they have at the
Air and Space Museum.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.110
They'd have people go
in there and sit to eat.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.240
And then they would have,
they would stimulate movements

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.970
that were supposed to
make people more hungry.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.010
And open up their appetite.

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:32.390
So, but I'll leave that for the
person who's special in that.

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:35.570
Then, as we move forward, we
look, we start to develop, by now,

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.870
in Italy, a really
strong sense of style.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:39.260 position:56%
That's respected all over the world.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:41.670
So despite problems and
despite immigration and things

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:45.520
that might have been immigration
-- attributed to it in the past.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.730
By now, we're very respected all
around the world, in terms of Made

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.270
in Italy and Italian style.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:54.220
And this is a quote
by Diego Della Valle.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.510
Also, language and food, so many

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.970
of our American food products
now have Italian names.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.270
Some of them are changed
a little bit,

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:01.800
but a lot of them are straight on.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.100
You know, pizza, ravioli, pasta.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.380
Bologna, of course, is
a whole different thing,

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.500 position:56%
but that's [inaudible] Italian word.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.800
Coffee, pepperoni.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.860
Pepperoni, in Italian, is peppers.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.690
So there is no like pork product

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.450
that we call pepperoni,
that does not --

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.750
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Yeah.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.050
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: -- It's not there.

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.750
But all of these words
are some of them.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:22.070
And also, we see fashion,

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.830
and different American-style
icons turning to Italy.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.730
Like Jackie O and different
actresses, for their fashion.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.030
That really helped.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:30.330
Food and fashion go hand-in-hand.

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.160
And whenever people like one,
they usually like the other.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:36.300
So this really helped with the
food to be spread in the world.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.540
And films, you know,
by Dino Di Laurentis

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.890
and Carlo Ponti, and Sophia Loren.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.270
All of these wonderful actresses.

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.590
Also, American movies
that are going to Italy.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:48.290
Now, by this time, Americans want
to have their movies shot in Italy.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:51.140 position:56%
So this, again, added to the appeal.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.790
And, of course, music.

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:57.010
We had so much great music that
was coming out of this area.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.800
And then American travel.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.650
By now, Americans could
afford to travel.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.980
And, you know, we had a
type of disposable income

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.280
that would let us go to Italy.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.820
So once people went to Italy
and saw it for themselves,

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:11.380
that's how it became such a great
tourist destination that it is.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:14.910
We saw huge changes in
the 1970s and the 1980s,

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.870
in terms of what people
thought Italian food was.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.560
What you could get in restaurants.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.950
What recipes were available.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.650
All kinds of misconceptions.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.180 position:56%
You know, they started out with the
now, we're not just Italian anymore,

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.570
but we're Northern versus Southern.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.040
And there was that whole thing.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.810
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Which
is still a simplification

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:30.110
of the way it actually is.

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.410
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Yes, yeah.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:32.710
And sometimes it's just
because you're on Twitter

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:34.220
and you only have a certain
amount of characters to use.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:35.520
And you can't say --

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.010
[ Foreign Language ]

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.880
[ Laughter ]

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.380
You have to just say South.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.680
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: But
it's changed since then.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.640
I mean, you know, we
don't really see too much

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.900
of the Northern/Southern
anymore, right?

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.770
I think it's much more regional.

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:51.990
You know, there's an attempt
to really dig down deeper

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.980 position:56%
into Italian cuisine here in the
U.S. And, I think, around the world.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:59.360
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: And then,
of course, by the '90s,

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.770
a lot of Italian food is
associated with gourmet.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.610
So now we have things that aren't
even Italian, using Italian names.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:05.910
Putting Italian cities.

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.540 position:56%
Putting Italian words, or, and, you
know, of course, with the olive oil.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.630
We won't go there today,
but it's a big thing.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:14.290
Because, by now, we've
got a gourmet reputation.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:17.220
And so people start to do that,
and also take advantage of it.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.770
And then, one of the wonderful
things that we're doing

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.740
and we see being done, is people
preserving the artisan pastas.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:24.110
So, here we have --

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:26.540
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: So this is a
chitarra, from the Abruzzo region,

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.750
which is where my family is from.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.050
And this is --

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Can you go to show to the people?

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:32.650
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Okay.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:33.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:35.250
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Okay.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:36.550
Yeah, so --

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:37.850
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

00:47:37.850 --> 00:47:39.150
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
No, no, no, that's fine.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:40.450
So I'll just kind of put
it on the chair here.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:41.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.050
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: This
is actually a tourist one.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.350
I have my mother's, but I
didn't want to bring it,

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:45.650
because it's kind of in bad shape.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:47.430
But this is actually a
19th century invention.

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:51.480
It was apparently invented
by the [foreign word].

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:56.310
The artisans who made the -- what
do you call a [foreign word]?

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:57.610
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Sieve.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.910
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
The sieves, yeah.

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:01.340
So when you made pasta, or
whatever, you sieved your flour,

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.640
because you wanted to get rid

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.650
of all the little bits,
and you save the rest.

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:06.550
But this was actually a way to sort

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:10.420
of make cutting your pasta
easier for housewives.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:15.030
So you put your strip of pasta on
here and you'd roll this, you know,

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.910
this rolling pin along it.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.430
And you'd cut the sheet
of pasta into strips.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:23.960
So until very recently, Abruzzo was
really the only place you could get

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:26.240
something like spaghetti
a la chitarra.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.870
But now, if you go down to Rose's
Luxury, you can get [inaudible].

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:32.570
Because it's become very popular.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:35.180
And this is what is happening
with regional Italian cuisine.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.190
That, you know, cooks,
cookbook authors,

00:48:38.190 --> 00:48:40.400
chefs, are really digging down.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.100
Because every region, I say --

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.550
I always say that Italy
is a small country.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.220
But every region is vast and deep.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.630
And, you know, I know
that every time I go back,

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.540
I come across recipes
that are new to me.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.290
That are either very old or
very new, and there's just,

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:59.300
there's always something
to discover.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.920
Which is pretty incredible,
when you think

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.070
about how many centuries people
have been traveling to Italy.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.300
And have been mining its
food and its culinary scene.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.570
So the fact that there are
still discoveries to be made,

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:10.870
I think, are pretty incredible.

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:12.640
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: I agree.

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:16.720
And as we talk about that, in
Italian food around the globe.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:20.040
This is a map that's
from Yelp, in Singapore.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.630
And you can see how many different
tiramisu restaurants there are.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.790
Tiramisu is the number
one dessert in Singapore.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:27.110 position:56%
They love -- they're crazy about it.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:28.540
And many places in the world.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.540
In Morocco, I was seeing
it all over the place.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:32.280
And also restaurants named for it,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.490 position:56%
but it is definitely the most
famous Italian dessert in the world.

00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:37.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: So and I want
to say one thing about Singapore.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.540 position:56%
Because I met a chef from Singapore,

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.320
when I was in Italy
over this summer.

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.270
And he's actually Japanese, but
he has a restaurant in Singapore,

00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:48.120
and it's an Italian restaurant.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.000
And he just won a Michelin Star.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.080
So that's, you know,
talk about global,

00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.380
that's pretty incredible, yeah.

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.680
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: That's awesome.

00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.980
That's awesome.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.280
And do you want to
talk about your --

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.580
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Oh yeah,

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.130
so you see those teeny-tiny
little bagels.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.920 position:56%
That's my daughter's hand, actually.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.900
We were in Florence in
this, over the summer.

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:10.090
And they, our hotel at happy
hour, or whatever, cocktail hour,

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:12.090
will put out wine and some
little [foreign word],

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.390
little things to eat.

00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:16.140
And one day, it was
these many bagels.

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:20.650
So here we are in the heart of
Florence, snacking on mini bagels.

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.390
And if you go to Italy, you know,

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.860
or the world of the
internet, and food blogging.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.560
I know a lot of Italian
food bloggers.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.910
And if you look at their sites,
you'll see recipes for muffins

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.410
and cheesecake, and,
you know pancakes.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.130
And when I go to Italy, I don't
want to have bagels, you know.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:38.240
[ Laughter ]

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.960
That's a personal preference.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.170
But, of course, you
know, if you're Italian,

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.940
you might want to have
bagels, I guess.

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.880
I don't know.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.250
So it's a shifting
landscape, I guess.

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:50.550
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: And also,
you have the,

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:51.960
you've seen the sushi
with the Italian flag.

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.300
And over on the right,
the pizza and kabobs.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.230
So very common, especially in Rome.

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:57.530
I lived in Rome for a while.

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:02.390
And the places where they have the
pizza Italia or the hand cut pizza,

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:04.450
will also have a shawarma
stand over in the corner.

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:07.270
A lot of them are run by
people from the Middle East.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.280
But they don't call them a
shawarma, they call them kabob,

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.190
which after the doner
kabob, for the Turkish name.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:13.980
So and some people, you
know, have an opinion

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.280
about that and they don't like it.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:16.580
They think that they're
ruining the pizzerias,

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.880
and they're ruining their culture.

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.590
But, if we look back to the history
of pizza, the word pizza comes

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.090
from [foreign word],
which is Turkish.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.390
So I think it's fair.

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.690
And there's lots of
tiramisu in Turkey, so --

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:25.990
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
Well, and of course,

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:27.290
if you go up to the Gran Sasso,

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.090
you can eat [foreign word]
kabobs out of [foreign word].

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:33.210
Which are made with mutton,
and they're really delicious.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:37.310
So, you know, I'm sure that
those [foreign word] had their

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.230
origin elsewhere.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.150
And they were a typical
food of the shepherds

00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.470
who passed through the area.

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:45.090
And they're delicious.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:48.500
So slow food, when I was
working on preserving Italy,

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.640
I spoke with a number
of food artisans.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.820
And I profiled a few in the book.

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:57.790
But some of them work with the slow
food movement and an organization.

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:00.780
And one of the wonderful things
that they're doing is they are,

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.340
they have been working to preserve,
you know, specific varieties

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.250
of tomatoes, or artichokes,
or beans.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.990
And they're not just
doing this in Italy,

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:12.730 position:56%
they're doing this around the world.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:18.620
So these traditions and these
foods are not lost to us.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.460
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: You could also
join Slow Food D.C. We have a

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:21.760
local chapter.

They give something called the
snail of approval to local purveyors

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:27.210
and restaurants who use
local, sustainable ways.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:30.160
So if you're here, it's
a great thing to do.

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.030

with this great quote.

We'd love to take questions,
if you have them.

Yes, ma'am.

&gt;&gt; Okay, I always have
multi-parted questions.

weekend, I at [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Reginetti.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.060

Oh, reginetti.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.400
&gt;&gt; Yes, [inaudible]?

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.450
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: So
that's a great question.

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:07.050
And I don't know if
there's a specific answer.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:10.280
There's all the varieties
of dried pasta.

00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.020
And then all the varieties
of fresh pasta.

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.940
So where did you have
your reginetti?

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.240
&gt;&gt; In New York.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.540
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: In New York.

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.440 position:56%
So I wonder if it was a fresh pasta?

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.740
&gt;&gt; It was fresh.

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: It was fresh.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.340
What does it -- what
did it look like?

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:26.820
&gt;&gt; Like a little kind
of squiggled ribbons,

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.180
kind of twisted, with
a scalloped edge.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.840
And, you know, maybe a --

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Yeah, I mean,

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.370
especially in the last
couple of decades.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.560
The shapes have -- there have
just been more and more shapes

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:41.470
that come out, and
they're very whimsical.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.840
And some are traditional,
but many these days are not

00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.140
traditional anymore.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.520
I mean, there's a shape
now that I see

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.890
in stores, called the calamarata.

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:52.710
And it looks like a calamari ring

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.510
and you serve it with
a seafood sauce.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:57.080
But, you know, when I was
growing up, that didn't exist.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.010
So I don't know if
there's an answer.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.310
I would say hundreds.

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.490
I mean, yeah, honestly.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:06.910
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: But also,
sometimes people take pastas

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:09.430
that are traditionally made fresh.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:11.970
And they make them into a
dry pasta, or vice versa.

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:13.270
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Right.

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:14.570
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: One that's
normally dry, then they'll start,

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.030
in a restaurant, they'll say,
oh, we want to do that fresh.

00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:17.970
But in Italy, there
might not be a tradition

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.860
of making that pasta fresh.

00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:24.020
That happens too.

&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Yeah.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.160
&gt;&gt; And the second part
of my question is,

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.020
exactly what does antipasto mean?

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:37.280
And why is it called -- why is
mortadella called mortadella?

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.580
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti:
So antipasto is --

00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:40.200
anti is before, pasta,
before the meal.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.510 position:56%
So it's your appetizer, essentially.

the 20th century, in Rome,

Alfredo, and the recipe came

to be known as Alfredo sauce.

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.830
&gt;&gt; Amy Riolo: Very controversial.

01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:56.130
Any other questions.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.340
Well, we thank you all for --

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.140
&gt;&gt; Domenica Marchetti: Yeah, thank
you so much for coming, everybody.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.300
[ Applause ]

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.950
&gt;&gt; Lucia Wolf: Thank
you all for coming.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:11.950
I am going to introduce Renato
Miracco, the cultural attaché

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:14.100
of the Italian embassy
in Washington,

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:19.340
D.C. Because he will give us some
conclusions about this event.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:20.640
&gt;&gt; Renato Miracco: Thank you.

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.940
Thank you.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.320
Thank you, Lucia, I
really, really thank you.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.880
As you know, this is the first day

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:31.470
of the Italian Cuisine
in the United States.

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:35.220
They decide just to have
during the Thanksgiving week.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:37.240
But I say, are you getting crazy?

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:40.910
During the Thanksgiving week,

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:44.880
we cannot have just the Italian
Cuisine in United States.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.780
So we decide just to anticipate.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:51.650
And thank you to Domenica, thank
you to Amy, it was really amazing.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:56.170
This is really the
big start of the week.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.010
This will be just only the start.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:03.630 position:56%
Maybe next year will be, we have
much more time, just to think about,

01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:06.460
just some news about cuisine.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.630
We started, anyway, we started
with the Library of Congress.

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:13.050
And I'm really honored just
to be a partner of this one,

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.450
with the Library of Congress.

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:20.420
We started just idea to have just
the new idea of food, in September,

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.170
when we were part of a festival.

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:29.750
National festival book, with two
events related to Italian cuisine.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:36.380
So, and we thought about why
we can give just a new images

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.680
of Italian cuisine.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:43.170
Because the mix of
generation, the mix of culture.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:47.100
The mix of people all
over the world.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:52.690
And then we have to update
the idea of Italian cuisine.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:58.600
In the meantime, we have to
preserve old Italian cuisine.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.200
And this is another
project that I'm leading.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:05.830
So preserving our heritage
is another thing

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:12.040
that the Italian Embassy at
UNESCO are doing this year, 2016.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.970
And we'll do in '17 and '18.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:16.620
What doesn't mean that just

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.660
to preserve our culture,
preserve our monuments.

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:25.300
Preserve, in the meantime,
our recipe, our smell.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.850
Something that we can give
to the next generation.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:31.790
So Eliza will be there.

01:04:31.790 --> 01:04:34.730
Sign if you would like to,
and thank you for coming.

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:39.280
And thank you, really, Lucia, to
host another beautiful event here.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.510
I thank you too, both of you.

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:57.260
