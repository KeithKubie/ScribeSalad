00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.556
Isn't it fascinating how the simple act
of drawing a line on the map

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.452
can transform the way we see
and experience the world?

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:24.778
And how those spaces
in between lines, borders,

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.556
become places.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.260
They become places
where language and food and music

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:34.408
and people of different cultures
rub up against each other

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:39.712
in beautiful and sometimes violent
and occasionally really ridiculous ways.

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.165
And those lines drawn on a map

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.636
can actually create
scars in the landscape,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.981
and they can create scars in our memories.

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:50.551
My interest in borders came about

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:54.081
when I was searching
for an architecture of the borderlands.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.577
And I was working on several projects
along the US-Mexico border,

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.125
designing buildings made out of mud
taken right from the ground.

00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:07.484
And I also work on projects that you
might say immigrated to this landscape.

00:01:07.508 --> 00:01:09.833
"Prada Marfa," a land-art sculpture

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:12.857
that crosses the border
between art and architecture,

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:16.324
and it demonstrated to me
that architecture could communicate ideas

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:19.699
that are much more
politically and culturally complex,

00:01:19.723 --> 00:01:24.272
that architecture could be satirical
and serious at the same time

00:01:24.296 --> 00:01:27.297
and it could speak to the disparities
between wealth and poverty

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.145
and what's local and what's foreign.

00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:34.065
And so in my search
for an architecture of the borderlands,

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:35.788
I began to wonder,

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:37.960
is the wall architecture?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.654
I began to document my thoughts
and visits to the wall

00:01:44.678 --> 00:01:48.227
by creating a series of souvenirs

00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:52.910
to remind us of the time
when we built a wall

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:55.068
and what a crazy idea that was.

00:01:56.112 --> 00:01:57.858
I created border games,

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.405
(Laughter)

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:00.707
postcards,

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:04.945
snow globes with little architectural
models inside of them,

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:10.937
and maps that told the story
of resilience at the wall

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:15.636
and sought for ways that design
could bring to light the problems

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.516
that the border wall was creating.

00:02:18.777 --> 00:02:21.325
So, is the wall architecture?

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.626
Well, it certainly is a design structure,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.332
and it's designed at a research
facility called FenceLab,

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.364
where they would load vehicles
with 10,000 pounds

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:32.547
and ram them into the wall
at 40 miles an hour

00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.642
to test the wall's impermeability.

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.924
But there was also counter-research
going on on the other side,

00:02:37.948 --> 00:02:40.218
the design of portable drawbridges

00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:42.243
that you could bring right up to the wall

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:44.270
and allow vehicles to drive right over.

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:46.265
(Laughter)

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.457
And like with all research projects,
there are successes

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:50.900
and there are failures.

00:02:50.924 --> 00:02:52.281
(Laughter)

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:55.647
But it's these medieval
reactions to the wall --

00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.948
drawbridges, for example --

00:02:57.972 --> 00:03:02.906
that are because the wall itself is
an arcane, medieval form of architecture.

00:03:03.613 --> 00:03:09.112
It's an overly simplistic response
to a complex set of issues.

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:12.945
And a number of medieval technologies
have sprung up along the wall:

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:16.748
catapults that launch
bales of marijuana over the wall

00:03:16.772 --> 00:03:17.773
(Laughter)

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:21.438
or cannons that shoot packets
of cocaine and heroin over the wall.

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:24.223
Now during medieval times,

00:03:24.247 --> 00:03:26.635
diseased, dead bodies

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.706
were sometimes catapulted over walls
as an early form of biological warfare,

00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:33.338
and it's speculated that today,

00:03:34.544 --> 00:03:40.123
humans are being propelled over the wall
as a form of immigration.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:42.384
A ridiculous idea.

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:49.130
But the only person ever known to be
documented to have launched over the wall

00:03:49.154 --> 00:03:51.038
from Mexico to the United States

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:53.172
was in fact a US citizen,

00:03:53.196 --> 00:03:57.702
who was given permission
to human-cannonball over the wall,

00:03:57.726 --> 00:03:58.877
200 feet,

00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.973
so long as he carried his passport in hand

00:04:00.997 --> 00:04:02.980
(Laughter)

00:04:03.004 --> 00:04:06.083
and he landed safely in a net
on the other side.

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:12.116
And my thoughts are inspired
by a quote by the architect Hassan Fathy,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.382
who said,

00:04:13.406 --> 00:04:15.851
"Architects do not design walls,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.999
but the spaces between them."

00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:21.459
So while I do not think that architects
should be designing walls,

00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:25.205
I do think it's important and urgent
that they should be paying attention

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.976
to those spaces in between.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.785
They should be designing for the places
and the people, the landscapes

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:33.261
that the wall endangers.

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:37.419
Now, people are already
rising to this occasion,

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:42.323
and while the purpose of the wall
is to keep people apart and away,

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:46.180
it's actually bringing people together
in some really remarkable ways,

00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:49.625
holding social events like
binational yoga classes along the border,

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:52.362
to bring people together
across the divide.

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:54.167
I call this the monument pose.

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:55.426
(Laughter)

00:04:56.388 --> 00:04:59.642
And have you ever heard of "wall y ball"?

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:01.070
(Laughter)

00:05:01.094 --> 00:05:06.958
It's a borderland version of volleyball,
and it's been played since 1979

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:08.396
(Laughter)

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.952
along the US-Mexico border

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.418
to celebrate binational heritage.

00:05:12.442 --> 00:05:14.860
And it raises some
interesting questions, right?

00:05:14.884 --> 00:05:16.995
Is such a game even legal?

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:21.700
Does hitting a ball back and forth
over the wall constitute illegal trade?

00:05:21.724 --> 00:05:23.951
(Laughter)

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:28.898
The beauty of volleyball
is that it transforms the wall

00:05:28.922 --> 00:05:31.286
into nothing more than a line in the sand

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.453
negotiated by the minds and bodies
and spirits of players on both sides.

00:05:36.406 --> 00:05:40.641
And I think it's exactly
these kinds of two-sided negotiations

00:05:40.665 --> 00:05:43.842
that are needed to bring down
walls that divide.

00:05:44.715 --> 00:05:47.882
Now, throwing the ball
over the wall is one thing,

00:05:47.906 --> 00:05:50.303
but throwing rocks over the wall

00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:53.379
has caused damage
to Border Patrol vehicles

00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:56.566
and have injured Border Patrol agents,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.153
and the response from the US side
has been drastic.

00:05:59.177 --> 00:06:02.710
Border Patrol agents
have fired through the wall,

00:06:02.734 --> 00:06:05.280
killing people throwing rocks
on the Mexican side.

00:06:06.906 --> 00:06:09.280
And another response
by Border Patrol agents

00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:12.768
is to erect baseball backstops
to protect themselves and their vehicles.

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:16.948
And these backstops
became a permanent feature

00:06:16.972 --> 00:06:18.815
in the construction of new walls.

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.329
And I began to wonder if, like volleyball,

00:06:22.353 --> 00:06:26.558
maybe baseball should be
a permanent feature at the border,

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:28.912
and walls could start opening up,

00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:31.964
allowing communities
to come across and play,

00:06:31.988 --> 00:06:33.631
and if they hit a home run,

00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:36.635
maybe a Border Patrol agent would
pick up the ball and throw it

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:37.994
back over to the other side.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:43.966
A Border Patrol agent buys
a raspado, a frozen treat,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.641
from a vendor just a couple feet away,

00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:49.235
food and money is exchanged
through the wall,

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:55.212
an entirely normal event
made illegal by that line drawn on a map

00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:58.213
and a couple millimeters of steel.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.054
And this scene reminded me of a saying:

00:07:02.078 --> 00:07:05.046
"If you have more than you need,
you should build longer tables

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.922
and not higher walls."

00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:10.451
So I created this souvenir to remember
the moment that we could share

00:07:10.475 --> 00:07:12.498
food and conversation across the divide.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:17.074
A swing allows one to enter
and swing over to the other side

00:07:17.098 --> 00:07:19.854
until gravity deports them back
to their own country.

00:07:20.817 --> 00:07:23.342
The border and the border wall

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:27.595
is thought of as a sort of
political theater today,

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.983
so perhaps we should invite
audiences to that theater,

00:07:32.007 --> 00:07:34.674
to a binational theater
where people can come together

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:37.967
with performers, musicians.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.947
Maybe the wall is nothing more
than an enormous instrument,

00:07:41.971 --> 00:07:45.677
the world's largest xylophone,
and we could play down this wall

00:07:45.701 --> 00:07:47.500
with weapons of mass percussion.

00:07:47.524 --> 00:07:49.439
(Laughter)

00:07:50.492 --> 00:07:52.915
When I envisioned this binational library,

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:56.130
I wanted to imagine a space
where one could share

00:07:56.154 --> 00:08:01.049
books and information
and knowledge across a divide,

00:08:01.073 --> 00:08:03.717
where the wall was nothing more
than a bookshelf.

00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.979
And perhaps the best way to illustrate
the mutual relationship that we have

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:10.299
with Mexico and the United States

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.021
is by imagining a teeter-totter,

00:08:13.045 --> 00:08:16.606
where the actions on one side
had a direct consequence

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.853
on what happens on the other side,

00:08:18.877 --> 00:08:20.890
because you see, the border itself

00:08:20.914 --> 00:08:25.157
is both a symbolic and literal fulcrum
for US-Mexico relations,

00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:28.831
and building walls between neighbors
severs those relationships.

00:08:30.047 --> 00:08:34.222
You probably remember this quote,
"Good fences make good neighbors."

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:37.872
It's often thought of as the moral
of Robert Frost's poem "Mending Wall."

00:08:39.316 --> 00:08:43.451
But the poem is really about questioning
the need for building walls at all.

00:08:44.171 --> 00:08:46.797
It's really a poem about mending
human relationships.

00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:49.790
My favorite line is the first one:

00:08:49.814 --> 00:08:52.083
"Something there is
that doesn't love a wall."

00:08:53.313 --> 00:08:55.741
Because if there's one thing
that's clear to me --

00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:58.412
there are not two sides defined by a wall.

00:08:58.436 --> 00:09:00.367
This is one landscape, divided.

00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.060
On one side, it might look like this.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:07.016
A man is mowing his lawn
while the wall is looming in his backyard.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.640
And on the other side,
it might look like this.

00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:12.877
The wall is the fourth wall
of someone's house.

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:17.029
But the reality is that the wall
is cutting through people's lives.

00:09:18.278 --> 00:09:21.227
It is cutting through
our private property,

00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:22.402
our public lands,

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:24.441
our Native American lands, our cities,

00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.424
a university,

00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:28.392
our neighborhoods.

00:09:29.077 --> 00:09:30.905
And I couldn't help but wonder

00:09:30.929 --> 00:09:33.635
what it would be like if the wall
cut through a house.

00:09:34.789 --> 00:09:37.366
Remember those disparities
between wealth and poverty?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.327
On the right is the average size
of a house in El Paso, Texas,

00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:43.184
and on the left is the average size
of a house in Juarez.

00:09:43.794 --> 00:09:46.692
And here, the wall cuts directly
through the kitchen table.

00:09:47.747 --> 00:09:50.516
And here, the wall cuts through
the bed in the bedroom.

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:55.443
Because I wanted to communicate
how the wall is not only dividing places,

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:58.171
it's dividing people,
it's dividing families.

00:09:58.195 --> 00:10:00.402
And the unfortunate politics of the wall

00:10:00.426 --> 00:10:04.002
is today, it is dividing children
from their parents.

00:10:04.647 --> 00:10:07.432
You might be familiar
with this well-known traffic sign.

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:11.120
It was designed
by graphic designer John Hood,

00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:12.898
a Native American war veteran

00:10:12.922 --> 00:10:15.542
working for the California
Department of Transportation.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:19.906
And he was tasked with creating
a sign to warn motorists

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.581
of immigrants who were stranded
alongside the highway

00:10:22.605 --> 00:10:24.890
and who might attempt
to run across the road.

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:29.780
Hood related the plight
of the immigrant today

00:10:29.804 --> 00:10:32.280
to that of the Navajo
during the Long Walk.

00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:36.415
And this is really a brilliant piece
of design activism.

00:10:37.796 --> 00:10:38.946
And he was very careful

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:42.607
in thinking about using
a little girl with pigtails, for example,

00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:46.909
because he thought that's who motorists
might empathize with the most,

00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:51.419
and he used the silhouette
of the civil rights leader Cesar Chavez

00:10:51.443 --> 00:10:53.321
to create the head of the father.

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.516
I wanted to build upon
the brilliance of this sign

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.929
to call attention to the problem
of child separation at the border,

00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:02.810
and I made one very simple move.

00:11:02.834 --> 00:11:05.119
I turned the families to face each other.

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:06.844
And in the last few weeks,

00:11:06.868 --> 00:11:09.956
I've had the opportunity
to bring that sign back to the highway

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.749
to tell a story,

00:11:11.773 --> 00:11:15.496
the story of the relationships
that we should be mending

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.921
and a reminder that we should be designing

00:11:17.945 --> 00:11:20.984
a reunited states
and not a divided states.

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:22.666
Thank you.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:26.960
(Applause)
