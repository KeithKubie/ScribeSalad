00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:03.254
- [Instructor] We're told
that a large tire spins

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:06.808
with angular velocity four omega.

00:00:06.808 --> 00:00:11.239
A smaller tire spins with
half the angular velocity.

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:13.157
I'm assuming half the angular velocity

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:14.835
of the large tire.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.740
How does the period T
sub-large of the large tire

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.201
compare with the period T
sub-small of the small tire?

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:25.623
So pause this video and see

00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:27.229
if you can figure that out and figure out

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.980
which choice you would pick.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.836
Okay, so the key here is
to realize the connection

00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:35.620
between angular velocity and period.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.970
And instead of just blindly
memorizing the formula,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.394
I always like to reason
it through a little bit.

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.037
We know that period is equal to,

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:44.080
well think about it.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.961
In order to complete
one cycle, if I'm doing

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:48.144
uniform circular motion, if I am going

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:50.573
in a circle around like this,

00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:54.260
in order to do one complete
lap around the circle,

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.734
or to complete one cycle, I
have to cover two pi radians.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:00.251
So two pi radians is what I need to cover,

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.872
and then I divide that
by my angular velocity,

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:05.714
how fast am I going through the radians.

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:08.859
So that's how I like to
reason through this formula

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:11.683
that connects angular
velocity, or the magnitude

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:14.507
of angular velocity, and the period.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.787
And so, we can say T sub-large,

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:18.550
I'll do some two different colors,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.467
we can say T sub-large,

00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:26.860
T sub-large is going to
be equal to two pi over,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.161
it says a large tire spins

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.811
with angular velocity four omega,

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:32.447
so it's going to be two pi,

00:01:32.447 --> 00:01:35.484
its angular velocity is four omega,

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:37.493
so two pi over four omega.

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:40.136
And then T sub-small, a smaller tire spins

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:44.053
with half the angular
velocity, so T sub-small,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:48.248
T sub-small is going
to be equal to two pi,

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:50.681
and it's going to have
half the angular velocity

00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:53.439
as the large tire, so
that half of four omega

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.522
is two omega.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:57.601
So how do these two things compare?

00:01:57.601 --> 00:01:59.680
Well it might be helpful to just simplify

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.835
these expressions a little bit.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:05.389
So T sub-large, the
period of the large tire,

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:08.139
is going to be pi over two omega,

00:02:09.588 --> 00:02:12.968
and T sub-small, the
period of the smaller tire,

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:16.135
that's just going to be pi over omega.

00:02:17.288 --> 00:02:20.072
And so, the red expression right over here

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.959
is half of this blue expression.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.907
I can rewrite this as being
equal to one half times,

00:02:26.907 --> 00:02:29.324
one half times pi over omega.

00:02:30.413 --> 00:02:31.702
Or another way of writing this,

00:02:31.702 --> 00:02:34.607
I could write T sub-large,

00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:37.992
T sub-large is equal to one half times,

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:39.373
this expression right over here

00:02:39.373 --> 00:02:43.540
is the period of the smaller
tire, so T sub-small.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.175
Now which of these
choices match up to that?

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:49.199
Well it is this one right over here:

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.108
the period of the larger
tire is going to be

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:54.441
one half the period of the smaller tire.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:57.537
Now, it's always nice
if you have the time,

00:02:57.537 --> 00:02:59.512
if you aren't under time pressure,

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:01.987
to just think about
whether that makes sense.

00:03:01.987 --> 00:03:05.368
So a large tire spins
with an angular velocity

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:07.680
of four omega; the smaller tire spins

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.444
with half the angular velocity.

00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:13.167
So, if it has half the angular velocity,

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.168
it's rotating half as fast.

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:18.098
If it's rotating half as fast,

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:21.999
it would take twice as
long to complete one cycle.

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.040
So the smaller tire is
gonna take twice as long,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.027
or you could view it as the large tire

00:03:26.027 --> 00:03:28.539
takes half as long as the small tire.

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:30.094
So that makes sense.

00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:32.177
Let's do another example.

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:38.039
An ice skater spins with
angular velocity two omega.

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.273
She brings her arms away from her body,

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:43.922
decreasing her angular velocity to omega.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:47.254
How does the frequency of her spin change?

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:49.182
Once again pause this video and see

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:52.133
if you can figure that out on your own.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:54.182
Well let's just think about how frequency

00:03:54.182 --> 00:03:57.218
is connected to angular velocity.

00:03:57.218 --> 00:03:59.627
We already know that period
from the last question

00:03:59.627 --> 00:04:02.547
is equal to, or you'll have
to complete two pi radians

00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:04.715
to complete a cycle, and
then we can divide that

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:07.965
by how quickly our angle is increasing.

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:11.013
And so, there you have it.

00:04:11.013 --> 00:04:11.846
That's our period.

00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:14.215
It's two pi over our angular velocity.

00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:15.982
And if we want frequency, frequency

00:04:15.982 --> 00:04:17.954
is just the reciprocal of period.

00:04:17.954 --> 00:04:22.121
So frequency is just going
to be omega over two pi.

00:04:24.005 --> 00:04:27.327
This is how many cycles we
can complete in a second.

00:04:27.327 --> 00:04:30.632
And so, at first the ice skater spins

00:04:30.632 --> 00:04:33.514
with an angular velocity of two omega.

00:04:33.514 --> 00:04:36.994
So let's say frequency, let's call it

00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:39.244
frequency initial, initial,

00:04:41.175 --> 00:04:42.958
is going to be equal to,

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.177
her angular velocity is two omega,

00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:48.273
it's going to be two omega over two pi.

00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:52.250
And then her frequency final I'll say,

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.583
frequency final,

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.451
so after she puts her
arms away from her body

00:04:57.451 --> 00:04:59.085
decreasing her angular velocity,

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:00.713
and we'll talk more about that phenomena

00:05:00.713 --> 00:05:03.280
in other videos, is going to be,

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.025
so decreasing her angular
velocity to omega,

00:05:06.025 --> 00:05:08.971
so now her angular velocity is omega,

00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:10.991
and it's gonna be over two pi.

00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:12.658
So do these compare?

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:15.493
Well if I write her initial frequency,

00:05:15.493 --> 00:05:19.016
I can rewrite it as initial frequency,

00:05:19.016 --> 00:05:22.933
initial frequency, is
equal to two times omega,

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:26.511
I'm gonna do that in another color,

00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:28.844
two times omega over two pi.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.437
Right?

00:05:32.437 --> 00:05:35.392
Two times all of this
business right over here.

00:05:35.392 --> 00:05:37.504
Which is the exact same thing,

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:41.337
which is equal to two
times our final frequency.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.837
Two times our frequency final.

00:05:45.885 --> 00:05:48.001
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:51.418
her frequency final, her frequency final,

00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:55.821
if I divide this and this by two,

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:58.229
is going to be equal to one half

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.145
of her frequency initial,

00:06:00.145 --> 00:06:02.812
is going to be equal to one half

00:06:04.203 --> 00:06:07.870
of her initial frequency,
frequency initial.

00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:12.658
If your initial frequency
is twice your final,

00:06:12.658 --> 00:06:14.955
then your final is going to
be one half your initial.

00:06:14.955 --> 00:06:17.672
I could just divide both sides by two.

00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:20.455
So once again how does the
frequency of her spin change?

00:06:20.455 --> 00:06:22.521
Well it looks like her frequency goes

00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.092
by half, and that makes sense.

00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:27.202
If your angular velocity
is going down by half,

00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:29.376
you are rotating half as fast

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.809
and so you're going to be able to complete

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:33.024
half as many cycles per second.

00:06:33.024 --> 00:06:35.600
So it makes sense that we are decreasing,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.783
our frequency is decreasing

00:06:37.783 --> 00:06:40.080
by a factor of two, it is halving.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.448
Decreasing by a factor
of two is the same thing

00:06:42.448 --> 00:06:46.615
as saying your frequency
gets multiplied by one half.
