--"would make beings able to
comprehend the cosmic story,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.060
and that we'd keep looking
into the dark energy of what we

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.360
don't know for something
we perceive that isn't."

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.070
Regents' Professor,
Alison Hawthorne Deming,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.860
spent her childhood in
the idyllic countryside

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.310
of Connecticut exploring
the surrounding forest

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.820
and helping her father
tend the family garden.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.090
They were writers,
they were performers.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.720
They took me to concerts, they
got me dance lessons and piano

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.160
lessons, and--

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.400
so I grew up feeling like
the arts and nature, that's

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.090
just what life is--
those two things.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.670
An excellent student,
she kept journals

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.740
and was a voracious reader.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.950
Her parents encouraged
her to pursue her writing.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.860
Was accepted to go
to Brown University.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.960
I had done a program
for gifted students

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.080
at Trinity College studying
Latin between my junior year

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.270
and senior year of high school.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.990
And then, I dropped out of
college because I was pregnant.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.502
And I had a child.

00:01:17.502 --> 00:01:20.280
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.610
She moved out with her daughter
to Vermont, and for 10 years,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.920
worked in the state's
first Planned Parenthood

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.360
clinic, all the while still
writing in her spare time.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.870
And I decided that I
would make the commitment

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.350
to see what I could
do with my writing.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.660
I left the public health work.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.170
I got an MFA degree
from the Vermont College

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.790
of Fine Arts, which made me
do some extra work because I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.890
didn't have the BA.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.490
I got that degree, and
that really catalyzed me.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.070
After that, things
began to open up for me

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.330
in ways that were very
rewarding, considering

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.150
the detour in my education.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.570
Her most recent books are the
poetry collection Stairway

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.780
to Heaven and Death Valley--

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.250
Painted Light.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.440
A Guggenheim Fellow,
she is the winner

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.580
of the Walt Whitman Award of
the Academy of American poets.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.930
I'm trying to find a truth.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.660
I'm trying to find a
deeper understanding.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.820
I'm trying to find a
deeper way to reflect

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.110
the complexity of emotion
that we feel about nature.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.970
I think it's a tremendous
loss to the human spirit

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.720
not to be exercising
our strongest

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.450
obligation to the planet
that's given us a home,

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.090
and doing everything we
can to nurture it and have

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.720
it continue.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.600
Deming came to
the U of A in 1990

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.270
as the director of
the Poetry Center,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.000
then housed in a series of
rundown bungalows on Cherry

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.580
Avenue.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.470
Of the many things
that Alison has been,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.115
she's a supremely
skillful administrator,

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:00.510
and she's a fantastic professor.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.090
She's been a steward
and a community member.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.970
And across all of
those things, she

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.010
does it with a
generosity and a grace

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.320
that I find
enormously compelling

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.120
and something to aspire to.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.880
Any young person,
or any aged person,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.482
who wants to devote a life to
the arts and make a go of it,

00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:21.270
[AUDIO OUT] respect, and--

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.810
you know, it's an honor
to try to mentor them.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.000
Deming spends a part of each
year in the family fishing

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.750
shack on the Canadian
island of Grand Manan.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.552
Nobody's very impressed that
I'm a writer or a professor.

00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:35.010
I'm just, you know,
someone they've

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.220
known since I was a
little girl, and--

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.980
Along with her traveling,
teaching, and writing,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.970
Deming is also a serious
student of jazz piano.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.100
Here's something my
piano teacher told me--

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.720
Stravinsky said, if you give
me form, you give me freedom.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.470
And that's kind of
what jazz is all about.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.630
You've got the form,
and once you have that,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.980
you can go anywhere with it.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.080
You know where you're
going to come back to.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.700
And I think that's a really
helpful paradigm in writing.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.880
And, particularly, in the essay,
which can just ramble all over

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.880
and be very meditative
and go off, and you think,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.370
what actually am
I writing about?

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.870
It's very much like a jazz riff.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.600
And then you can come back
to the form, or the melody

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.100
or the--

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.250
