00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.460
Why do spiral galaxies have arms?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.069
Is it to hug us?

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.080
Hello star citizens, Trace for DNews.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.590
When you think of the Milky way, you probably
picture that familiar spiral shape we’ve

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.920
all come to know and love.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.599
That spiral structure is very common for galaxies
- over three quarters of the one’s we’ve

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.039
observed are in this pinwheel shape - and
our own galaxy is actually in a subgroup called

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.720
barred spiral galaxies.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.330
But how exactly spiral galaxies get their
shape is still up for debate.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.620
Most galaxies spin around a central point,
usually a supermassive black hole.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.890
It’s tempting to think that those spiral
arms are practically solid structures, with

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.390
the same stars all sticking together as they
revolve around the center of the galaxy.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.920
If that were true, that would mean that the
stars on the tips of the arms have to move

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.330
faster than the stars near the center to keep
up.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.780
This doesn’t jive well with the laws of
physics.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.780
In reality, objects move faster when they’re
closer to the point they’re orbiting around,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.990
otherwise they’d lose the battle with gravity
and get sucked in.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.600
This is Kepler’s third law, and it’s why
Earth’s orbit takes a year while Mercury’s

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.220
is just 88 days.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.240
This means though that if the arms were made
up of the same stars, then as the galaxy rotates,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.350
the arms would get stretched out and wound
up like they were in a cosmic taffy machine.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.860
Our sun takes around 250 million years to
do a lap of the galaxy, which sounds like

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.280
a long time but on an astronomical timescale
is pretty quick.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.030
At those speeds spiral galaxies should wind
their arms into oblivion before any appreciable

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500
length of time, and we shouldn’t be observing
as many of these galaxies as we do.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.600
Astronomers call this the wind-up problem,
and they’ve come up with two explanations

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.190
for the arms.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.890
One is that the arms aren’t material, but
are actually the product of a density wave.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.390
As stars travel around the galaxy, they’ll
come to areas where they’ll bunch up for

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.840
a while and then areas where they’re more
spread out.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.560
This means that even though the stars are
moving inside the arms, the arms themselves

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.740
look pretty stationary.14 You can think of
it like a traffic jam: from afar the jam appears

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.140
to stay in one place on the highway, but the
cars that make up that jam are actually flowing

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.140
through it.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.030
What would cause these density waves in the
first place is still hotly debated.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.970
Astronomers have found that spiral arms could
be caused by other nearby galaxies, or driven

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.150
by the large bar shape at the center of some
galaxies.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.450
But bars and companion galaxies are not universal,
so explaining galaxies that have neither with

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.390
the density wave model is tricky.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.920
The other popular explanation is Stochastic
Self-Propagating Star Formation, but its friends

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.060
call it SSPSF.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.090
The basic idea behind it is: star formation
in a galaxy, causes a shock wave, that kicks

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.890
off more star formation.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.840
The rotation of the galaxy stretches the bright
new stars into the familiar spiral arms, and

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.900
they burn out and die as the chain reaction
propagates and the arms move on.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.390
It’s possible SSPSF and the density wave
model actually work together, and stars are

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.240
formed in the denser areas, making the arms
look brighter with their hot new stars.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.580
So those are the most accepted explanations
of spiral formation, but confirming them can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.610
only be answered after hundreds of millions
of years of observation.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.760
So if you’re looking for a career with job
security, might I suggest astronomy?

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.290
For a long time we thought we were the only
galaxy, and then we found Andromeda.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:40.150

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.840
Space is a big topic and there are lots of
questions to explore.
