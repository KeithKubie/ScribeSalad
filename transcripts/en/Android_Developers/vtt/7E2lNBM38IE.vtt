00:00:00.948 --> 00:00:05.200
MALE SPEAKER 1: Hmm, this
all looks so delectable.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.489
How does anyone choose?

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:07.780
MALE SPEAKER 2: Carefully, sir.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.580
There's some exquisite new
choices in the 23.2 menu.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.410
I definitely recommend the
DayNight theme from AppCompat.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.576
MALE SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:19.945
Do you have anything that's
fresh, like fresh, fresh?

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:22.730
MALE SPEAKER 2: I think we
might have something for you.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.800
If you're looking for
totally new features

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.670
or important
improvements, version 23.2

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.490
of the Android Support
Library doesn't disappoint.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.030
There's two new additions to
the Support Library family--

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.155
support-vector-drawable
and support animated vector

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.290
drawable.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250
These bring the power and
flexibility of vector drawables

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.950
to all API 7 and higher
devices, and animated vector

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.860
drawables to all API
11 and higher devices.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.570
I expect smaller APKs
from you as you all

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.500
replace multiple PNG assets
with a single vector drawable.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.460
AppCompat is already taking
advantage of vector drawables

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.340
in this release to save
everyone some space.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.570
And it provides a handy
source Compat attribute

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.470
for image views
and image buttons,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.360
making it easy to use
your new vector drawables.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.010
Check out our blog post for all
the details on how this works.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.620
Now, that's not all that
changed with AppCompat, though.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.845
In addition to the
current Theme.AppCompat

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:19.930
and Theme.AppCompat.Light,
there's

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.040
a new Theme.AppCompat.DayNight
theme specifically

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.460
for API 14 and higher devices.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.480
Now making a UI that
adapts to the time of day

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.010
just means picking the right
theme and testing thoroughly.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.850
You'll be able to manually
change between day and night

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.980
at the app level
or activity level

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.610
with new methods in AppCompat
Delegate, perfect for testing

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.020
or even as a setting you
expose to your users.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.560
Another new feature in
23.2 is the addition

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
to the Android Design Support
Library-- bottom sheets.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.530
[FANFARE]

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.280
Now, this coordinator layer
behavior attaches to any view,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.400
allows you to drag it
open and closed, peak

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.200
or hide completely.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.830
There's even a BottomSheetDialog
and BottomSheetDialogFragment

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.314
for easily styling a
dialogue as a bottom sheet.

00:02:09.314 --> 00:02:09.814
Magical.

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:10.642
[HARPS PLAY]

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.360
Now, if you have a
media-playing app,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.470
you'll be happy to know
that this release also

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.240
includes
MediaBrowserServiceCompat

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.450
and MediaBrowserCompat,
allowing you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.100
to use previously only
Lollipop and higher APIs all

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.087
the way back to API 4.

00:02:26.087 --> 00:02:27.670
Whether you're looking
for an easy way

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.730
to connect your media
playback service to your UI,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.320
or looking to integrate with
Android Auto and Android Wear,

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.456
this is the API to look into.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:39.790
Of course, there's another
Android out there-- Android TV.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.270
The Leanback Support
Library's GuidedStepFragment,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.120
which lets you guide users
through a series of steps,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.200
has received a number
of enhancements.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.420
The blog has all the details
if that's your thing,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.050
as well as information on
all the other new features

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.040
in version 23.2.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.012
So have you made your selection?

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.720
MALE SPEAKER 1: Uh,
yeah, I think I have.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.990
I'm going to go for all of it.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.820
Thank you.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.990
MALE SPEAKER 2: There's
actually only one person

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.948
who's made it through
that ordeal successfully.

00:03:07.948 --> 00:03:11.220
