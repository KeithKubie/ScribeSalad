00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.180
With all the hubbub about CRISPR in the news,
it may feel like using it to pick your kids

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.170
eye-color is just around the corner.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.150
But this seemingly miraculous gene-editing
technology may not actually be as simple--or

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.299
as safe--as we thought.

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.940
Just so we’re all on the same page, CRISPR
(or more accurately CRISPR-cas9) works by

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.110
cutting the DNA of a cell at a designated
spot, say a section of DNA that represents

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.110
a certain gene.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.500
Then, when the cell tries to repair the damaged
DNA, it often ends up just disabling the gene

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.500
altogether.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.610
This has all kinds of uses.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.610
Maybe we want to turn off a gene that produces
too much of a certain protein?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.610
CRISPR can do that.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.500
Say we want to see what a certain gene even
does?

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.290
CRISPR can help us do that too.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.770
Ever since it was first used to edit living
cells in 2013, CRISPR has been touted as a

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.860
promising technology for treating inherited
disorders, cancer, and other diseases with

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.640
no current treatment options.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.270
Teams of researchers around the globe had
even hoped to begin human trials in 2018.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.390
But none of those trials have taken place
yet, with the exception of China, where researchers

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.149
have been working with CRISPR in humans since
2016--no results from these trials have been

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.550
published so far.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.352
And in the US, the FDA just placed a ‘clinical
hold’ on the first proposed CRISPR gene

00:01:07.352 --> 00:01:08.630
editing human trial.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.990
But why?

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.110
Several new studies released in the last few
months suggest we need to be more cautious

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.630
when editing the human genome.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.440
Two of these studies found that when CRISPR
performs its hallmark trick and cuts DNA,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.240
that damage can kill the cell, or make it
stop growing.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.600
CRISPR modifications are also less likely
to kill cells that have a defective version

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.380
of a gene called p53.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.500
P53 plays a role in preventing the onset of
cancer by regulating a cell’s life cycle,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.210
so by leaving more of the defective cells
alive than healthy ones*, CRISPR may be inadvertently

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.200
raising the risk of cancer in that patient.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.280
Which is, like, the opposite of the goal.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.700
And we haven’t even gotten to the most recent
study that raises concerns.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.270
Up until now, CRISPR-cas9’s cutting function
has been accurate in the specific area of

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.090
interest--the spot in the DNA that’s supposed
to be cut.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.950
But that’s because researchers were only
looking for mutations caused by CRISPR in

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.040
the immediate vicinity of the cut.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.090
New research reveals that in about 20% of
cells, CRISPR results in MUCH larger deletions

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.479
than we thought**-- up to more than 100 base
pairs.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.659
Researchers didn’t notice this before because
they were looking for harmful mutations and

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.370
didn’t see any...but that’s because the
entire region was gone.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.379
In CRISPR treatments that would target billions
of cells inside the human body, this could

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.180
lead to, again...a risk of cancer.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.819
Putting us right back at square one.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.779
So the human trials have been delayed...where
do we go from here?

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.300
CRISPR permanently alters your genome, so
we want to make sure we get it right before

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.079
we make moves in real human bodies.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.069
Well, science marches on.

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.859
New and improved versions of this kind of
technology are already racing forward, like

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.870
a genetic editing tool called REPAIR, which
uses a different cutting enzyme--Cas13.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.930
REPAIR works with RNA, instead of DNA, to
make temporary or reversible changes.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.930
There’s also a newly engineered protein
that can alter individual base pairs rather

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.170
than a whole chunk of DNA, acting more like
surgical forceps than a pair of kitchen scissors.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.150
So continued progress and exciting breakthroughs
in this field are still happening--we’re

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.139
not at the end of our CRISPR rope yet.

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.430
It’s just that we need to take a step back
from the hype and carefully analyze what’s

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.670
really going to be safe as we move forward.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.950
