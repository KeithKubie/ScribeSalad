[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.770
Hello.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:09.570
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.560
Welcome to "This Week in
Android Development" on

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.190
Monday, August 19, 2013.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980
Last week, the Android Developer
Relations team

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.320
visited London, serving up some
knowledge to students at

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.430
Android Camp and introducing the
GDG London to the world of

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.670
Android gaming.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.660
On this side of the pond, Chet
was back again for a look at

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.910
using cartoon animation
techniques in a brand new

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.180
"DevByte." While further south,
our Australian-based

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.880
colleagues invited you backstage
for a Q&amp;A on how to

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.420
make your apps beautiful.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.180
When not backstage, JF was front
and center, showing us

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.500
how to optimize layouts
with Hierarchy Viewer.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.170
And our favorite intern told us
everything we need to know

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990
about image pixelization.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.110
Next week, we have a flood of
new "DevBytes" for you,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.950
starting with a guide to
ListView dragging and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.390
rearranging with Daniel,
ensuring your apps work on

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.770
large display devices.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.030
And a new series of "DevBytes"
from yours truly as I explain

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.260
how to make your data transfers
more efficient.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.070
For fans of the longer format,
we've got a new "Android

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.730
Design in Action" this week.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.920
And Hack and Todd will be
getting their game on on a new

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.410
episode of "Game On!" They
will introduce you to the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.120
wonderful world of
OpenGL ES 3.0.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.280
That's all for "This Week in
Android Development." Be sure

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.275
to check out this week's
"DevBytes." And join us for

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.290
our live shows which you
can find, as always, at

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.110

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.230
And everyone is waiting,
waiting on you.
