Hi, I'm Lauren. I'm one of the instructors
for Introduction to Psychology.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.380
I want to use this course to show you
why I love psychology so much.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.100
Psychology helps us understand and answer
questions about thought and behavior.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.390
For example, how does operant conditioning
make Maddie here so excited

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.530
when I say, psychology!
Good girl, Maddie.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.760
Hi, I'm Greg. And I'm Susan,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.990
and we're also your instructors
for this general psychology course.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.680
You just saw Lauren provide an example
of operant conditioning with Maddie.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.920
But you're going to learn
much more in this course.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.530
You're also going to learn about things
such as sensation and perception,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.190
personality, and even mental disorders
and treatments for those disorders.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.260
But you don't actually need
a real background in psychology.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.600
All you need is a curiosity about
human behavior and human nature.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.845
And if you bring that
to this class, we promise

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.914
it'll be an exciting adventure for you.
