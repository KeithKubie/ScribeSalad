&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I add my equations together, I get 13x equals 26. Positive 8y and negative

00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:10.563
8y eliminate. They add to zero. Then, we divide both sides by 13. So, I know x

00:00:10.563 --> 00:00:15.662
is equal to 2. I found x, so now, I need to find y. I'm going to use this first

00:00:15.662 --> 00:00:21.486
equation, and write it over here, so I can substitute the value of x, which is 2

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:26.463
into this equation. So, plugging in a value of 2 for x, I get 7 times 2, which

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:31.182
is 14. The rest of my equation stays the same. I subtract 14 from both sides to

00:00:31.182 --> 00:00:36.022
get 8y equals negative 8. Remember, I have more negatives than positives here,

00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:40.122
so definitely negative 8. Then, we divide both sides by 8 to get y equals

00:00:40.122 --> 00:00:44.368
negative 1. We write a solution as a point. I'm not going to show the check for

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:47.407
this equation but you can always double check your answer.
