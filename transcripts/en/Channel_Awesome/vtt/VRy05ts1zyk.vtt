00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:07.679
Hello. I'm the nostalgia critic guy remember it so you don't have to well the big summer blockbusters are coming up and guess which ones

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.610
have the most hype

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.110
aside from that

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.030
that's like from that one [to]

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.590
For the sake of this joke. I'm gonna say the [avengers] and prometheus

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:24.029
yes, people are excited to see these two big films premiere and why shouldn't they be it got one film directed by Joss Whedon and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.029
another film about the Alien franchise

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.549
Quit so much build-up between these two movies you gotta wonder why nobody thought to put Joss Whedon and the alien franchise

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.579
together at some point oh my God Alien resurrection my

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.410
God

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.369
Yeah, how many of you knew [that] the geek got a Sci-Fi actually started off writing one of the dumbest Sci-Fi flicks ever to hit?

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.599
The screen the sequel was made in Fam response to the fact that nobody was satisfied with the last and supposed final alien

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.959
So they made this flake to try and end it on a stronger when really it was Hollywood's way of saying hey

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.419
You think that's a bad way than to franchise

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.619
Take a look at how else we can fuck up this turkey throw in the very natural

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.130
Selection of the director from Amelie and you get a film that surprisingly sluts out the dignity of alien creatures

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.670
Who are more Phallic shape than out? So let's see why in space nobody can hear you sock this is Alien resurrection

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.000
So they waste no time on the resurrection part

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.119
We see ripley played again by sigourney weaver brought back to life through cloning 200 years later after her death

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.269
Jesus bringing people back from 200 years ago there are so many rap battles that can evolve from this

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.780
she's brought back so that scientists can reproduce the alien creature that was implanted inside of her and

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.599
Seeing how this is a Joss whedon script I expect at least one of those mad scientist's [dancing] along

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.119
I'm looking at you warm tongue blood and guts

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.500
Slimy -

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.129
Shoulda Stopped at Movie -

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.509
Ripley is kept alive and flown in a [cell] until she regains consciousness

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.080
Now from a symbolic standpoint the bank represents rebirth and entering a new world of life

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.789
But from a reality standpoint. They're just dicks [fuckin] around with her

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.809
Hey, harry, you got the giant novelty condom from Spencer's yeah

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.879
Why don't we go ahead and put her inside it you've been dreaming about this [for] a while haven't so what if I have?

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.569
But we quickly see that this ripley is different from the one before

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.080
As some of her dna has mixed in with the alien and made her a different kind of creature for example

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080
She thinks the word fork his fuck

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.140
fork

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.459
Fuck she said fuck. It's funny. It's a queen. How did you know that? She'll breed?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.989
You'll die. I think you will find that

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.819
Things have changed a great deal since your time yes, like they have answered proof cells to keep the aliens in a way

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.708
They don't well at least they have a general who understands the scientific risks at stake. [oh] [wait]

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.039
They don't well at least they're not just relying on a bunch of space

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.559
Pirates to bring up their incredibly important card - oh for God's sakes this operations as airtight as a [strain] [door]

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.549
Yeah, things have come a long way since before but dumb is still dumb

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.209
Don't cut the [russel] about [600] meters and give a little scare so like I said before a bunch of renegade

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.060
Space Pirates bring prisoners for the scientists to use as breeding grounds for the aliens could you have a please sir?

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.529
What could you [answer] please by the way that's ron [perlman] that's one of the pilots there. No weapons allowed on board sir

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.620
my own recipe

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.149
Way [more] dangerous could I say my line any closer to the camera? [oh]?

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.329
When I [kick] the chair why yes that would make a lot of sense?

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.489
When own a writer playing the part of coal and truth be told I'm sorry

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.599
I'm just not that big a fan of her acting why because every scene

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.899
She's in looks like a five-year-old about to throw a temper tantrum

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.970
He's conducting illegal experiments, and you were planning on letting us this we can't trust her [I]

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.519
wanted ice cream

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.009
It doesn't take long for them to come across Ripley was just as eager to chew the scenery as the aliens are

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.889
Know if you don't want to play basketball. I know some other indoor sports come on now. Give me the ball

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240
I

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.669
Guess she's wearing her [ear]. Fuck [hughes] today

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.919
Yeah, I bet you didn't know that her alien Dna gave her super Spider-Man powers, [too]

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.139
The hell are you [ah]?

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:07.119
Yes, and the ability to shoot a basket without even looking no doubt another chilling [side-effect] of the alien Dna these things must have taken

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.120
her sports very seriously ah

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.929
[so] for a while, we see people on the ship Mosey around being boring

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.979
[I] think [this] is supposed to establish character development, but let's face it

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.970
We're just getting an early peek at the buff [any] we know these guys are Alien chow

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.309
We're just looking at the clock until they get munched on

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.990
Then there's bizarre shit like this you

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:50.950
[know] it's at moments like this where I realized the only reason we let brad dourif Act is because we're afraid of what he'll do

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.950
if he doesn't

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.210
I

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.329
Have a date with six-Year-old boy

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.920
Come on. You were putting the moves on him

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.120
Meanwhile cole tries to break into the security system. That is so high-tech and so

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.049
airtight that she has a key chain of choices [to] foil it with

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.650
Thank God. They didn't stage in one of the bajillion guards they have [onboard] this flying crock-pot

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.820
well

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.820
You're Gonna kill me or what?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.139
There's no point is there?

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:40.499
It's true. They'll keep making sequels without her you [got] to help me stop this thing before it gets loose

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.500
It's too late

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:54.840
You can't stop it. There's lesbian [t's] for the trailer better down it to rub my tea party. [I] don't care [I]

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.729
Can make it stop did I mention this director was french very very french?

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.260
go on

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.639
Get out of here

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.840
They're looking for you

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.669
And the ability to psychically tell when people are looking for other people yet another chilling if not confusing

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.010
side-effect of the Alien DnA

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.499
right next to re-enacting scenes from wild things

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.170
I

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.300
Think you're Gonna fight that this was very ill-advised, but [cole] gets clawed

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.239
And they suspect she's some sort of terrorist trying to stop their plans

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.530
So they capture the rest of the [pirates] to question them look I don't care whether you [knew] or not

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.390
You brought a terrorist on board a military vessel and as far as I am concerned

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.140
You will die with her and I get to say my lives more flamboyant

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.529
Where's the other one with the chair?

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.440
Don't ever touch me

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:57.840
Ever uh wouldn't it make more sense if he just kept the gun no well, maybe they're trying to find the peaceful route christy

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.910
Okay, Nellie was pointless for him not to have kept the gun stop your weapons

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.530
You drop that biggest shit release Dr.. [mann] push on you. Oh

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.459
Jesus why stop there there's so many other obvious objects, you could have bounced it off [of]

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.160
Well that's going on the aliens in this cell trying to figure out [a] clever way out

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:36.719
Buddy, there's two kinds of aliens on this ship those who like the Nostalgia critics transformer cartoon review and those?

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:43.768
Who don't like the Nostalgia critics transformer cartoon review which are you? I just would have liked to have seen a more in character

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.290
[where] John's Cameo was pointless?

00:08:47.079 --> 00:08:49.079
Mathema Scriber got old

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.179
It just wasn't from do you

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:59.310
So the acid blood from the body breaks through the walls and allows the aliens to escape again

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:04.799
No, guards around to protect the most dangerous fucking thing in the Galaxy at the moment

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.680
[he'll] they [don't] even call security after this happens. They just look over the mez making way for this obvious kill

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.950
Hey

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.230
Oh poor

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.470
This leads to the general and his army [of] shoulder hair to do the most badass thing this division can think oh

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.750
Run the fuck away

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:36.460
Rhomboid pussies from the thing we were supposed to be guarding this whole time the aliens try to break in the ripley cell

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:43.150
But she has a plan to break open the metal wall with her bare hands cut her skin use her acid blood to short out

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.150
The wires thus opening the door oh

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:53.470
Her she could have just used the exact same strength to open the door get that acid blood doesn't flow much to the brain oh

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.820
Boy, it's like cup of noodles this looks like a job [for] a pointless CG shot

00:10:15.579 --> 00:10:19.529
In honor of those who proudly run away like little girls

00:10:35.069 --> 00:10:38.149
proof that [Dan] [Hadiya] can act with just a small portion of his brain

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:45.829
so of course after the fucking army runs away from these things our space pirates try to hightail it as well [or]

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:52.669
[they] stop and walk slowly in the other direction rather than make it to their only escape route

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.990
[level] [5] sweet delicious idiots on Level 5

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.069
So this guy whose name you came from member gets axed off and they come across suspect number one

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:18.289
It's okay. I'll give you guys a few minutes to run come on man. Type ago time to go [dick] [rat] alarm in it

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.930
Yeah, I should probably chase after them

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.019
I'm so distracted. I just can't focus you know

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:34.249
I think my mind was [just] distracted by that ad I saw earlier today, how'd it go again?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.119
Yeah, that was it okay

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.950
I think they've had time to simmer in their own sweat let me just use these pSychic alien powers

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.269
I just figured out we had to not figure out that one of my own kind is about to shoot

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:58.728
Fuck, [I] better still get a snow cone

00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:08.298
was it everything you hoped for what is your obsession with turning this into a lesbo quick, so

00:12:10.619 --> 00:12:12.918
Who do I have to fuck to get off this boat?

00:12:13.049 --> 00:12:19.909
We all know who you like a fuck [seriously] where did this come from [let's] get out of here. No wait a second here

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.910
She was the host for these monsters. She's not human

00:12:22.979 --> 00:12:28.969
[why] wanted a horse not a pony she comes so they come across the wheelchair guy?

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:31.308
Yeah, I know he has a name, but let's face it

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:36.918
You're just gonna [hold] the wheelchair guy and they also stumble across the other cloning experiments before Ripley was made

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:47.599
Now this scene is creative and allows for some cool visuals, but when you really get down to it

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:53.179
It's totally pointless would you really miss anything if this part of the story was cut out?

00:12:53.729 --> 00:12:55.729
aside from Deform Ripley boobie

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:09.708
A painless poison will do

00:13:16.289 --> 00:13:21.649
And I'm sure this will in no way attract other aliens aboard the ship at all

00:13:21.809 --> 00:13:22.799
Whatever you do

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:26.449
Don't draw the aliens attention except for very loudly

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:32.839
Destroying as much equipment as possible very still first up must be a chick thing

00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:39.108
They come across one [of] the prisoners who has an alien inside of him and like morons they decide to bring him along

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:42.888
I'm so looking forward to not getting attached to this character because

00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:47.359
[obviously] he's going to die yet the same chances as a lawyer in a theme park filled with

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:50.358
Dinosaurs [odds] aren't in your favor guy. I'm okay

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:52.379
I'm okay

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:57.979
They come across a flooded area where they discovered the aliens have set a trap [for] them to birth more babies. Oh

00:14:00.089 --> 00:14:06.258
Shit, that's bad as you remember in the first film once those things get on they never come off the more and more you pull

00:14:06.259 --> 00:14:10.788
The tighter and tighter it get or she just rips it off like waxing a mustache

00:14:10.889 --> 00:14:16.998
We can see the other alien movies [where] these things really like just wanting a housefly off of you the whole time

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.529
[Annoy]

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:27.948
Look like the black guy from earlier still has calculated aiming that would make basil of Baker Street blush

00:14:28.619 --> 00:14:35.639
Occupied by the square look at my sauce [nice] triangle dividing [Gautam] expensable of opposing forces motion and adjusting for the difference in equilibrium

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:46.980
This allows them to start climbing up just as one [of] the doctors from before turns against them way too trusting

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.600
Allow me to put this in [my] bitch later folder trust me. I'll put it to good use [so]

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.650
[the] Alien jumps out of the water and tries to follow our heroes

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.630
Wait a minute. You're telling me that this guy can hit with impeccable

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:29.459
accuracy any angle any position knocking off of every solid object he can find but a

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:36.239
7-foot Alien standing right the fuck in front of him is constantly throwing off his Aim

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:40.200
[do] you need to wear a giant bullseye on his head [boom] God this is embarrassing?

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.250
He does finally managed [to] shoot the damn thing, but it hangs on to [his] foot

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:53.640
Which he could easily kick off, but for some reason he decides to separate himself to save the rest of the crew

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.840
now

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.500
Let us have a moment of silence for that black guy you

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:14.810
[know] I don't think that fall would have killed [aah] he's dead. There's no other aliens down there together not now. He's dead

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.150
He could easily just swim out of there any chance you. Why can't you just accept the

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:24.020
Incredibly rare fact that a black guy has died in a horror film

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.450
Even though the fates hunkers were destroyed how does that even sure?

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.760
But it turns out cole made it out. Okay despite the fact that she was shot

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:39.109
Why because she's a robot of course you're an odd Todd

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.340
Robots designed by Robust, right

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.290
And all right this leads me to my bitch later folder first off if she's a robot

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.660
Why did a bullet hurt her the robots in the past never took so long to recover from anything like that?

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:59.150
Second since she fell in the water why didn't the alien attack her when it had the chance?

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.099
They're smart they know she's a threat and third if she could swim out of the water, okay?

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.199
Why a [fuc] card and the black guy you racist. [I] don't think you know what that word means

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.539
So after figuring that out lately gets caught by the aliens, but is surprisingly not hard

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.600
Hey

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.529
things get even worse when the doctor catches up with the crew and holds cole hostage

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:27.239
We move [alright] put a cap right with his little white brain

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:33.509
Go ahead. She's a fucking robot drop a weapon

00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:38.250
Yeah, sure drop the weapons

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:45.510
It's not like robots can survive anything extreme except being shot in the chest being torn in half and getting your head fucking decapitated

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.270
But aside from that robots are very sensitive be careful

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:53.220
Here's another goofy scene the prisoner from earlier feels the aliens starting to come out

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:58.859
So what does he do what anyone would do if they felt something starting to pop out of their stomach?

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:04.169
Gets up goes for a walk beats the living shit out of a guy and then has the alien birth through his head

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.779
Keeping the need for creativity, but [that] makes no sense

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.299
I don't remember john hurt going through anything like this in the first alien movie [oh] my God

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:16.319
I feel something about [to] breast out of my chest. [oh], that's strange. I have a sudden burst of energy, okay?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.770
I want [to] [Jessa] sighs oh, yes, do a little typo. Oh it's kicking

00:18:24.429 --> 00:18:28.109
And just when you thought things couldn't get any sillier in this movie

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.449
We find out that brad dourif is still alive

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:37.980
Throwing a really fucking last-minute plot exposition that Ripley's dna mixed with the queen's Dna now allows her to give birth

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:45.359
To a new [life-form]. [oh], and you thought his acting as chucky was subtle. Take a look at this little piece of shakespearean gold

00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:02.789
I have no idea why I'm cheerfully invested, but the new baby doesn't take to our mother kindly

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.810
A

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:17.740
beautiful beautiful

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.740
little baby

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:25.109
You know this performance is like a human representation of alien porn

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:31.349
Fanfiction, [I] really have no [idea] what's going on through his mind, and I think for the sake of all humanity

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:38.490
It should remain that way. He should just come with a sign saying brad door no questions [dammit] no questions

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:45.000
So ripley gets away. It jumps onto the ship leaving for Earth, but of course that's not bubble sneaks aboard to

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.820
Put it down

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.380
[I]

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:55.979
Really love how they try to make you feel for this thing you were introduced to in the last 10 minutes of the movie

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:02.819
Especially [when] they're given these big puppy-dog eyes. [I] just [want] to eat the manatee and develop wings

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.100
He's dead a [climb]

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:11.400
Even it is most psychotic. They still try to throw that shit in it's pretty emotionally clustered

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.079
I just wanna play with the puppies cocksucking motherfucker

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.550
Mommy why would you do this to me [Shelby] trash and hell?

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:32.490
But they shoot a hole in the window which forces him [to] literally get sucked out

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.640
I

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.250
Want a princess Gesell?

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.339
best death ever weapon

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.699
So I'm sure a hole in the window of a ship re-entering Earth's

00:20:56.070 --> 00:21:02.689
Atmosphere wouldn't cause any complications at all so they reenter fine and look over the new [world] they have to explore

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:14.519
And after all [that] lesbian build-up. We finally get our gay kiss for the movie

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.780
Fuck you

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.989
So that was alien resurrection

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.140
What the hell happened?

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.769
It's so weird watching a movie franchise like this

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:37.070
Go, so bizarrely bad, especially with to be fair a lot of good people working on it

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:44.150
The story has a million [whole] the characters are [just] there [to] die the idea of mixing Ripley's Dna with the Alien is

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:50.869
Interesting but doesn't add too much if anything at all some of the gross-out deaths are creatively over-the-top

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:57.050
But for the most part, it's just a lame lame flick and a really disappointing way to end

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.719
What is now the poorly named [Alien] Trilogy?

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:07.070
Personally, I'll take my chances with prometheus after all when is Ridley Scott ever directed a bad movie let me dream

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.890
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.440
[maybe] my [heart's] on fire

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:29.000
If you refuse me, how do you lose me then you'll be left alone? [oh], baby turbo and tell me I'm your

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.980
Check please must be a chick thing
