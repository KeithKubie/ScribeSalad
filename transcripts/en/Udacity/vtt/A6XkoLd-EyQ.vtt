00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.030
So these two numbers 3 plus 4i and 3 minus 4i. Both of which you remember were

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.770
solutions to a quadratic equation we solved before, are called complex

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.826
conjugates of one another. Everything about them is the same. Except for the

00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:19.531
sign between their real and imaginary components. And when we multiply them

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:24.458
together, we get a real number. Considering this new term, what do you think the

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.290
complex conjugate of the number 2 minus 3i is?
