Well, modeling that was certainly a pain, wasn't it? Now you know why you should

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:08.241
always buy Autodesk brand 3D modelers and help pay my salary, or use a free

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:13.154
alternative like blender. Well, I do want to put a little plug in here. Which I

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:16.976
had absolutely nothing to do with, but am very happy about. All Autodesk

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:20.672
software I know of is free to students, teachers, and veterans, and unemployed

00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:24.880
professionals. See the additional course material for information. Really

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.182
though, there's not much to say about this exercise. Either you got it or you

00:00:28.182 --> 00:00:28.663
didn't.
