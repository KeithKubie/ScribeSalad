00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.820
Arts graduates across the developed world,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.700
often complain bitterly about the difficulties they face finding good employment.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.920
They spent long and costly years

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.940
studying such subjects as history, art, philosophy, poetry and drama,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.760
then they reach the jobs market

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.520
and discover that no one has any use for their distinctive skills and interests.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.700
If they're extremely lucky they may find some kind of job

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.380
but it will almost certainly have no connection with what they've studied or pay very much.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.740
A great number end up making coffee

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.600
while deeply resenting against the backdrop of frothing milk and roasting beans,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.420
how their years studying Foucault or Spinoza

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.020
seem to have gone absolutely nowhere.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.600
It's tempting to dismiss such moans.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.660
If someone wants to spend their time finding out about post colonial theory,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.400
reading south American novels or deconstructing vampire films

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.540
then that's very nice, as a hobby.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.820
But it's harder to see why anyone should expect to get paid for doing so.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.060
You don't get paid for going to the cinema or attending parties either,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.720
but in truth, the extraordinary rate of unemployment or misemployment of graduates in the humanities

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.420
is a sign of something grievously wrong with modern societies.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.500
It's evidence that we have no real clue what culture and art are really for

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.620
and what problems they could solve.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.800
We like to declare the humanities worthy and noble and fund a few professors to dig away in the archives

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.980
but basically at a societal level we don't know what the humanities could do for us

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.840
and therefore, how people trained in them should spend their days, other than in preparing Frappucinos.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.880
Good news is that the humanities actually do have a point to them.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.900
They are a storehouse of vitally important knowledge about how to lead our lives:

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.340
Novels teach us about relationships,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.580
works of art re-frame our perspectives,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.180
drama provides us with cathartic experiences,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.780
philosophy teach us to think,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.620
political science to plan and history is a catalog of case-studies into any number of personal and political scenarios.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.760
The humanities have some of the biggest clues out there about how to fix stuff.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.440
We're very bad at a range of things that these arts graduates could help us with.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.400
We still don't know how to make relationships work. This could be a trillion dollar business.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.440
We don't know how to communicate what we're feeling to others in a way that they'll understand,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.800
we're bad at interpreting our emotions and making good choices,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.580
we don't know how to treat others to get the best out of them,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.300
we don't know how to reform advertising, the media, politics, schools, architecture

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.600
and a lot of the time we're simply anxious and sad.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.980
We aren't creatures who need only practical things like food and drinks, cement and running shoes.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.460
We also need help with the bits of ours that religion used to call our souls

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.020
and we much as well call our psyches.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.480
This psyche related work deserves to become a huge and legitimate part of the world econonmy

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.780
worth as much as the cement trade or the lumber business.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.700
That they're so many arts graduates waiting tables

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.000
isn't a sign that they've been lazy and self indulgent,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.800
it's that we haven't collectively working up to what culture could really do for us

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.200
and how useful and totally practical it could be...
