00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.680
SPEAKER: And the reason I call it
strategic practice is kind of that--

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.686
they're going to be grouped by
theme, like these are problems

00:00:06.686 --> 00:00:09.060
that help me practice this
topic, these are problems that

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.380
help you practice that topic and so on.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.150
But just like, you know, as I said, I'm
a chess player and my favorite chess

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.250
tactics book, they'll start
out with like a chapter on pins

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.240
and then chapter on forks
and chapter on skewers,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.500
or you're just practicing
individual chess tactics,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.430
and then towards the
end, you get the chapters

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.720
that mix everything
together and you don't

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.370
know there's going to be a
fork or a pin or a skewer.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.759
Well, you know, like on
an exam, I'm not going

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.410
to tell you whether it's a fork or
a pin or a skewer, but, you know,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.560
by doing a lot of problems, you're
going to be improving your pattern

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.060
recognition skills.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.580
So a lot of this course is
about pattern recognition

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.404
and that just takes practice, right?

00:00:46.404 --> 00:00:49.320
You have to practice as much as you
can, so the more practice problems

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.127
you do, the better, right?

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:53.460
I'm not trying to torture
anyone with a lot of problems,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.890
but as I said last time, this is a
difficult course and the best way

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.120
to learn it is just by my
doing a lot of problems.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.870
So anyway, those are there.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.880
That also serves-- if you look at the
solutions to these strategic practice

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.860
problems--

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.560
then also, you could think of that as
kind of an example of what ideally I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.180
would like to see on the homework.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.750
So when you're writing
up your homeworks, what

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.280
I don't want to see is like the kind of
thing I see sometimes, like, you know,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.870
you have like x plus 3 equals
4, and then you kind of decide

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.630
to subtract 3 from both sides--

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.780
minus 3 equals 1, and then I need
to square it for some reason.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.960
A 1 squared is still 1, so that's
OK, then it adds 7 equals 8.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.521
Put a box around it,
then that's the answer.

00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:43.770
That's what you should not do.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.570
What you should do is actually
have words and sentences.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.600
Just because this is a mathematical
class, doesn't mean you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.110
shouldn't be using English and
explaining things as well as equations.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.850
So I'd like you to be as clear
and detailed as possible in just

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.979
fully justifying your answers, right?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.140
Like, if the answer is 42, well,
the TF knows that the answer is 42.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.240
The question is, you know, what
reasoning led you to think that?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.610
So clarity is a good word.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.170
And I'd even say honesty.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.210
I hate it when students kind of
like have a very, shall we say,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.612
sloppy argument that, I think
the answer should work out to 12,

00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:41.820
and so they're just like,
you know, put in some stuff

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.700
somewhere and write it in a very
messy way and come up with 12--

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.080
put a box around it.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.080
That's very bad.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.650
So if you don't understand something,
then I'd much rather that you--

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.750
well of course, try to talk
to people and figure it out,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.940
but I'd rather say you don't understand
that than try to make something up

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.290
like random gibberish.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.460
I always think of it as like,
you know, if I were considering

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.640
hiring you to build a bridge for me,
and I'm thinking of three possibilities,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.870
like either--

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.970
if you just tell me,
here's the specifications,

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.740
you do this, this, and
this, I'm not going

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.656
to have much confidence if you just
say that that's the answer, right?

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:28.920
I'm not going to have blind faith
in-- even if you've successfully

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.320
built bridges before, I want to
see why this is going to work.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.680
And on the other hand, if you tell
me a bridge design and it collapses,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.120
do you think I'd prefer that?

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.411
Or would I prefer if you tell me, you
don't know how to build the bridge?

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.910
Well, if you tell me you don't
know how to build the bridge,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.940
then I would much
rather have that happen.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.500
So clarity, honesty, and words.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.020
You may be used in other math
classes or just write, oh,

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.510
the derivative of x squared
is 2x, and maybe you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.220
don't need to write any words, but
I like to see words, justifications,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.690
and thinking, not just equations.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.190
OK?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.356
So that's the style of the homework
and, you know, you can look-- as I said,

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:12.810
you can look at the strategic
practice for some examples of what

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.950
that should look like.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.450
Doesn't mean we're going to be
grading based on your grammar

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.519
and spelling and things
like that, and it

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.890
doesn't mean you have to
write a great American novel,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.390
but it should it should be
something that you could actually

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.650
take your homework-- you should be
able to actually read it out loud

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.576
and it would actually sound like
English with some equations thrown in.

00:04:33.576 --> 00:04:35.700
But even equations, you
can read out the equations.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.908
In principle, you should be able to do
that, that's what it should look like.

00:04:38.908 --> 00:04:42.060
Whereas if you did this, then
you just can't read that.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.960
OK?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.760
So homework's due in a week.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.750
What else?

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.020
The review.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.870
So math review handout.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.620
I posted before, but I've
made a few updates to it,

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.060
so you can download a new
copy of the math review

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.800
and hopefully most of
that material is review,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.160
but you should definitely take
a look at everything in there.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.460
And then today at 2:00--

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:13.660
review sessions are
Fridays at 2:00 in Hall E.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.450
Usually these Friday
review sections we'll just

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.750
be reviewing the week's
worth of material,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.510
but today's one, which
Bowe is going to do,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.160
is going to be a math review, so kind
of dovetailing the math review handout.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.790
So again, I mean, that's completely
optional, but some of you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.830
may be rusty on your math
and may find that useful.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.420
It's supposed to be videotaped.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.870
I have no control over when the
video is posted, things like that.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.630
Usually they're posted fairly
soon, but that's not up to me,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.160
but anyway, that will be available.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.270
OK.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.920
Any questions by the way on
anything about the course

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.740
that we didn't get to yet?

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.380
Before we actually start?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.020
OK.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.500
Any other announcements?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.240
Math reviews, strategic practice, OK.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.080
Oh, and I also want to mention that--

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.320
so the homework's due at
the beginning of class

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.220
and there's really no leeway with
late homework, because first of all,

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.130
it's such a large core;
secondly, I'm going

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.720
to post the solutions to the homework
very soon after you turn them in.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.520
But I do drop the two lowest
homework scores, so if it's late,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.650
it would just become
one of your dropped two.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.990
OK.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:34.960
All right, so last time I was kind of
quickly mentioning some of the areas

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.500
where probability is used.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.300
I wanted to just very briefly
continue my little list,

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.720
and then we'll start with the naive
definition of probability, which

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.990
was kind of the historical
roots of the subject,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.360
but we'll quickly want to
move beyond the naive stage.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.010
OK?

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.860
But just to continue my
little list a little bit.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.630
So last time, I just mentioned very
briefly in physics, quantum mechanics,

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.010
it's all probability; genetics, you
can't do genetics without probability;

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.180
and some of the sciences--

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.140
econ, econometrics, and
game theory, and so on.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:19.735
But I want to mention a few of the less
obvious applications, like history.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.630
Well, you might think, what
does history and probability

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.010
have to do with each other?

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:33.070
I just want to mention very quickly one
example of a really famous beautiful

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.940
example that Mosteller-- you can look
up details if you want you online--

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:48.550
Mosteller-Wallace did some beautiful
work studying The Federalist Papers.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.440
They were trying to resolve--

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.406
so The Federalist Papers were crucial
documents in the history of the US,

00:07:54.406 --> 00:07:58.900
you know, having to do with the
ratification of the US Constitution.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.279
And there's a lot of disagreement
over the authorship-- you know,

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:06.070
who wrote some of them, so that's
an important historical question,

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.110
and so they were using
probability, Bayes' rule,

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.050
think things we're going to
be doing to address that.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.790
And Mosteller was actually the founder
of the staff department in here,

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.600
and he's actually my grand advisor--

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.860
so my advisor's adviser, so I
like to talk about Mosteller.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.170
I didn't get to meet him.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:26.050
Actually, he died in 2006 and I came
here in 2006 so I just missed him.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.930
But anyway.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.290
You know, it is used in history,
and I wanted to mention--

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.919
when I mentioned history, it
reminds me that I was also

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.970
going to say something about pass/fail.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.110
So if anyone wants to take the
course pass/fail, I do allow it.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.914
The reason is for flexibility,
is because I trust

00:08:44.914 --> 00:08:46.330
you to decide what's best for you.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.470
Obviously you have to--

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.570
if you're counting this
for concentration credit,

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.986
you'll have to check with your
concentration advisor about

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:53.280
whether that be OK.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.440
It's OK with me.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.310
I don't usually recommend it, but I've
have had some cases before of students

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:04.510
who were really afraid to take the
course because they didn't know if they

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.590
had enough math and they
did pass/fail, and the story

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.450
that this reminds me of here is one--

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.560
I had a history concentrator
a few years ago.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.260
He had almost no math
background, just basic calculus--

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.000
like 1B, so he was scared to take this,
but he was interested in learning it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.150
So I let him take a pass/fail
and he really loved it,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.630
and after that, every single elective
he took for the rest of his time

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.180
here was a stat course-- he
stayed a history concentrator

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.700
but did lots of statistics electives.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.500
And now he's doing a PhD at
Stanford in applying statistics

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.040
to political science and history,
so there are examples like that.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.845
So there are more and more applications
in history and government also.

00:09:47.845 --> 00:09:50.080
You can check out IQSS at Harvard--

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.830
Institute for Quantitative
Social Science.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.121
Just take a look at their web page-- if
you have any interest in social science

00:09:55.121 --> 00:09:56.850
and government, look at the IQSS stuff.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.930
There there's a huge
amount of activity there

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.020
that's at the intersection
of statistics,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.310
political science, history,
government-- all come together.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.490
There are a lot of
applications-- an increasing

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:15.640
number of applications in social
sciences and even the humanities.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.510
Last time I mentioned
finance very quickly,

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.890
and I wanted to especially
recommend STAT 123,

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.530
which is not offered this year, but it
will be offered next year and probably

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.650
the following year-- the prerequisite
is STAT 110 and it's a very interesting

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:36.130
course for many reasons, but--

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.500
I won't talk about it more
now, but it is worth--

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.404
if you're interested
in finance, then you

00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:42.070
should definitely be interested in this.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.450
If you're not interested in
finance, then don't worry about it.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.200
All right.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.405
And then one more is gambling.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.700
And depending on how
cynical you are, you

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.370
could say that I've
just repeated myself,

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:03.400
but gambling is fun to talk about.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.990
Gambling is sort of--

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:07.470
it's illegal in a lot of--

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.470
most forms of gambling are
illegal in most parts of the US

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.320
and has kind of an unsavory reputation.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.740
And I never know if anyone has some
strong moral objections to gambling

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.930
is going to be offended
if I talk about gambling.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.790
It hasn't happened yet, but
let me know if you're offended

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.790
and I'll try to be
more careful about it.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.710
But anyway, gambling-- I feel justified
in talking about gambling in STAT 110

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.780
because gambling is where
probability came from--

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:44.600
that the historical roots of the
subject are exactly in games of chance--

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.900
gambling.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.350
And so it gives me a chance to talk
about a little bit of the history.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:55.710
It's also some familiar concrete
example, like dice and cards

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.400
and coins and things like
that that people gamble with.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.010
As I mentioned, the math
prerequisite before, I

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.470
didn't mention the cards prerequisite.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.550
You should know what a 52 deck
of cards, you know, like the--

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.870
you should know what--

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.094
basically what a standard
deck of cards looks like.

00:12:12.094 --> 00:12:14.010
So if you've never
played-- you don't actually

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.900
have to know how to play
poker in this class,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.930
but you should be familiar
with a deck of cards.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:24.340
But you can easily learn that if you
haven't played any card games before.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.150
So this is historically well-motivated.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.510
And it's also just a source
of interesting examples

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.720
that we can easily explain without
getting into a lot of technicalities,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.520
and then we can learn things.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.590
So there are some early
examples, I'm just

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:49.400
going to mention our Fermat
and Pascal in the mid- 1650s.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.430
And there are other examples as well,
but this is arguably the most important

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.080
kind of historical root of probability.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.550
So Fermat, you've probably
heard of Fermat's Last Theorem.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.986
He was a famous mathematician
and also a lawyer on this--

00:13:02.986 --> 00:13:04.860
actually, he was a lawyer
and a mathematician

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.250
on the side, not the other way around.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.190
Pascal was another
very, very famous guy.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.410
You know, Pascal's Wager, Pascal's.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:18.220
Triangle, Pascal-- it was a programming
language before C and so on.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.254
Very, very famous person.

00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:22.920
So anyway, you know, they didn't
have email back then obviously,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.730
so they were writing very long
letters back and forth to each other.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.970
And most of the letters have survived,
you can actually find them online

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.345
if you just look up, you know,
Fermat Pascal correspondence.

00:13:33.345 --> 00:13:36.210
It's pretty interesting to read
their letters back and forth,

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.834
and they were just writing letters
back and forth to each other

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:40.770
analyzing different
gambling games, and it's

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.394
like, if you have this gambling
game, what's the probability

00:13:43.394 --> 00:13:44.310
that this will happen?

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.980
What's the probably that will happen?

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.770
And it was all completely
new at the time.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:52.922
You know, no one had
mathematically derived these rules

00:13:52.922 --> 00:13:54.630
and how to work with
probability, so they

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.750
were just developing it just by writing
letters back and forth discussing

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.860
gambling.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.360
OK?

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.790
So we will discuss some
of those games that they

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:07.320
talked about when we get to it.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.470
And then I mentioned life
at the end last time.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.430
I'll come back to that.

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.810
Life.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.380
I like to say statistics is
the logic of uncertainty.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.450
Math is the logic of certainty,
statistics is the logic of uncertainty.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.460
Everyone has uncertainty.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.800
If you're 100% certain of everything,
then there's something wrong with you.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.710
Everyone has a lot of
uncertainties and probability

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:43.230
and statistics are how we
quantify and update our beliefs

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.620
and deal with uncertainty.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.880
So that's what this course
is going to be about.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.050
It's going to be about
quantifying uncertainty.

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:53.550
All right?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.670
So now we can get to the naive
definition of probability,

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.825
which was the origins of the subject.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.610
So let me tell you what
a sample space is first,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.640
then I'll give you the naive definition.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.095
So a sample space--

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:25.240
sample space just means the set of all
possible outcomes of some experiment.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.840
And we're going to talk about
experiments a lot in this class,

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.300
but you should interpret
the word experiment

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.210
in an extremely broad manner.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:37.550
An experiment can be
just anything, right?

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.994
Do anything-- as long as there
are certain possible outcomes.

00:15:40.994 --> 00:15:43.660
So before the experiment, you
don't know what's going to happen,

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.100
because there are
different possible outcomes

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.200
and you don't know which
one's going to happen.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.900
You do the experiment and
then something happens.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.440
OK?

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.850
So what I just said was
very, very general, right?

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.870
And I mean, that could describe
any number of situations.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:01.810
So a sample space is the set of all
possible outcomes of an experiment.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.294
And we can interpret
experiment however we want.

00:16:07.294 --> 00:16:08.710
So this is a very general concept.

00:16:14.183 --> 00:16:17.690
All Possible outcomes of
an experiment-- and we

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:19.856
might say it's a random
experiment, but I'm not

00:16:19.856 --> 00:16:22.730
going to use the word random right
now because we haven't defined it.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:26.330
I'm just interpreting
this very, very generally.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:27.140
OK.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.280
And then we need one more concept,
which is that of an event,

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.634
and we'll come back to
this, but the earlier you

00:16:33.634 --> 00:16:35.300
start thinking about events, the better.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:40.850
An event is a subset
of the sample space.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.710
And by the way, there's
also like a one-page handout

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.760
that's on the course web page called
Probability and Sets or something

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.820
like that.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.330
One of the big
breakthroughs in probability

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.990
that made it possible to actually treat
this as a mathematical subject instead

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:12.510
of just something more like astrology
was the idea of using sets, OK?

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.690
So most of you have seen
like unions and intersections

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.810
and things like that, but if
you don't know much, you know,

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.780
like basic facts about
set theory like that,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.995
I put a short introduction
into the review handout,

00:17:25.995 --> 00:17:28.870
but you definitely need to be
comfortable with unions, intersections,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:32.082
and complements in this course

00:17:32.082 --> 00:17:35.040
That was a huge breakthrough, because
before, people just kind of tried

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.670
to like solve probability problems
by just kind of writing down

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:42.300
some stuff that sounded
intuitive, or reasoning by analogy

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.790
and various heuristics
Most of those heuristics

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.670
unfortunately turned out
to be completely wrong.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:54.070
And we'll talk about some of those
famously wrong heuristics later.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.690
But even-- I should
mention Isaac Newton.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:01.200
Sort of later than this--
roughly around the same time--

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.560
Isaac Newton also-- you know,
Newton is one of the most famous

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.630
and probably top three most famous
mathematician physicists of all time,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.700
and there were gamblers who were asking
Newton gambling questions as well.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.540
Because at the time, no one
knew how to do probabilities,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.340
so if you were like a degenerate gambler
and you really needed to know the odds,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.930
then you had to go to someone of
the stature of Isaac Newton, Fermat,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.660
or Pascal to get an answer.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.300
You know, that was 300 years ago,
and so one of the cool things

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.150
is that after a few
weeks of STAT 110, you'll

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.510
be able to easily do calculations
that 300 years ago, you'd

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.700
have to consult Isaac Newton with.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.900
And Newton-- we'll talk
about some of Newton's stuff

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.040
probably in the next lecture, but
Newton did the calculation correctly,

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.035
but even Newton's intuition turned
out to be wrong for one of these.

00:18:56.035 --> 00:18:57.990
It's just a gambling problem about dice.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:00.610
His intuition was wrong.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.240
So one thing that makes
this subject difficult

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:06.390
is that we're going to do a lot
of things that are deeply, deeply

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.750
counterintuitive to almost everyone.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.934
And I think that makes
this a fun subject.

00:19:12.934 --> 00:19:14.850
It's a lot of fun teaching
it, there are a lot

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:19.210
of paradoxes we'll talk about, a
lot of very surprising results.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.250
So to me, that makes this
more fun than calculus.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:30.030
When you take a calculus class, I've
never seen anyone shocked by anything.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.900
I mean, the fundamental
theorem of calculus,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.020
which we will need occasionally,
is a very cool result.

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:39.750
It links differential calculus--
so derivatives and integrals

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.430
are inverse to each other.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.890
I mean, it's pretty cool,
but it doesn't amaze anyone,

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.170
It's not that counterintuitive.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.886
Statistics is full of
counterintuitive stuff, which

00:19:49.886 --> 00:19:52.260
just means you have to work
hard, you have to think hard,

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.210
and it will become more intuitive
the more you think about it,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.970
the more problems you solve, OK?

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:01.110
But at first, a lot of this might seem
counterintuitive, even to Isaac Newton.

00:20:03.722 --> 00:20:06.430
So that's why we need to be more
mathematically precise about it,

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.960
because our intuitions can easily
be completely wrong in probability,

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.677
so that's why we need to
make it more mathematical.

00:20:13.677 --> 00:20:16.260
And then as I said, the breakthrough,
mathematically-speaking,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:21.240
was to start thinking of
events as subsets, OK?

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.710
So I'm going to draw a lot of
Venn diagrams in this class.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:30.480
Usually I'll call the sample space
capital S. And that-- it's just a set.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.800
The elements of the set are possible
outcomes of the experiment, OK?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:41.070
So if our experiment is
to roll two dice, OK?

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.480
Six-sided dice, then there
are 36 possible outcomes--

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.240
we'll actually get to where
the 36 comes from in a bit.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.180
There's 36 possible
outcomes, and then this set

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.440
would consist of all those outcomes,
and then an event, let's call it A,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.930
is just some subset.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.440
OK.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.970
And so there are a lot of--

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.094
we'll get into this more
later, but you should also

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:06.810
look at the handout later about
probability and sets, where we--

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:11.100
the purpose is to connect
intuitive ideas about events

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.120
and make that mathematically precise
using unions and intersections

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.720
and things like that.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.220
OK?

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.110
So we'll get into that
more later, but I just

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.470
wanted to get this word out there
to help us now with the naive

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.305
definition of probability.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.230
You could also call it the very
naive definition of probability.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.030
So you can only use
this definition when you

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:44.180
have strong justification for doing so.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:51.720
The definition just says that
the probability of an event A--

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.720
so this is our first use of a letter,
capital P. Throughout this course,

00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:01.480
capital P means probability, so we
write P of A, where A is an event.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.200
So I'm imagining we have some
experiment that we're considering,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.550
we have this sample space, we have
a subset we're interested in--

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.890
A-- because we want to
know what's the chance,

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.700
what are the odds that some
particular event will occur?

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.180
That's the question we're going to be
considering throughout this course, OK?

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.610
So we want P of A.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.560
How do we get that?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.550
Well, that's a hard question, that's
what this entire course is about.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.660
But the naive definition
would be to just say,

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:35.480
that's just number of possible
outcomes in the denominator,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.140
and then the number of
favorable outcomes--

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.752
and by favorable, I
mean favorable to A--

00:22:44.752 --> 00:22:46.460
divided by a number
of possible outcomes.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.230
So the denominator is just
the size of the sample space,

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.180
it's the number of possible outcomes.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.640
And the numerator is just how many
of those outcomes did A occur?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.390
OK?

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:08.930
So for example, if we flip a coin--

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:18.870
flip coin twice, there are
four possible outcomes, right?

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.820
Either the coin lands
heads on the first toss

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.540
and heads on the second toss, or
heads and then tails, or tails

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.850
and then heads, or tails and then tails.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.240
So we have these four
different outcomes, OK?

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:39.149
Now suppose we want to know, what's the
probability that both tosses are tails?

00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:41.440
Then according to this, it
would be one quarter, right?

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.170
Because we have one-- this
would be the favorable outcome,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.694
there are four of them, 1/4, that's it.

00:23:46.694 --> 00:23:49.360
So that's sort of like the high
school definition of probability

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.693
as well, to just count how
many possibilities there are,

00:23:51.693 --> 00:23:54.760
how many of them did the thing
you want happen, and that's it.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.760
But notice, though, I didn't say
anything about, is it a fair coin?

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.180
Is it, you know--

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.810
and well, that's the question,
is what does it actually

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:06.790
mean for a coin to be fair?

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:10.230
I mean, we have to be careful
of some circularity here.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:15.470
So if we say a coin is fair, we mean
heads and tails are equally likely, OK?

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.360
But even then, that's just talking about
one toss, and if we have two tosses,

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.150
well, what if the coin has some kind
of sticky property that it lands tails

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.659
and it's likely to land
tails again the next time?

00:24:25.659 --> 00:24:28.450
There are all kinds of different
possibilities that we'll consider.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:29.980
But the most naive
way to write this down

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:31.720
would be, OK, we have these four cases.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.345
If we treat them all
as equally likely, then

00:24:34.345 --> 00:24:38.380
if we want the probability of some
event, we just count how many of those

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.840
happen, divide by a number
of things, that's it.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.410
That's the naive definition.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.130
So it has a huge assumption.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.010
It assumes that all
outcomes are equally likely.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.260
And it also assumes that there
are finitely many outcomes.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.145
I'll have to say finite sample space.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.780
So if the outcome of
your experiment could

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:15.590
be like any real number or any integer,
then the denominator would be infinity

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.830
and then this is meaningless, OK?

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.090
So it has to be--

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:24.187
in order to apply, it has to be
that we have a finite denominator.

00:25:24.187 --> 00:25:26.770
And the assumption is that
everything is equally likely, well,

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.750
that's a very, very
strong assumption, OK?

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.890
Now that's a reasonable
assumption in some problems where

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.240
we have some kind of symmetry, right?

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.290
Like if we roll a six-sided
die and we think, you know,

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:45.100
if all six sides are equally likely
just because it's a symmetrical cube,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.460
then maybe it's reasonable to say
each one is 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, right?

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.790
But it could just as
easily be a loaded die

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.060
that's weighted towards one side
more than another and then, you know.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.170
So taken to an extreme, this kind
of led to a dead end at some point

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.970
and got kind of ridiculed.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.790
Like, if you take this
to an extreme, you

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:11.830
could say, well, what if I want to
know what's the probability that there

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.490
is life on Neptune, OK?

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:16.810
Well, I've never been there.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.480
I don't know if there is
life on Neptune or not,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.710
so either there is or there
isn't, that's two possibilities.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.510
One of them has life, the other
one doesn't, so it'd be 1/2, OK?

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.720
So most people would agree,
that's a ridiculous argument.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.130
Despite that, you can find many
examples in the media, in the news--

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.510
there's a Daily Show clip I really
like kind of making fun of this,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.850
I'll post the link at some point.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:46.600
And I've seen various examples
where people are taking seriously

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.180
arguments of that form,
or they're using the naive

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.100
definition with no justification.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.510
There's no justification for using the
naive definition in that case, right?

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:57.160
And the situation gets even worse.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.160
I just said, well, according to this,
the probability of life on Neptune

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.060
is 1/2.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:04.600
Now what if I asked you instead,
what's the probability that there's

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.590
intelligent life on Neptune?

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:13.601
Well, again, either there is or there
isn't, so that would also be 1/2.

00:27:13.601 --> 00:27:16.600
But there's something that seems--
something's severely wrong with-- you

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.210
know, shouldn't it be
strictly less likely

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.930
that there's intelligent life than
that there's any kind of life?

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:27.010
Or there should be a strict
inequality there, OK?

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.450
And that's not reflected.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:31.510
So we'll quickly need to go beyond this.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.350
However, as I said, this is
where the subject got its start--

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.550
and for gambling, so
it's still important.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.020
It's important both to understand
how the subject evolved,

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.480
but it's also important
for a lot of problems

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.540
where we are able to
assume equally likely.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:50.050
I'm just emphasizing the fact
that you need some justification

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:54.820
or be very clear about
what you're able to assume.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.834
And if you are able to assume that
all the outcomes are equally likely

00:27:58.834 --> 00:28:01.750
and there's finitely many, then this
is the definition of probability,

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:03.850
it's perfectly good,
otherwise you can't.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.320
OK?

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.420
So in order to be able to actually--

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.120
I mean, I did a very,
very simple example here,

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.930
I just wrote down the four
outcomes and we did it,

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.390
but for anything that's
more difficult than that,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.690
it would become too tedious
to list everything out.

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:26.980
So therefore, the first major topic
in this class is, how do we count?

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:27.610
OK?

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.610
So I said that calculus
is a prerequisite.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.700
Counting is not really a prerequisite,
so we're going to start--

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.950
I'm trying to make this as
self-contained as possible,

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.090
we start with counting.

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:42.535
So some basic principles of counting.

00:28:51.414 --> 00:28:53.330
Because if we don't know
how to count, then we

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.800
would never be able to compute the
numerator and denominator there, right?

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.300
All right.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.590
So there are a couple of
principles that we need.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.400
First one, I don't really know
if it has a standard name,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.510
but I just call it the
multiplication rule.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.210
And it says-- it's a
pretty simple principle,

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:21.430
but it underlies most of
what we'll need for counting,

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:28.240
except for one other counting
method that we'll get to next time.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.940
Multiplication rule says that
if we have an experiment--

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.620
again, I'm going to say
this kind of abstractly

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.310
because this is a general
principle, and then we'll

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.480
see examples of how to use this.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:55.630
So if we have an experiment with,
let's say, n1 possible outcomes, OK?

00:29:55.630 --> 00:30:01.870
So we do some experiment and there
are n sub 1 possible outcomes.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:08.440
And then we do a second
experiment such that

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.970
for each outcome of
the first experiment,

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:18.525
then there are n2 possible
outcomes for the second experiment.

00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:22.210
I'll just abbreviate experiment to expt.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:29.960
There are n2 possible outcomes
for the second experiment--

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.800
that should be n2 here--

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.790
for a second experiment, et cetera,
do as many experiments as you want.

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.710
So I'll just put dot-dot-dot.

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:43.390
Let's say we're going to do r
experiments, and there are n sub r--

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:45.430
and so for each-- no
matter what happened

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:48.650
with the previous r minus
1 experiments, there

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:51.590
n sub r possible outcomes
for the rth experiment.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:57.850
OK.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.490
Almost done stating this.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:04.880
There are n sub r outcomes
possible for the rth experiment.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:13.970
Then the conclusion-- so we sort of
have all these separate experiments

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.360
that we're doing sequentially
one after the other, OK?

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.910
Then overall, there
are n1 times n2 times

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:29.420
blah blah blah times nr overall possible
outcomes for the combined experiment.

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.840
The combined experiment consists of
doing all these smaller experiments

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.090
one after the other.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.125
Overall possible experiment outcomes.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.690
Formally, you can prove
this using induction,

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.820
but I would prefer that you
understand why this is true just

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.350
by thinking about it,
thinking about examples, OK?

00:31:56.350 --> 00:32:03.290
And the way I like to visualize it is
just by drawing a simple tree diagram.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.290
So I promised someone
while were waiting outside

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.110
that I'd mentioned ice cream today.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.890
I like to talk about ice
cream examples with counting

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:14.560
for reasons that I might mention.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.650
Ice cream example-- this is
a very, very simple example,

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:21.160
but once you understand
this example completely,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.510
then all this stuff I
wrote here becomes obvious.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.670
Simple experiment, you
go and get ice cream

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.170
and suppose you have different options.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.880
Suppose just for simplicity that
there are only three flavors--

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.770
chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry--

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:43.300
and suppose that there are
two different types of cone.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.660
And so you go in, you choose
which type of cone you want

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.070
and which type of flavor
you want, that's it.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.570
OK?

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:50.710
That's the experiment.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.720
So that experiment consists
of two parts, right?

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.200
The first experiment is you
choose which type of cone you want

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.500
and on the second experiment is you
choose which flavor you want, right?

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.670
So very, very simple.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:07.780
So I would just depict it like this,
where let's say at the first branch,

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.920
you choose either C for a cake
cone or a W for a waffle cone,

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:14.360
and then once you've chosen
which type of cone you want,

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.820
then you can either choose
chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry--

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.590
CVS.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:24.610
Was not a sponsor today, but
maybe it'll get sponsorship later.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:28.330
Chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, there
we go-- that's the tree diagram.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:33.010
Once you understand this tree, all this
abstract stuff should become obvious.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:34.780
How many possibilities are there?

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:35.898
Well obviously there's 6.

00:33:35.898 --> 00:33:38.140
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:38.920
Why is it 6?

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.690
6 equals 2 times 3.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.560
Now notice also that 6 equals 3 times 2.

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:51.430
We could have-- they're not going
to force you to first choose a cone

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.614
and then choose the flavor.

00:33:52.614 --> 00:33:55.030
You could choose the flavor
first and then choose the cone

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.439
and they should be able
to handle that, right?

00:33:57.439 --> 00:34:00.730
So you can draw that tree for yourself,
it could have split three ways and then

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.860
two ways, there's still six outcomes.

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.960
That is all this is saying, right?

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:10.449
So you can imagine a massive tree
where it branches many times,

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:14.679
millions of branches, but if you
understand this simple little tree,

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:17.340
then you'll see where
that's coming from.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.400
OK?

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:23.139
So you all know about
exponential growth.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:25.480
6 is still a pretty
small number, but if you

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.989
imagine that there are
many branches and each time

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.780
it keeps branching different ways,
if you multiply 2 times 2 times

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.560
2 many times, it's going
to grow exponentially fast,

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.441
like 2 to the 10th power is 1,024.

00:34:37.441 --> 00:34:40.690
So if we had 10 choices and each choice
we can only choose between two things,

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:42.610
there's still over 1,000 possibilities.

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.000
So these grow very, very,
very fast, and that's

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.449
why it's hopeless to try
to just list them out

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:52.270
except for the very simplest problem.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:55.159
OK, so that's the multiplication rule.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.630
Well let's do one quick example.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:05.504
Find the probability of a full house in
poker-- and I'll tell you what that is.

00:35:05.504 --> 00:35:07.420
I'm assuming you know
what a deck of cards is,

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:13.900
but I'm not assuming you know the
term full house with a five-card hand.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:19.670
So a standard deck of cards has
52 cards, and you get five cards.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.680
And we're assuming that the
cards are completely shuffled

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.850
so that all sets of five
cards are equally likely, OK?

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.210
That's the assumption.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:31.030
OK.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:35.770
Then I have to tell you
what a full house is.

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.650
But if I'm going to use the
naive definition of probability,

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:44.230
I want to know, what's the
number of possible hands?

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.420
Well that's 52, choose 5.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.660
I think most of you have
seen this, sometimes

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.530
people write this as like 52C5,
you know, combinations and things--

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.649
this is a preferable notation.

00:35:55.649 --> 00:35:57.940
I'll remind you what it is
in case you haven't seen it,

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.724
but hopefully most of
you seen that before.

00:36:01.724 --> 00:36:03.640
We'll be seeing a lot
of these in this course,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.390
those are called a binomial coefficient.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.630
It's pronounced n choose
k and written like that.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:21.440
And it's defined as n factorial over
n minus k factorial k factorial.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.750
I'm assuming you've seen
factorials before, but if not,

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:29.100
you definitely should make sure
you know what factorials are.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:39.100
We'll also define this as
0 if k is greater than n.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.850
What this quantity is supposed to
represent is the number of way--

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:47.280
if you have n people, how many ways can
you choose k out of the n people, OK?

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.700
So choose a subset of size k
where order doesn't matter.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.410
So I'll say a number
of subsets of size k

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:02.390
where order doesn't matter of a
group of n people or n objects.

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:12.030
So if k is greater than n,
it has to be defined as 0,

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.800
because you can't choose--

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.880
if you have 10 people, you can't
choose 11 of them, it's impossible, OK?

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.930
So if k is less than or equal
to n, it's equal to this,

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.500
and let me just quickly
tell you the reason why.

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:33.700
If we choose-- we know we need
to make some choices, right?

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.060
This follows almost immediately
from the multiplication rule,

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.330
so I'll just quickly justify this.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.340
Let's choose the first person, OK?

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.180
So we have we have n people and
we want to select k of them, OK?

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.650
Pick the first person.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.000
There are n choices, right?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.170
Because you can pick anyone.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:54.280
Now, and then the next person could
be anyone except the one you already

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.400
chose, so it's going to be n minus 1.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.840
And then the next one is n minus 2.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.390
And it goes all the way like that
until it goes down to n minus k plus 1,

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:07.240
because if k is 1, I want to stop at n.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.480
If k is 2, I want to stop at n minus 1.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.960
So that would be the answer if we were
picking people in a specific order, OK?

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.950
But these k people I just selected, I
could have chosen them in any order,

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:21.640
right?

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.580
So I have to divide this
by k factorial because I've

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.990
over-counted by that factor.

00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:30.760
And that's actually the same thing
as n factorial over n minus k

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:36.830
factorial k factorial, because
if you write up these factorials,

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:40.050
all of the stuff is going to cancel
and this is what's left, right?

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:44.350
If you imagine-- this is n times n minus
1, n minus 2, all the way down to 1;

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.930
this 1, you know, the same
thing, starting at n minus k--

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:48.650
cancel stuff, this is what's left.

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:49.150
OK?

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.865
So that's where this thing comes from.

00:38:50.865 --> 00:38:51.680
All right.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.270
Now coming back to this
full house problem,

00:38:55.270 --> 00:39:01.910
a full house is defined as having three
cards of one rank and two of another.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:06.160
For example, three 7's and two 10's, OK?

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:09.230
That's called a full house.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.220
So if we use the naive
definition, which is justified

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.430
if we assume that the cards
are completely shuffled,

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:20.230
the denominator is 52 choose 5, because
I'm just choosing 5 cards out of 52

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:22.360
with all possibilities equally likely.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.970
Now let's get the numerator.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.550
For the numerator, so I'll just say--

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:31.900
for a full house then, I'm just
going to write as an example,

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.750
three 7's and two 10's.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:38.500
It really helps to just have some
concrete example in mind, some numbers

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:40.150
to think about.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.130
So we want to-- now
what's the probability?

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.940
Well, first of all, I need to choose--

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.330
what do I have three of?

00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:52.190
I wrote down 7's here, but that
could have been anything, all right?

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:56.830
There are 13 possibilities,
or you could say 13 choose 1.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:00.310
Now I'm multiplying because I'm
using the multiplication rule, OK?

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.512
So in my mind, I'm imagining--

00:40:02.512 --> 00:40:05.595
I'm not going to draw the whole tree
because I'd have to draw 13 branches,

00:40:05.595 --> 00:40:08.350
but I'm imagining that
at the first branching,

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:12.080
I'm choosing any rank--
ace, 2, 3, 4, whatever.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:16.930
Now in my mind, I'm imagining I chose
7, so I'm focusing on the 7 branch,

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.540
and then it's branching further.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.940
I have 13 choices and I have
7's and I need three 7's.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.390
Well, there are four
7's in a deck of cards

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.730
and I need to choose
three out of the four,

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:30.940
so I'm going to multiply by 4 choose 3.

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.790
Then I need to choose what the
other one is, so I wrote 10's here,

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.191
but it could have been anything.

00:40:35.191 --> 00:40:36.940
There's 12 possibilities,
because it could

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.670
be anything except 7's in that case.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:43.690
And then we need two
of those, 4 choose 2.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.670
And that's it.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:48.580
Now there are other ways
to write the answer, OK?

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.690
But I recommend thinking about it this
way, thinking in terms of the tree.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.624
It's a more structured way to do it,
you're less likely to make a mistake.

00:40:56.624 --> 00:40:59.290
If you have some other method you
like for doing these problems,

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:03.130
you can try to do it and then
compute and see if it's the same,

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.740
but it helps to think
in terms of the tree--

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.470
think in terms of the
multiplication rule.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.217
OK.

00:41:09.217 --> 00:41:11.050
Well that's the probability
of a full house.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:21.550
So n choose k is what's
called a binomial coefficient,

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.640
but it's also an example
of a choice, right?

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:28.580
We're choosing k things out of
n where order doesn't matter.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:34.240
So I want to quickly talk about
what happens if the order matters,

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.090
that kind of thing.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.265
So what we're doing is sampling,
so I call this the sampling table.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:50.230
So it's going to be a 2x2 table,
and we'll try to fill it in.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.530
So sampling means we
have some population

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:05.140
of items or people or anything,
and we're drawing a sample.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:09.614
So we're choosing k
objects out of n, and we

00:42:09.614 --> 00:42:11.530
want to know how many
ways are there to do it.

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:17.750
And there are two possibilities.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.320
Either we do it--

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.755
I'm going to draw a 2x2 table.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.140
Either we sample with replacement--

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.770
replacement means, for example,
imagine we were conducting a survey

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.790
and we pick a person and ask
them a bunch of questions

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.590
and then we kind of put them back.

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.860
With replacing, we're allowed
to pick the same person again.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:47.380
Without replacement would mean,
then the next person we pick

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.546
has to be someone different.

00:42:48.546 --> 00:42:50.720
So there's two different
applications-- sometimes

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.030
the replacement is relevant
and sometimes not replacement,

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:59.570
so sampling with or without replacement.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:03.160
And then the other possibility--
do we care about order or not?

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.840
So I'll say order matters
or order doesn't matter.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.740
And they want to fill in this table.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.040
Does everyone understand
the setup of the problem?

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.910
We have. n objects or n people,
we're going to pick k of them.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:26.140
In this case, this is with replacements,
so we pick one, put it back; pick one,

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.090
put it back, OK?

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:29.500
Until we have k of them.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:36.760
And order matters, meaning if I pick,
you know, Fred and then I pick John,

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.640
that would count differently from--

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.220
as a different possibility of
picking John and then Fred, OK?

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.490
So in this case, it's immediate--
how many possibilities there are

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.710
is just n to the k.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.070
I don't need to do any
calculation for that, that's just

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.880
immediate from the multiplication rule.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.330
There's n choices each time, OK?

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:55.850
So that's it.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:58.030
Now this corner here,
that's what we just did.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:07.440
Pick k people without replacement, order
doesn't matter, that's n choose k--

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:09.930
is the number of ways to do that, OK?

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.470
Now let's think about this one--

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:15.810
order matters, and we
pick without replacement.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.846
Again, it's immediate from
the multiplication rule, OK?

00:44:18.846 --> 00:44:20.220
So you don't have to memorize it.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:23.660
I don't want you to memorize this
table, I want you to understand, like--

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:26.370
you should understand why this
is immediate, this is immediate,

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:28.140
this is immediate.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:32.580
I didn't write it yet, but it's n
times n minus 1, blah blah blah,

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.140
all the way down to n minus k plus 1.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.300
Because there's n choices
for the first person,

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:47.080
and then since I'm not replacing that
person and there's n minus 1 choices

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.240
and so on, until we get
to n minus k plus 1.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.320
Now this is closely connected to
this as we just showed on that board.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.991
If you take this thing and divide it
by k factorial, you'll get this, OK?

00:44:56.991 --> 00:44:58.990
And you should think about
why that makes sense.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:05.710
OK, so these three boxes were
all very easy to fill in, right?

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:08.920
So hopefully this one will be easy.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.560
Actually, it's not.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.180
You can try to figure this
one out for yourself--

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.640
and I think it's good practice
to try to think about it,

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.590
but it's very, very difficult, at
least compared to these three, OK?

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.230
Order of magnitude more
difficult. It turns out

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:31.620
that the answer is n
plus k minus 1 choose k.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.800
And for practice, you may want to try--

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.030
just choose some very
small values of n and k

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.080
and verify that this is
correct in a small example.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.020
And if you enjoy, you know,
solving these kinds of things,

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.880
you could think about why this is true.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.600
We'll prove this next time.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.670
So these three should be obvious to you
once you understand the multiplication

00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:52.280
rule.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.550
This one is much more subtle but useful.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:59.500
So for now, you know, you
should know this result,

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.620
but we'll prove it next time.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:06.520
So this is basically kind of summarizes
most of what we need for counting.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.890
This is all you need for counting--

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.020
almost everything for the homework.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:16.657
And there are-- at this point,
you can do most of the homework.

00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:19.240
There are a couple of little
things we'll get to on Wednesday.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.312
Normally I'll cover everything you
need by Monday, but in this case,

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:24.520
we have a holiday, so there's
a couple of loose ends.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.310
Most of the homework you can do
already, so just start already.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.060
OK, so have a good weekend.
