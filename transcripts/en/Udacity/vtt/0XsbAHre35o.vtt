00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.556
It's a really good idea to be familiar with some common algorithms for

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:08.090
processing values in a loop. You've seen a couple of them already. You've seen

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.429
how to compute the average of a sequence of inputs and you've seen how to find

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.448
the largest element. There are quite a few more like that, counting matches,

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:19.507
finding the first match, position of the first match, finding all matches. And

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.920
so on, and so on. Instead of me tediously telling you something about each of

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.834
them, we've prepared a fact sheet where you can find the pseudo-code and an

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:31.060
example for easy reference. And Sara will practice a couple of those with you.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.651
The point is that you want to be familiar with what algorithms are out there,

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.829
so that you can adapt them as necessary.
