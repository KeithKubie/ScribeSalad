00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.730
So we have our object diagram started.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.950
And right now these objects
are just kind of floating around.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.640
We haven't really talked about
how they might be interconnected.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.220
So let's add some connections or if
we're going to use the more formal term,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.590
we'll say, let's add some relationships.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.400
Relationships that we're going to add
are going to ones that we've borrowed

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.070
from UML and
those are the contains relationship and

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.130
the kind of relationship and
these are also known by other names.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.960
For instance contains might
be known as part of and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.700
a kind of might also
be known as a type of.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.689
And there's other variations too.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.220
So what do these mean?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.640
Let's start with
the contains relationship.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.640
Like it sounds, a contains relationship
is representative of when an object

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.960
contains another object.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.010
If we think about the world object,
it contains a robot,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.030
it contains an alien, has a background.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.780
Also has a dialogue bubble and the.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.250
But we're going to leave those out for
now.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.960
So in our diagram, let's create some
relationships between the world and

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.580
the robot, the alien and the background.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.380
So I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.800
move some things around just
to make some extra space.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.700
And to represent
the contains relationship,

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.410
we'll draw arrows from the world object
to the objects that it contains and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.080
label them as contains relationships.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.310
Pay close attention to
the direction of the arrows.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.950
For these relationships, it's
pointing from the world to the robot,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.480
to the alien, and to the background.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.380
And the reason that it points in
this direction is it allows us to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.980
read the relationship by
just following the arrow.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.580
Now we could also said
that the app contains

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.480
each of the objects in this diagram,
but if I'm going to add an arrow for

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.620
every single object in our diagram,
it could get a little hard to follow.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.940
So to keep our diagram simple we just
want to add the contains relationships

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.600
from the app to the most
high level objects.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500
By high level I mean objects that are
bigger in the sense that they have more

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.250
complexity about them.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.590
So for instance the World object is at
a higher level than the Alien object in

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.520
the sense that it probably has more
functionality contained within it.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.730
Another way to think about it is that
the World probably plays a bigger role

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.620
as part of the app than the Alien does.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.280
In general you want to keep this going
from the most high level object like

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.940
In this case the alien aventure
to the lower level objects.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.410
So for instance an alien adventure
consists or contains a world,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.770
world contains a robot,
robot can contain a badge and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.100
we can add a relationship for
that later.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.060
Now the distinctions that we're making
here in these relationships that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.070
we're adding again they're
completely up to you.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.470
Where I'm using a contains relationship
between the world and the alien, you

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.815
might use something else, or you might
not even have a relationship at all.

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:47.030
Or we're on labeling this
is a contains relationship.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.070
I might not even have that.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.560
I might even remove an alien adventure.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.710
Because the world is kind of
the most high level object and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.210
by the title here we know that we're
talking about the alien adventure app.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.160
But again it's just personal preference,
you can do whatever you want to.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.220
So moving on, let's talk about the other
relationship, the kind of relationship.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.890
This is one of my favorites.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.200
It's used to describe objects
that have similarities and

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.440
it also involves a little
bit of abstract thinking.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.520
For instance let's think
about the alien and

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.410
the robot, they're actually pretty
similar, the robot and the alien.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.650
And can animate, we saw that the robot
could move across the screen and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.500
the alien is animating right now.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.030
And they're both able
to speak to each other,

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.180
so in a sense they're a little
bit like actors in a play.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.100
Now this is the abstract part, the
aliens and the robot are like actors in

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.760
a play, then why not add an object to or
diagram that represents an actor.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.080
I mean that sounds pretty good to me,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.300
an actor is an object they can be
animated and participates in discussions

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.450
and just like we said both the alien and
the robot are kinds of actors.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.910
And that's how we'll add
this kind of relationship.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.420
We'll start by adding
an actor to the diagram.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.950
And then we'll add relationships from
the alien to the actor because an alien

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.620
is a kind of actor.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.760
And from the robot, the actor because
the robot is a kind of actor.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.670
And I hope you've noticed that for
this kind of relationships,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.600
the direction of the arrows again,
we're going from the alien to the actor.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.620
So it reads very naturally
an alien is a kind of actor.
