00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.759
When it comes to giving holiday gifts, it’s
the thought that counts, right?

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:04.759
WRONG.

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.759
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS ON THE LINE.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.640
DO NOT SCREW THIS UP.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.280
Hey holiday shoppers, Chastity here filling
in for DNews.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.439
Shopping for holiday gifts is an unavoidable
pain that we endure year after year.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.050
Fighting through traffic to get to the malls.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.550
Fighting at the malls to get parking.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.089
Long lines, limited budgets, high stress.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.800
Online shopping has made that process a bit
easier, but thinking of the perfect gift is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.589
still the biggest challenge of all.

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.239
According to science, it’s NOT just the
thought that counts.

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.170
Studies show that giving bad gifts COULD potentially
hurt your relationships.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.761
So, if you’re one of the many last minute
shoppers out there, there’s a lot more on

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:41.340
the line than you think.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.760
A 2012 study in the Journal of Experimental
Psychology: General, found that the thought

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.100
only counts under specific conditions.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.990
At first, when participants thought about
receiving a gift they liked, the thought didn’t

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.990
count.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.080
The amount of thought they believed givers
put into it was not correlated with their

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.420
perception of the gift.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.820
Then, participants thought about times they
received a bad gift.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.200
In this case, the givers’ thought process
DID count, and WAS correlated with the evaluation

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.200
of the gift.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.749
The receivers were triggered by the bad gift
to think about the givers’ intentions.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:10.950
Probably along the lines of, “What the hell
were they thinking?

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.399
Why would I want SAND ART?”

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.270
Hot tip - NO ONE wants sand art.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.990
A study in the Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology looks at close relationships.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.289
The researchers argue that people are happiest
in their relationships when they believe they

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.689
have found someone who understands them and
shares their experiences.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.689
So good gifts signify similarity in a relationship,
which does little for the relationship itself.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.179
Bad gifts, however, could cause people to
question their similarity, which damages the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:36.179
relationship.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.740
A 2011 study in the Journal of Experimental
Social Psychology, found that people appreciate

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.039
the gifts they explicitly request more than
those they do not.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.009
We want what we ask for, plain and simple.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.450
Yet as gift givers, we don’t understand
that - we assume both solicited and unsolicited

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.240
gifts are equally appreciated.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.560
So if your loved one gives you the ol’ “Oh
I dunno, surprise me!”...DON’T.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.479
Think about that year your aunt got you that
shake weight.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.619
Or that gift card from your friend for the
chain restaurant you hate that’s STILL in

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.740
your wallet.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.509
Instead, ask for an idea of what they might
want.

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.690
Get something you know they’ll like, especially
if you want to be closer with them.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.200
And do not, I repeat, do not re-gift something
you got from someone else.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.530
Don’t be that guy.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.530
They will find out.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.730
