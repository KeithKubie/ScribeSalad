00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.230
I was so honored and delighted
to be awarded this prize

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.530
by the Library of Congress
because the library

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.020
of Congress is a place
very dear to my heart.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.150
It's a place where
I have done research

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.750
since the very beginning
of my career as a historian

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.170
and I find a libraries
and archives

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.120
to be something rather magical.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.500
I always feel as if I
get into a time machine

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.860
and can really delve back into
another era and another kind

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.880
of understanding of the
Human Condition Library

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.180
of Congress has had a number

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.280
of very significant
contributions to my work.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.440
One, perhaps the best
known of the kinds

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.420
of materials I used
are the photographs,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.470
the civil war photographs, which
are such a rich resource now.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.390
Many of the best
known civil war images

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.070
in the library's collections
are the ones of the bodies

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.200
on the battlefields, the
gardener and Brady photographs.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.140
But in my book about death,
I found a lot of images

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.080
that I hadn't been
familiar with before

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.630
about other dimensions of death.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.530
Embalmers on the battlefield or
grave diggers working together

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.800
or a whole other set of visual
representations of things

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.780
that I had been finding
in words in my research,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.050
so that was a marvelous
treasure that the library

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.140
of Congress unlocked
for me, but a manual set

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.640
of manuscripts also are one

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.330
of my favorite elements
of that book.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.600
Manuscripts that are in
the library congress.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.570
Most of the papers of Clara
Barton, the battlefield nurse

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.130
who kept extensive records of
her experiences during the war

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.760
and also was very involved
in some of the issues

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.070
about identifying the dead
and honoring the dead that are

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.470
at the core of my work in
this Republic of suffering.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.760
And I remember one of the most
moving things in the collection

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.080
for me was a set of
little notebooks,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.070
very small in which she
would write down information

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.590
that patients would tell her

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.270
as she was serving them
with their addresses.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.870
Next of kin.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.640
And knowing what I did about
the high level of mortality

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.800
and the lack of dog tags
or other identification.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.560
I'm sure that she kept
this information so that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.730
if an individual died or if
she wished to communicate

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.040
for some other reason with the
family, she was able to do that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.430
and and they were just the right
size to keep in our pocket.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.300
So I could imagine her moving
about the civil war hospital

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.000
with this little notebook now
in the library of Congress,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.970
in her pocket, in her hands
as she undertook the work.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.300
Not just of medical service
and care for these individuals,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.180
but trying to care
for their families.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.590
Those around them who might
never otherwise know what the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.620
fate of their loved
ones had been.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.530
So the very physicality of those
books meant a great deal to me.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:03.250
And that's part of the
library of Congress's wonders.
