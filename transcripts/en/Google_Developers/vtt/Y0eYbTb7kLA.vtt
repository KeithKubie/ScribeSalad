00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.825
FEMALE SPEAKER: What is the
biggest challenge designers

00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:02.450
face currently?

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.950
JENNA BILOTTA: The
biggest challenge

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.470
designers are
facing today is how

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.445
to describe their
value to non-designers.

00:00:07.445 --> 00:00:10.090
ADAM DEBRECZENI: Moving from a
static medium to a dynamic one.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.620
MIKE SIMONIAN: To
anticipate change.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.745
BRANDON WALKIN: Designing
in an interactive medium.

00:00:13.745 --> 00:00:15.645
ROMAN NURIK: We need
more and better tools.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:16.394
NOAH LEVIN: Tools.

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:18.630
I think we have a hard
time getting out our ideas.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.470
We have great ideas.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.070
I think everyone
has great ideas.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.357
But finding a way to get
them out into the world

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.440
is really the harder part.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.720
MAAIKE EVERS: To find simplicity
in all the complex systems

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.971
that we're tackling today.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:32.180
ISABELLE OLSSON:
Hardware and software

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.630
moving so quickly that
we don't have enough time

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.300
to put our hearts
and souls into it.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.966
VICTORIA SLAKER:
That's speed to market.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.440
JOSH MORENSTEIN: Speed
to market and inability

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.255
to spend enough time
refining your ideas.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:45.550
MOLLY STEVENS: So many
problems, so little time.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.270
FEMALE SPEAKER:
What do you think

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.686
is the biggest
challenge designers

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:48.710
will face in the future?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.085
SCOTT DOORLEY: I
think technology

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.904
will become more complex and
have more moral questions.

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:57.070
BRADEN KOWITZ: We are
building more and more complex

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.100
interfaces for people.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.760
And people are changing the way
they behave faster and faster.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.385
And that makes design
such a challenge.

00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:05.670
PAUL COLTON: The complexity
of future devices

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.580
and capabilities.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.070
MICHAEL DITULLO: As we
continue to interact further up

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.680
the value chain
with organizations,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.910
how do we remain designers?

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.404
MITCH HEINRICH: I think
managing complexity,

00:01:15.404 --> 00:01:16.320
keeping things simple.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320
CHAD THORNTON: I think it's the
same challenges they've always

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.210
faced.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.530
It's both having the vision
and realizing the vision.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.770
RYAN FREITAS: I think the
challenges are very old.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.895
They're trying to make
something beautiful, useful,

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:26.695
and well-built.

00:01:26.695 --> 00:01:28.830
JENNY ARDEN: I really
believe that design

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.642
will be a greater part of
leadership in all companies.

00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:33.350
I am really looking
forward to a designer

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.810
actually being more
like a CEO at companies.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.230
And so I think
designers will have

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.944
the challenge of having
the emotional connection

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:43.360
to the work, and to users, but
also having business sense.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.910
