00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.210
This Valentine’s Day,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.240
revisit the film that reminds you that no
matter how much you love each other

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.460
you’re both gonna grow old and die.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.610
The Notebook.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.610
From sappy author Nicholas Sparks, comes the
timeless romance that paved the way for millions

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.200
of people to form unrealistic expectations
of their real-life relationships.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.500
Meet Allie, an attractive, wealthy, Southern
Belle who’s biggest problem is that everyone

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.070
adores her.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:50.660
Meet Noah, a poor country boy who’s entire
family is dead.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.900
When these two find each other, he’ll criticize
her for being a pushover, and then constantly

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.900
tell her what to do.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.040
"Get in the water!

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.480
Get in!"

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.490
And she’ll abandon him on numerous occasions.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.760
Together they’ll be so indecisive, you’ll
wonder why they’re even trying.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
"I love you."

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.760
"I love him!"

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.760
"I hate you!

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
I hate you!"

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.979
"I love him!"

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.049
"Now I hate you!"

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.650
"I need you to tell him that I love him."

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.710
"If you leave here, I hate you."

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.740
"Do you guys love each other?"

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.840
"Look at us: we're already fighting!"

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.850
"Well, that's what we do!"

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.850
A love.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.640
that taught an entire generation of women,
that it's perfectly okay to string along a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.340
sweet, handsome, supportive guy, as long as
you’re able to satisfy your

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.149
every impulsive desire.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:45.229
A movie so generic, yet inexplicably popular,
it’s basically the Olive Garden of Love

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.460
Stories.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.469
And a romance that will make nagging girlfriends
ask “Why aren’t you more like Ryan Gosling?”

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.909
Prompting all boyfriends to ask: “Can we
please watch Die Hard?

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.729
Prepare to relive the bad driving,

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:07.740
the violence,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.340
the shirtless-ness,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.310
the red dresses,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.959
the more shirtless-ness,

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.200
the horrible slurping,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.970
and the death of feminism.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.970
Starring...

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.110
So wait, he wrote hundreds of letters, but
couldn’t just call her once?

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.180
Ugh could have saved me 2 hours.
