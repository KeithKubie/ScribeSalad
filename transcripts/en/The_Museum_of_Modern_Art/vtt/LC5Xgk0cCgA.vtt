00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.911
Our inspiration
was Walker Evans, strictly,

00:00:03.078 --> 00:00:04.955
and we looked at a lot of his stuff.

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.075
Our inspiration wasn’t
any other black and white films

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:09.645
but strictly photography.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.570
Framing-wise, but also aesthetics.

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:16.886
Whenever I found anything
in corrugated iron, we stopped and shot.

00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:19.811
Because I thought that was
the coolest thing in black and white.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.063
And of course for Alice,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.320
that was the first time I was
actually able to shoot in America.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.573
It was quite an improvised shoot,
we were a tiny little crew.

00:00:32.543 --> 00:00:37.528
And I wanted to start it
somewhere in the South

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:40.541
and we didn’t really have the money
to go all the way to Florida.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:42.501
So we traveled down and I said,

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:45.255
“When we see the first palm trees,
we’ll start shooting.”

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:47.673
And that became North Carolina.

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:52.470
So for some reason it starts
in Surf City, North Carolina.

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:56.181
It was also the first
road movie that I shot.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.268
That little film
"Alice in the Cities" was...

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.396
a way for me to discover
that there was a genre where

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.523
I could feel
like a fish in the water.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.570
It was very liberating
to shoot with such a little crew,

00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:11.155
and direct sound...

00:01:12.065 --> 00:01:13.663
And on the road traveling,

00:01:14.005 --> 00:01:17.215
and stopping wherever
I saw something that I liked

00:01:17.335 --> 00:01:18.700
and then we invent a scene there.

00:01:19.028 --> 00:01:21.296
Did you take a lot
of still photographs on that trip?

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:24.955
I was still
a Polaroid photographer.

00:01:25.325 --> 00:01:27.708
And "Alice in the Cities"
of course is the film

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:32.551
where people saw for the first time
the I-670 land camera.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.055
We got a prototype from them.

00:01:37.326 --> 00:01:39.938
And even when the film came out

00:01:40.058 --> 00:01:42.635
most people had never seen
this camera where...

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.025
the picture came out,
and then you saw nothing

00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:47.358
and slowly it would develop
in front of your eyes.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:50.986
So that was
the big fetish of the film.

00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:55.130
But you were interested
in Polaroids before that.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.913
What drew you
to Polaroids as opposed to Leicas

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:00.610
or printing in a darkroom?

00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.876
I loved the idea
that they only existed one.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.336
I liked the idea that...

00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.133
you took a picture
and it only existed once.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.883
Of course you could make copies

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.136
but I never did, and I liked
the idea that it was...

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:20.225
You took it once
and it existed once,

00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:23.393
and it was just
one piece that was

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.703
entirely related
to that second that you took it.

00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:30.983
There was
so much truth about the act,

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:35.338
and there is nothing
phony about a Polaroid.

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:37.093
Because you can’t fake anything.

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:39.535
You can’t interfere
with the process.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.830
And once it’s there, that’s
what it is, that’s all you get.

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:46.208
I really liked that;
for years, I didn’t do anything else.

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.628
Later on, I went
to a larger form and negatives,

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.173
and took photography
more seriously.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.383
But at the time,

00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:58.846
that was the first camera
you could actually do selfies with.

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.893
The first camera you can
really be very spontaneous.

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.061
And to give those pictures away,

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:08.940
sometimes people
just didn’t know...

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:11.943
you could do something
and then hand it over to them

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.736
and say, “Keep it.”
