00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.740
They say there’s a time and place for everything,
just as long as it doesn’t offend anyone.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.610
It may seem that shows like South Park, Family
Guy and Game of Thrones can get away with

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.430
anything, but even they aren’t immune from
censorship imposed by networks and pubic opinion.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.380
But what could possibly have been so offensive
about Sesame Street that had it banned in

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.070
Mississippi or The Price is Right that had
them pull dozens of episodes from syndication?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.610
Find out in our list of 10 TV Show Banned
For Shocking Reasons…

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.610
Simpsons

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
The season nine episode of The Simpsons titled
“The Cartridge Family” showed what happens

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.980
when people like Homer acquire firearms.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.140
His reckless misuse of the weapon wasn’t
considered very funny by British censors who

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.550
didn’t allow the episode to be aired when
in initially premiered in 1997.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.000
It would later appear on a “Too Hot For
TV” VHS compilation and would air in syndication

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.650
in the UK but not without several bits cut,
such as Marge deciding to keep the gun herself

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.530
at the end and Moe’s lesson on how to turn
a gun into five guns.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.530
Seinfeld

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.080
As a big network show, Seinfeld didn’t usually
court controversy and one of their final episodes

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.190
illustrated why.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.250
In “Puerto Rican Day” the characters get
stuck in traffic caused by the Puerto Rican

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
day parade.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.220
The parade is mostly an excuse have the characters
gridlocked and is never even shown.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.860
However in the episode’s final minutes,
Kramer accidentally lights a Puerto Rican

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.430
flag on fire and gets chased by several angry
parade goers.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.100
The National Puerto Rican coalition took particular
umbrage with Kramer’s observation that “it’s

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.420
like this every day in Puerto Rico” as they
attacked Jerry’s car.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.690
It was called an “unconscionable insult”
to Puerto Ricans.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.280
NBC issued an apology and pulled the episode
from syndication.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Sesame Street

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.260
What could be so objectionable about puppets
teaching children to count that got Sesame

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.670
Street banned for 22 days in 1970 Mississippi?

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.870
To but it bluntly, racism.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.280
Not racism in the show, but on the part of
a committee who was uncomfortable with an

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.689
integrated cast of kids and decided to flip
a big bird to the Civil Rights movement.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.270
No official reason was given when they first
pulled the show from the airwaves, but once

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.360
an anonymous insider leaked the committee’s
reasoning the public outrage was too loud

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900
to ignore and they reversed their decision.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.900
Boy Meets World

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.840
When Boy Meets World began in 1993 nobody
expected it to last seven seasons.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.879
During its run, Cory went through many things,
including puberty.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.099
By the seventh season, star Ben Savage was
20 years old, so the show runners tried to

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.890
include some more age appropriate themes,
such as underage drinking and premarital sex.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.650
The show found a new audience in syndication
on the Disney channel, but to this day there

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.359
are 3 episodes that fans who discovered the
show here have never seen due to their mature

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.359
content.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.430
They’ll just have to use their imagination
for what happened between Boy Meets World

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.299
and Girl Meets World.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.299
Star Trek

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.730
In the original Star Trek series, the crew
would often find themselves on planets with

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.989
societies that mirror aspects of our own usually
accompanied by some kind of social commentary.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.040
In a second season episode titled “Patterns
of Force” the Starship Enterprise finds

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.859
themselves on a planet with a rising power
that emulates the Nazis.

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.439
Because of the blatant depiction of the Third
Reich and a character claiming that the Nazis

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:08.639
were the most “efficient society ever”,
German networks refused to air the episode

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:09.940
for nearly 3 decades.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.799
There’s clearly a lot of shame surrounding
this aspect of German history, but it’s

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.139
not exactly something that can just be swept
under the rug by removing all cultural references.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.139
X Files

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.340
While the X-Files predominantly dealt with
UFOs and alien conspiracies, some episodes

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.299
were much more horror than Sci Fi.

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.950
In season 4 they aired one of their most controversial
episodes ever with “Home”, a story involving

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.930
a heavily inbred family cut off from the outside
world.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.989
In addition to the taboo subject matter, it
was an intensely scary episode and little

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.879
too much for what primetime network audiences
were used to.

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.819
It was the only X Files episode to get slapped
with a TV-MA rating but they still received

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.069
viewer complaints and the episode was removed
from syndication on Fox.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.389
“Home” is now considered one of the best
episodes of the series, but in 1996 people

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.739
trying to unwind on Sunday night with Mulder
and Scully’s latest alien adventure just

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.480
weren’t prepared something that was more
Texas Chainsaw Massacre than Close Encounters.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.480
South Park

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.319
South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker
have continually pushed the boundaries of

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.560
censorship, and in 2010 they found out just
how far they could go.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.080
For their 200th episode they made a two part
special that tied together multiple story

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.410
lines from past seasons, one of which promised
to show the Muslim prophet Muhammad.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.120
After the first part aired, Stone and Parker
received death threats and Comedy Central

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.310
decided to censor the character with a black
bar and bleep out all mentions of the prophet’s

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.310
name.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.090
The irony being that South Park’s message
is often about censorship and freedom of speech,

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.980
so many thought they had meant to have the
character removed this way in order to prove

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.980
a point.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.480
They even incorporated the experience into
Kyle’s concluding monologue about using

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.310
violent threats to get your way, but this
was also bleeped out.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.470
The Price is Right

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.080
If you ever watched The Price is Right during
the Bob Barker years, you’ll remember that

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.190
he closed every episode with a reminder to
get your pets spayed or neutered.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:05.320
This wasn’t a sponsored message, but a personal
mantra from an ardent animal rights activist.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.840
Fur coats were once a common prize on the
game show, but at Barker’s request they

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.780
not only stopped giving them away, but agreed
not to air an re-runs or release DVDs of episodes

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.010
with fur prizes.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.180
He remains critical of other prizes the show
still gives away, such as tickets to Sea World

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.130
and the Calgary stampede, which is probably
why he wasn’t invited to partake in the

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:27.700
show’s 40th anniversary despite being the
host for 35 years.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.700
Family Guy

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.250
Like South Park, Family Guy found out just
how they could push the envelope in 2010 with

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.840
“Partial Terms of Endearment”, an episode
where Lois gets an abortion.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.720
Perhaps one of the reasons Family Guy is able
to get away with pretty much anything is because

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.890
the jokes are usually irreverent yet disconnected
from anything that’s actually happening

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.640
in the story or to the characters.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.870
Generally nothing is taboo on the show, but
when the entire third act was about Lois getting

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.750
the abortion, Fox wasn’t laughing and decided
to terminate the episode.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.860
Even the Cartoon’s Network’s Adult Swim
wouldn’t air it, but it played in the UK

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.390
and can now be seen on DVD and streaming platforms.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.390
Game of Thrones

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.650
When you have a show with as many severed
body parts as HBO’s Game of Thrones, sometimes

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.190
you have to outsource their production or
rent them in bulk.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.640
This is how ex president George W. Bush’s
head accidentally ended up impaled on a stick

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.390
in the first season much to HBO’s dismay.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.540
Even with a wig Bush’s profile is recognizable
in a couple shots, though the show’s makers

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.730
claim it wasn’t intentional and didn’t
even notice until after the scene was shot.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.720
Intentional or not, HBO was forced to issue
an apology for what was seen as disrespect

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.450
to the former Head of State and promised to
remove the shot from all future DVDs.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.280
How many of these banned episodes have you
been able to track down?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.280
Were there any we missed?
