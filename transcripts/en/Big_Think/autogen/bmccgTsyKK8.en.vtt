00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:08.770
 
you

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780
 
 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.419
 
yeah it's hard to tell of course but

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
yeah it's hard to tell of course but
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.060
yeah it's hard to tell of course but
that I've been interested in science

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
that I've been interested in science
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.190
that I've been interested in science
certainly from a child I'd meant I was

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200
certainly from a child I'd meant I was
 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.580
certainly from a child I'd meant I was
mostly interested in numbers I was

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590
mostly interested in numbers I was
 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.490
mostly interested in numbers I was
calculating things at a very young age I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
calculating things at a very young age I
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.429
calculating things at a very young age I
just fell in love with numbers and then

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
just fell in love with numbers and then
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.980
just fell in love with numbers and then
it spread from there to the rest of

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
it spread from there to the rest of
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.990
it spread from there to the rest of
nature and I became I remember the total

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
nature and I became I remember the total
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.570
nature and I became I remember the total
eclipse of the Sun which happened when I

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580
eclipse of the Sun which happened when I
 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.049
eclipse of the Sun which happened when I
was three and I was furious with my

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
was three and I was furious with my
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.729
was three and I was furious with my
father because he wouldn't take us to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
father because he wouldn't take us to
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.160
father because he wouldn't take us to
see it she would have meant about about

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
see it she would have meant about about
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.369
see it she would have meant about about
it the whole day's driving and anyway so

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
it the whole day's driving and anyway so
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.289
it the whole day's driving and anyway so
he said no you can see the partial

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:48.299
he said no you can see the partial
 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.079
he said no you can see the partial
eclipse and that's it and I thought that

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089
eclipse and that's it and I thought that
 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.950
eclipse and that's it and I thought that
was terribly unfair

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960
 
 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.530
 
so when I never learned much science in

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540
so when I never learned much science in
 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.260
so when I never learned much science in
school that was I think an advantage in

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270
school that was I think an advantage in
 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.290
school that was I think an advantage in
the old days I grew up in England and we

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300
the old days I grew up in England and we
 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.120
the old days I grew up in England and we
spent most of the time on Latin and

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130
spent most of the time on Latin and
 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.090
spent most of the time on Latin and
Greek and very little on science and I

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100
Greek and very little on science and I
 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.950
Greek and very little on science and I
think that was good because it meant we

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960
think that was good because it meant we
 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.859
think that was good because it meant we
didn't get turned off it was science was

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869
didn't get turned off it was science was
 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.200
didn't get turned off it was science was
something we did for fun and not because

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210
something we did for fun and not because
 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.860
something we did for fun and not because
we had to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870
 
 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.730
 
yes well I was 15 when the war started

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740
yes well I was 15 when the war started
 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.560
yes well I was 15 when the war started
so for a long time I just stayed in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570
so for a long time I just stayed in
 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.210
so for a long time I just stayed in
school but then so it well I was lucky I

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220
school but then so it well I was lucky I
 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.920
school but then so it well I was lucky I
had only two years of the war and so I

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930
had only two years of the war and so I
 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.540
had only two years of the war and so I
went to work for the Royal Air Force

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550
went to work for the Royal Air Force
 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.420
went to work for the Royal Air Force
when I was 19 which was already just two

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
when I was 19 which was already just two
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.290
when I was 19 which was already just two
years before it ended so I went to the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300
years before it ended so I went to the
 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.730
years before it ended so I went to the
bomber command headquarters and that was

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740
bomber command headquarters and that was
 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.850
bomber command headquarters and that was
July 43 and so I had just two years of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
July 43 and so I had just two years of
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.779
July 43 and so I had just two years of
it the last two years and I was working

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789
it the last two years and I was working
 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:04.960
it the last two years and I was working
as a statistician mostly just collecting

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970
as a statistician mostly just collecting
 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.150
as a statistician mostly just collecting
all the information about the air force

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160
all the information about the air force
 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.210
all the information about the air force
operations particularly the bombing of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220
operations particularly the bombing of
 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.850
operations particularly the bombing of
Germany so I had a sort of front for a

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
Germany so I had a sort of front for a
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.449
Germany so I had a sort of front for a
front row seat view of that of course it

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459
front row seat view of that of course it
 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.280
front row seat view of that of course it
was a total shambles that the whole

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
was a total shambles that the whole
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.110
was a total shambles that the whole
campaign was a great tragedy for both

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
campaign was a great tragedy for both
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.440
campaign was a great tragedy for both
sides and there was nothing I could do

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
sides and there was nothing I could do
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.780
sides and there was nothing I could do
about it
