00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.346
- Just look at how rich and
beautiful that curry is.

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.442
Whoa, this is like richness
on top of richness.

00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:16.192
(rhythmic music)

00:00:18.338 --> 00:00:20.043
Good morning, it's Mark Weins with

00:00:20.043 --> 00:00:23.763
migrationology.com in Mumbai, India.

00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:27.018
Ying and I had a quick breakfast
at the hotel this morning,

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:29.757
and today we're gonna be
hanging out with Myron

00:00:29.757 --> 00:00:32.964
who has been watching our
videos for many years.

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:37.713
He invited us to hang out
and to go around Mumbai.

00:00:37.713 --> 00:00:40.081
So he should be here soon,

00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:42.801
and I think we're gonna
eat a lot of food today.

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:47.341
We met up with Myron, and
we just jumped into a taxi.

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.844
You want to say what's up, Myron?

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:51.026
- Hi guys, Myron here.

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:53.229
I'm so happy Mark has made it all

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.661
the way to Mumbai finally,
finally, you know?

00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:59.016
And yes, it's really
great, it's really awesome,

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:02.935
and I'm so lucky that I'm in his video.

00:01:02.935 --> 00:01:04.562
I mean, just like you
guys sitting out there,

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:07.346
I used to be at my home
watching his videos,

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:09.785
and now, here I am in his video.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.432
So anyways, thank you, Mark.

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:15.508
- Thank you very much,
Myron, for the kind words.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:19.065
We are on our way over to Crawford Market.

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:21.815
(rhythmic music)

00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:40.832
We arrived to Crawford Market.

00:01:40.832 --> 00:01:44.176
This is a huge market area in Mumbai.

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:45.973
This is the indoor section,

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:49.189
which is housed in this
old colonial building.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.185
You can find just about
everything here from candies

00:01:52.185 --> 00:01:55.852
and snacks and sweets,
to nuts and shampoos.

00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:00.971
Just about everything you can think

00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:03.435
of you can find here at this market.

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:06.759
This is the indoor section,
but if you go outside,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.926
there are many streets with
just a huge bazaar full

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:15.847
of everything you can
imagine to buy as well.

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:23.169
Along with all of the dried
products and the household

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.057
items, there's also some
really good looking fruit

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:28.552
at this market and some
vegetable vendors as well.

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:32.891
You can just smell the
ripeness of those mangoes.

00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:35.558
(horns honking)

00:02:40.965 --> 00:02:43.870
You've really gotta be
careful of the traffic

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.218
and the action that is
happening on this road.

00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:51.164
But we are walking down the
road from Crawford Market.

00:02:51.164 --> 00:02:54.423
(horns honking)

00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:56.997
This is definitely one
of the market streets

00:02:56.997 --> 00:03:00.921
where you have to kind of
duck so you don't get hit

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:04.588
sometimes by boxes or
transport or vehicles.

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:06.811
But it's an amazing place.

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.894
Just full of action.

00:03:08.894 --> 00:03:11.727
(rhythmic music)

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.765
This area is just fascinating.

00:03:40.765 --> 00:03:42.684
There's so much going on.

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.971
There are businesses and restaurants

00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:49.129
and stalls and just
lots and lots of people.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.562
Lots of action.

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:53.812
This is an amazing action filled place.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.927
This area is actually
the Mohammad Ali Road,

00:03:58.927 --> 00:04:02.541
which is a very, very famous
food street in Mumbai.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.467
But it's especially famous in

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:07.717
the Ramadan period as well as at night.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:18.639
We have stopped to eat
a little quick lunch

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.065
at a restaurant called Noor Mohammad.

00:04:21.065 --> 00:04:22.596
This restaurant is especially famous

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:24.883
for serving nalli nihari.

00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:26.277
This is beef.

00:04:26.277 --> 00:04:27.873
There are some chunks of beef,

00:04:27.873 --> 00:04:30.657
and then these little white
pieces are bone marrow

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:34.810
which has been extracted from
the bone and into the gravy.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.444
This is definitely an orange, oily gravy

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:41.231
and it smells and looks incredible.

00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.648
This is very fluffy actually.

00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:45.377
I think this is a tandoori roti.

00:04:45.377 --> 00:04:46.672
Is it a tandoori roti?

00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:49.589
And it's actually extremely fluffy.

00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:54.405
And break off a piece and
I'm gonna make a little

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:57.198
cone shape so I can
grab some of the curry.

00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:58.206
And I especially want to get some

00:04:58.206 --> 00:05:00.556
of the bone marrow in this first bite.

00:05:00.556 --> 00:05:04.723
Oh wow, just look at how rich
and beautiful that curry is.

00:05:11.214 --> 00:05:12.047
Wow.

00:05:15.455 --> 00:05:17.565
That is amazing.

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:18.605
Wow.

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:19.438
OK.

00:05:20.905 --> 00:05:24.072
It's so rich and so oily, but amazing.

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.198
It has kind of a light spice blend.

00:05:30.198 --> 00:05:32.018
And then that marrow.

00:05:32.018 --> 00:05:34.221
It literally just melts
in your mouth along

00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:36.367
with that oil and those spices.

00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:38.863
What I'm gonna do next is
grab a little wedge of lime

00:05:38.863 --> 00:05:42.363
and squeeze in a little bit of lime juice.

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.277
It's so ridiculously rich.

00:05:48.277 --> 00:05:49.360
It's so rich.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.517
Not only is there a lot of oil,

00:05:53.517 --> 00:05:55.241
but bone marrow on top of that.

00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.658
This is like richness on top of richness.

00:06:01.003 --> 00:06:02.870
Yeah, this is just one of the more

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.703
rich dishes I think I've ever had.

00:06:11.643 --> 00:06:14.726
So tender and it literally just melts

00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:19.096
into that bone marrow and oil and sauce.

00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:22.906
Wow, that is insane.

00:06:22.906 --> 00:06:25.632
- This nalli nihari that
I'm having, it's amazing.

00:06:25.632 --> 00:06:29.382
It's super rich, very
buttery, not too spicy,

00:06:30.743 --> 00:06:32.615
But yes, I love it.

00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:34.334
- Maybe it's one of the richest dishes

00:06:34.334 --> 00:06:35.844
I've had in a very long time.

00:06:35.844 --> 00:06:37.696
There's this little dish of salad.

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:39.891
I think it's chopped up chilies.

00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:41.082
I'm not sure what that little on is.

00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:42.661
It looks almost like ginger.

00:06:42.661 --> 00:06:45.828
I'm gonna pinch a little bit to taste.

00:06:47.398 --> 00:06:48.231
Mm.

00:06:49.535 --> 00:06:51.838
Yeah, that's sliced up chilies.

00:06:51.838 --> 00:06:53.099
A little bit spicy.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.978
And I think that is ginger,
but I think it's baby ginger

00:06:55.978 --> 00:06:57.778
because the ginger is very mild

00:06:57.778 --> 00:07:01.148
and just has a juicy ginger taste to it.

00:07:01.148 --> 00:07:02.296
Mm.

00:07:02.296 --> 00:07:05.364
And a nice lime sour flavor to it as well.

00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.973
One thing you can do, which
Myron has explained to me,

00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:11.027
is you can take a piece of
meat and just set it into

00:07:11.027 --> 00:07:15.110
the middle of the roti
and just kind of break it.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:20.803
And that way, it's easy to
grab pieces of the roti and

00:07:26.636 --> 00:07:28.845
take little bits of meat.

00:07:28.845 --> 00:07:31.373
Oh, and I think I could add
some marrow to this bite.

00:07:31.373 --> 00:07:33.790
Dip into that beautiful sauce

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:38.367
and some white jiggly bits of marrow.

00:07:41.128 --> 00:07:44.326
Wow, that marrow is unbelievable.

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:45.862
I have finished my roti,

00:07:45.862 --> 00:07:47.813
but I still have some of the curry left.

00:07:47.813 --> 00:07:50.007
So you can eat it like a soup

00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:52.674
at the bottom of all that gravy.

00:07:55.417 --> 00:07:56.250
Whoa.

00:07:58.805 --> 00:08:01.055
It's so buttery and so rich

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.850
and so smooth and so meaty.

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:11.709
Oh, one thing I was gonna
tell you is that in India,

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:16.079
because there are so many vegetarians,

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.579
you either eat veg or non-veg.

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:22.234
Veg means pure vegetarian,

00:08:22.234 --> 00:08:25.817
whereas non-veg usually
means extreme meat.

00:08:27.448 --> 00:08:29.561
In India, it would be
common to call a dish

00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:32.874
like this hardcore non-veg
because this is about

00:08:32.874 --> 00:08:37.840
as opposite as vegetarian
as you can possibly get.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.505
So it's worth mentioning that this

00:08:39.505 --> 00:08:41.172
is a pretty cool restaurant.

00:08:41.172 --> 00:08:43.464
It's on the side of the road.

00:08:43.464 --> 00:08:46.566
There's a highway which is above ground,

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:48.882
so it kind of has a dark feel to it.

00:08:48.882 --> 00:08:50.448
But then you come back
into this restaurant,

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:51.568
it's a real classic restaurant.

00:08:51.568 --> 00:08:56.244
There's bucket seat couches
that we are sitting on,

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:58.608
which it's the perfect environment

00:08:58.608 --> 00:09:00.941
for eating bone marrow stew.

00:09:02.787 --> 00:09:05.454
(horns honking)

00:09:14.657 --> 00:09:17.977
We are now walking around down the street

00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:20.409
in an area what is
called the Bhendi Bazaar,

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:24.450
which is another huge
bazaar area in Mumbai.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.146
I'm seeing just about
everything you can imagine

00:09:27.146 --> 00:09:31.313
once again including a little
shop full of different knives.

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:36.596
And then there are a lot of
household supplies, plastics.

00:09:38.553 --> 00:09:41.720
There are a bunch of cats eating meat.

00:09:43.197 --> 00:09:46.679
And then I'm seeing a lot
of kitchen supplies as well.

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.096
Pot stores, toys.

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:52.484
Yeah, there's a lot of
stuff in this market

00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:55.417
and just has an amazing feel to it.

00:09:55.417 --> 00:09:58.147
The stalls are on both sides of the lane.

00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:00.370
There are bicycles and motorcycles.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.159
There are buildings surrounding us.

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:05.778
There are, I think they are crows,

00:10:05.778 --> 00:10:07.942
which are just flying all overhead.

00:10:07.942 --> 00:10:11.306
This is a very interesting
place to just walk around

00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:16.043
and explore, and just to
people watch and to shop watch.

00:10:16.043 --> 00:10:18.793
(rhythmic music)

00:10:30.798 --> 00:10:32.052
- [Myron] (speaking foreign language).

00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:35.969
- (speaking foreign language).

00:10:42.888 --> 00:10:43.721
- [Myron] Cheese, if
you would like cheese.

00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:45.304
- Yeah, sure, sure.

00:10:49.813 --> 00:10:52.102
I don't think of sandwiches
when I think about Indian

00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:56.073
food, but in Mumbai,
sandwiches with masalas

00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:59.971
and different spices and
potatoes and vegetables

00:10:59.971 --> 00:11:03.554
are an extremely popular
street food snack.

00:11:06.158 --> 00:11:07.734
Is that beets?

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:08.651
OK, onions.

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:23.890
Cheese.

00:12:12.175 --> 00:12:13.743
This has to be one of the most fascinating

00:12:13.743 --> 00:12:16.878
street sandwiches I've ever seen made.

00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:19.571
He took two pieces of bread
and put butter all over them,

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:21.104
and then he added in.

00:12:21.104 --> 00:12:22.207
What did he cut in there?

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:23.917
Using a hacksaw blade,

00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:27.765
he sliced in some tomatoes, some onions.

00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:30.515
There's definitely some cucumber.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.000
Then masala potato
mixture he spread into it.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.980
Then he shredded on some cheese.

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:38.667
Then he added some chutneys.

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:41.360
And the best part about
him making the sandwiches

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.277
is that he had this iron
device sandwich maker,

00:12:46.424 --> 00:12:47.787
what you put the sandwich into,

00:12:47.787 --> 00:12:51.651
and then he stuck it over a propane fire,

00:12:51.651 --> 00:12:53.462
and it just grilled within that.

00:12:53.462 --> 00:12:54.751
So it's hot and fresh.

00:12:54.751 --> 00:12:58.751
This is a classic Indian
Mumbai street sandwich.

00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:02.661
We can see that cross section.

00:13:02.661 --> 00:13:04.290
Oh, that is beautiful.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.275
Look at all those layers of vegetables.

00:13:06.275 --> 00:13:08.989
And this is a vegetarian sandwich as well.

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.879
But there's some cheese.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.127
I'm gonna take this
first wedge of sandwich

00:13:13.127 --> 00:13:17.127
and I think I'll go in
for some of that chutney.

00:13:18.422 --> 00:13:20.590
Oh, and I'm losing some
ingredients though.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.423
Oh well.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:28.807
Mm.

00:13:29.901 --> 00:13:30.994
Oh, that's awesome.

00:13:30.994 --> 00:13:33.170
I can take a little bit of cumin in there.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.167
And what I really like is that beet root.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.000
That's really good.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.417
The beet root is just soft
and just sort of dissolves,

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:42.216
and then you have the crunchy cucumber,

00:13:42.216 --> 00:13:46.383
the crisp onion, and then
the cheese just is melted

00:13:47.719 --> 00:13:49.868
and just wraps it all together.

00:13:49.868 --> 00:13:54.252
And then that minty
chutney in there as well.

00:13:54.252 --> 00:13:56.169
That is pretty awesome.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:00.982
Mm.

00:14:00.982 --> 00:14:03.082
So many different vegetables.

00:14:03.082 --> 00:14:05.100
And even the potato is
really good in there.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.058
That was a surprisingly
extremely tasty sandwich.

00:14:09.058 --> 00:14:10.789
It was really colorful
with all those different

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:13.420
ingredients and all those layers.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.759
Yeah, that was really good.

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:18.027
Just a very typical
sandwich that you'll find

00:14:18.027 --> 00:14:19.985
all over the streets of Mumbai.

00:14:19.985 --> 00:14:22.652
(horns honking)

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:27.917
(rhythmic music)

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.203
We just took a taxi over
to Haji Ali mosque area,

00:14:49.203 --> 00:14:51.870
and it is insanely packed today.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.021
So many people.

00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:58.012
So we have decided to stop
at Haji Ali juice center.

00:14:58.012 --> 00:15:01.158
I ordered a lemon water and
I got the salted version

00:15:01.158 --> 00:15:03.825
as opposed to the sweet version.

00:15:07.058 --> 00:15:10.256
Like extremely salty limeade.

00:15:10.256 --> 00:15:12.710
This is a beverage that you
need when you're sweating

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.553
outside because it has
all that salt in it so

00:15:14.553 --> 00:15:17.707
you can retain all of your vitamins.

00:15:17.707 --> 00:15:19.790
And then that lime juice.

00:15:25.048 --> 00:15:27.381
Oh, yeah, it's pretty rough.

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:36.836
Right now it is high tide, so
you cannot walk to the mosque.

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:41.389
But when it's low tide, there
is a pathway that uncovers

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:45.222
from the water and you
can walk to the mosque.

00:15:46.801 --> 00:15:49.204
The police have mentioned
that at 6 p.m. it will be low

00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:52.826
tide, so they will allow
people to walk to the mosque.

00:15:52.826 --> 00:15:54.709
That's why it's so busy
around here right now

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:58.448
is that everybody's just
waiting around until 6 p.m.

00:15:58.448 --> 00:16:00.491
But I think that's in about four hours,

00:16:00.491 --> 00:16:03.103
so I don't think we're gonna stick around.

00:16:03.103 --> 00:16:04.880
But it was really nice to get a view

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.527
of the mosque just from the coast here.

00:16:07.527 --> 00:16:10.360
(easygoing music)

00:16:14.354 --> 00:16:16.081
We jumped back in a taxi,

00:16:16.081 --> 00:16:20.704
and it looks like it's
gonna rain pretty soon.

00:16:20.704 --> 00:16:23.366
Or I think it's starting to
rain right now as I said that.

00:16:23.366 --> 00:16:25.876
We're gonna take the Sea Link to Bandra.

00:16:25.876 --> 00:16:28.293
An area of Mumbai called, Bandra.

00:16:28.293 --> 00:16:31.126
(easygoing music)

00:16:45.824 --> 00:16:48.908
we made it to Mount Mary
and there's a main cathedral

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:52.022
and then across the
street, there is a shrine.

00:16:52.022 --> 00:16:54.963
But you walk inside to the
cathedral and it's just an

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:59.130
amazing place of piece and
complete calm and silence.

00:17:00.016 --> 00:17:03.371
The complete opposite
of being in the center

00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:06.503
of the bustle and chaos of Mumbai.

00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:09.253
(rhythmic music)

00:17:19.021 --> 00:17:20.964
One of the reasons we haven't taken,

00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:24.029
or even in the videos you
haven't even seen auto rickshaws,

00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:27.809
is because auto rickshaws are
not allowed in south Mumbai,

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:31.961
which is where we've been so
far since being on this trip.

00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:35.211
But north Mumbai and in Bandra onwards,

00:17:36.988 --> 00:17:39.287
there are lots and lots of auto rickshaws.

00:17:39.287 --> 00:17:41.954
(horns honking)

00:17:45.429 --> 00:17:49.179
It's really windy and raining off and on.

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:53.346
We are walking up the
promenade to the Bandra Fort.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.719
This is their remains of
an old Portuguese fort,

00:17:59.719 --> 00:18:02.585
but now it's been made into
a public park where people

00:18:02.585 --> 00:18:05.092
come just to sit next to the ocean.

00:18:05.092 --> 00:18:06.459
The waves are crashing.

00:18:06.459 --> 00:18:08.539
And from here you can also get a really

00:18:08.539 --> 00:18:11.020
good view of the Sea Link Bridge.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.770
(rhythmic music)

00:18:29.576 --> 00:18:30.587
It started raining again.

00:18:30.587 --> 00:18:34.554
This time pretty hard, so we
jumped into an auto rickshaw.

00:18:34.554 --> 00:18:38.002
We are on our way to a
place to have some chaat.

00:18:38.002 --> 00:18:40.752
(rhythmic music)

00:18:49.765 --> 00:18:52.447
We just took a pretty
intense auto rickshaw ride

00:18:52.447 --> 00:18:55.140
from the Bandra area to a place

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.307
called Elco for some different snacks.

00:19:01.627 --> 00:19:04.163
Right along the street,
they have an outdoor section

00:19:04.163 --> 00:19:06.573
where you can just stand
and order and eat standing,

00:19:06.573 --> 00:19:10.831
but they also have a couple
floors of indoor sections.

00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:13.008
We have just ordered a
couple of different chaats.

00:19:13.008 --> 00:19:14.810
This one is called sev puri.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.977
They are little crispy discs
on the bottom topped with

00:19:19.988 --> 00:19:23.115
a bunch of different things
and a lot of crispies.

00:19:23.115 --> 00:19:25.513
There are some peanuts in here.

00:19:25.513 --> 00:19:27.399
I think that's cilantro.

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:29.489
There's some onions and potatoes.

00:19:29.489 --> 00:19:32.848
Just like a splatter of crunchiness.

00:19:32.848 --> 00:19:35.478
And what you do is you can just
grab one with your fingers.

00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:36.941
It includes so many.

00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:38.454
Oh yeah, on the bottom
there, you can see all

00:19:38.454 --> 00:19:40.916
of the different chutneys
and sauces mixed in

00:19:40.916 --> 00:19:43.414
and then all of the crunchy goodies.

00:19:43.414 --> 00:19:47.081
I think I'll eat the
whole disc in one bite.

00:19:52.884 --> 00:19:55.581
That's like an amazing nacho.

00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:58.070
For a moment there, I thought
it was actually guacamole

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.166
because the potatoes
in there are so creamy.

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:02.631
Almost like avocado.

00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:04.616
You got a little bit
of spiciness going on.

00:20:04.616 --> 00:20:07.310
You've got a little bit of
sweetness from the tamarind.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.373
You've got crunchy things
all over the place.

00:20:11.373 --> 00:20:14.475
And then you have the
onion flavor as well.

00:20:14.475 --> 00:20:16.325
We also got dahi puri.

00:20:16.325 --> 00:20:18.745
Dahi is the yogurt, and then the puris

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:21.912
are those little hollow crispy shells.

00:20:25.738 --> 00:20:29.155
It's kind of sweet and salty and crunchy,

00:20:31.468 --> 00:20:34.476
and then you have a little bit
of sourness from the yogurt.

00:20:34.476 --> 00:20:38.709
But then you can also taste
the sprinkle of spices.

00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:42.968
The sev puri in particular
was absolutely delicious.

00:20:42.968 --> 00:20:45.428
That was the best thing that I tried here.

00:20:45.428 --> 00:20:48.178
(rhythmic music)

00:20:54.784 --> 00:20:56.651
We are just walking along the road,

00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.746
and we have found a man selling deserts.

00:20:59.746 --> 00:21:04.085
This is a type of malai,
which is a cream desert.

00:21:04.085 --> 00:21:06.338
Actually, this one is a very special one

00:21:06.338 --> 00:21:10.505
because it is made with the
very first milk of the cow.

00:21:11.783 --> 00:21:14.720
I believe in English,
that's called colostrum.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.486
So it's like the creamiest, richest milk

00:21:17.486 --> 00:21:21.236
with all the nutrients
and all the richness.

00:21:21.236 --> 00:21:23.356
It looks a little bit like jelly textured,

00:21:23.356 --> 00:21:27.523
but at the same time it looks
kind of like cheese as well.

00:21:29.581 --> 00:21:30.414
Wow.

00:21:31.614 --> 00:21:34.853
It kind of has the flavor of
cheese except it's very sweet.

00:21:34.853 --> 00:21:37.124
The texture is like a combination

00:21:37.124 --> 00:21:39.374
of tofu and jelly or jello.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.092
And then at the same time,

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:45.645
you can taste a really strong milk flavor.

00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:48.312
(horns honking)

00:21:55.253 --> 00:21:58.447
We have made it to an area
which is called Linking Road

00:21:58.447 --> 00:22:02.616
which is another shopping
market especially for clothes.

00:22:02.616 --> 00:22:05.449
Again, it is just a packed market,

00:22:06.926 --> 00:22:08.398
especially with ladies because there

00:22:08.398 --> 00:22:11.315
are a lot of women's clothing here.

00:22:15.622 --> 00:22:17.651
From the market, we walked
over to a restaurant

00:22:17.651 --> 00:22:21.691
that's called Jai Jawan
which serves Punjabi food.

00:22:21.691 --> 00:22:22.918
They're especially known for

00:22:22.918 --> 00:22:25.650
their prawns fry which we ordered.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.515
And actually at that
market, Link Way Market,

00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:31.313
they have a stall of the same restaurant,

00:22:31.313 --> 00:22:32.544
which is just standing.

00:22:32.544 --> 00:22:35.864
But then you walk about
five minutes away from there

00:22:35.864 --> 00:22:38.074
and there's more of sit down restaurants.

00:22:38.074 --> 00:22:39.156
We came to the sit down restaurant

00:22:39.156 --> 00:22:40.827
to get a little bit of peace.

00:22:40.827 --> 00:22:42.757
The prawns fry have just arrived.

00:22:42.757 --> 00:22:44.539
They are hot and fresh.

00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:47.280
Deep fried coated in a
little bit of a batter.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.660
You can see a little
bit of salt or some kind

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.631
of seasoning sprinkled on top,
and you can smell the aroma.

00:22:53.631 --> 00:22:55.131
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:22:59.698 --> 00:23:03.031
- Wow, the prawns are bouncy in texture.

00:23:04.365 --> 00:23:08.359
Kind of a light, but very crispy batter.

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:09.192
Salty.

00:23:10.054 --> 00:23:12.052
That is as good as it looks.

00:23:12.052 --> 00:23:16.171
Definitely a squeeze of
lime would be wonderful.

00:23:16.171 --> 00:23:19.165
Maybe a little bit of
this chutney as well.

00:23:19.165 --> 00:23:23.203
I'll put a little of
this down on my plate.

00:23:23.203 --> 00:23:24.044
Wow, those are good.

00:23:24.044 --> 00:23:27.014
Those are like shrimp onion rings.

00:23:27.014 --> 00:23:29.847
Just like plump and bouncy shrimp.

00:23:31.405 --> 00:23:33.822
A little bit of that chutney.

00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:39.412
Wow.

00:23:41.961 --> 00:23:44.486
And with that extra lime,

00:23:44.486 --> 00:23:47.819
that gives it the refreshing sour touch.

00:23:49.378 --> 00:23:53.600
Especially I like it because
it contrasts the saltiness.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.720
The chutney is also extremely good.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.763
You can taste a lot of garlic in there,

00:23:57.763 --> 00:24:02.759
and I think a lot of cilantro
and maybe some lime juice

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:04.941
as well as maybe some
ginger in there as well.

00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:07.373
We also had to order
some tandoori chicken,

00:24:07.373 --> 00:24:10.206
which is also a Punjabi specialty.

00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:12.492
Tandoori chicken is just one of

00:24:12.492 --> 00:24:16.068
the great styles of chicken in the world.

00:24:16.068 --> 00:24:20.278
We got the whole chicken cut into pieces.

00:24:20.278 --> 00:24:24.011
I love those rivets within
the chicken to make sure all

00:24:24.011 --> 00:24:27.341
the flavor seeps inside
and to cook it evenly.

00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:29.340
- [Myron] Oh, it's hot.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.257
- Oh, yeah, that's hot.

00:24:40.137 --> 00:24:41.662
Oh, wow.

00:24:41.662 --> 00:24:45.109
Sometimes when you have tandoori
chicken, it's kind of dry.

00:24:45.109 --> 00:24:48.379
But this tandoori chicken,
it's extremely juicy.

00:24:48.379 --> 00:24:52.145
It is caked in flavor from that outside.

00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:54.895
You can taste the really fast way

00:24:57.137 --> 00:25:00.480
that it's been cooked in the clay oven.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.344
You can taste the roasted flavor

00:25:02.344 --> 00:25:03.975
throughout the whole piece of chicken.

00:25:03.975 --> 00:25:06.498
It's so good on it's own, but I am kind

00:25:06.498 --> 00:25:09.498
of an addict of sauces and chutneys.

00:25:10.731 --> 00:25:11.981
Oh, that's hot.

00:25:13.566 --> 00:25:16.983
I have to go in for some of that chutney.

00:25:19.558 --> 00:25:20.801
I gotta have some of that chutney.

00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:24.051
That chutney is just ridiculously good.

00:25:27.587 --> 00:25:30.026
That chutney is awesome.

00:25:30.026 --> 00:25:32.325
That chutney is award winning.

00:25:32.325 --> 00:25:35.501
You could just eat that
chutney like a soup.

00:25:35.501 --> 00:25:38.668
It's garlicky and sour and herbaceous.

00:25:42.293 --> 00:25:44.380
We also ordered some dal makhani,

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.097
which is our black lentils.

00:25:47.097 --> 00:25:50.847
This is one of the
world's great bean dishes.

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.935
Grab a tandoori roti,

00:25:57.162 --> 00:26:00.662
and I cannot wait to try that dal makhani.

00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:09.044
Oh. yeah.

00:26:10.346 --> 00:26:14.513
That is just one of the world's
great lentil bean dishes.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.925
Oh, it's so good.

00:26:17.925 --> 00:26:22.092
And again, that has a nice
garlicky taste and it's creamy.

00:26:23.521 --> 00:26:25.188
It's just wonderful.

00:26:26.052 --> 00:26:27.083
I love dal makhani.

00:26:27.083 --> 00:26:29.738
Another dish we got is
called mutton keema.

00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:33.249
Often times this is served
with just white bread

00:26:33.249 --> 00:26:34.875
and then you eat it and dip it up.

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:36.338
But we just got some tandoori roti,

00:26:36.338 --> 00:26:38.518
which we're gonna eat with it.

00:26:38.518 --> 00:26:41.293
Scoop a little bit of this.

00:26:41.293 --> 00:26:45.142
I think it's minced mutton
with all the spices.

00:26:45.142 --> 00:26:46.628
Minced mutton.

00:26:46.628 --> 00:26:49.542
You can taste probably some cumin in there

00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.050
and just a blend of spices,

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:54.883
and it's in a rich, buttery gravy.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:57.943
Oh, wow.

00:26:57.943 --> 00:27:00.190
That is marvelous.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.153
- [Myron] Have a safe trip.

00:27:01.153 --> 00:27:02.329
Enjoy your world tour.

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:03.980
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.076
It was fun to hang out.

00:27:05.076 --> 00:27:06.861
- [Myron] (mumbles)
never stop making videos.

00:27:06.861 --> 00:27:07.694
- [Mark] OK.

00:27:07.694 --> 00:27:08.652
- [Myron] Never stop traveling

00:27:08.652 --> 00:27:10.279
Never stop eating.

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:11.216
That's all I want to say.

00:27:11.216 --> 00:27:12.056
- All right, man.

00:27:12.056 --> 00:27:13.193
Thank you.

00:27:13.193 --> 00:27:14.026
Bye bye.

00:27:14.879 --> 00:27:17.140
We finished with dinner at Jai Jawan.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.160
That was some amazing food.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.051
And we took a taxi all the
way back to south Mumbai

00:27:22.051 --> 00:27:24.551
where we're staying in Colaba.

00:27:25.712 --> 00:27:28.751
We seemed to go to a lot of busy, packed,

00:27:28.751 --> 00:27:32.942
chaotic markets today,
which was very interesting.

00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.263
Awesome to walk through.

00:27:34.263 --> 00:27:36.932
And also had some delicious food.

00:27:36.932 --> 00:27:39.614
It was great to hang out and meet Myron.

00:27:39.614 --> 00:27:41.611

00:28:03.943 --> 00:28:08.110
Check out this goat standing
on top of the motorbikes.

00:28:11.303 --> 00:28:12.653
Hello.

00:28:12.653 --> 00:28:13.908
And then right down from the goat,

00:28:13.908 --> 00:28:17.991
there's a chicken standing
on the motorbike, too.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.620
(rhythmic music)
