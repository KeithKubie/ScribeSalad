00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.130
- Welcome to The Next Level
stage my guy T. Murph,

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.437
who's from the windy city of Chicago.

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:06.809
(audience applause)

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.010
Chi-Town!

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.070
Now, I heard that you were a barber..

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.260
Before you started doing
comedy which I feel like

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.360
is a cheating thing behind your beard.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.500
'Cause you knew how to
manufacture the beard,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.530
but that's another story.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.880
What was that like for you,
I mean from a material basis,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.040
you know, the barbershop is a comedy hub.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.100
- Do you feel like that
was a place where you

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.780
perfected your craft, in the barbershop

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.613
when you was cutting hair?

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:29.446
- Honestly, yes,

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:31.190
I mean, it's a haven for comedy, man.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.690
I mean, I was one of those barbers, like,

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.750
if you come to the barbershop,
you've all had the barber

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.250
that spends more time cracking jokes..

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.083
- 100 percent.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:38.916
- Than cutting hair, yeah.

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:39.890
- An hour and a half, two hours?

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.130
- You gonna get a whole comedy show

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.100
while you wait on this land.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.057
- That's a good thing though!

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:48.240
The barbershop is honestly
the best comedy club, I think.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.073
- Facts.

00:00:49.073 --> 00:00:52.000
- Going into the barbershop on a weekend

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.810
and having a high level of chemistry

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.250
with everybody in there,
that's a good Saturday.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.083
- It is.

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.510
- Snapping with everybody in the shop.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.130
Now, because you were a comedian,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.340
do people find themselves
snapping at you more?

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.960
- Oh, all the time, man!

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.990
You know, cats come in the barbershop,

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.168
they feel like they can take you.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.770
You know what I mean, they
come in, they just wanna roast.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.734
And then when you go in on them,

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:13.200
you know, there ain't no
security to break it up.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.033
- No, no, no.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.420
- So, you go in on him, you roast,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.380
and some people's feelings get hurt,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.173
like, 'alright, its enough
with all the little jokes'.

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:22.160
(audience laughs)

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.480
'I ain't come here for all that'.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.013
Even though they started it, you know?

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.860
- I got a photo, I want you to explain

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.580
the photo to me, okay?

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.150
- Uh huh.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.830
- What was going on back there?

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.370
What was going on right here, man?

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.520
- Okay, so those were my first head shots.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.353
- Okay.

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:43.587
- So, after I started
doing stand-up comedy,

00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:45.830
you know, you gotta get a head shot.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.800
And I was like, okay, cool,
I'm gonna get a head shot.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.410
So when I went in, I went
in to this photographer

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.450
who generally took photos of children.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.312
- Okay.

00:01:54.312 --> 00:01:57.145
(audience laughs)

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.620
- I didn't know!

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.460
I didn't know that you
needed to get a photographer

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.820
that focused on you, and your
age, and what was going on.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.045
So I went to this..

00:02:06.045 --> 00:02:07.395
(audience laughs)

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:09.370
- There's a lot of things
that's wrong with this picture.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.610
I'm gonna tell you, man, you
should've known it was bad

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.776
when he said, 'go get your bike'.

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:17.730
(audience laughs)

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.670
You are more than ready
for this moment, man.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.640
This is The Next Level for you!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.740
Go out there, and go make Chicago proud!

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.750
You all show this man some love right now!

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.940
Go do you, boy!
