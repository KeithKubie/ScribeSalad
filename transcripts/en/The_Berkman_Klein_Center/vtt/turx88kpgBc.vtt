00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.140
 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.870
Hello.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.170
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.040
This is the fifth of 12
lectures on copyright.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.730
Our topic today is authorship.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.300
We'll be examining the
rules that determine

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.860
what person or organization owns the
copyright in a particular copyrighted

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.910
work.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.870
How those rules have evolved over time.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.560
And whether they make sense.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.190
As usual, I'll be concentrating
on the law in the United States,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.910
but will also mention some issues
on which the law in other countries

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.570
diverges from that in the US.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.030
Also, as usual, I'll be
illustrating the lecture

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.520
with various audiovisual materials.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.810
So it would be best if
you watch the lecture

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.750
on a device with a good sized screen.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.160
One of those illustrative
materials will be

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.400
a map prepared using the MindManager
software of copyright law.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.490
I'll be showing the native
version of the map on your screen

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.710
during portions of the lecture.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.680
An interactive PDF version of
the current addition of that map

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.970
can be obtained through my home page.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.470
The address of which is tfisher.org.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.550
So if you happen to encounter
this lecture any time

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.470
after the spring of 2013, you
might want to go to my website

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.022
to download an updated
version of the map.

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.790
 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.010
The concept of authorship
permeates copyright law.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.570
In general, and in the United States
in particular, at least rhetorically,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.030
the law celebrates and rewards authors,
the creators of original works.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.570
The clearest statutory manifestation of
this orientation in the United States

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.100
comes in section 201 of the copyright
statute, which provides simply,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.170
"Copyright in a work protected
under this statute vests

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.610
initially in the author
or authors of the work."

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.160
In most of the cases that
naturally come to mind

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.570
when we think about
the copyright system,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.350
the application of this principle
will be straightforward.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.280
Some examples, the author of a novel
or a poem is the person who writes it.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.290
The author of a musical
composition is the composer.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.950
The author of a painting is
the person who paints it.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.230
The author of a sculpture is
the sculptor, and so forth.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.850
It's very important to
differentiate the author of a work

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.570
from the owner of a
particular embodiment of it.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.410
Suppose, for example, I write a letter
to a friend and then mail it to her.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.270
She owns the piece of paper on
which the letter is written.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.050
But I still own the copyright.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.780
As the owner of the physical copy
of the letter, she important rights.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.380
She can, of course, read it.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.560
She can also burn it.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.550
Or give it away.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.630
But she can't copy it because that
would violate my exclusive right

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.630
as the copyright owner
to reproduce the work.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.830
Nor may she, or anyone else,
publish without my permission

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.650
a compilation of the letters I've
sent to her for the same reason.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.020
When applied to letters, this rule may
strike you as puzzling or misguided.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.910
Certainly, it's hard to justify under
the dominant theory of copyright.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.880
The utilitarian argument that we
discussed in the last lecture.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.050
That theory contends
in brief, that the law

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.420
should be crafted so as to stimulate the
creation and distribution of socially

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.320
beneficial creative works.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.250
Copyright protection for
letters, one might argue,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.720
is not necessary to induce
people to write them.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.490
So the law in this instance seems
to impede dissemination of works

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.230
without any offsetting social benefit.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.250
Viewed from another theoretical
angle, the rule may seem less odd.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.990
You'll recall, I hope, that one
of the personhood interests that

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.660
figures in the personality theory
of property in general and copyright

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.680
in particular is a fundamental
human need for privacy.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.140
Perhaps the rule that accords the
copyright in a letter to its writer,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.970
rather than to its recipient,
or to no one at all,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.060
works to shield the privacy
interests of the writer.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.840
If so, however, the rule
does so only crudely.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.370
You'll recall, I hope, that the
facts and ideas contained in a letter

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.290
that I write are not shielded
by my copyright in it.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.770
Only the distinctive way in which
I've expressed those facts and ideas

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.670
is protected.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.950
So if I've revealed in my letter
some intimate or embarrassing fact,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.410
the recipient is perfectly free-- at
least as a matter of copyright law

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.760
--to tweet about it or
shout it from the rooftop.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.000
She just can't use or mimic my language.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.170
The upshot is that
the rule doesn't align

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.070
at all well with privacy interests.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.970
The bottom line, the copyrights
enjoyed by the authors of letters

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.590
is hard to justify on the basis of
the author's personhood interests.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.940
And sometimes, arguably, has
pernicious social consequences

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.420
as when that impedes
the work of biographers.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.550
Courts are sensitive to
those troubling implications.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.340
And, as we'll see later
in this lecture series,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.560
sometimes invoke the exceptions and
limitations built into copyright law

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.120
to override or temper
the author's rights.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.900
But the starting point of the analysis
is that an author gets a copyright.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.190
And keeps it even when a physical
embodiment, even a unique embodiment,

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.580
is transferred to someone else.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.970
That principle is certainly not
limited to the context of letters.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.400
So, for example, a painter
hired to paint a portrait

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.100
retains the copyright in the portrait.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.790
Even after he's been paid.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.080
And even after he's
delivered the painting

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.620
to the person who commissioned it.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.560
Same with a photographer.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.680
Copyrights, in short, are sticky.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.950
They stay attached to the
author unless they're formally

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.430
transferred in some way.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.310
This stickiness is
important in practice.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.820
A surprisingly large percentage
of copyright disputes

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.330
involve the following basic narrative.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.400
Person or Company A does work for
Person or Company B in relation

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.850
to a particular project.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.210
The work is satisfactory and B pays A.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.310
Neither of the parties
notices that A's work

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.050
consists of or contains
copyrighted material.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.390
And so they don't write a contractual
provision that deals with copyright.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.570
B later decides that A's work could be
deployed in a second unrelated project.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.920
A demands an additional payment.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.950
B refuses.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.180
A brings a copyright
infringement suit contending

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.150
that A retain the copyright
in the original work product.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.990
And B's use of it in
the second project would

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.270
abridge one of A's exclusive rights.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.280
Typically, the exclusive
right of reproduction.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.360
Or public performance or display.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.150
Now, if A is an employee of
B, and the work that A does

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.860
falls into the scope of A's
job, then in the United States,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.370
the copyright in A's work
product will belong to B.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.300
We'll examine the rules governing
such employment relations

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.980
in detail in the third
segment of this lecture.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:08:00.710
But often, A's not an employee of B,
but rather, an independent contractor.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.450
In that situation, the copyright
will initially attach to A.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.690
And will stick there, giving
A a potential copyright claim.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.570
 

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:16.780
Here's an example of
a dispute of the sort.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.460
Toyota makes, among other
things, Solera brand cars.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.270
In 2003, Toyota and
its advertising agency

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.130
decided to launch a new ad campaign.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.990
For this campaign, they needed to
create digital models of their cars.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:38.100
Digital models, as many of you know, are
useful because they enable advertisers

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.679
easily to alter the color and
accessories of a depicted car,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:48.500
enable consumers to manipulate those
images on websites, and so forth.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.890
In this case, the ad
agency working for Toyota

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:57.050
hired a company named G&amp;W to
prepare the digital models.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.990
And G&amp;W, in turn, hired
another company called

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:05.570
Meshwerks to prepare
so-called digital wire frames.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.360
Some of which are shown on your screen.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.010
 

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.610
These wireframes are images
formed by a network of lines

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.290
that represent in great detail the
external dimensions of objects.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:21.800
In this case, cars.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:26.720
Wireframes are prepared partly through
an automated measurement system.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.050
And partly through manual adjustment
of those automated measurements

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.350
to make the resulting set
of lines look realistic.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.210
In this instance, G&amp;W took
Meshwerks' wireframes,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:47.060
draped over them images of the lights,
body, tires, and so forth of each car.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.370
And provided the net
product to the ad agency

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.250
which used them in the
advertising campaign.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.570
Meshwerks and G&amp;W were paid the
amount specified in their contracts.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.990
And everyone, as best we
could tell, was happy.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.010
Things went awry,
however, when Toyota began

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.890
using the images in another setting.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.060
Specifically, in a variety of ads
other than the television spot

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.080
for which Meshwerks thought its
work was originally intended.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.340
Meshwerks asked for more money.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:22.230
Toyota refused.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.050
Meshwerks then brought a
copyright infringement suit

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.420
contending that it owned the
copyright in the wireframes.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.780
And, therefore, that Toyota could not
reproduce them or derivatives of them

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.630
in unlicensed contexts.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.330
The case was finally resolved in 2008.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.900
Five years after the original
advertising campaign.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.970
Now, the plaintiff doesn't
always win in lawsuits like this.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.070
Sometimes B is able to avoid liability.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.620
For example, by showing
that A's work did not

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.440
fall within the zone of
copyrightable subject matter.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:03.080
Or that the later use of A's material
was expressly or impliedly authorized

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.200
by the terms of their original contract.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.240
Indeed, Toyota, in the
case I just summarized,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.830
eventually prevailed on
the first of those bases.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.230
But often, B loses.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.990
And, therefore, either
has to pay A an extra fee.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:21.750
Or cease using the work in question.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.740
Even when B prevails, resolving
the dispute typically takes years.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:32.160
And costs both parties a lot of
money, as it did in this case.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.470
The frequency of lawsuits
of this sort is attributable

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:39.390
not just to the fact that such
situations are distressingly common,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.160
but also to the fact that the
moral intuitions of the parties

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.430
commonly diverge.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.360
Typically the attitude
of B's managers is

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.500
that they've already paid A
an agreed upon and fair price.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:57.800
For A to demand more money now,
they see as a form of extortion.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:03.860
By contrast, A feels like he or
they has created a valuable work

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.830
and thus deserves a share
of the revenues that

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:12.530
are generated when that work is put to
an unexpected, but lucrative later use.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:16.610
Underlying this attitude are some of
the beliefs associated with the Lockean

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:21.040
theory that we discussed
in lecture number two.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.160
Both parties, in other words,
are convinced typically

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.694
that the other is behaving immorally.

00:12:26.694 --> 00:12:28.235
That's a prescription for litigation.

00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:31.420
 

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.630
Controversies of this
sort can almost always

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.260
be avoided by addressing
the issue up front.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.130
Companies in situations
of this sort should

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.160
be watchful for commercial
relationships that

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.290
will generate potentially
copyrightable works.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:49.210
And clearly provide in advance
who will own those works.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.170
It's a mistake to rely
on trust, friendship,

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.760
or a history of amicable
dealings to prevent disputes

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.610
from arising down the road.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.010
Because, as I've
suggested, moral intuitions

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.700
commonly diverge in such cases.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.850
This kind of anticipatory contractual
resolution of copyright issues

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.030
is like the antenuptial
contracts sometimes entered

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.740
into by prospective spouses.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.740
Sometimes awkward and
seemingly unnecessary

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.550
when the relationship is
fresh, but extremely helpful

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.520
when the relationship later unravels.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.400
 

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.200
So to review, the general point
illustrated by this example

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.260
is that the copyright in
a work vests automatically

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.100
in the author of the work.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.390
And it stays with the author unless
expressly transferred to someone else.

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:46.970
Failure to be alert to this phenomenon
can create big and expensive problems.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.670
 

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.170
Up to now, we've been
dealing with situations

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.800
in which the identity of the
author of a work is obvious.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.000
Sometimes it's not.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.010
Here's an example.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:05.250
As I'm sure you know, in
1912, the steamship Titanic--

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.290
shown here just before her first and
final voyage --collided with an iceberg

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.810
in the North Atlantic and sank.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.900
Most of the passengers died.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.390
Including one, Harry Elkins Widener.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.992
A Harvard graduate.

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:21.710
The Principal library
here at Harvard was later

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.070
funded by Harry's mother
who survived the accident.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:31.240
And the library is named
for and dedicated to Harry.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.920
The ocean where the accident
occurred is over 12,000 feet deep.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.630
As a result, for 60 years, no one knew
exactly where the wreck of the Titanic

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.290
lay.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.630
And certainly no one saw it.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:49.490
Then in 1985, a joint US and
French expedition found the wreck.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.600
Subsequently, several other expeditions
were organized to photograph and film

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.260
it.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.970
One of which produced this photo.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.870
One of those filming
ventures was organized

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:05.100
by a consortium that included a company
called RMS Titanic, Incorporated,

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.400
which technically was the salvor
in possession of the wreck.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:15.130
That consortium-- we'll call it RMST
for short --entered into an arrangement

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.960
with a filmmaker named
Alexander Lindsay.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.830
Lindsay had previously done a
British documentary on the Titanic.

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.510
And he now agreed to do
another one for RMST.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.740
Unfortunately, for all
concerned, the parties

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.670
failed adequately to capture the
terms of their deal in a contract.

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.840
Thus, planting the seeds
for a subsequent dispute.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.540
Lindsay spent a lot of time
and effort preparing for

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.720
and overseeing the making of the film.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:46.900
He was pretty closely involved
in the filmmaking process.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.980
But here's the crucial fact, Lindsay
did not himself do the actual filming.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:57.290
Instead, he scripted and supervised
the filming of the underwater footage.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.800
More specifically,
Lindsay claimed that he

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:06.140
created storyboards which identified
specific camera angles and shooting

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.050
sequences.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.180
Designed and personally constructed
the underwater light towers

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.140
that were used to illuminate the wreck.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.530
Provided the photographers
who actually did

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.760
the filming with detailed
instructions for positioning

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.630
and utilizing those light towers.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:30.590
Directed the filming from onboard
the salvage vessel, Ocean Voyager.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:34.810
Screened the footage at the end of the
day to ensure that he had the images

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:36.480
he wanted.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:43.320
And, in general, supervised all aspects
of the preparation of the footage.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.360
Lindsay contended that he
was never paid for his work.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.520
Or at least not adequately paid.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.190
In an effort to secure
appropriate compensation,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.590
he brought suit against
RMST asserting-- and here's

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.450
the rub --that he was the author
of the underwater footage,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.880
and therefore, owned the
copyright [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.560
The defendants, RMST, objected.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.480
Pointing out that Lindsay
did not operate the cameras.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.609
As a result, RMST argued Lindsay
could not claim the status of author.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.329
In the end, the court
sided with Lindsay.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.569
If the facts were as he had
claimed, the court ruled,

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.839
Lindsay should be deemed the author.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.500
Here's the language the court used.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.580
All else being equal,
where a plaintiff alleges

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.122
that he exercised such a high degree
of control over a film operation,

00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:36.830
including the type
and amount of lighting

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.140
used, the specific camera
angles to be employed,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:45.240
and other detail intensive
artistic elements of a film, such

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:49.250
that the final product duplicates
his conceptions and visions of what

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.260
the film should look
like, the plaintiff may

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.650
be said to be an author within
the meaning of the Copyright Act.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.230
 

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.720
The principle that underlies
this passage is important.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.460
To qualify as an author, it's
neither necessary, nor sufficient

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:11.980
that you have your hands on the
instruments that create the work.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.980
If you direct the behavior of
others sufficiently closely,

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.360
that it's your ideas that are being
transposed into tangible form,

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.890
then you, and not they, are the author.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.080
And thus, it is you, and not
they, that acquire the copyright.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.220
 

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.150
This concludes our analysis of
the topic of sole authorship.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:39.210
In the next segment of the lecture,
we'll take up joint authorship.
