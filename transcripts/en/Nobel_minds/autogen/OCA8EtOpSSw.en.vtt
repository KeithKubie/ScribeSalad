hello my name is Fred Ryan I'm speaking

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990
hello my name is Fred Ryan I'm speaking
 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.889
hello my name is Fred Ryan I'm speaking
to you from inside my garage and Clinton

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899
to you from inside my garage and Clinton
 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.299
to you from inside my garage and Clinton
New Jersey I'm a retired police officer

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309
New Jersey I'm a retired police officer
 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.959
New Jersey I'm a retired police officer
my question is is it possible to measure

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969
my question is is it possible to measure
 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.150
my question is is it possible to measure
the trajectory of a galaxy I'm

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
the trajectory of a galaxy I'm
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.990
the trajectory of a galaxy I'm
interested in learning whether or not we

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000
interested in learning whether or not we
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.439
interested in learning whether or not we
can determine if galaxies are actually

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
can determine if galaxies are actually
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.620
can determine if galaxies are actually
moving in an arc and I believe that if

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
moving in an arc and I believe that if
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.260
moving in an arc and I believe that if
they are found to be moving in an arc

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
they are found to be moving in an arc
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.979
they are found to be moving in an arc
then we can suspect that they're

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
then we can suspect that they're
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.210
then we can suspect that they're
actually in an orbit thank you
