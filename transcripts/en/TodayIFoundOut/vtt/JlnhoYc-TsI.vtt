00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.830
Curbing “Impure” Urges, the Birth of the
Graham Cracker

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.630
Between 1820 and 1830, America was in the
midst of a health craze.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.369
Sylvester Graham, the creator of the graham
cracker, was on scene with a diet plan he

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.060
thought ought to increase physical wellness,
sexual purity, and spiritual health.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.660
The Presbyterian minister from New Jersey
was an avid vegetarian, and on a mission to

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.710
rid the world of sexual immorality.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.850
Graham believed wholeheartedly that a vegetarian
diet devoid of spices and sugars, combined

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.880
with avoiding foods made with overly processed
flours that often had chemicals added, would

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.730
do away with the greatest evil of his day
– lustful thought.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.180
More specifically, he concerned himself with
ridding the world of masturbation, an act

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.300
he and others thought led to insanity and
blindness.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.479
First, a little background- Graham spent his
early adult years as a farmhand and teacher.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.539
Later in life, ill health caused him to turn
his attention to ministry work.

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.170
His background in harvesting and public address
equipped him to preach about the relationship

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.200
between diet and piety, giving birth to the
“Graham Diet”.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
Individuals inspired by Sylvester Graham’s
teaching lived in community with one another,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.700
and observed Graham’s strict diet and living
habits, all while working to spread the idea

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.640
that diet had a profound effect on righteous
living.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.630
A part of the Graham Diet was what is today
called “graham flour”, which is essentially

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.060
a type of non-bleached, “all-natural”
finely ground whole wheat flour.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.080
Among other things made with this flour, Graham
would make what would come to be called “graham

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080
crackers”.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.250
At their inception, graham crackers were incredibly
bland.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.509
The minister preached a high-fiber, whole
wheat diet.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.060
His followers faithfully abstained from meat
and sweeteners, like honey and sugar, and

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.220
drank only water.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.070
Graham also consistently reminded his congregation
that consuming food produced by animals led

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.120
to impure thoughts and actions, with the exception
of eggs, milk, and cheese which according

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.849
to his diet could be consumed, but only if
they were absolutely fresh.

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.799
With such diet restrictions, it’s no surprise
that original Graham crackers lacked flavor.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.650
They were not the sweet treat we enjoy today.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.719
The first flour used to make the wafers was
a winter wheat.

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.510
The endosperm of the wheat was extracted and
ground into a fine powder.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.499
The bran and germ of the winter wheat was
added to the mixture creating a course type

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.590
of flour.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.730
The unrefined flour yielded a naturally nutty
flavor and very slight sweetness.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.579
This supported the crux of Graham’s theory,
that bland food kept one pure in thought and

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.579
deed.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.510
Since the days of the Graham Diet, the cracker
recipe has evolved significantly.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.879
For instance, Nabisco began making Graham
crackers with bleached white flour and oils.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.480
The germ is rarely used as excluding the germ
in the flour mixture results in the crackers

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.140
having a longer shelf life.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.840
Today, grocery stores carry Graham crackers
of all flavors: sweetened with honey, cinnamon

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.599
sugar, and more.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.049
You can even snack on chocolate flavored crackers.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.510
Beyond that, common ways to eat these crackers
include smothering them with peanut butter,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.170
crushing them up for cheese cake and pie crusts,
as well as cloaking them in frosting and decorating

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.519
them in gumdrops to replicate winter cottages.

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.459
That’s not to mention that they are traditionally
used as the outer layer of a tasty little

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.739
marshmallow and chocolate sandwich by campfires
the world over.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.439
If there is indeed a hole in the floor of
heaven, and Sylvester Graham is looking down,

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.999
he is surely not happy about any of this.

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:48.489
Of course, neither Graham crackers nor his
diet have ever been shown to even remotely

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.229
cure sexual urges, so perhaps he can’t complain
too much.

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.920
Sylvester Graham didn’t just give us the
Graham cracker, though.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.459
His influence is believed to have impacted
the direction of other popular branded food

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.459
items.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.139
For instance, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg and
his brother, Will, found the minister’s

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.780
ideas useful at their Sanitarium in Michigan.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.430
Dr. Kellogg imposed the vegetarian diet on
his patients with the belief that it could

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.200
cure some of their troubles.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.230
The brothers even made Graham crackers on
the premises of the ward.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.640
Eventually Will left out some prepared wheat
used to make the facility’s Graham crackers.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.300
When he came back to finish the cooking, the
dough had become hard and stale.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.440
As there wasn’t money to waste a whole batch’s
ingredients, he used it in the baking process

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440
anyway.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.960
Rather than get thin wafers after extruding
the dough through the rollers, he ended up

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.050
with hard crispy flakes – somewhat similar
to the corn flakes we eat for breakfast today.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.160
This accident didn’t bode well for the brother’s
relationship.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.310
After the invention of the flakes, which the
people at their Sanitarium enjoyed, Will decided

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.840
to market them and felt that adding sugar
would help them sell better.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.090
Needless to say, John found this to be borderline
blasphemous and the two parted ways with Will

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.050
founding the now billion dollar Kellogg corporation
(which besides their tasty flakes was soon

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.340
to also introduce another breakfast staple,
Rice Krispies), while his brother stuck more

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.740
to his original principles and continued to
dedicate his life to ridding the world of

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.729
such acts as masturbation.

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.800
Graham’s holistic approach to life lives
on.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.620
While his diet did nothing for sexual urges,
today we know that eating lots of fruits and

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.290
vegetables, combined with avoiding overly
processed foods, really is good for one’s

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.949
health, as is Graham’s suggestion that one
should regularly exercise.

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.360
Of course, sticking with bland foods isn’t
at all necessary, but nobody bats a thousand.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.760
Bonus Fact:
• Sylvester Graham also advocated sleeping

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.620
on hard mattresses; keeping bedroom windows
open at all times for fresh air (something

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.539
Ben Franklin also steadfastly believed in,
much to the chagrin of those who shared lodgings

00:05:47.539 --> 00:06:05.440
with him when traveling in winter); cold showers
to invigorate the body; and loose clothing.
