00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:16.713
I'm a writer-director
who tells social-change stories,

00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:19.983
because I believe stories
touch and move us.

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.588
Stories humanize
and teach us to empathize.

00:00:23.612 --> 00:00:25.670
Stories change us.

00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:28.166
When I write and direct plays,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.739
I'm amplifying voices
of disadvantaged groups,

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:33.624
I'm fighting the self-censorship

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:38.561
that has kept many Ugandan artists
away from social, political theater

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:44.406
since the persecution of artists
by former Ugandan president, Idi Amin.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.486
And most importantly,
I am breaking the silence

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.204
and provoking meaningful
conversations on taboo issues,

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:56.800
where often "Silence is golden"
is the rule of thumb.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:59.679
Conversations are important

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:03.577
because they inform
and challenge our minds to think,

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.029
and change starts with thinking.

00:01:06.974 --> 00:01:11.650
One of my struggles with activism
is its often one-sided nature

00:01:11.674 --> 00:01:14.037
that blinds us to alternative view,

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.203
that numbs our empathy,

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:19.696
that makes us view those
who see issues differently

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.676
as ignorant, self-hating, brainwashed,
sellout or plain stupid.

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:29.517
I believe no one is ignorant.

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:33.573
We are all experts,
only in different fields.

00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:39.729
And this is why, for me, the saying
"stay in your truth" is misleading.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.537
Because if you're staying in your truth,

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.529
isn't it logical that the person
you believe is wrong

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:47.474
is also staying in their truth?

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:51.101
So, what you have is two extremes

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:55.673
that shut out all possible
avenues of conversations.

00:01:56.061 --> 00:02:01.688
I create provocative theater and film
to touch, humanize

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:05.998
and move disagreeing parties
to the conversation table

00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:08.841
to bridge misunderstandings.

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:15.174
I know that listening to one another
will not magically solve all problems.

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:17.549
But it will give a chance
to create avenues

00:02:17.573 --> 00:02:22.282
to start to work together to solve
many of humanity's problems.

00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.245
With my first play, "Silent Voices,"

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.879
based on interviews with victims
of the Northern Uganda war

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:32.854
between the government
and Joseph Kony's LRA rebel group,

00:02:32.878 --> 00:02:37.640
I brought together victims,
political leaders, religious leaders,

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:42.506
cultural leaders, the Amnesty Commission
and transitional justice leadership

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.303
for critical conversations on issues
of justice for war crime victims --

00:02:48.327 --> 00:02:51.780
the first of its kind
in the history of Uganda.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.868
And so many powerful things happened,

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:57.413
that I can't even
cover them all right now.

00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:01.578
Victims were given the opportunity
to sit at the table

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:03.869
with Amnesty Commission leadership,

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:07.490
and they expressed
the big injustice they suffered

00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:09.492
when the Commission ignored them

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:14.428
and instead facilitated the resettlement
of the war perpetrators.

00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:19.498
And the Amnesty Commission
acknowledged the victims' pain

00:03:19.522 --> 00:03:24.228
and explained the thinking
behind their flawed approaches.

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:26.768
But one of the things
that has stayed with me

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:30.164
is when, during my Northern Uganda
tour of the play,

00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:33.006
a man approached me and introduced himself

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.518
as a former rebel soldier of Joseph Kony.

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:41.157
He told me that he didn't want me to leave
feeling disappointed,

00:03:41.181 --> 00:03:44.736
due to some of what I considered
inappropriate laughter.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:49.426
He explained that his
was a laughter of embarrassment

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:53.569
and a recognition
of his own embarrassment.

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:57.355
He saw himself in the actors onstage

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.472
and saw the meaninglessness
of his past actions.

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:05.577
So I say: share your truths.

00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:08.197
Listen to one another's truths.

00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:11.874
You will discover
a more powerfully uniting truth

00:04:11.898 --> 00:04:13.318
in the middle ground.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.045
When I lived in the USA,

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.863
many of my American friends
would be shocked at my ignorance

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:23.720
at fancy Western dishes
like lasagna, for instance.

00:04:23.744 --> 00:04:24.942
(Laughter)

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.022
And my question to them would be,

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:29.127
"Well, do you know malakwang?"

00:04:29.673 --> 00:04:32.704
And then I would tell them
about malakwang,

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:36.379
a fancy vegetable dish from my culture.

00:04:36.403 --> 00:04:38.752
And they would tell me about lasagna.

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:42.625
And we would leave
richer and fuller individuals.

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:46.881
Therefore, share your recipe truth.

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:49.133
It makes for a better meal.

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:50.307
Thank you.

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:56.698
(Applause)
