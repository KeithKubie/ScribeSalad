TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.263
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:06.570
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.150
Two years ago, we launched
the Android Security Rewards

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.550
program, and since then
we've rewarded researchers

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.310
over $1.5 million.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.310
We're constantly working
to improve the program,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.250
and we've made a few changes to
all vulnerability reports filed

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.170
after June 1, 2017, including
increasing some of the rewards.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.850
For the program
rules and tips on how

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.420
to submit complete reports,
head on over to the post.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.080
We've made upgrades for
Python users on App Engine,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.530
including the ability to
deploy Python 3.6 on App Engine

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.970
Flexible Environment.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.100
And on App Engine
Standard Environment,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.050
we've updated more
than two million apps

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
running Python 2.7.5
to Python 2.7.12.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.850
For more updates and
details, check out the post.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.480
Google Cloud is the first
and only public cloud

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.000
to deliver Intel's next
generation Xeon server

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.190
processor codenamed Skylake.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.440
And now it's
generally available.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.780
In addition, we've made
several other enhancements

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.510
to Compute Engine, including
increased total amount

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.160
of memory per
instance by removing

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.880
memory caps, increased
variety of machine shapes,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.560
Broadwell CPUs available
in all regions, and more.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.210
We've launched a
new online course

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.070
called Localization
Essentials that

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.320
covers all localization
basics needed

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.660
to develop global products.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.940
It was developed in
collaboration with Udacity.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.880
It's free to access, and
is linked from the post

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.980
in the description below.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.710
We've rebuilt the AdMob
platform from the ground up

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.320
to help you build a
profitable business faster,

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.170
and to stay profitable
as you scale.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.830
It's simple to use, and with
a brand new user interface,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.740
has richer insights with a
deep integration with Firebase,

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.600
and comes with advanced
controls to help you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.490
scale with mediation groups.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820

And I'll see you next week.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.862
