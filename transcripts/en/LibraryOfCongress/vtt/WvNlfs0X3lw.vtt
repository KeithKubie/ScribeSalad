00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.593
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380


00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.400
&gt;&gt; ...her neighborhood,
Ms. Alexander lives

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.726
on just the other side
of the capital.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.353
She'll be talking today
not only about her new book

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.336
which is called Parallel Worlds:
The Remarkable Gibbs-Hunts

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.556
and the Enduring Insignificance
of Melanin; but also something

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.903
about now, about the district that
she's called home for a long time,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.463
about the extended family that she's
a part of that's had such influence

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.696
in the district, in the
culture, in the nation;

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.683
and also of note her daughter

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.216
who [inaudible] inevitably early
this morning was seen just in front

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.450
of that white building over there

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.450
as Barack Obama's inaugural poet
also interviewed Lonae [assumed

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.783
spelling] Anelle Parker's
[inaudible] this morning.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.863
So without hesitation, I want to
welcome Adele Logan Alexander.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.420
[ Applause ]

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.810
&gt;&gt; Adele Alexander: I thank
you all so much for coming.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.503
I've been writing history for
a long time; studying history,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.186
teaching history, writing
history for a long time.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.920
And we sometimes as academic
historians feel as if we sort

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.896
of labor in caves; and very few
people outside the academic world

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.520
knows what we're about, knows
what we are writing about

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.243
and then you talk to groups of 12
people-- 12 enthusiastic people.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.806
But then when we come
across something

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.076
like this incredible National
Book Festival and the support

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.796
from the Library of Congress,
created by the Library of Congress,

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.976
supported by the Washington
Post and my introducer and then

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.283
of course I was so thrilled, my
daughter and I were so thrilled

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.376
when Lonae's piece came
out in the Washington Post

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.886
and everybody's been coming up to
me here I am obscure historian.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.190
Everybody comes up to me and
says I just saw your picture;

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.736
I just read about you and
your daughter and so on.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.113
And also it is so absolutely unique
and wonderful that my daughter

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.843
and I have the privilege
of appearing here together

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.443
at the National Book Festival; and
of course she had a poem that kind

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.420
of made her famous that was heard
by two billion with a b people

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.943
around the world so I come here
standing before you most humbly

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.896
in appreciation.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.163
I'm going to talk not for
very long and I'll talk--

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.240
they didn't tell me until just
now that I was also going to talk

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.373
about my family and our role
in the District of Columbia.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.850
But I'm going to talk to you
a little bit about my book

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.673
and maybe we can get to the other
stuff in questions because I'd love

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.413
to have some give and take with
you and what you are interested in

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.536
or you might be interested
in with this particular book;

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.223
and about African-American
history and women's history

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.920
and whatever else you're
thinking about.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.340
So let me just talk to you about
ten minutes about this book.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.916
I have to put this
down because the space

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.613
under here won't accommodate it.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.666
Okay so here we go.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.466
One of the things that is
particularly enjoyable about talking

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.026
about this particular book
which is called Parallel Worlds:

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.410
The Remarkable Gibbs-Hunts and the
Enduring Insignificance of Melanin,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.183
is that different readers,
different audiences suggest

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.850
different approaches.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.760
Different audiences come to
it with different interests

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.406
and there's plenty of me here
in the book to approach it

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.363
from a variety of different
directions.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.630
At George Washington University
where I have been teaching

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.060
since 1994, they asked me
last winter to fit this

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.040
in with their black history
month's theme about the new Negro

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.523
in Washington, D.C. in the
1920's; and of course I did that;

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.383
I talked about black women's issues
and black women's political activism

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.260
at the Women's National
Democratic Club.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.903
So I did that there,
then just recently

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.443
at the D.C. Historical Society
I joined a panel where we talked

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.303
about how things have changed and
things have not changed in terms

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.896
of African American's and women's
influence in foreign relations;

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.603
and foreign relations is a very
important part of this book.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.940
But the Library of Congress

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.410
when I spoke there last winter
advertised this as being

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.936
about a remarkable mixed race family
so this gives me an opportunity

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.076
to talk about those
aspects of Parallel Worlds.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.183
Given the great variety and
accelerated discussions and debates

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.060
that we've had in the last few years
about so-called mixed race people

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.600
in the United States, most
obviously certainly our President,

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.313
plus the fact that relatively
recently as of the 2000 census

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:00.450
and of course we've just
taken another census,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.770
but as the 2000 census, we
could talk about mixed races

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.683
and claim ourselves as having all
kinds of different racial heritage.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.506
So I don't know whether any of you

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.010
in fact saw the Henry
Louis Gates series

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.966
on television called
Faces of America.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.046
And one of the things
that he is emphasizing

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.056
in that is how many
interrelationships we have racially,

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.210
culturally and so on.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.803
Just as a very amusing
aside, Stephen Colbert

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.630
who interviewed my daughter
after she was the Inaugural Poet,

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.996
and he is a neighbor of my
son in Mt. Clair, New Jersey,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.166
and they have been working
on ellipticals together

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.250
and so they've known
each other for some time.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.343
And it turns out from
Skip Gates' research

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.236
that in fact we are cousins;

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.380
and of course in his own driveway
Stephen Colbert says, "No, no,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.960
no I am the whitest man in America."

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.373
But it did introduce us to
all kinds of different things.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.243
So I'm going to inform you a little
bit I hope and challenge you to some

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.923
of these questions as I talk.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.893
And one of the things that I do know
and that most of us in this room

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.406
who identify ourselves as
African Americans know too,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.393
at least this is true for those of
us who are, shall we say, over 50,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.870
that regardless of our physical
features, skin color, hair texture,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.613
all of those things, we
always thought of ourselves

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.206
in my childhood the word
of course was negroes.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.796
More recently we became blacks,
then we became African-Americans.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.270
We didn't think of-- we old
generation didn't think of ourselves

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.443
as being of mixed race; there
was no question about that.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.563
And this was a matter that
was shaped by a lot of things.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.130
It was shaped by custom,
it was shaped by law,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.746
and it was also very much shaped
by pride in racial accomplishments.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.336
That's not to say of course that
we didn't know pretty much for sure

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:40.610
that in our families several
generations back there was indeed a

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:45.910
complex racial history some place
several generations back or more.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.993
There often were add mixtures
of white blood and I use

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.766
that word blood which we all know is
a metaphor; it doesn't really mean

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.206
and I always see quotation
marks whenever I say blood

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.566
in that context.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.683
And we also, many of us, had Native
American so-called blood as well.

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.356
We also knew and know that in most
cases this whiteness had intruded

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.683
on our Africanness through
white male per genitors,

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.450
and it was not always something
that came consensually.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.610
I recently heard a lecture
at the National Endowment

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.370
for the Humanities in which a
grantee has developed a massive

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.316
database of the Atlanta
Slave Trade almost 400 years.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.860
And one of the statistics
gleaned from that

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.460
and this is totally amazing to me --

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.156
I've done history for
more than 20 years,

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.990
that until the mid 1800's the
ratio of black women being brought

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.813
to this country, in other words
African women, to white women--

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.390
the women who came here voluntarily,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.890
that that ratio was
9 to 1-- amazing.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.896
So obviously what we know from this
is that most of the European men

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.883
who cross the Atlantic did not
come with their wives so some

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:27.963
but few Native American women were
available to them so in many cases

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.780
of course their sexual
partners were African slaves.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.770
The other interesting and
unique thing that happened

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.530
in the new United States

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.200
in the 1800's was there
was a virtual reversal

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.910
of the old tradition that was so
prevalent in English common law

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.950
which determined that
the condition--

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.016
the legal condition of a
child followed the condition

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760
of the mother.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.693
Now that meant that when we
turned that concept upside down,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.793
the child of a slave woman was also
therefore enslaved in perpetuity.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.193
That determination
did a lot of things.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.203
It both saved white men
from having any moral

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.443
or financial responsibility
for their offspring,

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:27.263
and it also ensured an ever-growing,
ever-sufficient enslaved population

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.120
for a new country that
grounded its economy and much

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.193
of its wealth enslaved labor.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.903
Especially that was true after 1807

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.720
when the International
Slave Trade was banned;

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.906
in other words you couldn't
bring anymore enslaved Africans

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.133
into the country.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.133
So that dramatically
curtailed the availability,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.793
the supposedly limitless
supply of those people.

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.430
Another factor soon crept
into this complex equation

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.800
and that was again something
that's unique in the United States,

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.820
sort of a binary definition
of race itself.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.133
In other words in the United States
anybody who is not certifiably

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.146
"white" all white so to speak,
anyone with any so-called trace

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:21.436
of Negro blood was
designated both in law

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.410
and in practice to be a Negro.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.570
So this is very different
from the situation even

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.766
in the Western hemisphere
where various degrees

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.116
of so-called Negro-ness gave people
varying amounts of privilege,

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.723
varying amounts of
protections under the law;

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.520
sometimes that included getting
your freedom; So I tell you this

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.236
to introduce some of the
specific circumstances

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.573
in which the two intertwine
families-- the Gibbs and the Hunts,

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:02.343
whom I write about in Parallel
Worlds found themselves

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.470
in the 19th Century which is
when my story takes place.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.183
So let me tell you a little
bit more about the book

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.370
and how these people
that I write about.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:18.463
My main protagonists are Ida
Gibbs-Hunt and William Henry Hunt;

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.973
how they came to be part of
these mixed race families.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.326
Both of these are fascinating
people to whom I was drawn

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.800
in the first place because I love
biography; I love family history;

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.286
I have written two family
history books before this one;

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:43.363
my first one was Ambiguous Lives and
my second one was the American Saga

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.846
of Homelands and Waterways: The
American Saga of the Bond Family.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.260
I saw in their marriage, this
marriage of Ida and William,

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.690
a remarkable balance of power,
balance of gender power.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.273
That was singular in their era but
certainly it's hard to document

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.590
and certainly that
was an era when women

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.730
for the most part played very
subservient roles to men.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.040
I also wanted of course to tell a
good story because what I love to do

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:20.310
with history is the story part
of it and telling good stories

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:24.083
because that's what attracts me.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.483
and I think that's what
attracts a lot of you as well.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.250
William Henry Hunt actually
became the first African American

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.913
to have a full career
with the State Department.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.293
And thus he lived around
the world for 35 years,

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.246
most of it with his wife.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.580
Ida also was a significant
intellectual.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.360
She was a major organizer of W.E.
B. Dubois' Pan African Congresses

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.910
in Europe in the 1920's
so there was plenty

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.626
of heft to both of their lives.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.893
These people also provided me with a
lot of documentary evidence to help

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.986
in recreating their stories.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.986
Ida's father, Mifflin Gibbs,

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.243
wrote and published an
autobiography in 1902.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.960
She herself published
extensively and she left scads

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:22.620
of personal letters as did her
sister and her brother-in-law.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:27.750
Now William Hunt wrote but he
didn't manage to get it published,

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.820
a memoir of his own, as
well as a number of articles

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.043
and he too left a plethora

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.090
of personal professional
correspondence.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.230
William and-- I'll
call him Billy now

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.356
because he becomes Billy
early in my narrative.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.590
He was born into slavery
in 1863 in rural Tennessee.

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.510
He apparently never felt the need

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.890
to say specifically a white man was
my father, but he knew from family

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.186
and friends that his father did live
in the nearby so-called big house,

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.240
that being of course the
phrase that was always used

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.956
for the master's house
in the antebellum south.

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.596
And as I write about Billy's
account of his paternity he says,

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:18.970
"Stories like these offer
anecdotal the credible confirmation

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:20.350
that my wielding their
physical, sexual, economic

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:27.696
and emotional powers, such white
men have significantly lightened

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:28.456
so-called black America's
collective complexion while

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.736
with apparent indifference,
they contributed

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.990
to widespread illegitimacy
in that community."

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.016
So one of the things that we
talk about all the time now

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:49.683
and appropriately so is
illegitimacy in the Black community;

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.406
but one of my arguments
in this is to say

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.446
that this was first an
imposed illegitimacy that came

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.770
out of the traditions of slavery.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.820
His mother, Billy's mother,
I determined belonged

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.963
to a slave-owning widower
whose name was William H. Hunt.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.490
She gave her oldest son his name
with whom she had six children.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:17.643
I judge from that account
combined with census documentation

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.043
of both Billy and his mother;

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.310
and from Billy's appearance he was
quite light-skinned, light-haired--

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:30.596
- light eyes, curly hair that to use
our metaphor again he probably had

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.983
considerably more so-called white
blood and so-called black blood.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.800
Nonetheless as I also explained
before for purposes of law

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.346
and in practice, he was
in fact designated a Negro

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.413
and he never tried to
seriously circumvent

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.330
that identification
although he could have.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:01.260
Another question arises because I
think he perhaps may have had Native

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.066
American ancestors when he was a
council in France in the 1920's.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:06.756
There was an article
written in a French newspaper

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.543
that said he was a po
rouge [assumed spelling]--

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.650
that common but ugly
designation of a redskin.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:20.116
Perhaps Billy Hunt heard that rumor
and repeated it in his host country

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.170
but anyway it became
common news in France.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:33.843
So the French it seemed in
the 1920's really wanted

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.430
to differentiate him
and his wife Ida

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.633
from the truly black colonial
Africans whom they knew something

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.470
about and whom they
considered very primitive.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.783
They didn't consider-- they thought

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:49.900
that Billy Hunt was
a sophisticated man.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.800
He was an American; he
was educated and so forth.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.623
Ida Alexander Gibbs came from
another such mixed race family

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:01.166
and her story as I document it
is perhaps ever more intriguing

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:04.620
although we do hear these
stories from time to time.

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:07.966
Family lore combined
with other anecdotal

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.953
and census records reveals a
lineage that's very interesting

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.810
on her maternal side.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.063
I argue that Ida's maternal
grandfather was a man named Richard

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680
Mentor Johnson.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:28.016
You probably don't know that name;

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:30.260
I didn't know it before I undertook
this endeavor and I should know

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.070
such things because I'm
supposed to be an historian.

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.276
But he was very well known
in his time because from 1837

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.000
to 1841 he was Vice President
of the United States--

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.526
Martin Van Buren's Vice President.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.893
Before that period, during

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.290
that period Johnson was a Kentucky
slave owner, he had been a Senator.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.133
He officially remained a
bachelor throughout his life.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.140
There's a lot of documentation,
a lot of speculation

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.526
about his relationships especially
with a woman named Julia Chinn

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.103
with whom he had two daughters
whom he acknowledged and supported.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.236
But according to many accounts Julia
Chinn was not the only slave woman

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.750
with whom he had sexual relations,
and sometimes he kept more

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.446
than one mistress of
color at the same time.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.440
Several biographies suggest
that he also had liaisons with

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:34.920
and prepare yourselves for this--

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.253
this one sort of shocked
me-- with Julia's two nieces.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.716
One was named Patience Chinn

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:44.860
and the other was named Lucy Chinn
Alexander, Lucy being the mother

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.926
of my protagonist Ida Gibbs.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.853
One such story which I quote in
my books suggests that Lucy had

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.033
"about the complexion of
Shakespeare's worthy Othello.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.683
Who knows what this worthy
Othello's complexion was like?

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.090
But in any case she at least
had one child by that white man,

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.966
Maria, who was Ida's mother.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.830
Most evidence suggests that
it was Richard Mentor Johnson,

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.683
Vice President, who was her father.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.346
I think that these stories are true
and they also lead me to suspect

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:33.276
that the Chinn family had Native
American forbears as well.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.423
Several accounts suggest that Maria
ran away from our R.M. Johnson

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.286
with assistance of a Chaukta
[assumed spelling] Indian man.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.063
So descriptions of the
women in the family also say

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.593
that they were copper-skinned

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:52.080
and they had straight
black hair and so on.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.240
So I think that they probably had
Native American blood as well.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.173
My book accounts the early life
of Ida's father, Mifflin Gibbs,

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.623
but his experiences while equally
remarkable do not include any

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:12.450
such accounts of white men who
used or misused their slave women

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.363
and father their children.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.093
So those are some of the
stories about Ida Gibbs

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.313
and William Hunt's ancestries
that I account in Parallel World;

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.583
which leads to the designation
of them in today's Lexicon

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.340
as being so-called
mixed race family.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.100
Now let's fast forward a little
to the early 20th Century.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.036
Billy Hunt first followed his
very successful father-in-law

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.446
to the Consulate in colonial
Madagascar in 1898 and then

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.213
after ten years in Madagascar he
went on to 20 years in France,

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.410
then he was sent to Guadalupe
and in 1929 he found himself

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.206
in the mid-Atlantic
Portuguese Azores,

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.003
a local that he found
to be quite idyllic.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:10.396
At that time and here we get
into some of the personal stories

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.710
that are intertwined,
he had correspondence

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.030
with a young Negro woman named
Caroline Bond-Day whose mother was a

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.526
close friend of Billy's wife, Ida.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.283
Caroline wanted a photograph
of Council Hunt to add

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:26.856
to the collection that
she was pulling together

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.330
at Harvard University

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:34.063
for her pending Master's
Degree in Anthropology.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.420
When her work was complete,

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:41.353
she became the first self-identified
Negro anywhere in the country

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:41.920
to earn a graduate
degree in that field.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.926
In 1932 Harvard published
her thesis under the title,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.460
a Study of Some Negro White
Families in the United States.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.246
The work seems a bit primitive by
today's standards of anthropology,

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:57.903
but it was far in a way the
earliest study of its kind

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.123
and I know a great deal about it

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.020
because Caroline Bond-Day
was my mother's older sister,

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.893
she was my aunt and my
mother worked on this thesis

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.183
in the book during
her college summers.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.473
It was a treasured fixture in my
house as I was growing up and that's

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.320
where I first saw the
photograph of William Henry Hunt.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.426
One reason it intrigued me
was because he looked so much

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.370
like members of my
father's maternal family

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.746
and they too had the surname Hunt.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.150
My mother assured me that that Hunts
were not related to Council Hunt.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:46.670
I'd like to be able to tell you
that I definitely learned otherwise

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:47.030
in this book but I didn't;
I don't think we're related.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.910
What I learned is that
Ida Gibbs Hunt

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.853
and William Henry Hunt definitely
did meet one of my relatives,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.026
a great uncle in Paris in 1921.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.953
This sort of expands our
ideas of all the things

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.386
that African-Americans
did at that point.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:10.080
They had mutual friends
in Washington

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.553
and probably met again n the
1930's when Billy Hunt had retired

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.223
from the State Department.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.623
Henry Hunt, a well known educator
arrived here in 1934 to serve

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:24.513
as what was then called Franklin
Delano Roosevelt's black cabinet.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:28.860
I don't know whether
you know that term.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.450
Of course they were really cabinet
members; the first cabinet member--

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.270
real cabinet member was Robert
Weaver who was appointed

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.366
by Linda Johnson in 1965.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:40.276
But it was the first time
that any sizeable number

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.483
of African Americans held
positions of substance

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.433
in the Federal Government.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.233
I'd like to close my formal
presentation with a little

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:53.820
of what Dubois wrote
posthumously [assumed spelling]

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.573
about Henry Alexander
Hunt which I include

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.293
in the epilogue of Parallel Worlds.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.766
He asked rhetorically
why Hunt, my great uncle,

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.153
had stayed so resonantly within
the African American community,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.106
never taking the easier path and
opted to become the white man

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.040
that his physiog [assumed
spelling] declared him.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.363
When, as Dubois wrote, thousands of
men and women like him have done so.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:18.826
Those thousands who chose to pass
for white included several members

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.940
of the Hunt family I write about
there, and my Hunt family as well.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.280
The overwhelming and I'm
continuing with Dubois opinion

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.460
of white Americans, is that
one black ancestors in 8

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.056
or 16 makes a tremendous
difference of identity

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.306
of treatment of opportunity.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.196
And then he went on to take a stand
in America, however; as anything

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:47.700
but a Negro would have
made him extremely unhappy

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:54.980
because here was an opportunity
for battle on the highest plane.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.620
Life is primarily friends and family

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.600
and one cannot lightly cast off
this enveloping and intriguing bond

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.013
of love and affection to create
a new place in a strange world.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.493
So I've barely touched on 30 years
of living, working and adventuring

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.813
around the world that's
at the core of this book

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.520
about the remarkable Gibbs-Hunts.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:21.846
But I hope that this discussion

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.113
of mixed race families has given
you a taste of what's in my book;

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.376
something to think about,
something to chew over and I hope

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:32.753
that you will be stimulated
to ask questions.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.066
We don't have terribly much time
but I would love it and I thank you

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:40.216
so much for your attentiveness.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.350
This is wonderful.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.520
[ Applause ]

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.186
Adele Alexander: Yes Sir?

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.586
&gt;&gt; Audience question: In
your significant study

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.133
of African-American families and I
guess particularly mixed families,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.106
how often did you come across
the use of skin products--

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.193
skin lighteners or whiteners or even
darkeners; or was that something

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:13.716
that you were able to research or
was that something that was talked

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.980
about at all or written about?

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:17.380
&gt;&gt; Adele Alexander: Certainly
I don't write about it

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.913
because I never found
it in any of the people

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.133
that I happen to write about.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:27.000
However, I've done a lot of
work with a woman you may know

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.510
about whose name is A'lelia Bundles
whose great grandmother was Madame

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.220
C.J. Walker who developed
hair straightening--

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.480
she called them hair health
products, skin health products

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.226
that also served to create a
more-- a whiter appearance.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.073
But I guess that one of the things
is that it almost seems remarkable

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.766
to me not that so many
people did these things,

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.446
but that so many did not.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.766
Because in our culture there
was so much of a premium

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.626
that has been placed on whiteness--
day to day inconveniences,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.573
legal restrictions
and everything else.

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:22.183
It's easy for me to understand why
a number of black people wanted

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:26.633
to be part of the majority in
this country because they were

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.186
so discriminated against
and any steps

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:32.970
in that direction I think
were understandable.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.683
&gt;&gt; Audience question: I've enjoyed
your presentation very much.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:40.003
My friend and I came
here from Georgia;

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.890
we're both from the Deep
South, rural Georgia,

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:44.426
and wonder about your connection
to Georgia given your earlier book,

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.103
Ambiguous Lives, and just wondered
if you'd comment about that.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:53.910
&gt;&gt; Adele Alexander:
I'm a big city girl.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:57.456
I'm a total Northerner, I
grew up in New York City

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.010
and I didn't know anything
whatsoever

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:04.770
about Georgia beside Atlanta,
the world of the Deep South,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.100
sort of began and ended for me

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.166
with the Atlanta suburbs
when I was growing up.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.233
And then in the 1980's,
the early 1980's I was--

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.193
also I should add sort of on
my own bio, that I went back

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.756
to graduate school when my children
were going to graduate school

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.856
so I was a very old
graduate student--

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:34.620
And so in case you all got confused
about my age and my white hair.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.593
But so this was in the 1980's
that I went down to rural Georgia

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:46.476
and the ruralness of it
was a revolution to me.

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:54.263
The degree to which the South was
still-- much of the rural south,

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.336
not Atlanta, that's one
of the big differences.

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:03.176
The rural south was still
held captive by its traditions

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.130
of segregation but
also how community

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.440
and family retain traditions that
we-- when we move to urban areas,

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:18.916
we move to the North, we
sometimes lose these things.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:26.416
And I just totally became engrossed
in this family of mine that came

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.550
out of Hancock County, Georgia

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:35.203
which at one time was the most
populous county in the State;

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.500
and it is now just such
a total sad backorder.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:44.710
But there I found the most wonderful
family and friend so that's a lot

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:47.930
of my connection with Georgia.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.850
Oh thank you so much.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.533
They're holding up a big sign
in here that says overtime.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:01.350
I think they're going to cut off
my mic any time, any moment now

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.943
so let me once again
thank you for coming.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:06.980
[ Applause ]

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.780
&gt;&gt; Adele Alexander: And if I
can just add one quick thing.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.320
For some reason they scheduled
my book signing before and not

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.053
after my talk which is crazy,

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.413
but if any of you do want
books signed I would be more

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.750
than delighted to do so.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.216
Thank you again.
