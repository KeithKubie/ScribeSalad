00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.710
Hello, and welcome to my new set!

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.130
I'm on a chaise lounge!

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.130
I'm on a chair!

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.200
Chaise lounge!

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
Wingback!

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Chaise!

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Chair!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200
Both at the same time!

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.770
I also got a new jacket; it was formerly owned
by Roger - he had it embroidered with his

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.380
name - but one thing here is not new: my brain.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.539
Because unlike the vast majority of cells
in my body, the neurons I had when I was an

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.249
infant are the neurons that I have right now.

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:29.739
They will be the same neurons I have when
I die.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.250
Our brains are us.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.070
They do not replace.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.260
It's all part of the magical mystery that
is our minds.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.050
Now, some - okay, me, occasionally - argue
that psychology is a softer science than chemistry

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.690
or biology or physics.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.880
Well, frankly, that's true: there's more discussion
of tendencies, of maybes, the allowances for

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.199
statistical significance are wider, and you
want to know why?

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.219
Because it's more complicated.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.710
Your brain is more complicated than anything
taught in theoretical physics classes.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.370
There are no equations that can define it.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.600
Though it operates within the same laws as
the rest of the cosmos, its complexity rivals

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.909
that of the entire rest of the universe combined!

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.860
Excluding all the other brains, of course.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.610
You'd think that we'd be really good at understanding
brains, though, since, you know, we all have

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.410
one and use one all the time.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.700
We experience the world as a brain connected
to sensing systems, and yet, as we will see,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.680
our insights about how brains work are often
very wrong!

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.810
So just throw out everything you think you
know!

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.280
And that is why we have this wonderful science
of psychology.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.060
Though you cannot, as early psychologists
wished, break the human psyche into "atoms

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.909
of consciousness", through careful study of
your mind, you can, at least in part, understand

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.250
your mind!

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.270
And the minds of others!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.100
We can heal the sick, deepen understanding,
and improve functions.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.350
That's really the heart of it.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.490
Minds trying to understand minds.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.869
The reason we do things, why we think and
feel the way we do.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.400
The schools of thought, the techniques, the
history, the characters, from Freud to advanced

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.420
neuroscience - from healthy to broken, from
everyday behaviors to the deepest depths of

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.490
your subconscious.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.290
And also, did I mention?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.390
Chaise lounge!

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.560
Why don't I have a cigar?

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.310
I should have a cigar.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.340
I honestly do not have any idea how to acquire
a cigar; Freud would be so disappointed in

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.340
me!

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.660
Actually, did you know that Freud was, in
addition to cigars, also addicted to cocaine?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.280
One of the many things you will learn here
in Crash Course Psychology!
