00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 align:start position:0%
they should not misuse the chemistry
 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
they should not misuse the chemistry
that's<00:00:45.420><c> they</c><00:00:45.899><c> should</c><00:00:46.110><c> not</c><00:00:46.289><c> misuse</c><00:00:47.329><c> anything</c>

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 align:start position:0%
that's they should not misuse anything
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.580 align:start position:0%
that's they should not misuse anything
which<00:00:48.629><c> might</c><00:00:48.840><c> be</c><00:00:48.899><c> used</c><00:00:49.200><c> for</c><00:00:49.379><c> peaceful</c>

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 align:start position:0%
which might be used for peaceful
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
which might be used for peaceful
purposes<00:00:49.829><c> but</c><00:00:50.789><c> at</c><00:00:51.059><c> the</c><00:00:51.180><c> same</c><00:00:51.390><c> time</c><00:00:51.600><c> which</c>

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 align:start position:0%
purposes but at the same time which
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.209 align:start position:0%
purposes but at the same time which
could<00:00:51.989><c> be</c><00:00:52.140><c> harmful</c><00:00:52.469><c> to</c><00:00:52.829><c> the</c><00:00:53.960><c> people</c><00:00:54.960><c> so</c><00:00:55.680><c> this</c>

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
could be harmful to the people so this
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.189 align:start position:0%
could be harmful to the people so this
is<00:00:56.370><c> strictly</c><00:00:56.820><c> prohibited</c><00:00:57.180><c> by</c><00:00:57.660><c> the</c><00:00:57.719><c> convention</c>

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
is strictly prohibited by the convention
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.860 align:start position:0%
is strictly prohibited by the convention
so<00:00:58.530><c> they</c><00:00:58.710><c> actually</c><00:00:58.770><c> they</c><00:00:59.100><c> have</c><00:00:59.340><c> to</c><00:00:59.809><c> abide</c><00:01:00.809><c> by</c>

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 align:start position:0%
so they actually they have to abide by
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.070 align:start position:0%
so they actually they have to abide by
their<00:01:01.350><c> obligations</c>
