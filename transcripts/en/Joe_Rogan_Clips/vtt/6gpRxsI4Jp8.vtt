00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.460
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.650
I watched a documentary called,
what the hell have you seen?
It's like,
yeah,

3
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:11.720
it's filled with a lot of propaganda from Canada at them.
Those guys,
again,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.710
like the Nazis,
I remember the,
it's,

5
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:18.711
they used a lot of discredited studies and there's a lot of epidemiology studies

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:22.380
that'll connect things that bond mula she does that.
What does that mean?

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.000
Like an epidemic or he's like,
no,

8
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:29.001
we could pull up what the actual pulled something up and etiology.

9
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.980
But the way I would describe it as they would do these studies,

10
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:34.080
and essentially it would be,
they would,

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.060
they would ask you what you eat on a daily basis.
How often do you eat meat?
How,

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:43.530
and it's basically a survey.
And in,
in that survey they would say,
well,

13
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:47.370
there's a direct correlation between people that eat meat and diabetes.

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.750
So let's pull up the definitions.
Oh,
I see.

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
But the problem is what is causing here a branch of medicine,

16
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.560
which deals with incidents,

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:01:00.030
distribution and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to

18
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.060
health.
Um,
so when they're,

19
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
when they're dealing with incidents,
right?
They're dealing with,

20
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.570
how often do you eat red meat?
How often do you eat this?

21
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:11.940
How often do you eat that?
And then they find,
oh,

22
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.840
well there's more instances of diabetes and people that eat meat.
Okay,

23
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.250
but is it people that eat meat and vegetables or is it people that eat meat and

24
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:25.251
vegetables and diet coke and sugary sodas and ice cream and French fries,

25
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.910
and how are they eating their meat?

26
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240
Are they eating cheeseburgers for some bullshit fast food place?

27
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:34.530
Are they eating grass fed steak?
Are they eating grass fed steak and vegetables?

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.060
And there's very little evidence that shows there's anything wrong with eating

29
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:43.860
meat.
If you follow a normal healthy,
what they would call it,
primal diet eating,

30
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.760
cut out all the grains,
cut on all the sugar,
cut out all the bullshit,

31
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.380
eat vegetables and meat.
And there's almost nothing.

32
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.020
I mean unless you have some very unusual,

33
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:59.910
rare condition where you are either allergic to meat or you have some very

34
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:01.330
strange,
uh,

35
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.040
digestive system where you find you have allergies to it or you have real

36
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.700
problems digesting it or you have real problems with high cholesterol foods,

37
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:13.100
which is very rare as well.
Most of what you're getting is vegan propaganda.

38
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.950
People that want other people to be convinced that the way that they're living

39
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:19.900
is the correct way and that eating meat is,

40
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.680
is physically bad for you and it's causing all these harms.

41
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:26.670
What's causing all the harm people physically is the modern American diet and

42
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.900
that's been pretty established.
Yes,
that's right.

43
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.620
And there are clear ethical reasons to be Vegan in the,

44
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:34.800
it takes you out of the exploitation of animals.
But that documentary,

45
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:36.230
what the health that I watched was like,
you know,

46
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:38.610
not be a vegetarian for years and this light and I've gone back and forth to

47
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:40.500
veganism because I felt God,
Jesus Christ,
man,

48
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.960
there's enough things in my life I'm not doing without not been out.

49
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.530
I have an egg without feeling guilty for pasture raised eggs.

50
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.970
If you get them from a good farm,
the chickens are just hanging out now.

51
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.300
They'll confident in these animals in the way.
Well,
one by one,

52
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.420
slowly Dulcie eliminate in

53
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.670
terrible fertilize.
Nine of them to coyotes.
Just last month,
maybe two months ago,

54
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.400
I said pretty heavy.
So it was a heavy toll.
Yeah.

55
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:09.340
Well we had a fire out here and the chicken coop burnt down.

56
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:12.130
We got a smaller chicken coop and the coyote is figured out how to get into it

57
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.010
more when we're at home and came home to just feathers everywhere.

58
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.750
It was disgusting.
Brutal.
They're brutal little monsters.
Coyotes.
Yeah.

59
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.500
Yeah.

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.260
You know ungovernable they're the reason why I'm want to have rats everywhere

61
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.760
too.
All right.
So yeah.

62
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.100
<v 1>Could I live in lion king was right.
So like,
hey though,
um,</v>

63
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.670
the thing that about that Vegan documentary mate is that it,

64
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.860
it tuned in to my preexisting belief when it said stuff like,
oh,

65
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:39.780
the diabetes associations,

66
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.680
they are funded by these meat and dairy organizations in these pharmaceutical

67
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:44.041
companies.

68
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:48.720
The cancer organizations similarly accepts donations from these organizations.

69
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:53.280
And it made me recognize my preexisting idea to I come to it with is,

70
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.730
you know,
like that whole pyramid of these are the things you should eat.
Bread,

71
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.980
milk,
like,
you know,

72
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.230
just with the figs that it was easy and cheap to produce and that we're

73
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:03.140
profitable and they used it.

74
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.790
<v 0>I think that they really did used to think that breadwinner and grains are the</v>

75
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:08.760
most important.
Do you think they felt that?
I think they did.

76
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.060
I think they thought it was,
it was filling and it provided energy.

77
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:13.940
And I don't think they understood well.

78
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.440
There was no talk of gluten intolerance when we were young.

79
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.510
It didn't exist and there was no understanding of excess carbs and excess carbs

80
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.890
leads to excess body weight and it makes you,
makes you store fat.

81
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.460
And people didn't think about it that way.
They didn't understand there was,

82
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.330
the thing about nutrition is in nutrition,
science is a,

83
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.190
it's a body of knowledge that's constantly added to.

84
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.530
<v 1>Yeah.
And in fact,
perhaps most things are,</v>

85
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:42.170
who knows what misapprehensions and ignorance we toil on.
Yeah.

86
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.320
That will be revealed to us.
