00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians,

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.892
let's talk about prepositional phrases:

00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:04.459
what they are, and how they're used.

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.411
Their care and feeding, you know.

00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:09.754
So a prepositional
phrase, simply speaking,

00:00:09.754 --> 00:00:13.979
is anything that follows
a preposition, frankly.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.395
So, if we look at the sentence:

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:21.395
Danielle blew the horn with
the strength of a giant-

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:28.771
quick little doodle there.

00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:30.234
There's Danielle blowing the horn

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:31.278
with the strength of a giant.

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:33.357
So this part with the strength

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:37.073
of a giant, is a prepositional phrase.

00:00:37.073 --> 00:00:39.997
Actually, it's two prepositional phrases,

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:42.679
because there's with the strength,

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.094
and then, of a giant.

00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:46.349
What is a prepositional phrase?

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:49.111
It is a word chunk that begins

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:50.192
with a preposition.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:53.198
So, with is a preposition,
of is a preposition,

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.997
and this entire thing, with
the strength of a giant,

00:00:55.997 --> 00:00:59.073
is one prepositional phrase, altogether,

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:02.069
composed of two smaller ones.

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.458
And what's cool, is you can use

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.536
prepositional phrases in a couple

00:01:07.536 --> 00:01:08.817
of different ways.

00:01:08.817 --> 00:01:12.470
You can use them as nouns.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.256
You can use them as adverbs.

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:19.391
And you can use them as adjectives.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.549
So we've got two different examples here,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.195
just even within this first sentence here.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:27.308
So Danielle blew the
horn with the strength

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:29.851
of a giant. How did she blow the horn?

00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.197
With the strength of a giant.

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:33.299
And so she blew the horn

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.030
with the strength of a giant.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.433
So, with the strength of a giant,

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:40.114
this prepositional phrase is modifying

00:01:40.114 --> 00:01:42.668
the verb blew.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.933
You can really see, her hair's

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.013
being blown back just by the strength

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:47.718
of this (trumpet noise).

00:01:47.718 --> 00:01:51.713
So this whole thing
together is being treated

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:53.211
as an adverb, but if we look

00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.650
at the word strength, strength

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.331
is being modified by of a giant.

00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:59.816
So this is a noun,
right, the word strength

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:02.696
is a noun, but this of a giant thing

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:05.389
is modifying it, so this part

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:09.290
is actually behaving as an adjective.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.099
Kinda cool, right?

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.046
Let's look at some more examples.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.596
To steal the queen's diamonds

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:24.638
would be a terrible crime.

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:26.032
This is actually something we'd call,

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:28.656
in addition to being a
prepositional phrase,

00:02:28.656 --> 00:02:31.037
this is something we'd call an infinitive.

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:33.856
The verb to steal, when
it's presented like this,

00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:36.399
in the to form never conjugates.

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.755
It's not affected by time, so it's

00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:40.730
kind of infinitive and infinite.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.529
But we are treating this whole thing

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.095
as a noun, right, because

00:02:45.095 --> 00:02:46.895
to steal the queen's diamonds

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:48.811
is kind of all being considered one thing,

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:50.377
this big, old prepositional phrase,

00:02:50.377 --> 00:02:53.292
would, right, to steal
the queen's diamonds

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.578
would be a terrible crime.

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:58.377
So, this prepositional phrase is acting

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:02.474
like a noun.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.474
Let's try another one.

00:03:05.474 --> 00:03:06.207
I don't know what that is,

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:07.352
I just made it up.

00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:09.291
Let's pay attention to how

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:12.495
the prepositional phrase of glass

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:14.956
works in the rest of the sentence.

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:16.291
You know, what part of this

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:17.556
is it attached to?

00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:21.179
It's not I of glass, or enjoy of glass.

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.139
It's the cathedral of glass,

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:25.917
and that means that this of glass thing

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.937
is describing cathedral.

00:03:27.937 --> 00:03:30.293
A cathedral is a place or a structure,

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:33.231
so it's a noun, right, so if of glass

00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:35.111
is modifying this noun, that would make it

00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:36.690
an adjective.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.256
So of glass here, this
prepositional phrase,

00:03:39.256 --> 00:03:42.449
is behaving like an adjective.

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.375
Prepositional phrases
can be really powerful

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:47.696
and really elegant, and really cool.

00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:49.612
Like in Hamlet, in the
"to be, or not to be"

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:52.479
speech, Hamlet describes death as

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.606
the undiscovered country,
from whose bourn,

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:02.556
no traveler returns.

00:04:02.556 --> 00:04:04.949
And bourn is an Early Modern English word

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.795
meaning, like, boundary.

00:04:06.795 --> 00:04:09.279
What Hamlet is saying in the soliloquy

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:11.010
is that death is a mystery.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.657
People don't come back from it.

00:04:12.657 --> 00:04:15.235
And I think that's like a really powerful

00:04:15.235 --> 00:04:17.929
use of a prepositional phrase.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.587
All of this is describing country

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:27.298
in a way that undiscovered is also doing.

00:04:27.298 --> 00:04:31.210
So country is being
modified from both sides,

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.811
which is really cool, and it imbues

00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:36.353
the word country with
a really strange power.

00:04:36.353 --> 00:04:38.258
But, you have to be careful

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:39.476
because you can set yourself up

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:41.010
for a lot of ambiguity

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.320
with prepositional phrases.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.154
You may remember this terrible joke

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:47.650
from Mary Poppins. One man says,

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.354
"I knew a man with a
wooden leg named Smith."

00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:54.791
Other guy says, "But what was
the name of his other leg?"

00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.154
It's silly, but it's
a good way to indicate

00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:03.533
where confusion can arise

00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:05.774
with prepositional phrases.

00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:09.279
So I would say, generally,
that the solution

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.637
to a problem like this is to just put

00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:14.179
the named Smith part
earlier in the sentence.

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:16.628
I knew a man named Smith
who had a wooden leg.

00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:19.474
Maybe lose the prepositional phrase.

00:05:19.474 --> 00:05:22.457
That solves the problem.

00:05:22.457 --> 00:05:24.756
What I'm trying to say
is, prepositional phrases

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:26.590
are very powerful, but
you have to be careful

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.692
about how you use them, because

00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:29.899
if you're not careful, you can create

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:31.756
confusion or ambiguity.

00:05:31.756 --> 00:05:34.032
Anyway, you can learn anything.

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.238
Sorry for the terrible cockney accent.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:37.479
David out.
