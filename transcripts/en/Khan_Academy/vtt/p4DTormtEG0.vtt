00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.440
This right here is a picture
of an Airbus A380 aircraft.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.109
And I was curious
how long would it

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.790
take this aircraft to take off?

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.875
And I looked up its
takeoff velocity.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.600
And the specs I got were
280 kilometers per hour.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.810
And to make this a velocity we
have to specify a direction as

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.620
well, not just a magnitude.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.680
So the direction is in the
direction of the runway.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.304
So that would be the positive
direction right over there.

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:37.470
So when we're talking about
acceleration or velocity

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.928
in this, we're
going to assume it's

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:42.780
in this direction, the direction
of going down the runway.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.970
And I also looked up
its specs, and this,

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.120
I'm simplifying a little
bit, because it's not

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.214
going to have a purely
constant acceleration.

00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:50.630
But let's just say
from the moment

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.490
that the pilot says we're
taking off to when it actually

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.690
takes off it has a
constant acceleration.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.280
Its engines are able to
provide a constant acceleration

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.960
of 1.0 meters per
second per second.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070
So after every second it
can go one meter per second

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.030
faster than it was going at
the beginning of that second.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:25.530
Or another way to write this
is 1.0-- let me write it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.250
this way-- meters
per second per second

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.984
can also be written as
meters per second squared.

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:32.650
I find this a little
bit more intuitive.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.910
This is a little
bit neater to write.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.360
So let's figure this out.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.490
So the first thing
we're trying to answer

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
is, how long does take off last?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.200
That is the question
we will try to answer.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400
And to answer this,
at least my brain

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.289
wants to at least
get the units right.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.830
So over here we have
our acceleration

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.890
in terms of meters and
seconds, or seconds squared.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.640
And over here we have
our takeoff velocity

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.130
in terms of
kilometers and hours.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.030
So let's just convert
this takeoff velocity

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.170
into meters per second.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.479
And then it might simplify
answering this question.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.770
So if we have 280
kilometers per hour,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.170
how do we convert that
to meters per second?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.630
So let's convert it to
kilometers per second first.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.650
So we want to get
rid of this hours.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.122
And the best way
to do that, if we

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:26.580
have an hour in
the denominator, we

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.230
want an hour in the
numerator, and we

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.530
want a second in
the denominator.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.600
And so what do we
multiply this by?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960
Or what do we put in front
of the hours and seconds?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.030
So one hour, in one hour
there are 3,600 seconds,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.960
60 seconds in a minute,
60 minutes in an hour.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.870
And so you have one
of the larger unit

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.400
is equal to 3,600
of the smaller unit.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.280
And that we can
multiply by that.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.820
And if we do that, the
hours will cancel out.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.950
And we'll get 280 divided by
3,600 kilometers per second.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.830
But I want to do
all my math at once.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.550
So let's also do the conversion
from kilometers to meters.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.770
So once again, we have
kilometers in the numerator.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.070
So we want the kilometers
in the denominator now.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.410
So it cancels out.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.490
And we want meters
in the numerator.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.710
And what's the smaller unit?

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.790
It's meters.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.800
And we have 1,000 meters
for every 1 kilometer.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.830
And so when you multiply
this out the kilometers

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.910
are going to cancel out.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.490
And you are going to be
left with 280 times 1,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.620
so we don't have to write
it down, times 1,000,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.400
all of that over 3,600,
and the units we have left

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.440
are meters per-- and the
only unit we have left here

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.700
is second-- meters per second.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.970
So let's get my trusty TI-85
out and actually calculate this.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.050
So we have 280 times 1000, which
is obviously 280,000, but let

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.790
me just divide that by 3,600.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.880
And it gives me 77.7
repeating indefinitely.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.300
And it looks like I had
two significant digits

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.120
in each of these
original things.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.230
I had 1.0 over
here, not 100% clear

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.630
how many significant
digits over here.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.830
Was the spec rounded to
the nearest 10 kilometers?

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.799
Or is it exactly 280
kilometers per hour?

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.340
Just to be safe I'll
assume that it's

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.360
rounded to the
nearest 10 kilometers.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.390
So we only have two
significant digits here.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.265
So we should only have
two significant digits

00:04:34.265 --> 00:04:34.910
in our answer.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.390
So we're going to round this
to 78 meters per second.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.800
So this is going to be
78 meters per second,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.950
which is pretty fast.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.590
For this thing to take off
every second that goes by it

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.260
has to travel 78
meters, roughly 3/4

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.369
of the length of a football
field in every second.

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:03.160
But that's not what
we're trying to answer.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.950
We're trying to say how
long will take off last?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.650
Well we could just do this in
our head if you think about it.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.440
The acceleration is 1 meter
per second, per second.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.060
Which tells us
after every second

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.420
it's going 1 meter
per second faster.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.574
So if you start at a velocity
of 0 and then after 1 second

00:05:21.574 --> 00:05:22.990
it'll be going 1
meter per second.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.198
After 2 seconds it will be
going 2 meters per second.

00:05:25.198 --> 00:05:27.740
After 3 seconds it'll be
going 3 meters per second.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.770
So how long will it take to
get to 78 meters per second?

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:38.550
Well, it will take 78
seconds, or roughly a minute

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.710
and 18 seconds.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.840
And just to verify this with our
definition of our acceleration,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.877
so to speak, just
remember acceleration,

00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:48.960
which is a vector quantity,
and all the directions

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.060
we're talking about now
are in the direction

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.280
of this direction of the runway.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:00.240
The acceleration is equal
to change in velocity

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.140
over change in time.

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:07.050
And we're trying to solve for
how much time does it take,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.740
or the change in time.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.520
So let's do that.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.040
So let's multiply both
sides by change in time.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.780
You get change in time
times acceleration

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.785
is equal to change in velocity.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.600
And to solve for change
in time, divide both sides

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.230
by the acceleration.

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.940
So divide both sides by
the acceleration you get

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.980
a change in time.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.710
I could go down
here, but I just want

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.584
to use all this real
estate I have over here.

00:06:37.584 --> 00:06:40.400
I have change in time
is equal to change

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.855
in velocity divided
by acceleration.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.664
And in this situation, what
is our change in velocity?

00:06:51.664 --> 00:06:53.455
Well, we're starting
off with the velocity,

00:06:53.455 --> 00:06:54.980
or we're assuming
we're starting off

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.880
with a velocity of
0 meters per second.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.710
And we're getting up to
78 meters per second.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.650
So our change in velocity
is the 78 meters per second.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.030
So this is equal,
in our situation,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.580
78 meters per second is
our change in velocity.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.400
I'm taking the final velocity,
78 meters per second,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.320
and subtract from that
the initial velocity,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.590
which is 0 meters per second.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.000
And you just get this.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.230
Divided by the
acceleration, divided

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.990
by 1 meter per
second per second,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.400
or 1 meter per second squared.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.160
So the numbers part
are pretty easy.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.920
You have 78 divided by
1, which is just 78.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.140
And then the units you
have meters per second.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.620
And then if you divide by
meters per second squared,

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.230
that's the same
thing as multiplying

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.760
by seconds squared per meter.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.440
Right?

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.940
Dividing by something
the same thing

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.940
as multiplying by
its reciprocal.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.130
And you can do the
same thing with units.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.110
And then we see the
meters cancel out.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.060
And then seconds squared
divided by seconds,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.660
you're just left with seconds.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.340
So once again, we
get 78 seconds,

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.910
a little over a minute for
this thing to take off.
