00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.221
&gt;&gt; Throughout this course, we've discussed human thought and behaviors processes

00:00:03.221 --> 00:00:07.686
that are driven by both nature and nurture. And this lesson on mental illness

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:10.610
epitomizes the dynamic interplay between the two.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.732
&gt;&gt; That's right. And as we said throughout the course, we are like little chemical

00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:17.695
factories, making chemicals that help us live successfully in our environment.

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:21.127
But as you've seen from this lesson, sometimes there can be a tragic disconnect

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:24.663
between our individual nature and nurture experience which can result in mental

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:26.535
illness.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:29.308
&gt;&gt; Although this lesson is sobering, we really hope that it shows you to be

00:00:29.308 --> 00:00:33.310
thankful the times that you're experiencing positive mental health.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.544
&gt;&gt; That's right, and remember that it's not unusual for us to experience highs and

00:00:36.544 --> 00:00:40.811
lows throughout our life, periods of anxiety or depression. But it's when we

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:43.866
don't have these experiences that we should be fortunate and thankful for our

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.615
good mental health.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:48.715
&gt;&gt; Now that you've completed this lesson, we hope that you're a more educated

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.015
person in the terms of mental health literacy and that any negative stereotype

00:00:52.015 --> 00:00:58.250
or stigma that you may have once had are now diminished or completely removed.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.630
&gt;&gt; We as humans are unique and fascinating creatures and it's not uncommon for us

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.340
to experience difficulties in the sometimes challenging world. However, when

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.590
those difficulties manifest themselves through mental illness, that can be

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.497
challenging in and of itself. However, as we'll see in the next lesson, there

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:18.995
are a variety of techniques that can help reduce the symptoms of mental illness

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:25.040
such that people can live fulfilling, meaningful, adventurous, and proud lives.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.685
There's absolutely no shame in mental illness. And in our next lesson, we're

00:01:28.685 --> 00:01:31.200
going to learn about the treatments for mental disorders.
