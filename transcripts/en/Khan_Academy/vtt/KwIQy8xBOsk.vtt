00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.400
- [Instructor] So some
historians have actually said

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.579
that The Market Revolution
is more revolutionary

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.448
than The American Revolution.

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:11.969
Actually, this is a very
classic AP-US-history question.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.885
Which was more revolutionary:

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:17.665
The American Revolution
or The Market Revolution?

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.349
But how could something
actually be more revolutionary

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.748
than The American Revolution?

00:00:22.748 --> 00:00:24.335
It's because The Market Revolution

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.918
was a confluence of inventions,

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:32.105
changes in the way that the
American people did business,

00:00:32.105 --> 00:00:35.932
and changes in the way that
people got goods to market

00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:40.324
that happened in this period
from about 1790 to 1850.

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:43.337
So this is kind of a
large period of history,

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:45.696
and I don't think it's
really important for you

00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:49.412
to have a laundry list
of dates of exactly when

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:54.310
what thing was invented, but
just kind of take in the idea

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.280
that in the first half or
so of the early 19th Century

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.239
there were many new inventions
in both factory work

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.043
and in transportation and communication,

00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:11.512
and that how people did
business changed a lot.

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:14.318
So I wanna take some time to look into

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:16.901
all three of these revolutions:

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:19.995
The Industrial Revolution,

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:23.791
The Revolution in Transportation
and Communication,

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.159
and just the broader Market Revolution.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.067
So I know this is a subset of
itself, but I'll get to that.

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:32.508
And in this video I wanna
start out by talking

00:01:32.508 --> 00:01:35.194
about The Industrial Revolution.

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:38.083
OK, so what was The Industrial Revolution?

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.035
This was, broadly speaking,

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:43.202
a revolution in the kinds of machinery

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.492
that people used to make finished goods.

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:54.435
Now, if you think about the early republic

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.686
in the United States you often think

00:01:57.686 --> 00:02:00.269
of kind of an agrarian society;

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:04.684
and that was how Thomas Jefferson,

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.247
the author of The
Declaration of Independence,

00:02:07.247 --> 00:02:09.769
really imagined the United States,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.781
as a nation of small farmers.

00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:15.585
But Thomas Jefferson
didn't necessarily see

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:19.865
all of these revolutions
in industry coming.

00:02:19.865 --> 00:02:21.986
He couldn't anticipate that;

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:24.819
and so, in the 1790s, early 1800s,

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:30.533
a bunch of new inventions
came to the United States

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.357
that completely revolutionized
how things were made.

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:36.718
So in this time period the United States

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:39.566
kinda slowly begins its transformation

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.066
from being a nation of farmers

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:46.641
to a nation of people
who worked for wages,

00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:49.679
by the hour,

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.402
and then used the money that they made

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:56.569
from that hourly labor to buy
the things that they need.

00:02:57.568 --> 00:02:59.530
So how did this happen?

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.697
One event that historians often
point to is the introduction

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:08.948
of the textile mill to the United States.

00:03:08.948 --> 00:03:13.017
So this fellow here, his
name is Samuel Slater,

00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:16.515
and Samuel Slater was an Englishman

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:19.023
who worked in a textile mill.

00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:22.789
And remember that the United Kingdom was

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:27.376
the world's capital of textile
production in this time.

00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:30.511
And they were so jealous of their position

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:33.563
as the world's leading textile producer

00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:35.963
that they even made it illegal

00:03:35.963 --> 00:03:39.213
to export the plans for a textile mill.

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:44.139
Samuel Slater decided that
even if it was illegal

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.500
to export actual plans,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.972
it wasn't necessarily
illegal to export his brain,

00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:53.055
so he decided to memorize

00:03:56.296 --> 00:03:58.879
how these textile looms worked;

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.123
and this is powered by a water wheel.

00:04:04.183 --> 00:04:07.266
And then he actually got in disguise,

00:04:08.902 --> 00:04:12.766
put himself on a ship,
and came to Rhode Island

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:14.849
to set up a textile mill.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.107
In fact, people were so
angry that he did this that

00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:24.967
in his home town he's actually
known as Slater the Traitor.

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:26.753
So what was new about this?

00:04:26.753 --> 00:04:30.330
Well, I think the water-wheel aspect

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.173
is really one of the key innovations here.

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:36.256
So instead of being powered by humans

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:40.180
or perhaps being powered by animals,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.347
now American machinery can be
powered by an outside source:

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:50.193
so water or steam; and
that means that these mills

00:04:50.193 --> 00:04:52.797
and factories later are
going to kinda congregate

00:04:52.797 --> 00:04:56.534
around sources of power,
like rivers for example.

00:04:56.534 --> 00:04:59.545
So if you've ever wondered
why so many American cities

00:04:59.545 --> 00:05:01.297
are next to rivers, it's usually because

00:05:01.297 --> 00:05:04.591
they needed them to power mills.

00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.436
So starting in the 1790s,

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:10.524
and really into the early 19th Century,

00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:14.691
there's this slow transformation
toward factory labor.

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:18.251
And you can see in this
image here that a lot

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:21.351
of the people actually
laboring in these factories

00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:25.518
were women because young men
kind of had a pretty good path

00:05:26.608 --> 00:05:29.052
forward in life at this time period.

00:05:29.052 --> 00:05:31.815
They could be farmers, like their fathers;

00:05:31.815 --> 00:05:35.025
maybe they could learn a trade.

00:05:35.025 --> 00:05:37.786
But for young women
there wasn't necessarily

00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:40.304
a form of income outside the house,

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:43.054
and so a man named Charles Lowell

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:48.011
decided to set up a whole series

00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:51.836
of textile mills in what will be called

00:05:51.836 --> 00:05:53.283
Lowell, Massachusetts.

00:05:53.283 --> 00:05:55.621
It's just outside of Boston.

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:59.114
And then he primarily employed young women

00:05:59.114 --> 00:06:01.191
to work in these textile mills.

00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.874
Think partly because young women

00:06:03.874 --> 00:06:07.761
were associated with working with fabric;

00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:09.649
women frequently did the spinning

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:11.002
and the sewing in the household;

00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:13.810
but also because women
you could probably pay

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.977
a little bit less than young
men for the same kind of labor.

00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:25.067
So this is kind of a very slow revolution

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:26.984
toward individual work.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.893
Because as a nation of farmers,

00:06:34.184 --> 00:06:38.291
most people would have
worked in a family unit.

00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:41.221
And even some of the
very earliest factories

00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:44.397
in the United States
would hire family units.

00:06:44.397 --> 00:06:47.511
It was known as the Rhode Island System.

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.178
By this time, by Lowell's mills,

00:06:51.842 --> 00:06:56.009
he started hiring individual
workers for individual wages.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.997
And the working conditions
were pretty brutal.

00:07:00.997 --> 00:07:04.080
Most women at the Lowell mills worked

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:09.077
12-hour days with no air conditioning,

00:07:09.077 --> 00:07:11.735
remember, this is long before
there's air conditioning,

00:07:11.735 --> 00:07:13.230
for pretty low wages.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.134
I'd say probably about
three dollars a week.

00:07:17.134 --> 00:07:20.107
But despite the pretty harsh conditions,

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.399
for many of them this was
a really good opportunity

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.426
'cause this was the
first time in their lives

00:07:25.426 --> 00:07:28.967
they'd ever had any chance
to make money of their own,

00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:31.040
to be away from their families.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.432
It's kind of expected that
if you were a young woman

00:07:35.432 --> 00:07:39.745
in Massachusetts you wanted to
go work in the Lowell mills.

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:43.000
You could go there for a
few years of your life,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.667
make a little bit of money,

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:48.937
and then go back to your
hometown, meet someone,

00:07:48.937 --> 00:07:51.458
get married, start a family of your own.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:53.983
So if kinda makes work for women

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:56.400
outside the home respectable.

00:07:57.525 --> 00:08:00.136
And textile production
is going to continue

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:01.923
to ramp up in the United States.

00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:03.340
In the late 1840s

00:08:05.697 --> 00:08:07.530
a man named Elias Howe

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:12.246
invents a really excellent sewing machine.

00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:15.537
He's not the first man ever
to invent a sewing machine.

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.472
There were versions of
them stretching back

00:08:17.472 --> 00:08:20.119
to think even the 1750s,

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:22.479
but Howe's sewing machine brought together

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:25.162
a lot of different capacities that made it

00:08:25.162 --> 00:08:26.993
kinda the best sewing machine.

00:08:26.993 --> 00:08:31.489
And it will be even further
refined by Isaac Singer,

00:08:31.489 --> 00:08:34.177
who we associate today with
the Singer Sewing Machine.

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:37.010
And so these massive textile mills

00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:43.103
really become the backbone
of New England commerce.

00:08:44.592 --> 00:08:46.627
But, they never would have gotten started

00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:50.794
without another invention,
which was the cotton gin.

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:56.576
And the cotton gin was invented
by Eli Whitney in 1793.

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:01.124
And what's important about the cotton gin,

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:05.432
so here's the gin, and
basically it's kind of a box

00:09:05.432 --> 00:09:09.537
with some spikes on it
that allows you to take

00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:13.704
these balls of cotton and
separate them from the seeds.

00:09:14.784 --> 00:09:17.466
And separating cotton from the seeds

00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:20.883
was an extremely labor-intensive process.

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:25.795
If you've never held a ball of cotton,

00:09:25.795 --> 00:09:29.949
it's extremely sticky, so you
kinda have to wade through

00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:34.342
the little bits of cotton,
pull out these seeds.

00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:35.931
It takes forever.

00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:39.102
And so an average day's
work would not produce

00:09:39.102 --> 00:09:43.007
all that much cotton that
was ready for market.

00:09:43.007 --> 00:09:46.269
Well, Whitney completely
revolutionizes this

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:47.618
with the cotton gin.

00:09:47.618 --> 00:09:50.057
These little spikes help separate

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:52.702
the cotton seeds from the cotton ball,

00:09:52.702 --> 00:09:56.364
and revolutionizes how
much cotton can be produced

00:09:56.364 --> 00:09:58.769
by a single person in a single day.

00:09:58.769 --> 00:10:01.943
Whitney's cotton gin made it
possible for a single person

00:10:01.943 --> 00:10:06.456
to process 50 pounds of
cotton in a single day,

00:10:06.456 --> 00:10:09.511
which is just an order of magnitude more

00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.073
than they were able to do beforehand.

00:10:12.073 --> 00:10:13.703
This is really interesting 'cause it had

00:10:13.703 --> 00:10:17.036
kind of a massive human cost in the form

00:10:18.344 --> 00:10:22.208
of really bolstering the
institution of slavery

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:26.237
in the American South
because when farming cotton

00:10:26.237 --> 00:10:30.062
was so labor-intensive it
really wasn't very profitable;

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:32.299
and so the institution
of slavery was actually

00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:34.863
starting to die out a little bit.

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:37.857
Before the 1790s people were saying:

00:10:37.857 --> 00:10:42.039
"Eh, I don't know if it's
actually worth it to keep slaves."

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:44.194
So if it weren't for the cotton gin,

00:10:44.194 --> 00:10:46.678
the United States might
actually have outlawed slavery

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:50.845
considerably earlier than it
ended up doing in the 1860s.

00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:56.122
So it's interesting to
note that even though these

00:10:56.122 --> 00:10:59.942
inventions really changed the
fabric of American society,

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:01.937
allowed some people to earn money

00:11:01.937 --> 00:11:04.379
who had never been able
to earn money before,

00:11:04.379 --> 00:11:08.045
it also meant that the
institution of slavery

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:10.197
was really entrenched in the United States

00:11:10.197 --> 00:11:14.364
and would only continue
to expand until the 1860s.

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:18.288
So that's a little bit of a peak into
