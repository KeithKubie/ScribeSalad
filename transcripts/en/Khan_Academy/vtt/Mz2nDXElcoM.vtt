00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's say that I have
a ramp made of ice.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.180
Looks like maybe a wedge or
some type of an inclined plane

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.474
made of ice.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:10.390
And we'll make everything
of ice in this video

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.190
so that we have
negligible friction.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.400
So this right here is my ramp.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.560
It's made of ice.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.930
And this angle right over here,
let's just go with 30 degrees.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.850
And let's say on this
ramp made of ice,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.440
I have another block of ice.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.490
So this is a block of ice.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.520
It is a block of ice, it's
shiny like ice is shiny.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.230
And it has a mass
of 10 kilograms.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.030
And what I want to do
is think about what's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.810
going to happen to
this block of ice.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.042
So first of all, what are
the forces that we know

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:44.750
are acting on it?

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.070
Well if we're assuming
we're on Earth,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.460
and we will, and we're
near the surface,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.390
then there is the
force of gravity.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.050
There's the force of gravity
acting on this block of ice.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.960
And the force of
gravity is going

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.280
to be equal to-- it's going to
be in the downward direction,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.660
and its magnitude is going to
be the mass of the block of ice

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.450
times the gravitational
field times 9.8

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.260
meters per second squared.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.040
So it's going to be
98 newtons downward.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.860
So this is 98 newtons downward.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.220
I just took 10 kilograms.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.530
Let me write it out.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.050
So the force due
to gravity is going

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.410
to be equal to 10
kilograms times 9.8

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.810
meters per second
squared downward.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.140
This 9.8 meters
per second squared

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.480
downward, that is
the field vector

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.920
for the gravitational field
of the surface of the earth,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.590
I guess is one way
to think about it.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.430
Sometimes you'll
see the negative 9.8

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.880
meters per second squared.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.660
And then that negative is giving
you the direction implicitly

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.300
because the
convention is normally

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.440
that positive is upward
and negative is downward.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.580
We'll just go with
this right over here.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.370
So the magnitude of
this vector is 10 times

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.230
9.8, which is 98 kilogram
meters per second squared, which

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.920
is the same thing as newtons.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.580
So the magnitude
here is 98 newtons

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.580
and it is pointing downwards.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.610
Now what we want to do
is break this vector up

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.660
into the components
that are perpendicular

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.370
and parallel to the
surface of this ramp.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.740
So let's do that.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.970
So first, let's think
about perpendicular

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.920
to the surface of the ramp.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.550
So perpendicular to the
surface of the ramp.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.170
So this right over
here is a right angle.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.320
And we saw in the last
video, that whatever

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.530
angle this over here
is, that is also

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.120
going to be this
angle over here.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.340
So this angle over here is also
going to be a 30-degree angle.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.910
And we can use that
information to figure out

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.110
the magnitude of this orange
vector right over here.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.960
And remember, this orange
vector is the component

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.360
of the force of gravity that
is perpendicular to the plane.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.310
And then there's going to be
some component that is parallel

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.020
to the plane.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.430
I'll draw that in yellow.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.620
Some component of
the force of gravity

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.490
that is parallel to the plane.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.270
And clearly this
is a right angle,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.740
because this is
perpendicular to the plane.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.582
And this is parallel
to the plane.

00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:07.040
If it's perpendicular
to the plane,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.520
it's also perpendicular to
this vector right over here.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.180
So we can use some
basic trigonometry,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.013
like we did in the last
video, to figure out

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:17.030
the magnitude of this orange
and this yellow vector

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.200
right over here.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.610
This orange vector's
magnitude over the hypotenuse

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.690
is going to be equal
to the cosine of 30.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.640
Or you could say that
the magnitude of this

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:36.670
is 98 times the cosine
of 30 degrees newtons.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.370
98 times the cosine
of 30 degrees newtons.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.860
And if you want the whole
vector, it's in this direction.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.060
And the direction going into
the surface of the plane.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.902
And, based on the
simple trigonometry--

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:49.860
and we go into this in
a little bit more detail

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.510
in the last video-- we
know that the component

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.220
of this vector that is parallel
to the surface of this plane

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.230
is going to be 98
sine of 30 degrees.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.220
Sine of 30 degrees.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.840
Sine of 30 degrees.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.840
And this comes straight
out of this magnitude,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.830
which is opposite to the
angle over the hypotenuse.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.363
Opposite over hypotenuse is
equal to sine of an angle.

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:18.779
And we did all the
work over here.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.195
I don't want to
keep repeating it.

00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:22.820
But I always want to emphasize
that this is coming straight

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.970
out of basic
trigonometry, straight out

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.060
of basic trigonometry.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.470
So once you do that, we know
the different components.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.730
We can calculate them.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.680
Cosine of 30 degrees is
square root of 3 over 2.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.234
Sine of 30 degrees is 1/2.

00:04:38.234 --> 00:04:40.150
That's just one of those
things that you learn

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.400
and you can derive it yourself
using 30-60-90 triangles,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.050
or actually even
equilateral triangles.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.180
Or you could use a calculator.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.430
But it's also one
of those things

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.304
that you memorize when
you take trigonometry.

00:04:49.304 --> 00:04:53.260
So no kind of magical
trick I did here.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.870
And so if you evaluate this,
98 times the square root

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.339
of 3 over 2 newtons,
tells us that--

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.130
let me write it in that
same orange color--

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.970
the force, the
component of gravity

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.390
that is perpendicular
to the plane.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.710
And this kind of implicitly
gives us this direction,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.890
it's perpendicular to the plane.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.330
But the force
component of gravity

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.705
that's perpendicular
to the plane

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:16.006
is equal to 98 times
square root of 3 over 2.

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:18.760
98 divided by 2 is 49.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.570
So it's equal to 49 times
the square root of 3 newtons.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.730
And its direction is into
the surface of the plane,

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.050
or downward or, let me just
write, into surface of plane.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.670
Surface of the plane, or
the surface of the ramp.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.227
And it's in this
direction over here.

00:05:38.227 --> 00:05:40.060
And I have to do this
because it's a vector.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.440
I have to tell you what
direction it's going in.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.809
And the component of the force
of gravity that is parallel.

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:48.100
The component of the force
of gravity that is parallel,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.430
I drew it down here, but I
could shift it up over here.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.520
It's the same exact vector.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.460
The component of
gravity that is parallel

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.090
to the surface of the plane
is 98 times sine of 30.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.800
That's 98 times 1/2,
which is 49 newtons.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.230
And it's going in that
direction, or parallel

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.360
to the surface of the plane.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.260
Parallel, I always have
trouble spelling parallel.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.840
Parallel to-- don't even
know if I spelled it right--

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.680
surface of the plane.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.650
So what's going to happen here?

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.250
Well, if these were the
only forces acting on it.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.320
So if we had a net force
going into the surface

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.700
of the plane of 49 square
roots of 3 newtons.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.100
If this was the only force
acting in this dimension

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.510
or in the dimension that is
perpendicular to the surface

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.320
of the plane, what would happen?

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.630
Well, then the block
would just accelerate.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.190
At least just due to this force
it would accelerate downward.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.240
It would accelerate into
the surface of the plane.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.120
But we know it's not
going to accelerate.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.280
We know that there's this
big wedge of ice here

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.530
that is keeping it from
accelerating in that direction.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.415
So at least in this dimension,
there will be no acceleration.

00:06:57.415 --> 00:06:58.790
When I talk about
this dimension,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.280
I'm talking about in
the direction that

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.570
is perpendicular to the
surface of the plane.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.380
There will be no acceleration
because this wedge is here.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.030
So the wedge is exerting a force
that completely counteracts

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.070
the force, the perpendicular
component of gravity.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.880
And that force.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.130
You might guess
what it's called.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.400
So the wedge is
exerting a force, just

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.345
like that, that's going
to be 98 newtons upward.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.240
The wedge is going to
be exerting a force that

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.450
is 49 square roots of 3,
because this right here

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.900
is 49 square roots
of 3 newtons into.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.580
And so this is 49 square
roots of 3 newtons out

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:48.390
of the surface,
out of the surface.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.750
And this is the normal force.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.660
It is the force
perpendicular to the surface

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.310
that essentially, you could
kind of view as the contact

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:01.260
force that the, in this case,
that the surface is exerting

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.625
to keep this block of ice from
accelerating in that direction.

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:07.500
We're not talking about
accelerating straight

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.240
towards the center of the earth.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.365
We're talking about
accelerating in that direction.

00:08:10.365 --> 00:08:13.950
We broke up the force into kind
of the perpendicular direction

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.750
and the parallel direction.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.580
So you have this
counteracting normal force.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:24.620
And that's why you don't
have the block plummeting

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.940
or accelerating into the plane.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.130
Now what other
forces do we have?

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.909
Well, we have the force that's
parallel to the surface.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.840
And if we assume that
there's no friction--

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.909
and I can assume that there's
no friction in this video

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.280
because we are assuming
that it is ice on ice-- what

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.220
is going to happen?

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.900
There's no counteracting
force to this 49 newtons.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.560
49 newtons parallel downwards,
I should say parallel downwards,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.280
to the surface of the plane.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.910
So what's going to happen?

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.280
Well, it's going to
accelerate in that direction.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.060
You have force is equal to
mass times acceleration.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.640
Force is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.990
Or you divide both sides by
mass, you get force over mass

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.820
is equal to acceleration.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.310
Over here, our
force is 49 newtons

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.030
in that direction,
parallel downwards

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.920
to the surface of the plane.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.050
And so if you
divide both by mass,

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.460
if you divide both
of these by mass.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.150
So that's the same thing as
dividing it by 10 kilograms,

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:33.676
dividing by 10 kilograms, that
will give you acceleration.

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:39.130
That will give you
our acceleration.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.100
So acceleration is
49 newtons divided

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.960
by 10 kilograms
in that direction,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.540
in this direction
right over there.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.720
And 49 divided by
10 is 4.9, and then

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.900
newtons divided by kilograms
is meters per second squared.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.890
So then you get
your acceleration.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:02.810
Your acceleration is going to be
4.9 meters per second squared.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.760
And maybe I could say parallel.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.790
That's two bars.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.560
Or maybe I'll write parallel.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:16.845
Parallel downwards
to the surface.

00:10:16.845 --> 00:10:18.640
Now I'm going to
leave you there,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.790
and I'll let you think
about another thing

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.850
that I'll address in
the next video is,

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.980
what if you had this
just standing still?

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.890
If it wasn't
accelerating downwards,

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.120
if it wasn't accelerating
and sliding down,

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.980
what would be the
force that's keeping it

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.700
in a kind of a static state?

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.530
We'll think about that
in the next video.
