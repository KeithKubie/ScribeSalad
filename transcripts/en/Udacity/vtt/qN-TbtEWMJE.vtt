00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now one other thing about the business model canvas in general,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
now that we've talked about customer segments is understanding

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that sometimes you'll have multiple customers, multiple segments,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and it's kind of interesting to take a look at Google as an example.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So, let's just take a look at Google search.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Let's just think about who is the customer for Google search?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's anyone searching on a web or mobile and the product we have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is a free search bar or free mobile app and what are the key resources?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, they need software and software developers and installed user base

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but the key idea is this product is free and if you think about the cost directory for this,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
it requires massive data centers and software development

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and key activities or data center or speed but the key idea is the red new model is free

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but Google and Google search is one of the most profitable businesses on the face of the earth.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Well, how can Google do that?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, think about it what we've just been doing is Google has been acquiring users,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but someone else if paying for this product

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and that someone else is a different customer segment called advertisers.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So we had users here but we now have payers here.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, what's really interesting is for every customer segment, we have a value proposition.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We had a free search bar for the users but for the advertisers,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
we have a completely different product.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We have Google AdWords and our customer relationships are different.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
For users, it was kind of an automated process.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You just basically went to the Google website or you downloaded a Google toolbar.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But for pairs, it might be automated but they also have telemarketing

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and direct sales to go after big advertisers but they're distribution channel,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in addition to the automated is also self-service and direct sales,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but the key thing to note is that not only do they have different segments

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and different value props and different customer relationships,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
more importantly, they have a different red new model.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's a big idea--multiple customer segments require multiple value props,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
multiple customer relationships, sometimes different channels but always different revenue models.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000
These are the payers. So, Google Search is what we call a two-sided market.

00:02:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
There are users and they are payers.
