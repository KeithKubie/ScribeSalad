Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich this is radio lab, that podcast. So today on the podcast we are going to continue the conversation that we started in our last hour. You know, animal minds like what can you share with say your dog, like really truly share, right. In this 10 minutes we're going to explore a kind of sharing that we didn't get to in our last hour. One that's arguably a deeper kind of sharing comes to us from reporter Ben Calhoun and grew out of a conversation that he had with a well,

Speaker 2:          00:31          just listen. Okay. You can start anytime you want. All right. Thank you very much, sir. You're ready to go. Are you? Yeah, absolutely. Jerry, you ready? Yes, sir. Whenever you are, let's just start with the having you introduce yourself. I'm Jerry stones. I'm the facilities director at the Gladys porter zoo. That's where Jerry is now, but he told me this story. He was working at the Henry Doorly zoo in Nebraska and he was working with this orangutan named Fu Manchu. I call him food that everybody that had loved that old boy referred to him as food or fully wait, let me just set the scene. So we're in the Nebraska Zoo. We were in Nebraska. Is this in Omaha? Oh, in Omaha. Okay. In the Omaha Zoo. It's fall 1967 late 66 or 67 kind of coal. The leaves have fallen off the trees. Jerry stones is just going about his daily business. What is his daily business and being in charge of the zookeepers. So he's kind of the top dog among the crew of zookeepers there. And he's up at the office and then all of a sudden here comes a couple of the keepers running up over this hill is Jerry, Jerry, Jerry. The orangutans are into trees by the elephant building.

Speaker 3:          01:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:41          the line went dead for a minute cause I couldn't figure out what the blazers they were talking about. And I said, wait, what? And they said the rangs in the trees by the elephant building. So the orangutans are no longer in their assigned area. Yes. So I took off with them and we ran down there and sure enough there was this grove of elm trees on this hill overlooking the elephant building and an air up in the top of these trees were all their Rangataua and, Oh God. Yeah. And there was a Fu Manchu and his female Tondo Leo and an old female named Sophia, big heavyset girl and Toba, young female and dentists' a young male. And they were all up in the trees. Five of them. I have a, I'm up there, you know, look like these huge red clumps of grapes

Speaker 2:          02:23          at this point. Jerry's a young guy, so he went Tarzan on them. Back in those days, I didn't think anything about going to the top of a tree and grabbing an arranged by the hand and leading him back out of the tree, even though I, couple of them had already bit me. So he gets them all back in the exhibit and they didn't know how the orangutans had gotten out. No question. And everybody and not listening. I have a tendency to do that, you know? Anyway, I would get them down to the building. We put them away in the Cajun and we go out to see what was going on in the exhibit itself. There's most on each side of exhibit, you know, like a zoom out. You've got the exhibit and then you've got where people look from and in between there's a mode, right?

Speaker 2:          03:05          Well, down at the bottom of this moat, there was a door to a furnace room, big metal door that had just a regular lock and everything on it. It was always shut, kept locked all the time that door was open. What had happened, the rings had climbed down in a moat, went into the furnished room, which was in the basement, up a ladder, did a janitor's closet on the first floor. One, two, three, four, five. They all emerged from this janitor's closet and then just pushed the big glass doors open, went out into the park. I figured somebody had not locked the door shut. Oh right. Okay. So Jerry stones gathers his zookeeper's around and he says basically when we needed to be more careful, somebody evidently went out in that moat to do something. And when they came back in, they did not lock the door a mistake and it should not happen again.

Speaker 2:          03:57          And everyone at buddy bowed that this would not happen again. And it didn't, it didn't happen again for about a week. A few days go by, I can't remember where I was at. And again, the orangutans during the trees by the elephant building and Jerry, we, we, the door was locked. Jerry, we didn't do it. We didn't do it, you know, not ana. So they take them all back into the building. Same thing. I get there, go down to mote. That furnace room door is open again. I was convinced that these people were not sharp enough to shop, tie their shoes, you know, and, and, and uh, and they said, but Jerry, we don't go down there. Well, somebody screwed up. So I'm discussing with these capers, what's going to happen to them in their short lives. Now, I swear to God, I said, Dude, look, next time this happens, somebody being fired few days later, somebody runs up to you on Jerry, come, you got to come see this. I'll go, no, not now. They ran out into the zoo and they went to this hill that's near the exhibit,

Speaker 4:          04:55          peaked over the top of it. Commando style down at the bottom of the moat. Fu Manchu was messing with that furnace room door. What was he doing? They couldn't exactly see what he was doing because of how far away they work. But he was fiddling with the lock and he's fiddling and he's fiddling and then

Speaker 2:          05:15          the door, the dam is popped open and we went bowling down the hill and we caught him before he could do any damage. You mean the rang hands seem to be opening the door? Yes. You know, I realized that it wasn't their fault and you know, I hate the crow that I had to eat and uh, we still didn't know exactly how I did it. And we went out there and we looked around and there was few little sticks and stuff laying around. We thought, well, he must be using this stuff to pry the door open or do something, you know? So Jerry figured, easy solution, clean the exhibit every day. I said, look, from now on we need to go out in this yard everyday before we put the rangs out and searched. That plays over and again, you know, make sure there's no sticks or anything out there.

Speaker 2:          05:58          I don't know how he did it, but he did it. You know, we knew what the problem was and we knew how to deal with it. Went along like that for a week or two. And then here come to keepers, Jerry, the orangutans are in, into trays by the elephant, Billy. And we checked it. Jerry, we did everything we were supposed to do here. You know, they're, they're bound and determined. They didn't do anything wrong. Should we sit down? So they had been searching this exhibit every day and make sure that he didn't hear was no, we walked that exhibit. We cleaned them all, we did everything. There was no sticks, no anything. We could find that he used the pride, that darn door open. No tools, no tools, no nothing. Wait, how do we know? Like how can this be? How can this be? How

Speaker 1:          06:36          can this be? So he's ushering Fu Manchu through the building. They've got all the orangutans, they're moving them and all of a sudden he sees in the corner of Fu Manchu,

Speaker 2:          06:48          I saw this little blink of light, just a little glimmer of light, like a silver filling or something. Yeah, a little shiny thing. It's the corner of his mouth. He walks over, pulls down through Manchus lip and in there, low and behold there was a piece of wire,

Speaker 5:          07:05          uh,

Speaker 2:          07:08          about four inches long that he had bent into a horseshoe to fit in inside of his lower lip and around his gum. And he's had it there for so long that it was just polished, shiny, suggesting what this animal has been secreting his actual key all this time. Yeah. All this stuff that we're picking up and hauling away, it keeps him from opening the door was of no use because he was carrying his own key with him all the time. What he had done was stick the wire into the space between the door jam and the door, wrap it around the latch and pull it back. It's like the credit card trick. You know, nobody taught him this. Nobody ever did anything like that around him. Not only did he make the tool, but he put it in a place where I couldn't find it. He was smart enough to know that if I found it, I'd take it away from him. The locksmith union of the United States gave him an honorary membership and the zoo in Omaha had that hanging on their wall for years. I don't know if they still have it or not.

Speaker 5:          08:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:13          well, this has been very interesting. So really great story. [inaudible] very nice. But I don't quite understand like what, what exactly was, why are you telling it to me? What is the reason for this? Well, you know, there's a lot of stuff,

Speaker 1:          08:25          stories of orangutans using tools, right? Yeah. But even though this is a funny story, there's actually a really serious question at the heart of it about deception. Why? What's so important about, well, deception is special. It requires that the deceiver get into the mind of the person who they're deceiving and nobody has been able to prove that animals can actually do this. No. A human beings thoughts intimately enough, get inside their heads and you know, consciously deceived them.

Speaker 5:          09:00          So

Speaker 1:          09:02          I took the Fu Manchu story

Speaker 5:          09:05          two

Speaker 1:          09:06          a scientist, a primatologist named Rob Shoemaker.

Speaker 2:          09:09          Hello, Rob Shoemaker.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Hey Rob, it's been, am I catching you at the great ape trust in Iowa?

Speaker 2:          09:15          And I studied the behavior and cognition of Orangutans

Speaker 1:          09:19          and he says, the food man choose story doesn't prove that animals are capable of doing this.

Speaker 2:          09:25          It in this particular case, I can't prove it one way or another. There's always a question of whether or not it was really happening,

Speaker 1:          09:33          but when I really pushed it, I'm just wondering like personally, do you believe in his case that it was he said yes.

Speaker 2:          09:41          Do you know if, if I had to just give, um, an opinion about this,

Speaker 1:          09:45          that deep down,

Speaker 2:          09:47          I have no doubt at all. I 100% believe it was deception keeping a tool concealed over a whole number of days and timing his escapes so that no one was around to see him. I think the evidence is just absolutely compelling to suggest that he who met you was able to deceive and was deceiving. And if someone really has that much trouble believing yet, I think then maybe they add a question. Is it because I don't believe what I'm hearing or I don't want to believe it because it's an orangutan. If they don't want to believe it because it's an orangutan, that's no excuse. It was like who tardy? I just, I couldn't figure it out. I mean, when you think you're so smart that all the other animals are way below you and all of a sudden you find this animal that does these sort of things and you know people that couldn't open the door with the key right there. You, you, you know you have to be in awe.

Speaker 5:          10:45          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          10:46          I've been around a lot of other orangutans in my almost 45 years in this business, and a next time you go to a zoo and you're around one, you just look at their face and you look at their eyes and you can see in there there's this, these wheels turning, trying to figure you out.

Speaker 5:          11:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          11:17          then Calhoun is a reporter here in New York City. Thank you to him and thanks to the people who make radio lab possible. They are, well, they're the national science foundation and they are the Sloan Foundation. Yup. I'm Jad. I boom, Rod, I'm rubber coach. Thanks for listening.
