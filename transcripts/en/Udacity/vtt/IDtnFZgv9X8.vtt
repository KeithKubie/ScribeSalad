00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.280
You've possibly in the past used remote procedure calls.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.950
This is an example of procedural middleware. The idea here is that,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.470
your piece of a system needs some computation that's available on another piece,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.230
and you'd like to make it look,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.170
in your code, as if you're just making some kind of function call. When really,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.420
the function that's doing the comp, computing is on another machine.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.580
Remote procedure calling, technology hasn't been available since the 1980s.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.050
It is typically synchronous, okay, that is you block until you get

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.362
the procedure call comes back. However, it's operating system dependent. And

00:00:39.362 --> 00:00:44.484
there have been technologies developed by SUN and, NDR, for dealing

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:50.080
with the data representations and, and the coordination of the call and return.
