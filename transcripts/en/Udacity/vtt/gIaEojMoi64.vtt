00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.980
So using just the information you had in the

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.380
pedigree here, you should have been able to figure out

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.460
that unaffected parents have affected children, and that the trait

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.670
seems to skip generations. Now let's take a look at

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.710
each of these over here. We see that unaffected parents,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.660
look at Kate's parents: she has an unaffected mom and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.140
an unaffected dad, but she's affected. And then look at

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.620
her dad's sister, who was affected, right, her paternal aunt.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.040
Both of her parents were unaffected. This appears to be

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.060
true in our pedigree here. The second option is that

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.660
affected parents have affected children. In no circumstance do we

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.900
see, although we only have one to look at, Kate's

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.560
maternal grandfather, where he's affected but his daughter is not

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.350
affected. This would be Kate's mom. So let's go to

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.900
the third and fourth options we could have chosen here.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.010
And we look at the trait itself, the shaded box,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.780
the shaded square here. And we see that it

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.940
did not get passed down to the daughter, and then

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.970
did get passed down to the granddaughter. This fully

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.930
skipped a generation. So this is obvious here that the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.670
trait does skip generations. This particular pattern of inheritance

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.240
Could seem a little confusing at first. Especially if yo're

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.280
new to this. But, understanding how a genome is transmitted

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.760
from parents to chilrens, is going to help us answer many,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.710
many more questions about other traits in coming lessons.
