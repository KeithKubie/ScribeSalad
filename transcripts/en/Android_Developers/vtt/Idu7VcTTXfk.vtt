ANDREW SUTHERLAND:
In high school,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.210
I had a bunch of
vocabulary homework.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.850
And one night, I was
studying with my dad,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.700
and I realized I could
build a program that

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.260
would do the same thing that my
dad was doing but much faster.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.220
I built it, and for the
next test I got 100%.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.520
I kept working on it and
eventually released it.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.450
ARUN SAIGAL: Quizlet
is a platform

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.434
for people to study
anything and everything.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:32.850
ANDREW SUTHERLAND:
Whether they're

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.210
an eight grader learning "Romeo
and Juliet," whether they're

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.550
in biology class, they
can input the curriculum

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.790
they want on Quizlet.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.190
And we give flash cards,
and different games,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.150
and tools that help keep
track of what you know

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.290
and don't know.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.630
From the first month,
we had about 500 users,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.590
and now we have 22
million uniques a month.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.800
We're now reaching about a
quarter of all US high school

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.960
students every month.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.490
ARUN SAIGAL: Low and behold,
Google Play for Education

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.950
comes about.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.560
And now we're one of the
first apps that teachers

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.768
go to when they think, I
want to use some study tools

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:03.610
in my classroom.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.151
ANDREW SUTHERLAND: Our business
has been enabled by this base

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:09.089
layer that Google has set up,
and that's really exciting.

00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:10.880
SOPHIA BENDER-KONING:
The Google Play Store

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.310
lets you iterate really quickly
with getting updates out

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.810
to users.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.290
There's a beta program so we
can get feedback, find crashes,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.210
and iterate on our product
before launching it

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.980
to everyone.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.813
ANDREW SUTHERLAND:
Google Play for Education

00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.420
is really exciting
to us, because it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.070
a core distribution platform
that students, and especially

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.110
teachers, can easily get Quizlet
onto lots of kids' devices

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.849
at the same time.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.265
ARUN SAIGAL: It''ll be so cool
to see how Quizlet improves

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.230
and especially how Quizlet's
going to improve on Android

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.830
devices.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.455
SOPHIA BENDER-KONING:
Lots of teenagers

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:45.250
say that before
they used Quizlet,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.650
they just couldn't
figure out how to study.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.740
And this was the
thing that tipped them

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.930
into being able to get a
really great education.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.580
