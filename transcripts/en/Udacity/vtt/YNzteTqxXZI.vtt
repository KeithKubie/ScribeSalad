00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:06.081
This graph looks very strikingly like an exponential distribution.

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:09.570
Now, what does that mean about our process?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.870
Well exponential processes are very frequently used in

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.640
the industry to model rare events.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.650
For example, they're used to model the distribution of everything from

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.410
heart attacks in a given city to traffic accidents to the arrival of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.900
requests in a file system.
