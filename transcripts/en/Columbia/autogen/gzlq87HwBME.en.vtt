this challenge I'll focus in on the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940
this challenge I'll focus in on the
 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.400
this challenge I'll focus in on the
crisis in sub-saharan Africa as as the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
crisis in sub-saharan Africa as as the
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.070
crisis in sub-saharan Africa as as the
central challenge of course we're

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
central challenge of course we're
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.750
central challenge of course we're
motivated by the children and the fact

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
motivated by the children and the fact
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.890
motivated by the children and the fact
that Africa loses four million or so

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
that Africa loses four million or so
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.160
that Africa loses four million or so
children under the 85 every year which

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170
children under the 85 every year which
 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.100
children under the 85 every year which
is a shocking an avoidable tragedy

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110
is a shocking an avoidable tragedy
 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.350
is a shocking an avoidable tragedy
because almost all of the desk of young

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
because almost all of the desk of young
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.340
because almost all of the desk of young
children our avoidable at low costs

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350
children our avoidable at low costs
 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.199
children our avoidable at low costs
using proven standard young preventive

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209
using proven standard young preventive
 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.229
using proven standard young preventive
and curative approaches and so the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239
and curative approaches and so the
 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.650
and curative approaches and so the
challenge is to understand why is that

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660
challenge is to understand why is that
 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.199
challenge is to understand why is that
these known methods of saving life and

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209
these known methods of saving life and
 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.479
these known methods of saving life and
avoiding death are not undertaken and

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489
avoiding death are not undertaken and
 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.130
avoiding death are not undertaken and
what can be done of and essentially

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140
what can be done of and essentially
 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.020
what can be done of and essentially
the core of all of this is extreme

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030
the core of all of this is extreme
 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.830
the core of all of this is extreme
poverty and so the question is how to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
poverty and so the question is how to
 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.650
poverty and so the question is how to
save lives and sail up basic health

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660
save lives and sail up basic health
 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.180
save lives and sail up basic health
systems and other aspects of basic life

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190
systems and other aspects of basic life
 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.449

sure okay thank you any kind of approach

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840
sure okay thank you any kind of approach
 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.710
sure okay thank you any kind of approach
to this challenge of health disparities

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720
to this challenge of health disparities
 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.009

the way to understand systematically

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270
the way to understand systematically
 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.140
the way to understand systematically
what it is that we're confronting when

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150
what it is that we're confronting when
 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.950

00:29:58.670 --> 00:29:58.680
we're trying to design a system together
 

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.710
we're trying to design a system together
with the community and that means lots

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720
with the community and that means lots
 

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.620
with the community and that means lots
of iterations along the way home you

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:03.630
of iterations along the way home you
 

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.390
of iterations along the way home you
can't have community house workers doing

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:05.400
can't have community house workers doing
 

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.000

this you can't assume that we need to

thing so you need lots of feedback

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.010
