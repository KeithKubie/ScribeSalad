00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.990
So we have a piecewise linear function
right over here for different intervals

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.589
of x.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.760
g of x is defined by a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.160
a line or the line changes depending
what interval of x we're actually in.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.090
And so let's think about its domain, and
then we'll think about its range.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.300
So the domain of this, this is a review.
The domain is the set of all inputs for which

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.810
this function is defined, and our input
variable here

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
is x. This is a set of all x values for which
this function is defined.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.600
And we see here. Anything, anything negative 6 or
lower, our function isn't defined. If it, if

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.010
x is negative 6 or or lower than that. I don't --
it doesn't, it doesn't fall into one of

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.270
these three intervals.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.010
So there is no definition for it. 
It doesn't say hey do this in all other

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.579
cases for x. It is just saying, look, if

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.620
x falls into one of these three
conditions, apply this.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.309
And if x doesn't fall into one of those three
conditions, well this function g is just

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.410
not defined.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.570
So, to fall into one of these three, you have
to be at least greater than negative 6.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.440
So this part right over here, the low end
of our domain is defined right over there,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.040
so we say, we could say, negative 6

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.290
is less than x and I'm leaving --
so let's write it here.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.979
All real numbers -- actually
let me write this way

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.119
x, I could write it more math-y. I could say

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.460
x is a member of the real numbers

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.090
such that, such that negative 6

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.909
is less than x. Negative 6 is less than x

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.439
and I also think about the upper bound.
So as x goes, I just wanna make sure

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.540
that we fill in all the gaps between

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.570
x being a greater than negative 6 and
x is less than or equal to 6.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.570
So let's see. As we go up to and including negative 3,
we're in this clause. As soon as we

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.909
cross negative 3,

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.200
we fall into this clause up to 4, but
as soon as we get 4, we're in this clause

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.649
up to and including 6. So

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.130
x at the high end is said to be less than
or equal to 6,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.469
less then or equal to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.740
6. Now another way to say this and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.759
kind of less math-y notation is x, x

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.280
can be any

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.210
real number, any the real number

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.590
such that, such

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.410
that negative 6 is less than x

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.290
is less than or equal to 6. These two
statements are

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.060
equivalent. So now let's think about
the range of this function.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.660
Let's think about the range, and the range
is, this is the set of all

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.060
inputs , oh sorry, this is the set of all
outputs that

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.740
this function can take on, or all the
values that this function can take on.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.390
And to do that, let's just think about
as x goes, but

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.980
x varies or x can be any values in this
interval.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.450
What are the different values
that g of x could take on?

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.520
Let's think about that. g of x is going
to be between what and what?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.840
g of x is going to be between what and
what?

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.740
g of x is going to be between what and
what?

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.320
And it might actually, this might be some
equal signs there but I'm gonna worry about

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.130
that in a second.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.300
So when does this thing hit its low
point? o this thing hits, hits its low point

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.250
when x is as small as possible. An x is
going to be as small as possible

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.550
when x is approaching negative 6. So if

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.180
x were equal to negative 6, it can't
equal negative 6 herer but if x is

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.900
equal to negative 6, then this thing over here
would be equal to negative 6

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.500
plus 7, would be, would be 1.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.420
So if x is greater than negative 6,  g of x

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.800
is going to be greater than 1, or another way
to think about it is if negative 6 is less than x,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.989
then 1 is going to be less than g of x.

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.630
And the reason I said that is if I put negative 6
into this, negative 6 plus 7

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.850
is equal to 1. Now this gonna hit a
high end when it as large as possible.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.400
The largest value in this interval that
we can take on

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.799
is x being equal to negative 3.
So when x is equal to negative 3,

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.410
negative 3 plus 7 is equal to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.120
4, positive 4. And it can actually take on
that value because this is less than or

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.930
equal to, so we can actually take on
x equals negative 3

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.709
in which case g of x actually
will take on positive 4.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.150
So, let' do that for each of these. 
Now here we have 1

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.200
minus x, so this is going to take on
its smallest value when x is as large as possible.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.150
So the largest value x can approach for,
it can't quite take on for, but it's going

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.200
to approach for.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.430
So if x, let's see, if we said x was 4,
although that's not this clause here,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.220
1 minus x, 1 minus 4 is negative 3.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.490
So as long as x is less than 4,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.160
then negative 3 is going to be less than

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.740
g of x. I wanna make sure that makes sense
to you because it can be little bit confusing

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.110
because this takes on its minimum value when x

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.950
is approaching, or it's
approaching its minimum value

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.700
when x is approaching its, when x is
approaching its maximum because

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.630
we're subtracting it.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.190
So if you take the upper end, even though
this doesn't actually include

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.290
4, but as we approach for, we could say, OK, 1 negative 4

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.890
is negative 3 so that's, so g of x
is always going to be

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.230
greater than that, as well it's going to be
going to be a less than.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.410
Well what happens as we approach x being

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.570
equal to negative 3? So, 1 minus

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.200
negative 3 is going to be positive

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.780
4. So this is going to be positive
4 right over here.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.080
And these are both less than, not less
than or equal to

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.810
because these are both less than right
over here. And now let's think about this

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.840
right over here. So

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.170
2x minus 11 is gonna hit its maximum value
when x is as large as possible.

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.270
So its maximum value's going to be hit
when x is equal to 6

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.240
So 2 times 6 is 12, minus 11.
Well that's going to be

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.490
1. So its maximum value's going to be 1.
It's actually going to be able to hit

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.770
because x can be equal to 6.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.520
Its minimum value is going to be when x
is equal to 4, and actually can be equal to

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.350
4. We have this

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.140
less than or equal sign right over there.
So 2 times 4

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:15.000
is 8, minus 11 is negative 3. So, g of x in this case
can get as low as negative 3 when x is equal to 4.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.700
So now let's think about all of, all of the
values that g of x can take on.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.610
So we could say,

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.720
we could write this a bunch of ways,
we could write g of x

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.010
is going to be a member of the real
numbers

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.050
such that -- let's see. What's the lowest
value g of x can take on? g of

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.000
x can get as low as negative 3.
It can even be equal to negative 3.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.480
This one just has been greater the
negative 3, but here can be

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.540
greater than or equal to negative 3. 
So negative 3

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.900
is less than or equal to g of x, and it
can get as high

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.010
as, it can get as high as

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.130
Let's see. It's defined all the way to 
1 and then --

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.260
or I shouldn't say it is defined all the way to 1.
It can take on values up to 1

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.760
but it can also take on values beyond 1.
It can take on values all the way up to

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.790
including 4

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.210
over here. So it can take on values up to

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.010
and including 4. So g of x is a member
real numbers such that

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.300
negative 3 is less than or equal to g of x
is less than or

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.660
equal to 4. So the set of all values
that g of x can take on

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.750
between, including and including negative 3

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.120
and positive 4.
