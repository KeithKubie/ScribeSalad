00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The answer is this one, and now, I'm not going to go through all of these other four cases.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'll leave that to you to show that in each of these other four cases, the total work done

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
when you really include everything--gravity, pushing etc., really must be nonzero

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because in each of these, I said, happened at constant speed.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Here, when the object falls, well, that's clearly not constant speed.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We know it accelerates. Now, we're getting somewhere.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This case is so special out of these five because the motion is changing in a very specific way.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
When we keep track of the total work which I'll abbreviate with a little T down here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we find that it causes the object's kinetic energy to change which I will label like this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is so important that I'm going to write it. Work causes changes in kinetic energy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, we don't know what kinetic energy is quite yet.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Stay tuned one second but this statement is known as the work energy theory and it's vital to physics.

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, let's talk about what this whole energy nonsense is.
