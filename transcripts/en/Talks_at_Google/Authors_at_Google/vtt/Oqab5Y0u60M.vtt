&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Hello everyone and thank you
for joining us today. My name is Steve Grove

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.710
and I'm the head of News and Politics at YouTube
and we're very lucky today have Evgeny Morozov

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.330
here with us.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.530
Evgeny just wrote a book, as you can see behind
us, called "The Net Delusion: The Dark Side

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.820
of Internet Freedom". And as we'll get into
in just moment he holds a very interesting

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.110
and I think useful perspective for people
at Google to hear about what he might say

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.900
are some of the myths or misunderstandings
about technology and its role in politics.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.390
And so we're very excited to have him here
today. This is part of both YouTube News and

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.620
Politics and Authors@Google NY event. Thanks
to Kate up there for setting this up.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.969
I'm gonna start by reading an excerpt from
Evgeny's book. We reached out to Evgeny about

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.559
three months ago to come to Google to speak
of course not knowing what would happen between

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.039
the time we invited him and the time that
he came. You can talk about Wiki Leaks, you

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.210
can talk about Tunisia, and you can talk even
today about Iran or sorry Egypt as being new

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.640
data for us to explore and look at within
the context of Evgeny's book. So good timing

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640
for you to be here.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.110
And we'll just do a little bit of Q and A
up here between Evgeny and I and then we'd

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.331
love to just have a conversation with folks
in the crowd and I think we have a few people

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:15.331
on VC as well.

00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:19.690
So I'm gonna read an excerpt and then we'll
dive right in there, Evgeny. This is from

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.490
the first chapter of Evgeny's book which is
titled "The Google Doctrine" ?

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.490
[laughter]

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.400
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: and here is what he has to
say.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.130
"Iran's seemed like a revolution that the
whole world was not just watching but also

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.240
blogging, Tweeting, Googling, and YouTubing.
It only took a few clicks to get bombarded

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.060
by links that seemed to shed more light on
events in Iran quantitatively if not qualitatively

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.330
than anything carried by what technologists
like to condescending call 'the legacy media.'

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
Such virtual proximity to events in Tehran
embedded by access to the highly emotional

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.730
photos and videos shot by protesters themselves
led to unprecedented levels of global empathy

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.530
with the cause of the Green Movement. But
in doing so such networked intimacy may have

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.420
also greatly inflated popular expectations
of what it could actually achieve.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.510
As the Green Movement lost much of its momentum
in the months following the election it became

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.489
clear that the Twitter revolution so many
in the West were quick to inaugurate was nothing

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:23.019
more than a wild fantasy. And yet it still
can boast of at least one unambiguous accomplishment.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.780
If anything Iran's Twitter revolution revealed
the intense Western longing for a world where

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.780
information technology is the liberator rather
than the oppressor -- a world where technology

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.639
could be harvested to spread democracy around
the globe rather than entrench existed autocracies.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.880
The irrational exuberance that marked the
Western interpretation of what was happening

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.780
in Iran suggests that the green clad youngsters
Tweeting in the name of freedom nicely fit

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.310
in some preexisting mental schema that left
little room for nuance interpretation let

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.819
alone skepticism about the actual role the
Internet played at the time."

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.489
So Evgeny tell us a little bit about what
"The Google Doctrine" is --

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:02.609
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [chuckles]

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.579
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: and why you think it's irrationally
exuberant.

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.560
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure. Well I was not referring
to the doctrine when I said this.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.750
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right, right, right.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.579
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: But I mean the idea of The
Google Doctrine I think to me it's just a

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:27.190
useful moniker to describe I think the somewhat
dubious relationship that has now emerged

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.560
between the State Department and people in
Washington thinking about issues like Internet

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.529
freedom and Silicon Valley and in firms like
Google, like Facebook, like Twitter I did

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:44.069
not mean to zoom in on Google in particular.
I think there is this expectation that since

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.409
so much of this infrastructure that is now
used by digital activists all over the world

00:03:50.409 --> 00:04:01.359
is built by American companies that that infrastructure
somehow needs to be promoted by American politicians.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.510
And I think again we can debate the extent
to which this is a useful policy orientation

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.379
for people in Washington. I think there is
certainly a danger here because this association

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.349
between the kind of business interests and
the business agenda of Silicon Valley and

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:26.500
the political agenda of Washington, I think
it may potentially harm both for various reasons

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.099
which we're gonna get into.

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:35.240
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Well so what is it, why do
you think people get so excited about the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.120
Twitter revolution in Iran or WikiLeaks and
why do you think that excitement is overstated

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.120
or over felt?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.240
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure. I mean in the case
of Iran I think we have to understand that

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.910
again the U.N. sent around different programs
in Tunisia and they are different from ones

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.131
in Egypt. If you look at the media reaction
to what was happening in Iran 18 months ago,

00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:08.990
I think that reaction, I think that fork was
the role of technology much more than on the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.759
actual political factors that were driving
the events and that were driving the protesters.

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:22.550
And I think it created this very, how say,
myth that somehow all of those protests were

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.550
organized and mobilized by Twitter and I looked
at the actual data from Iran. The only entity

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.130
which actually fact checked the number of
Twitters if you will in the country at the

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.419
moment was Al Jazeera and they could only
find 60 people actively Tweeting from Iran.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:46.570
And so the majority of them were not in Iran.
Those were Iranian Americans Tweeting probably

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.310
from abroad. Again they did play a role in
terms of publicizing what happened, in terms

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.720
of getting the story on the radar of the mainstream
media and especially of CNN which did not

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.440
cover the protest for the first few days.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:08.350
But I think if you go and trace, and I do
that in the first chapter, if you go and trace

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:14.550
the kind of claims that were made about the
power of technology back in Iran, I think

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:20.330
most people did think that that was the end
of the regime and it came in part because

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.470
so many people were armed with Twits and pokes
and other forms and text messages.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.199
And of course, what happened afterwards, I
think, got completely lost in the media coverage.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:37.949
And what happened is that since the government
managed to stay in power they actually turned

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:43.330
to social media. They turned to the information
posted to Facebook and Twitter. They even

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.780
looked at email, mailing lists --

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.780
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.699
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: basically and email groups
to identify some of the dissidents, to identify

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.770
some of the protesters. They turned to Flicker
actually to fetch some of the photos that

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:01.060
were posted there by the participants themselves
and they circled some of the faces of protesters

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.500
that are now in Iraq and they posted them
on government run news media websites asking

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.430
people to identify people whom they could
recognize.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.430
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.300
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: In a sense, they were crowd
sourcing the gathering of information about

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.830
the protesters which was later used in court.
That part of the story did not get almost

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.919
any coverage in the media in the West in part
because I think it also reveals a somewhat

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.400
ugly side to technology and to social media
in general.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:37.430
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So the net effect of social
media in Iran would be negative in your mind?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:44.360
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: I wouldn't go that far to
say that it was negative. Again it did not,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.440
it did not help the protesters to an extent
that many people in the West thought that

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:57.780
it did. It certainly put many of them at great
risk I think without them realizing and recognizing

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.349
the kind of risks that they were taking.

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:06.230
Again my theory is that most of the people
who were actively Tweeting and just Tweeting

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:13.069
something or were posting messages on Facebook
may not even have been aware that the government

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:18.259
has the technology to go track them down.
I'm not even talking about Deep Packet Inspection

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:22.241
technology which supposedly was also used
in Iran to look at the traffic. I'm talking

00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:28.160
about very basic stuff looking at social media
sites.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.400
I just don't know what we gain by saying it
was positive or negative. It just didn't play

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.871
that much of a role in Iran in getting people
out into the streets. I think to me the most

00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:44.560
interesting part about what happened in Iran
was the kind of media and public reaction

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:50.740
that it produced. And I think it did reveal
a lot about how we think about the liberating

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.579
power of technology. I mean so to me the most
interesting part was the public discourse

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:59.300
in the West about what was happening in Iran
not necessarily the way for which it was used.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.170
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: It's interesting you say that
because there was headline after headline

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.890
after headline calling this the "Twitter Revolution"
or the "YouTube Revolution" or whatever it

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.460
might be and of course the native video played
a lot into that I think in terms of --

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.460
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.339
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: people having a galvanizing
thing that they could point to. Why in your

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:16.430
mind as your researched in the book ?

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.430
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.700
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: that whole phenomena -- why
are those of us in the West or in America,

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.519
why were we so prone, if in fact this --

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:26.519
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:30.950
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: there is a net delusion, that
it's a delusional viewpoint -- why are we

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.980
so prone to have it? Why was everyone so excited
--

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:33.980
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.089
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: about technology if, in fact,
there was only 60 people Twittering from inside

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:39.070
Iran and the net effect was ?

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.070
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.270
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: difficult for many activists?

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:46.860
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um. Um-hum. Well I mean
some of it I think has roots in just how we

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:51.230
think about the liberating power of technology,
not just the Internet. Again I have an entire

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:57.860
chapter in the book looking at the kind of
intellectual assumptions that so many pundits

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:06.899
in America made about the power the technology
played in supposedly ending the Soviet Union.

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:12.430
There is a very rich tradition of journalists
and politicians in this country claiming that

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.779
it was the -- first of all it was Ronald Reagan
who ended the Soviet Union, but this -- and

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:25.000
second, it was the Voice of America and Radio
Free Europe and the Western broadcasts and

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.130
then the fax machines and the Xerox machines
that were smuggled into the Soviet Union to

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.260
be used by dissidents -- that eventually caused
the Soviet system to collapse.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:40.360
When you look at some of the columns written
recently even about Tunisia and Egypt, you

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.529
still see a lot of columnists making that
particular point that it was the free flow

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:51.050
of information that undermined the Soviet
Union. And I think there is definitely a role

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:58.269
that Western broadcasting certainly didn't
hurt the chances of the democratization in

00:10:58.269 --> 00:11:01.449
the Soviet Union right. The Samizdat literature
certainly helped to create and shape the culture

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:07.910
of resistance in the country. It was not the
driving force by any means. Most historians

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:15.089
now would probably credit the role of the
economy and the fact that the Warsaw Pact

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:20.139
could not compete with NATO. I mean there
are all sorts of structural factors which

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:25.670
caused the Soviet Union to collapse but, however,
it's just as a narrative. It just makes for

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:31.340
such better copy and journalism to credit
the role of dissidents with the fax machine

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.240
then some trade statistic and the Soviet economy.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.829
But of course when that was many of the stories
glorifying the role of the user, glorifying

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:48.459
the role of the dissident. And I think many
of the same assumptions now are being rediscovered

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:51.130
when we talk about the power of blogging --

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.130
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:56.269
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: and the power of the Internet.
I mean I spent some time analyzing Hillary

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:58.690
Clinton's big speech last year on Internet
freedom.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.640
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: On 21st century statecraft.

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.029
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs] Well I mean technically
it was a speech on Internet freedom and she

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:05.310
did another speech on 21st century statecraft
--

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.310
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Oh, okay.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.079
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: but it was the museum speech
--

00:12:08.079 --> 00:12:09.079
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Yeah.

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:13.240
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: on January 21st. And you
look at that speech and the way she described

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:19.690
some of the problems ahead in terms of Internet
freedom are all framed and phrased in terms

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:25.970
of the Cold War vocabulary. It's all about
the information curtain that's descending

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:32.770
upon the world. It's all about virtual walls
that are replacing the Berlin Wall. It's all

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:39.350
about bloggers being dissidents to point out
who are engaging in basically production of

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:43.130
samizdat which again she takes to mean basically
blogging and Twitting --

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.130
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.160
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: and all of that. And I think,
I mean, some of this is useful in terms of

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:56.250
elevating the subject to, in terms of sort
of institutional politics in the State Department.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:02.779
If you label bloggers as dissidents, probably
anyone working on Internet freedom will automatically

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:06.440
get more traction and it just will be much
easier for them to get things done.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:13.420
But on the other hand, I'm just not sure that
claiming that bloggers are dissidents is helpful

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.410
in terms of grasping the actual environment
in countries like Russia or countries like

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:23.230
China or even Iran. We do have a lot of bloggers
who are actually much more conservative than

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:26.220
their leaders. I mean there are plenty of
bloggers in Iran who hate Ahmadinejad --

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.460
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So in some ways --

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:28.830
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: because he's not harsh enough.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:34.570
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So in some ways, you're taking
contention with the sort of evaluating technology

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.980
is inherently good in some ways whereas --

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:45.740
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah. I mean yes, but also
evaluating bloggers and blogging as just a

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:51.649
logical continuation of those older processes
of Samizdat printing, Samizdat distributing

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:57.880
banned literature. I mean again it's useful
to an extent but you have to realize that

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.920
many of those countries have changed so tremendously.
Russia and China and even Iran have changed

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.980
a lot since --

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.050
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:10.820
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: 1989. I mean they -- it's
no longer just the battle of the bad guys

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.279
who are in the government and the good guys
who are opposing the government. I mean they

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:21.600
have much more complex political and social
forces out there in Russia. It's the Nationalists

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:27.290
who make the best use of technology whether
it's YouTube or whether it's blogging or whether

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:31.459
it's Twitting. I mean they are much better
at organizing, getting people into the streets,

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:36.851
and having race riots as we saw in November
in Moscow, for example, right? And if you

00:14:36.851 --> 00:14:42.519
just imagine that all of those Internet users
in Russia who are using this channel some

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:46.750
platforms are dissidents, you're just missing
out that many of them aren't and many of them

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:51.300
have agendas which probably look even more
anti-democratic than the Kremlin's one.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.560
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: We should back up for a second
and tell people in the room about your own

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560
story --

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.560
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.560
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: you're from Belarus --

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.259
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: you didn't start out with this
opinion necessarily but --

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:02.259
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: No.

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:04.610
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: this is sort of a conclusion
that came to you after some thinking.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:05.610
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.610
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Tell us a little bit about
how --

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.610
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:08.610
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: you came to write the book
--

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:09.610
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.610
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: and --

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.040
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah so I come from Belarus
which as some of you may know is not probably

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:20.250
the most democratic country in Eastern or
Central Europe. So I've always been fascinated

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:26.889
by the questions of basically democratization
and how do you actually promote democracy

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:32.051
in a country like Belarus without necessarily
having to send in the Marines or --

00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:33.051
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:35.370
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [chuckles] or anything of
that sort. So I've always been interested

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:40.390
in sort of finding some softer morals in which
to open up the country and to promote democratic

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:45.529
values. So I did get very excited about the
power of technology and love to point out

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:50.589
around the year I would say 2005, so when
there was still a lot of excitement in the

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:59.130
U.S. about the power of new media. Remember
it was shortly after the 2004 Presidential

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.670
Campaign was still lot of talk of Howard Dean
making this excellent --

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.670
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So you went into the media
--

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.430
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: use of media. So I thought,
"Gee, I mean great. Let's just use all of

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:12.709
that, let's use blogs and social networks
and all of those new platforms to basically

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:18.610
push against the government. So I joined an
NGO called "Transitions Online" which was

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.470
based and still is based in Prague which was
not only active in Belarus. They were acting

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:26.850
throughout the former Soviet blocs in like
29 countries including --

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.980
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.879
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: western Europe and places
like Mongolia even. And eventually I became

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:38.709
Director of New Media which meant that I traveled
throughout that region, gave trainings to

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:44.220
a lot of bloggers and journalists and activists
on how to use blogs and social networks to

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:49.829
push for democratic change, but also oversaw
a lot of projects that we got funded to do

00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:55.170
by the likes of National Endowment for Democracy
in Washington or all sorts of other funders

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.820
that traditionally take government funding
--

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.810
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: And so you're out there training
bloggers and dissidents --

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.940
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs] And supervising
some complete projects --

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.579
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: And what were you learning?

00:17:04.579 --> 00:17:05.630
&gt;&gt;Evgenhy Morozov: Yeah.

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.049
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Were they --

00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:11.000
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Well, I mean for them it
was easy I mean they wanted to promote their

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.169
stuff, they wanted to mobilize people, they
needed to know how to push the ideas out there.

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:22.760
I ended up in Tajikistan in a training where
I brought this fancy PowerPoint. It was Flicker,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.490
YouTube, all the goodies about to [inaudible]
and ended up in a room of people whose only

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:32.940
experience was the [inaudible] was basic chatting.
They're still using all that chat software

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.750
from the 90s and they were operating in an
environment where the only national paper

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:44.350
comes out once a week on a Thursday and it
has no photos in it, just text. It was very

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:50.270
hard to talk about the benefits of Web 2.0
to activism to that audience.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:56.200
But in other cases it was much better received
because they were users. The problem with

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:01.250
that as I discovered after three years of
doing this, is that the governments themselves

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:07.770
were becoming much more strategic about their
use of the Web. It was not just about blunt

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:14.320
Internet filtering. They were doing much more.
They were not only banning access to certain

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:20.559
URL's; they were beginning to pay bloggers
to spread their own opinions and propaganda.

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:27.039
They were beginning to turn to all sorts of
data mining firms to learn about trends of

00:18:27.039 --> 00:18:31.820
sentiment analysis in social media understanding
sort of what people think and how they behave

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.929
and what things are happening.

00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:42.010
Even in Russia you saw pro [inaudible] oligarchs
suddenly buying new media platforms, you had,

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:46.710
LiveJournal was bought by a Russian guy basically
and now is owned by Russians right. So all

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:53.500
of those seemed kind of, at first they seemed
very interesting, I mean the other side, the

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.480
enemy was doing something as well. But by
2007 I think early 2008 I just realized that

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:08.070
we were kind of losing the fight. In addition
to that many of the projects that were funded

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:13.809
by American donors in countries like Belarus
or San Alaysia actually had the opposite effect

00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:19.830
because what happened is that you had this
big foreign funder come in and hire all the

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.660
most talented new media entrepreneurs and
put them on grant money and basically kill

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.820
all local innovation because now they didn't
want to build a Website unless they got a

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.130
big grant. And once they got the grant, they
would make sure that it fails because they

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:39.070
can get another grant to fix all the problems
right. So you ended up in this cycle where

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:45.679
all of the best people who could be working
on all these wonderful projects ended up working

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:50.710
with NGO's that were just taking money from
the West and not contributing much. [coughs]

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.860
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So if the Web is a platform
where any number of things can happen: good,

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.310
bad, ugly, oppressive --

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.310
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Uh-huh.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.000
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: democratic, revolutionary there's
a lot of things that can take place on the

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.820
Internet. What your book seems to be saying
is, "Hey, wake up. Don't just concentrate

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.919
on the good stuff, there's a lot of, there
are a lot of -- challenges to the Web --

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:09.330
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.080
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: and politics. But that's just
my sense of it. Why did you write the book?

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.470
What is the, what do you hope someone ?

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.470
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.470
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: gets out of your argument?

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:22.610
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah I mean to me the primary
interest of course is still policy makers.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.590
It's not the general kind of Internet --

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.590
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.330
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: sort of media, new media
public. To me the big, the primary market

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.669
for the book is Washington or London, and
Brussels. It's people who are thinking about

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:40.480
ways in which to integrate new media and which
to integrate the Internet into the existing

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.190
sort of kind of foreign policy making apparatus
if you wish.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:44.190
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.210
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: And the problem is that
when I look at a concept like Internet freedom

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:55.210
which Hillary Clinton began to promote last
year I just think if I have to evaluate it

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:02.799
as the new pillar of U.S. foreign policy as
she claimed it was, I think it's just a very

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:08.351
weird concept. Not only does it not capture
the kind of the darker side of what's happening

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:12.030
in terms of business or right there inside
governments themselves very actively using

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:17.549
the Web. I think it's also deaf to domestic
policy and to what's sort of the U.S. government

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:22.480
itself has been trying to do with the Internet
domestically in the last three or four years.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:26.980
If you look at the evolution of your domestic
American approach to the Internet, all the

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:32.549
argument has all been about great Internet
control not great Internet freedom. Whether

00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:39.380
it's a matter of FBI and NSA trying to convince
American companies to build back doors into

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:47.830
the system or it is going about the main names
of people spreading pirated materials online

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:54.110
or whether it's a matter of going after companies
that assist WikiLeaks. I mean you look at

00:21:54.110 --> 00:22:00.240
all of that and it makes America look extremely
hypocritical when on the one hand they are

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:06.169
touting the virtue of Internet freedom abroad
while kind of doing the exact opposite domestically.

00:22:06.169 --> 00:22:12.270
And so to me the, there are, we can debate
how to resolve this problem domestically,

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:19.150
but to me the fact that now we have rushed
into this quest of promoting Internet freedom

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.950
without having thought about how the State
Department should structure its relationship

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:32.530
with American companies, how they should structure
their conversations with other agencies of

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.580
the U.S. Government which are trying to do
the opposite of what they're doing. All of

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.080
those I think are big questions that need
to be addressed because it's very easy I think

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.039
and I think that's in part what has been happening,
it's very easy to be moving in the wrong direction

00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:49.980
at the great speed, right. And I think --

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.300
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So what is wrong --

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:52.300
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs]

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.620
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: with the, what is wrong with
the U.S. foreign policy's relationship with

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.200
American technology companies or --

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.200
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:04.830
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: their understanding of, because
access to information --

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:05.830
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:06.830
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: or Internet freedom --

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.830
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.540
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: could be applied to Radio Free
Europe 20 years ago --

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.540
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.540
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: I mean that's a value --

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.540
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure. But I mean --

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.540
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: that's basically American.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.850
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: to me the question is do
you as Google or does Facebook or Twitter

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:22.710
want to be seen necessarily in Russia or China
or Iran as the Voice of America or Radio Free

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:23.710
Europe right?

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.830
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Very different in this context
then --

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.580
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: I know but still I think
it's a big question because this is how you

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:36.309
would be seen intrinsically right. And I just
don't know whether it's a good idea to trust

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:41.490
you to be Voice of America because you're
driven by completely different set of motivations

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.610
and incentives, right. So this is one problem
that I see.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:50.240
The second problem is that look, look at what
happened in the last three years in terms

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.690
of sort of what the State Department has been
doing, Voice of America companies. I mean

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.110
you all know probably very well about [inaudible]
of technology delegations.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.110
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:03.919
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: They take the CEO's of American
companies send them abroad. Again there was

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:11.191
a dinner in which Hillary Clinton hosted for
some of the CEO's at the State Department

00:24:11.191 --> 00:24:16.790
and the question there is why should, to me
the question is for example, why should the

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:22.559
CEO of Twitter or the founder of Twitter be
invited to the State Department when Twitter

00:24:22.559 --> 00:24:27.789
did not join the Global Network Initiative?
A very simple question. Why should the State

00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:33.289
Department be kind of promoting some of those
very companies that do not want to sign up

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:37.100
to certain standards of behavior resisting
the Department itself? --

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.100
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: And just --

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.100
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: as a kind of champion right.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.799
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: explain the GNI for those here
who may --

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:46.899
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: I mean it's basically an
industry wide agreement of technology companies,

00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:53.370
certain NGO's which Google is a member of,
which specifies how they should behave when

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:58.529
it comes to certain aspects of freedom of
expression, how they should treat --

00:24:58.529 --> 00:24:59.950
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right.

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:02.840
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: users and user data and
how they should interact with governments.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:03.980
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right. So in some ways --

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.980
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs]

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.280
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: it sounds like you, one of
your concerns is private companies playing

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:15.710
a very public, private companies whose platforms
are made for profit because they're probably

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:20.409
companies being sort of used at the forefront
of public and international discussions --

00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:26.750
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes, but also I just don't
see how exactly -- there is no firm approach,

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.360
there is no coherent approach. You have on
the one hand the State Department accusing

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.620
or being very critical of Cisco's role in
providing technology to China which facilitates

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.659
their censorship and then on the other hand
10 months ago giving Cisco an innovation award.

00:25:41.659 --> 00:25:47.460
And it's very hard again to reconcile those
two, even though it may have been done by

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.140
two different departments, two different bureaus
within the State Department.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:57.669
But the other thing I think you have to remember
that if you look at the kind of perception

00:25:57.669 --> 00:26:03.590
that the State Department has created in terms
of how it views American companies, it's not

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:08.200
a very healthy perception. And here I have
to speak critically of your colleague, new

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.159
colleague now, Jared Cohen who used to work
at the State Department.

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:16.820
Again you look and track some of Jared's statements
where he would say things like, I'm quoting

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.559
"Facebook is the most organic tool for the
market's promotion the world has ever seen."

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:26.680
And when you say things like that when you
work for the government, chances are a lot

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.779
of governments are concerned with America
promoting democracy in their backyard. Chances

00:26:31.779 --> 00:26:37.690
are it's not gonna help either the government
or Facebook because the governments will try

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:45.039
to squeeze out American companies or try to
replace their services with local, more pliable,

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:48.080
and easier to control alternatives. Right
so --

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.220
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: So let's back up --

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.220
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.090
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: for a second and look at sort
of how this relates to Google because you're

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.090
at Google and I'd love --

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.090
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.090
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: to dig a little bit more --

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.090
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:59.090
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: deeply into that. Our mission
as you know is to organize the world's information

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.090
and make it --

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.090
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:02.460
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: universally accessible and
useful. And I think most people at Google

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.049
don't think about that as like a business
strategy but just like a true good, --

00:27:07.049 --> 00:27:08.049
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:10.100
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: right. Like more information
is better for the world and having --

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.100
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.409
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: more transparency and more
access to it is good for our users and good

00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:14.409
--

00:27:14.409 --> 00:27:15.409
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:17.160
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: for our citizens. Do you agree
with that? I mean would --

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.830
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: you take intention with that
as a truth and what --

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.830
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.220
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: problems or challenges do you
see with that and what would you hope Googlers

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:27.220
know about your --

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.220
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.220
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: feeling on that question?

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.279
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: But I think it doesn't really
matter whether I agree with that. The question

00:27:31.279 --> 00:27:38.789
is how will that mission be perceived abroad
by certain governments and how will that mission

00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:44.250
be interpreted in light of certain events
or relationships that Google has or does not

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:45.840
have with the U.S. Government.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:52.860
Because again you look at Tunisia and Egypt
those countries have enjoyed American support.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.440
So no one would actually, no one inside would
think that the protests there were actually

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.480
organized by the CIA. That would not seem
like a realistic hypothesis. In the case of

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:10.200
Iran or China or Belarus or many other countries,
that would seem like a realistic hypothesis.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.190
So when some protests break out, the initial
assumption is that, "Hey they must have been

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:22.910
orchestrated by America, by the State Department
training young activists abroad or training

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.940
bloggers or training cyber activists." You
name it. And this is where I think you have

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:37.130
to understand how your own image will be perceived.
I mean it will not be, you will not be judged

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:42.390
against your mission. You will be judged against
your existing relationships whether those

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:48.190
are with the State Department of the U.S.
Government or with dissidents or with activists,

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.190
right.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:54.240
And again I'm not sure that this realization
is -- I mean I'm sure it's there I'm just

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.990
now sure how acutely you are aware of that.
[coughs]

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:03.039
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: You mentioned Tunisia and Egypt
and I would love to hear just your thoughts

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:08.159
on the events of the past few months and how
it relates to the project of this book.

00:29:08.159 --> 00:29:13.830
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah. I mean in some sense
if you look at the sort of public reaction

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:18.950
to what happened particularly in Tunisia I
think there was still quite a bit of hype

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:24.690
in terms of people calling it a Wikileaks
revolution or Twitter revolution. So in some

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.149
sense if you look at the public discourse
I mean it has improved somewhat I think people

00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:34.730
are much more reluctant to call it a Twitter
revolution as they were in Iran but some of

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.610
that was still there.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:43.930
In terms of the use of new media for organizing,
I never denied that it would be used right

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:52.070
and again when the right time comes it can
do wonders. It helps to have not just Twitter

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:57.289
but army on your side and if you do of course
social media will be a great role in terms

00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:58.799
of publicizing protests.

00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:04.720
The problem is that [coughs] if the government
doesn't fold then you end up in a situation

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:09.790
like Iran where the government also turns
to the same platforms to basically make its

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:16.210
crack down much harsher because of it has
access to all the data. So again it's all

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:20.880
about political and social conditions on the
ground and not so much about technology and

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.600
I think you have to remember that.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:29.090
In Egypt I think the situation is more or
less familiar. Many of these groups were in

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:34.770
place three years ago many of them Facebook
groups especially. Many of them did not appear

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:40.220
overnight and many of the digital networks
have been in place for some time already.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.990
Again the reason why I think they played such
a big role in terms of publicizing protest

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:49.100
before data was cut off again was because
the political situation was right and the

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:57.200
30 years of Mubarak's rule were bound to end
sooner or later.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:03.520
So again I think it will be a mistake to attribute
what has happened there to technology because

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.610
it's not driven by technology. And to me the
question is in an age where everyone is on

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:12.330
Facebook and Twitter and is using Google,
I mean how do we expect a revolution to look

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.840
like? I mean it's normal that all of them
will have some --

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.720
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: But is there something more
inherently personal about --

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Yeah.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.279
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: these things that unfold when
there's a way to connect to them through social

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:24.279
media? I mean to --

00:31:24.279 --> 00:31:25.279
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Uh-huh.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:26.279
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: watch to watch Neda --

00:31:26.279 --> 00:31:27.279
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Yes.

00:31:27.279 --> 00:31:29.360
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: pass away in the streets of
Tehran --

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.360
&gt;&gt;Evgenhy Norozov: Yeah.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.360
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: as an American sitting at your
laptop at your home --

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.360
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Sure.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.330
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: is a very personal and chilling
moment that I think probably connects people

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.850
in a more deep way to an event --

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:38.850
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Yeah.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.670
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: than say seeing a news wire
story or --

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.670
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Sure.

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:42.670
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: and so --

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.670
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: But again --

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.120
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: whether or not the regime toppled
--

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Yeah.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.590
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: there's more people in the
U.S. probably that feel a connection to what

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.110
took place in Iran I would argue ?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.110
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Uh-huh.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.110
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: because of that ?

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.110
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Norozov: Sure.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.110
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: connection and in the long
term is that a good thing?

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.630
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Well again the question
is to what extent will that influence a load

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:04.760
of U.S. foreign policy. You may argue that
there will be cases where, and now we're seeing

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.760
images from [inaudible] --

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:10.700
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: or Americans feel that they
need to push their government to change the

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:16.309
policy on Egypt. I mean I'm also sure that
there will be cases where similar images will

00:32:16.309 --> 00:32:20.860
push America to change its foreign policy
in ways that will not be necessarily conducive

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.200
to democracy and democratization.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.200
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.740
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: The example I usually give
is the photos that came out of Somalia and

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.500
they're of U.S. soldiers being dragged through
the streets of --

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:32.500
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.889
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Mogadishu. Again that was
very emotional [inaudible] It led to America

00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:40.700
withdrawing its troops in part because the
U.S. public was so concerned and it wanted

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:47.559
to exert pressure right. So again it all depends
on I think the particular case. I'm not, I

00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:52.230
wouldn't go as far as to say that the fact
that so many Americans get so emotional about

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:58.820
stuff online necessarily has a good influence
on policy making; no I wouldn't. In part because

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:07.400
it, in some sense, it shortens the distance
between the policy maker and the citizen at

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.760
which point we do have to debate the virtues
of direct democracy versus representative

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.260
democracy. How much autonomy actually we want
to grant to policy makers.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.260
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:22.190
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: And on many issues I think
we want to make sure that they are transparent

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.940
and this is why we have WikiLeaks, but on
the other hand I --

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.940
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.419
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: don't want policy makers
to set policy based on how many ?

00:33:28.419 --> 00:33:29.440
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Got it.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:30.970
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: views each video gets ?

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:31.970
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Yeah.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:32.970
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: on YouTube.

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.539
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: I don't think that's happening.

00:33:34.539 --> 00:33:35.539
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs]

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:39.279
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: It'd be interesting. If that
was the case, Charlie the Unicorn would be

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:40.700
President of the United States.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.700
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [laughs]

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.559
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: I'd like to open it for questions
if you have questions for Evgeny, there's

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:47.830
mics here and here and I don't know if anybody
in the VC has one, but feel free to chime

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:49.990
in if you do. Over here, sir.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:56.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yeah, so events teach us many things.
You mentioned Neda dying. It teaches us on

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:02.139
the one hand it inspires us to see that other
peoples potentially dying for freedom perhaps

00:34:02.139 --> 00:34:05.950
set an example. On the other hand it teaches
us that running around the streets of a place

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:09.910
like Iran during this sort of event is a really
dangerous thing to do and it may be considered

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:10.910
unwise. There's a good side to that ?

00:34:10.910 --> 00:34:12.200
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:18.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: there's a bad side. And this, the
two sides are in anything.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.670
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:26.320
As far as sort of the argument that seems
to be made here, it seems to me that a fundamental

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.680
promise of democracy is that the voice of
the people will be heard, that their experience

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.300
and knowledge will be respected ?

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.300
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:39.290
&gt;&gt;male #1: and that it will be considered
useful. And thus for us to have a democracy,

00:34:39.290 --> 00:34:40.290
?

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.290
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:45.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: we have to ways for people to be
heard. We have to have ways to store and retrieve

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:51.590
information. So it seems to me that sort of
a society or a people's ability to either

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:57.380
maintain a democratic form of government or
to create one if it doesn't exist, is fundamentally

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:04.250
tied to the facility with which they, the
technology that's available to them for sharing

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:10.985
information, for communicating with others,
for storing it and retrieving it, and the

00:35:10.985 --> 00:35:11.985
rest.

00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:16.970
Given that, it would seem to me that the Internet,
the technologies that we work on etcetera,

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:21.360
we must have them and we probably must have
more of them ?

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.360
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:27.220
&gt;&gt;male #1: of that technology and better technology
if we want to see democracy in the future.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.220
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.090
&gt;&gt;male #1: It may be that there's some unfortunate
consequences along the way.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:34.090
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.890
&gt;&gt;male #1: But no matter how much sort of
unfortunate consequences there may be, ?

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:39.890
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:42.670
&gt;&gt;male #1: I think we need to accept that
doing more with this technology ?

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.670
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.870
&gt;&gt;male #1: is absolutely necessary ?

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.490
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.550
&gt;&gt;male #1: and that we should never hold back
?

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.550
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.150
&gt;&gt;male #1: of building tools that make it
easier for people to communicate, store information,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.150
exchange it, etcetera.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.910
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Sure, I mean I think it's
the right direction to think about it. The

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:04.200
question is really I mean it's nice to be
building tools right and it's nice to be building

00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.960
tools that circumvent censorship, and it's
nice for a company to be doing that and I

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.630
think Google is doing a great job.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:15.820
The question is if you sit at an entity like
the State Department right which has to make

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:21.930
decisions about the allocation of resources
do you want to pour more money into building

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:26.260
tools? Do you want to pour more money into
training bloggers? Do you want to pour more

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:33.061
money into making sure that existing NGO's
and political parties in a country like Belarus

00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:37.900
or Azerbaijan or whatever know about new media,
right. And this is I think the question. I

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:45.640
mean there are different levels in which we
have to answer this question. As a private

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:51.260
actor sure you have to be doing as much as
you can and probably on an issue in which

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:56.800
you can contribute the most. It still doesn't
answer how you should go and redistribute

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.710
the resources within the State Department
or a government entity ?

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.710
&gt;&gt;male #1: But if we want ?

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.570
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: which has a policy based
on what?

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.580
&gt;&gt;male #1: If we want democracy in Belarus
?

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.970
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.491
&gt;&gt;male #1: and if democracy relies on the
ability of the people to ?

00:37:10.491 --> 00:37:11.491
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes.

00:37:11.491 --> 00:37:12.491
&gt;&gt;male #1: communicate, store, etcetera ?

00:37:12.491 --> 00:37:13.510
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:20.670
&gt;&gt;male #1: then how could we do anything other
than work constantly to increase the facility

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.180
with which the people can speak among themselves?

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:26.540
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Well I mean [chuckles] there
is no Internet filtering in Belarus right

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:33.640
now so but again I think there is this virulent,
hostile tendency to think that once we build

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.140
the tools and once people can bypass censorship,
they will immediately do certain things, X,

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:42.720
Y, Z. And it just doesn't work that way.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:48.410
And again from the perspective of someone
who wants to spend a pot of money, 10 million

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:53.700
or a million dollars on fostering democratic
change in a country like Belarus, I'm not

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.490
sure that building tools is the way to go.
Maybe you want to go and make sure that your

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:06.570
network of activists on the ground knows about
how to campaign, how to resist police pressure,

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:14.330
how to raise money. I mean there are all sorts
of other ways which by the way we knew before

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.150
the Internet in terms of how to promote democracy
elsewhere.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.550
So I mean I understand the push ?

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:22.660
&gt;&gt;male #1: But to campaign, to raise money,
to do these things ?

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.660
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.530
&gt;&gt;male #1: these are all acts that require
technology, okay? The problem here isn't the

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:34.360
technology, the capacity to communicate, to
store and retrieve this is a fundamental requirement

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.800
before any of these other things can occur.
If you wish democracy, you must have these

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.370
things. So to question whether or not ?

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.350
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah, but if you don't have
the networks of people who take advantage

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:48.461
of this tools, there is no point in building
the tools.

00:38:48.461 --> 00:38:53.100
&gt;&gt;male #1: Yes there is because once you build
the tools, once you provide the capabilities,

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:58.040
they will be there for the people to use when
they get in the mood to use them.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.500
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Well I mean I wish it was
that simple but again ?

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.230
&gt;&gt;male #1: How could it be anything else?

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:07.180
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Well because there are elections
in which you need to have to make sure that

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.340
you have political infrastructure that you
have political parties that can go and make

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:16.911
sure that there are people after the elections
to show up on the street. I mean the tools

00:39:16.911 --> 00:39:22.641
will not get you 5,000 people to show up in
a post-election protest as much as you want.

00:39:22.641 --> 00:39:24.400
&gt;&gt;male #1: Okay. Whatever.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.400
Information technology, ?

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.400
[laughter]

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.720
Information technology is the fundamental
infrastructure for democracy. You cannot ?

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.300
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: But again ?

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.351
&gt;&gt;male #1: have one without the other.

00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:35.540
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: no one is arguing that.
You have to think about this from the perspective

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:40.750
of a policy maker who has limited resources
to spend on achieving a certain objective,

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:47.140
right. I mean let's just scrap the State Department
and National Endowment for Democracy and just

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.390
empower Google to build tools and then wait
until democracy happens.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.700
&gt;&gt;Steve Groves: So in some ways you're just
saying, "Hey it's more complex than that."

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.560
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Well yes again ?

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.450
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: That's the crux of your argument
in some way.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:02.720
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: I mean yes but I don't even
think I have to make that argument and then

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.000
yes of course it's more complex than that.
But again I just don't think that by building

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.140
tools necessarily you will be getting any
closer to any of those objectives. I mean

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:18.450
it took, if you look at what it took to get
the Ukrainians to the level of the Orange

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:24.070
Revolution. It took years of funding, years
of hard work, years of training to the activists,

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:25.070
years of making ?

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.070
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:29.030
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: sure that the Ukrainian
activists underground can go and learn from

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:33.800
the activists in Serbia who had a similar
event in Georgia, had a similar events a few

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:40.020
years before that. It didn't take Asamas technology
to tax people and tell them where the protest

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:46.450
is. That was the easiest part of the entire
-- so again I'm all for building the infrastructure

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.650
just that as a policy maker you probably ?

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:49.650
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:53.940
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: want to have some kind of
a framework where you know how to discriminate

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.000
between great tools and great people and ?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Right, right.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: great networks.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.000
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Let's go over here.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.800
&gt;&gt;male #2: In light of Iran and Moldova with
very strong states that crushed these like

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.800
new media ?

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.800
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.430
&gt;&gt;male #2: revolutions and I would argue in
Egypt where if the army were called in to

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.770
actually crush this they actually would be
able to, where do you see the value in social

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:17.340
media, I guess where are the opportunities
in what puts the states in situations and

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.340
sociopolitical ?

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:19.340
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.230
&gt;&gt;male #2: situations where the new media
actually has the greatest ?

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:22.350
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs]

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.970
&gt;&gt;male #2: chance to affect democratic change?

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:31.630
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Um-hum. Well I mean again
publicizing this event I think, I'm not, let's

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.511
look at Egypt I'm not sure that the reason
why the Egyptians blocked the Internet was

00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:40.640
to prevent Egyptians from organizing. It was
probably to stop the foros and videos and

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.280
medias from getting out. That's the reason
why they're now cracking down on Al Jazeera,

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.460
right. Again as Egyptians have shown, you
don't really need a great social networking

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.990
infrastructure to have so many people in the
streets of Cairo, again as they proved again

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.440
just a few days ago.

00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:01.820
So I think there is definitely an element
of making the violence more transparent and

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.630
this is what scares so many people in the
government. In terms of the kind of positive

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:17.220
program for social networking, I think again
often there is an assumption that's made that

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:22.340
we don't need to have existing political movements,
we don't need to build political parties,

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.870
we don't need NGO's. The moment young people
are online, they will all form their own groups

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:32.900
on Facebook and they will all pour into the
streets and protest. In some case probably

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:38.020
something like that happened in Tunisia and
Egypt but I think it would be over simplifying

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:45.350
to claim that we can expect the same outcomes
to come in, to happen in Russia or Belarus

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.830
or in Azerbaijan.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:52.600
And to me the key question is how can you
can actually make sure that this young digital

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:58.000
goers who are online, who are on Facebook,
do not disengage from the existing political

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.990
forces on the ground? Because to me, the risk
and the danger is that we'll see a growing

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:08.160
disconnect between this younger generation
who are on Facebook, who are online and the

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.940
older ones which are eager to go online and
protest and get written up and end up in jail

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:18.460
right. And I think looking at my own country
to Belarus I do see a lot of young people

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:25.720
for whom virtual protest has become the kind
of end in itself. They have so much fun ?

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:27.390
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Slacktivism as they call it.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:33.500
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yes, they have so much fun
taking a photo of the President and Photoshopping

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:39.200
it and drawing all sorts of mustache or whatever
to a photo and then claiming that it's a political

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.380
act and then having a competition in thinking
that it's the greatest act of dissent that

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:49.860
they ever could make. And I think that this
is the kind of activism, slacktivism, I worry

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:50.860
about right.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:56.090
Again in Tunisia of course there are a lot
of people who are unemployed, there are a

00:43:56.090 --> 00:44:00.380
lot of young people who are over educated
and unemployed which of course makes it easier

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.000
for them to go out to mobilize. And kind of
like Russia the problems are different and

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.160
unemployment is not there to the same extent,
and the oil prices are keeping the Russian

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:15.180
economy afloat so I think making sure that
we don't just create virtual movements that

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.760
exist on their own and make sure that we integrate
with the existing ones would be a good way

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.460
for social media to kind of advance.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.920
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum. Right.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.020
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: [coughs]

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.480
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Over here.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.460
&gt;&gt;male #3: We've been talkin' a lot about
democracy but I think even more important

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:30.290
than that is liberty and if you're not, it
seems to me that if you're not careful you

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:37.280
get the kind of things like in Algeria where
they had a movement for freedom and then it

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:41.640
became a repressive government and as you
mentioned the Nationalists in Russia. How

00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:48.310
do you keep things from just being a majority
population stomping on the minority 'cause

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.170
it's easier to organize people around things
they hate than about things they love.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:55.040
&gt;&gt;Avgeny Morozov: Well I mean I don't think
that there is a way. I mean you take the risk

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:01.490
and see what happens. I would probably rather
run the risk of having Nationalists in power

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:09.530
in Russia than see Kremlin continuously in
charge, right. [laughs] So I don't know that

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:14.710
there is a solution. Again you have the same
problem in the U.S. with the Tea Party exploiting

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.350
social media very actively and aggressively
for their own purposes right. So I just don't

00:45:19.350 --> 00:45:24.050
think that there is an easy answer. Get people
online and see what happens.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:30.740
My point, the reason why I talk about Nationalists
and all of those other forces that are not

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:36.300
particularly pro democratic in the book is
because the current Internet freedom policy,

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:42.570
Internet freedom agenda is completely deaf
to the fact that some wrong forces may be

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:46.810
in power and that they will need to be somehow
countered online, right.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:52.980
You have in Russia for example, you have Nationalists
who actually taking census data which is now

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:59.370
also available online and they're taking the
maps published not by Google but by Yandex

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:04.760
in Russia and they're creating matchups. They
take census data about where national minorities

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.900
live in a particular Russian town and they
match it up with the map and they basically

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.170
show where minorities live in a particular
Russian town, encouraging their supporters

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.290
to go and basically beat up anyone who lives
in that part of the city. [chuckles] Right,

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.951
again so like I don't know what to do about
them but I know that [chuckles] you need to

00:46:23.951 --> 00:46:32.220
have a somewhat more sophisticated view probably
driven by people and shaped by people who

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.630
know something about Russia.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.800
The problem with Internet freedom agenda in
the State Department right now is that it's

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.500
so more or less articulated by people who
seem to know so much about the Internet, but

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.440
very little about the regional environments
and very little about the politics of Russia

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.890
and very little about the politics of China
and Iran. And that's why you run into all

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:58.060
of those geopolitical traps with the government
of Iran and China thinking that it was all

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:04.410
about Twitter and that's the company, it was
America's role, it was America's fault that

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:05.410
the protests happened.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:09.710
So part of the argument I'm making in the
book is that the only way to reveal those

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:16.970
traps is to empower people with regional expertise,
it's not to empower Internet cores, it's not

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:22.390
to empower people who know everything about
Silicon Valley and like to point out because

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:28.260
there is a limit as to how much you can understand
about the Internet's impact on social change

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:32.640
and political change if all you know is how
the Internet works. You do need to know about

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.874
the social and political dynamics of those
countries.

00:47:33.874 --> 00:47:34.874
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Let's go over here.

00:47:34.874 --> 00:47:36.840
&gt;&gt;male #4: I think the number you threw out
before about the 60 ?

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.840
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.500
&gt;&gt;male #4: bloggers in Iran -- it's a little
misleading because ?

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.500
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Uh-huh.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:46.700
&gt;&gt;male #4: I think the reach is more important
rather than the actual bloggers. If everyone

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:47.700
is --

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.700
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.280
&gt;&gt;male #4: and then also I think you're always
going to see with something good that comes

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.160
out you're going to see such as with Iran
?

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.160
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Yeah.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:02.341
&gt;&gt;male #4: and you saw the oppressive government
using these technologies in a negative way.

00:48:02.341 --> 00:48:08.270
You're always gonna see that but I don't think
that's an argument to not develop these and

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.270
promote these technologies.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:13.360
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: Exactly, yes. I mean I'm
not saying that we should just shut down the

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.950
Internet and go back to the kind of the pre-digital
stage. To me the bigger question is how do

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.310
you get the policy right [inaudible]. And
I do think that there are there are worse

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:26.760
ways of going around setting policy on Internet
freedom and on such issues.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:32.160
So [coughs] again I think the reason why we
need to look at the dark side in part because

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.000
we need to know who facilitates the dark side,
who makes it easier for the governments.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:43.100
Now in Belarus, for example, where I come
from we had protests in December after the

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:48.470
presidential elections, just months ago. Now
there are reports that the government is actually

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:54.510
turning to mobile phone networks to the operators
of the mobile phones basically and demanding

00:48:54.510 --> 00:49:00.580
them, demanding that they submit any data
and any information about their users who

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:04.340
may have shown up on the square at that time
so that the government can actually go and

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.721
track down all the dissidents who wanted to
oppose it, who wanted to protest against that.

00:49:08.721 --> 00:49:14.800
And again I don't know what kind of technology
makes it possible. It may be that any mobile

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.730
phone company that has towers would be able
to identify who those people are. But then

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:27.950
they also want these companies to provide
the transcript of some conversations and text

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:33.870
messages traffic. And that technology was
probably sold to those companies by Ericsson.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:41.910
Just like we saw in the case of Iran was a
technology sold to them by Nokia Siemens also

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:46.521
being exploited by the government. I don't
whether it was for the packet inspection or

00:49:46.521 --> 00:49:49.910
if it was just for tracing the mobile phones
and calls.

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:55.450
So again to me the question, the reason why
we need to look to the dark side is to identify

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:59.390
how to minimize [chuckles] the government's
ability to profit from it and there are just

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:07.150
too many Western firms that make it possible,
right, and there are ways in which we can

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:10.510
minimize the kind of information and the amount
of information that the governments can collect.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:15.230
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Thanks. And did you have data
on how many followers there were on those

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.230
60 bloggers?

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:19.920
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: It's data that came from
Al Jazeera so I don't even know if they disclosed.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:25.180
I mean it would be silly for Al Jazeera to
disclose who those people were in part because

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:27.030
the government can go and arrest them.

00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:30.550
But then I take your point I mean it doesn?t
matter how people you have on the ground because

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:35.790
they can amplify because of the network effect
and whatnot, but again the narrative that

00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:40.200
you saw, the reason why I quote the stat in
the book is because the narrative we saw in

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.680
the Western media made it seem as if every
second Iranian had a mobile phone from which

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.400
they were Tweeting, right. It was not that
Twitter didn't play some role. Of course it

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.300
played some role in publicizing what was happening,
but the dominant narrative in the Western

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:58.570
media was that, "Hey all of the Iranians organized
online. They all were on Twitter and each

00:50:58.570 --> 00:50:59.830
of them was Tweeting from the square," and
then that's ?

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:00.830
&gt;&gt;Steve Grove: Um-hum.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:01.930
&gt;&gt;Evgeny Morozov: that's just not what was
happening.
