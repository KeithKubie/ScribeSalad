00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.862
- [Voiceover] Alright, we can now do

00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:03.626
the math to solve for v.

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:06.320
So let me just simplify
the right hand side

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.636
of this equation, v minus negative v.

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:11.074
Well, that's just going to be two v.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.446
One minus negative of v
squared over c squared.

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:18.539
Well that's just one plus
positive v squared over c squared.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.559
And let's see, what can we do next?

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:24.227
Well we can multiply,
we want to solve for v.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.642
We can multiply both
sides of this equation by

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.182
one plus v squared over c squared.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.819
So let's do that.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.931
One plus v squared over c squared.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.508
On the right hand side, those cancel.

00:00:37.793 --> 00:00:40.781
And on the left hand side,
we can distribute the 0.8

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:43.904
and we will get 0.8,

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:46.616
or we can distribute
the 0.8 c, I should say,

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:51.616
0.8 c plus 0.8 c v squared over c squared.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:54.996
Well, the c in the
numerator is going to cancel

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:56.384
with one of these c's in the denominator.

00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:01.471
So it's going to be plus
0.8 v squared over c.

00:01:04.203 --> 00:01:08.214
And then, it is going
to be equal to two v.

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:10.885
And remember, we want to solve for v.

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:13.404
So we're setting up
essentially a quadratic in v.

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:19.349
So let's now find
ourselves some real estate,

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:21.397
so let's go right over there.

00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:23.777
Let's subtract two v from both sides.

00:01:23.828 --> 00:01:26.296
And actually, I'm going to
write it in order of degree.

00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:31.348
So on the left hand side, I
have 0.8 over c v squared,

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:37.615
and then minus two v, I
subtracted two v from both sides,

00:01:37.784 --> 00:01:41.515
Plus 0.8 c,

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:46.585
plus 0.8 c is equal to zero.

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:49.399
I guess if we want to
simplify a little bit,

00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:52.104
we can multiply both sides by c.

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:55.833
If we multiply both sides
by c, this will become

00:01:55.898 --> 00:01:59.847
0.8 v squared

00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:05.178
minus two c v plus 0.8c
squared equals zero.

00:02:08.223 --> 00:02:10.801
And we could keep trying to
algebraically manipulate this,

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:13.233
but we could just go straight
to the quadratic formula here

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:14.313
to solve for v.

00:02:14.957 --> 00:02:16.576
I'll do that in a different
color just for kicks.

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:19.956
v is going to be equal to negative b.

00:02:20.286 --> 00:02:23.113
So this right over here is b.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.235
This is our a.

00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:30.136
And this is our c.

00:02:30.258 --> 00:02:32.550
We're talking about
the different variables

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:34.455
using the quadratic formula.

00:02:35.098 --> 00:02:36.753
So v is going to be negative b.

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:38.448
So the negative of negative two c.

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:41.884
So it's going to be two c,
plus or minus the square root

00:02:42.074 --> 00:02:46.551
of b squared, so negative
two c squared is positive

00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:51.486
four c squared, minus four, times a,

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:56.583
so minus four times 0.8 times
c, so times 0.8 c squared.

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:08.951
All of that over two a,
so 0.8 times two is 1.6.

00:03:10.796 --> 00:03:13.496
Now let's see this is
going to be equal to two c

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:16.084
plus or minus the square root --

00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:18.905
now I can factor out a four c squared.

00:03:19.154 --> 00:03:24.154
Four c squared times one
minus, 0.8 times 0.8 is 0.64.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.129
All I did was factor out a
four c squared from both terms.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.786
Of course, all of that over 1.6

00:03:36.162 --> 00:03:37.642
Scroll down a little bit.

00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:39.383
And this is going to be equal to --

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.730
this is all algebra at this point --

00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:42.844
two c plus or minus --

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:45.885
if I take the four c
squared out of the radical,

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:48.646
its going to be two c.

00:03:48.872 --> 00:03:52.083
So two c plus or minus two
c times the square root

00:03:52.112 --> 00:03:53.883
of one minus 0.64.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.450
Well, that's 0.36.

00:03:56.953 --> 00:03:58.278
Things are getting nicely simple now.

00:03:58.278 --> 00:04:00.686
All over 1.6.

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:05.005
The square root of 0.36, the
principle root of that 0.6.

00:04:05.312 --> 00:04:07.890
So that's 0.6.

00:04:08.904 --> 00:04:10.001
And move down a little bit.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.741
So this is going to be equal to two c --

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.517
and I can see the end --

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:19.604
plus or minus 1.2 c, all of that over 1.6.

00:04:23.335 --> 00:04:25.581
So we got two possible values for v,

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:29.730
but we can tell if we add this up here,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.014
you're going to end up
with 3.2 c divided by 1.6,

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:36.528
which is going to be a speed, a velocity,

00:04:36.534 --> 00:04:38.407
greater than the speed of light.

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:41.149
So we can rule out the
positive version of it.

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:42.599
So we know the answer's going

00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:44.084
have to be negative version of it.

00:04:44.114 --> 00:04:47.998
So two c minus 1.2 c over 1.6,

00:04:48.177 --> 00:04:53.177
which is equal to 0.8 c over 1.6.

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:59.754
Well 0.8 is half of 1.6, so this is 0.5 c.

00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:02.803
That was really, really, really cool.

00:05:02.947 --> 00:05:04.254
Because what do we know now?

00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:09.096
We know now that A in
A's frame of reference

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:11.301
feels like it is stationary.

00:05:11.493 --> 00:05:14.121
We have A's friend moving
with a relative velocity

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.724
of eight-tenths of the speed of light.

00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:17.802
There could be a third party, C,

00:05:17.808 --> 00:05:20.403
that defines a frame of
reference moving away from A,

00:05:20.408 --> 00:05:23.038
with the velocity of
half the speed of light.

00:05:24.054 --> 00:05:26.393
Half the speed of light.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.397
And from A's frame of reference,
it looks like C's velocity

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:32.522
is closer to B's than it is to A's.

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:34.849
But we're dealing in this relativistic,

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.469
this Einstein-ian world
because if we then go into

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.321
C's frame of reference, it
actually looks like A and B

00:05:42.347 --> 00:05:46.731
are both leaving C with a speed of 0.5 c.

00:05:49.692 --> 00:05:52.351
So here you can view the
velocity as positive 0.5 c,

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:57.576
and here you could say the
velocity is negative 0.5 c.

00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:01.951
This was really cool.

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.523
We were able to find a frame of reference

00:06:03.523 --> 00:06:05.085
that you could think of
it as right in between.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.146
Now what's going to be
really cool about this,

00:06:07.146 --> 00:06:08.684
is that we can actually --

00:06:08.794 --> 00:06:11.162
you know what some people
don't like about Minkowski

00:06:11.162 --> 00:06:14.350
space-time diagrams is
that it looks asymmetric.

00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.455
Even though B is moving
in A's frame of reference

00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:19.777
with a velocity of positive eight-tenths

00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:20.798
of the speed of light,

00:06:20.798 --> 00:06:22.237
if you were in B's frame of reference,

00:06:22.237 --> 00:06:25.994
A is moving to the left
with a speed of 0.8 times c.

00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:29.568
But now we can define a
neutral frame of reference,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.594
where they're both moving
in different directions

00:06:31.594 --> 00:06:33.109
with the same speed.

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.435
Which actually makes
interpreting the space-time

00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:37.764
diagram a little bit easier.

00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:39.337
We will do that in future videos.

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:42.350
But this was a fun
problem in it of itself.
