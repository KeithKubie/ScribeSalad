Hey Vsauce, I've got a quick and fun video

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.233
for you today because I made a mistake.

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:07.323
Last week on Episode 10 of ING,

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:10.933
I showed a picture and I said,
"cat and dogs cooperating."

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:13.223
However, if you look at the picture
for more than a second,

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:16.183
you can tell that it's not a cat.
It's a monkey.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.353
When a commenter pointed that out to me,
my mind was blown.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:21.583
And so now I'm going to return the favor.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:26.943
Prepare to get blown
in the mind.

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:29.453
First stop, Super Mario Galaxy.

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:31.413
Many of you may have already discovered this,

00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:34.023
but if you read each letter and only each letter

00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:37.023
that has a star underneath it
on the cover of the game,

00:00:37.023 --> 00:00:42.893
it spells out "U R MR GAY."
Mario!

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:45.533
But don't the worry.
We might get the last laugh.

00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:48.943
Here it is, an online Flash game
you can play right now

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:53.243
called Duck Hunt, more specifically,
"Kill the Dog From Duck Hunt."

00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:56.703
That's right. After all of these years,
you finally have the power.

00:01:00.575 --> 00:01:03.243
Unfortunately, Nintendo may have one-upped us.

00:01:03.243 --> 00:01:06.030
Remember this? After completing the castle,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.620
it turns out Toad has been flipping us off
the entire time.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.990
The Chicago Bulls logo upside down
is a robot reading a book,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.250
and if you actually look closely, the Doom guy
has only ever had one gun.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.960
More importantly, the poster for
Silence of the Lambs.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.340
We've all seen it, but have you ever noticed
all of the naked women?

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.640
I'm serious. Let's get a little closer in on the skull.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.470
Good. Do you see it? It's a portrait
by Salvadore Dalles.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.350
And hey, what the H?
Let's do an audio illusion.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.560
You're going to need headphones for this, but if you don't have them, I'll do a visual illusion simultaneously.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.320
Okay, stare into the middle of these swirling shapes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.690
and listen through your headphones.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.580
You'll hear someone shaking a matchbook
three-dimensionally around you.

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.259
I spent more time yesterday than
I'd like to admit playing this game.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.179
It's fun because you get to jump around,
but sometimes if you want to,

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.559
your jumps can have a little extra kick,
I guess because of your diet.

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.529
Okay, so puzzle farter probably didn't blow your mind,

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:31.619
but phew, it feels good to get off my chest
the fact that I love it.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.419
One final fact, NERF is not just a silly word.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.329
It's an acronym that stands

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.169
for non-expanding recreational foam,

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.619
also, I am made out of Vsauce.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:56.019
I didn't really die, but if you have a secret about yourself,

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.889
leave it in the comments below.

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.099
And as always, thanks for watching.
