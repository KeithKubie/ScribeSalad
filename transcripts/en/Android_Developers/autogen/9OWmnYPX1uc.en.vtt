 Ian Lick: For many people 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.020
 The method used and controlled by your application can be classified in a two-way, 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.950
 Either browsing through the content, or through search oriented content. 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.250
 If your app does not provide a good search experience inside 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.592
 If you are serving only part of the user base. 

00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:16.380
 Hi, I'm Ian Lick, and I want to see you 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.400
 What you need to build a great in-app search experience 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.650
 Using SearchView , to help users access 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.592
 What they want exactly in the easiest way possible. 

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:27.620
 Basic building units for a good search experience 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.860
 Start with the hardest one, the good content. 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.380
 We are talking about searching using a single query thread. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.290
 But how this is reflected on your data 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.610
 Whether it is a user list or a full-text search publication 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.350
 How to store all this data is under your control. 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.590
 Well, it may be helpful to have a full search text 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.270
 Feature, or FTS table exists locally on your computer. 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.930
 If your data set is small enough, search speed is important. 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.340
 Let's focus on the search process at the moment. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.155
 Because the search is a pivotal routing style, 

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:04.380
 It makes sense to standardize a single pattern to provide search. 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.310
 In android, including SearchView 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450
 Typically, SearchView is considered as Action in the main application bar 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.410
 Or in an appropriate taskbar. 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.720
 By clicking the SearchView icon 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.540
 SearchView expands, allowing the user to search immediately. 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.190
 Through AppCompat , part of the Android support library, 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.110
 SearchView is now available in all Android 2.1 and higher devices. 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.070
 Add SearchView to your application bar 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.400
 Adding an item only adds to the list you are adopting. 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.170
 Next to the title and icon are more obvious. 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.700
 You will notice that ShowAsAction contains collapseActionView 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.920
 This is what tells the list that this element must involve 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.570
 In normal, but can be extended to the specified ActionViewClass specified. 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.340
 We also need ifRoom or instead showAsAction 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.200
 Without this, our icon will appear only in the overflow dropdown list 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.180
 And we will not be able to extend it to the full SearchView . 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.950
 And we do not want that. 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.790
 With this extension only, we get a nice search code 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.350
 Expands to SearchView , 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.508
 But the search does not go anywhere or do anything else. 

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:12.970
 We can get a reference when we open our list, 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.480
 But what are we doing here? 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.210
 First, there is a full manual mode, 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.780
 SetOnQueryTextListener . 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.210
 Here you will find a retrieval to change the search text 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.740
 When the user submits his search, 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.070
 Giving you full control over what happens and when it happens. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.130
 You can take advantage of more when it provides a searchable installation. 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.460
 This is the XML file, specifically 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.740
 For all the various options associated with the search. 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.860
 So many options that we have a full documentation page 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.740
 For all varied options, 9 pages of detailed explanations. 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.484
 Fortunately, it is also possible to be very short and easy. 

00:02:54.484 --> 00:02:56.360
 Just a tag, which is often the name of your application, 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.430
 And a hint of research publications 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.150
 Or search for the name of your application. 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.140
 Evaluate what it takes to add a search search to your SearchView ? 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.180
 Just one extra line for your searchable structures. 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.050
 This is a very strong line, but remember that voice search 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.360
 Enter directly what is being said. 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.580
 There is no chance to change things before input, 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.580
 Make sure your search is sound before you activate it. 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.300
 This will then link the searchable structure actively. 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.160
 This is the activity you want to go to 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.976
 When the user enters a search. 

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:34.410
 You will notice that we are using SingleTop launch mode. 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.460
 This is important if you have SearchView 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.370
 For your searchable activity, let's say, to do a second search. 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.400
 This launch mode prevents a huge amount of potential search results. 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.480
 Link your SearchView , installable searchable 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.330
 SearchManager Search Manager is used 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.390
 System service that distributes the additional data element 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.690
 Which you have added to one of your activities and creates searchable information 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.370
 You can drag it to your SearchView . 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.570
 This triggers the searchable activity. 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.520
 But to extract the real search text, look for ACTION_SEARCH 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.600
 Then we draw the research from the additional content. 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.030
 This calls it onCreate 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.020
 And if you are using SingleTop firing mode 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.950
 Called from onNewIntent also. 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.870
 So you have a great looking SearchView 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.990
 Which is directly looking for the activity of our choice. 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.820
 What we have not yet talked about is the new search suggestions. 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.300
 Or revised proposals 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.730
 Which makes it easier for users to find what they want. 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.440
 Check out the developer's website for more information. 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.890
 I can not wait to see great experiences 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.270
 Which you will create using the internal application search during your search 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.960
 To build better applications.
