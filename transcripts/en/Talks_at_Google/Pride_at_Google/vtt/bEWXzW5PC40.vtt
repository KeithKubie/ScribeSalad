EMILY METCALF: So my name
is Emily Metcalf.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.520
I'm a member of the Google
privacy team, as well as a

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.430
member of the Gayglers,
Google's gay, lesbian,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.970
bisexual, and transgender
employee resource group.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.800
And it is my honor today to
invite three speakers from the

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.750
Transgender Law Center who are
here today, Masen Davis, Ilona

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.920
Turner, and Nathan Harris.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.260
They're all going to be talking
about the state of the

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.390
transgender movement.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.295
And without any further ado, I
will turn it over to Masen.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.360
Thanks so much for coming.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.340
MASEN DAVIS: Thank you
so much, Emily.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.275
I really appreciate it.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:34.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250
MASEN DAVIS: And we are thrilled
to be here today.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.260
I have been traveling around
the country a lot recently

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.060
talking with community members,
activists, and

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.390
policymakers.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.600
And I have been struck by how
excited people are at this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.570
moment of history, especially
as we wait for a pretty

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.190
important Supreme Court
decision or two

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.140
in the next 10 days.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.150
As early as tomorrow morning, we
could hear what happens to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.810
the freedom to marry for gay and
lesbian and bisexual and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.655
transgender people.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:13.180
We should know what the fate is
for the Defense of Marriage

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.380
Act and for Proposition 8 in
California definitely within

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020
the next 10 days.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.250
It's been really exciting to see
that we're at this point

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.440
in history now where
we hopefully

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.380
will have this freedom.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.350
And as I travel around the
country, I'm struck by the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.630
number of people who feel that
it is just a matter of time

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.640
until people can marry who they
love, which is awesome.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.060
But I'm also getting this
question, are we done?

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730
And that's one question I
want to pose to you all

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.380
today, are we done?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.380
Because I'm also hearing from
activists and community

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.860
members in organizations that
are saying, once we have

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.980
achieved the freedom
to marry, we are

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.400
done as an LGBT movement.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.270
We have achieved equality.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.530
Now I'll tell you, that's hard
for me to reconcile sometimes.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.360
At Transgender Law Center, we
hear from over 2,500 people a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.310
year at this point who are
contacting us because they are

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.389
experiencing some level of
discrimination and bias and

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.230
violence in school, at the
doctor's office, at work, and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.680
on the street.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.230
We know that transgender people
are twice as likely to

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.110
be unemployed and living
underneath the poverty level.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.930
That's four times as high
when it comes to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.100
transgender people of color.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.030
We know that transgender people
are much more likely to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.235
be homeless and experience
family rejection.

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:33.540
In fact, one out of five of us
have had to go and live on the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.440
streets at some point
in our lives.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.480
And we know that health care
continues to be a real

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.680
challenge for us.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.440
Many of us can't get a doctor
when we need it the most and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.530
have been turned away from
health care facilities.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.820
So when I hear this question,
are we done yet, I'm really

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.910
clear that we are not.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.740
But that we are at a time when
we have to redefine what

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.020
equality means, what freedom
means, what justice means, and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.940
to determine whether we're into
just us as people, or if

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.250
we're going to continue
to fight for

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.020
justice for all of us.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.420
So I'm thrilled to be joined by
our legal director, Ilona

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.180
Turner, from Transgender
Law Center.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.670
Ilona leads our very small but
robust legal team, helping

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.070
people fight for their rights in
California, nationwide, and

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.930
even occasionally
internationally, as we figure

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.540
out how to make sure that all of
us have the basic freedoms

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.400
and supports that we need
to survive and thrive.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.100
So we're going to be talking to
you today about some of the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.660
critical issues facing
transgender communities across

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.440
the country, especially issues
impacting our youth, issues at

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.090
work, and issues accessing
health care.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.100
I'm Masen Davis.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.260
I'm the executive director of
Transgender Law Center and

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.640
thrilled to be joining
Ilona today.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.830
And before I turn it over to
her, I want to make sure, too,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.420
that we understand what
we're talking about.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.180
Because I assume some of you are
experts and should be up

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.170
here, and other people may be
newer to transgender issues.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.620
The term "transgender"
is used in a lot

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.120
of different contexts.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.330
It means a lot of different
things to different people.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.430
So I want to let you know kind
of what we mean when we use

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.160
the term "transgender."

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.804
And at Transgender Law Center,
we define "transgender," or a

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:19.500
transgender person, as anybody
whose gender identity, the way

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.779
they feel about themselves,
their deep-seated sense of

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.630
their own gender, or their
gender expression, the way

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.830
they look to the world, doesn't
fit the stereotypes

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.780
associated with their
sex at birth.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.850
All of us have a gender marker
put on our birth certificates

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.020
when we're first born.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.300
Many of us don't have to think
about it after that's done.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.080
But the truth is, the
expectations about who we will

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.830
be as adults are largely based
on that first question, is it

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.120
a boy or a girl?

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.640
We put so much expectation
about a person

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.240
based on that answer.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.570
And for transgender people and
the people who are contacting

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.120
us, that gender marker on
their birth certificate

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.780
doesn't really reflect who they
are, how they are, or

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.650
what they want to be
in their lives.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.350
So we do a lot of work with
people who experience any kind

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.670
of challenge because they don't
fit the narrow gender

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.490
stereotypes that we typically
associate with men and women

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.250
in this world.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.600
And with that, I want to turn
it over to Ilona, because I

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.680
know together we're really
hoping by the end of today,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.300
we'll be able to highlight some
of the critical issues

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.200
facing transgender people and
also some real opportunities

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.490
right now to kind of change
the game when it comes to

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.406
transgender equality in
the United States.

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:30.140
Ilona.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.504
ILONA TURNER: Thanks, Masen.

00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:35.590
I'm going to talk about some
of the issues that we hear

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.570
about a lot relating to
transgender youth, especially

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.490
in schools.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.710
As Masen mentioned, there are
just unacceptably high rates

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.650
of family rejection, kids being
pushed out of their

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.230
homes when they are transgender
or gender

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.300
non-conforming, LGBT
generally.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.790
But the numbers in every case
tend to be worse for

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.870
transgender youth.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.020
So homelessness as a result.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.880
In schools, kids facing
harassment, violence, and then

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.190
when kids are dropping out,
and that often leads to

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.210
dropping out of school.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.070
And so that leads to the other
problems that Masen was

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.780
highlighting of unemployment,
underemployment, poverty,

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.140
homelessness as an adult,
involvement with the criminal

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.050
justice system, you name it.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.890
And these problems all
build on each other.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.450
So to really address that sort
of systematic problem, the

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.680
most effective way to do so is
really to start changing

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.670
things with these kids at an
early age, make sure that

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.770
they're actually getting the
support that they need and

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.790
deserve so that we can hopefully
end those cycles.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.570
And we actually have been seeing
some really heartening

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.490
changes in recent years.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.200
I think partly as a result of
increased visibility of

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.310
transgender people and
transgender youth, we're

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.475
seeing more and more kids coming
out as transgender and

00:07:00.475 --> 00:07:04.250
asserting their identity and
their right to be who they are

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.200
at earlier ages.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.200
And I think as a result of the
increased visibility, we're

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.830
seeing more and more parents
who, instead of, as they might

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.960
have done in previous eras,
saying, no way or that's crazy

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.250
or let's get you counseling,
they're saying,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.180
OK, this is a thing.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.280
I've heard of this.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.610
What can I do to help you?

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.100
I might not understand it, but
you're my kid, and I love you.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.330
So those are some of the most
touching calls that we get.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.860
It's just really amazing
sometimes to hear from these

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.450
parents and the journeys that
they've gone through, people

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.260
from all different kinds
of backgrounds and

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.480
conservative, whatever.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.540
But when it comes to their kid,
they're not going to let

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.620
anybody mess with them.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.790
So we worked with one family
recently, I'm just thinking of

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.020
a family, a mother, a single
mother, actually, in rural

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.080
Missouri whose child
is transgender.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.570
The mother had never heard
of this before.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.650
But the kid was working with
a counselor who helped

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.430
explain it to her.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.410
And she was like, OK, well.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.900
I mean, if you say so.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.580
I love my kid.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.620
The child was assigned female
at birth but identifies as a

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.240
boy, goes by the name Trace.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.340
And Trace went to school
earlier this year.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.100
He's nine years old.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.740
And in his fourth grade
classroom, just before

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.710
Thanksgiving this year,
told his classmates

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.590
that he is a boy.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.809
And the school's response was to
immediately suspend him for

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:46.420
three weeks and, when he got
back to school, to put him

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.110
essentially on lock down in a
special education classroom.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.520
He was previously just in a
totally mainstream classroom.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.680
And they wouldn't let him out
even for lunch or recess.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.710
He was the only kid in the whole
elementary school who

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:05.210
was seen as this kind of danger
for whatever reason.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.050
And this mom, again, she's
not an activist.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.180
She probably doesn't
know any other gay

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.860
people, queer people.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.340
But she knew that she had to
fight for her kid, that this

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.120
was unacceptable.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.915
Because he was getting
incredibly depressed.

00:09:20.915 --> 00:09:23.920
He told her that he
wanted to die.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.410
It was just really, really
traumatizing for him and for

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:28.110
their whole family.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.560
And so she got in touch with us
at Transgender Law Center.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.930
And we were able to successfully
advocate with the

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.330
school, wrote them a
very nasty letter.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.210
And they agreed to lift those
restrictions on him.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.970
And he was so much happier.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.430
And they were so grateful, just
to be able to reach out

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.830
and find that there's somebody
in the country somewhere who

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:56.820
understands what they're going
through and is able

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.966
to fight for them.

00:09:57.966 --> 00:10:01.980
So that was really one of the
most meaningful things that

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.030
I've been able to work on.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.600
MASEN DAVIS: We got this
wonderful letter, too, and

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.080
apparently Trace now wants to
move to the Bay Area when he's

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.610
older and become a lawyer.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.360
So that's a good sign.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.490
ILONA TURNER: Yeah, they sent us
a little photo of him, his

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.000
class photo, and he's
wearing camo.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.440
And then I was talking to him
afterwards, and he said, did

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.540
you get the photo?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.100
And I said, yeah.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.660
And he said, don't
I look handsome?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.550
So that was great.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.640
But unfortunately, these calls
keep on coming in.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.250
And a lot of the issues that we
see are around transgender

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.660
students who are struggling at
school because the school is

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.900
refusing to allow them to live
as who they are, saying that

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:47.570
they can't dress in a way that
matches their gender identity,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.020
saying that they can't--

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.670
even if they are living
full-time in accordance with

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.720
their gender identity, and their
parents are on board,

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.770
and their doctor--

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.730
this is who they are, and
everybody's on board, the

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:01.880
school may still say nope.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.370
You can't.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.920
We're not going to call you by
the name that matches that.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.310
We're not going to call
you by the pronouns.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.350
We're not going to update
your records.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.190
And we're not going to let you
use the right facilities that

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.380
match that gender.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.260
And we're seeing, unfortunately,
a lot of really

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.910
serious consequences of this,
parents who are calling us

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.290
about their children getting
bladder infections because

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:25.200
they won't use the
restroom all day.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.800
We got a call recently from
a parent of a high school

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.160
student in Ohio who actually
just dropped out of high

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.130
school because she got a number
of suspensions for

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.080
using the girl's restroom after
the school said, you're

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.150
not allowed.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.362
But she would go in with
all her friends.

00:11:42.362 --> 00:11:44.410
And again, it just really--

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.380
if you have a student who's
living every day in accordance

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.060
with their gender identity, and
you're telling them, you

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.540
can't use the restroom, or you
can't be in the gym class that

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.570
matches who you are, that just
isolates that student in such

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.440
a serious way.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.720
It really subjects them to
stigma and invites harassment,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.080
essentially.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.150
Because you're outing
them as different.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.440
The school is basically putting
a neon sign above

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.690
their head that says,
I'm different.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.710
Ask me why.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.240
And so we're seeing kids
dropping out of school.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.810
We're seeing kids being
pushed out of school.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.646
And so, in part as a result of
all these calls that we were

00:12:21.646 --> 00:12:24.280
getting, we're actually working
on a bill this year

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.180
here in California.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:30.410
We're sponsoring a bill called
AB 1266 that would actually

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.940
put it into the state law that
says that schools have to

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.580
respect the gender identity of
transgender students and allow

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.560
them to participate in school
activities and use school

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.360
facilities based on
who they are.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.840
So that's moving its way through
the legislature.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.860
MASEN DAVIS: And it's
a big deal.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.700
This is the first time this kind
of bill has been tried

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.770
anywhere in the United States.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.210
It is a new concept
to some people.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.800
And yet we are having
transgender youth coming out

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.940
at younger ages who are just a
seamless part of the school

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.070
environment, who want to just
be themselves and want to be

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.610
able to make sure they have
the credits they need to

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.780
graduate and be able to
get out of school

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.620
and live their lives.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.440
It's incredibly important to us,
too, because we know from

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.360
some data that's been collected
that 50% of

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.700
transgender youth
have attempted

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.090
suicide by the age 20.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.870
The amount of harassment that
our youth are facing in

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.780
schools and the impact
of that harassment is

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:24.560
life-threatening.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.840
So we have every need at this
point to make sure that we're

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.180
able to fix these issues, and so
our trans kids are able to

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.600
be in schools without harassment
and able to

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.250
graduate like everyone else.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.940
ILONA TURNER: Yeah.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.240
One last anecdote about
harassment, just if I may.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.000
We have another client, a trans
boy high school student

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.870
from Southern California who
was one of these people who

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.790
was just fully integrated,
living as a boy in school.

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.210
Nobody knew that he was
transgender until one of his

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.020
classmates happened to be in the
office for something else,

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.080
the school office, and got a
glimpse of his record that had

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.540
an F on it, Female.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.000
She took a picture of that with
her cell phone, blasted

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.420
it out to the whole school.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.020
And so all of a sudden,
everybody knows, and he starts

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.990
getting harassed persistently
at school.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.550
As a result of that, he gets
in a fight with one of the

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.170
harassers, fistfight at school,
and he gets expelled.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:29.360
So we're pursuing a complaint
with the State Department of

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.470
Education on his behalf.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:35.530
But that just demonstrates how
serious this problem is.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:37.770
Harassment, it's not just
about bullying.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.280
It's not just, oh, you
should toughen up.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.970
I mean, this is really leading
to a serious problem of our

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:47.770
kids not graduating and all of
the lifelong problems that

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.420
that can cause.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.970
I know that you guys-- we've
heard that you guys, some of

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.540
you have been thinking about
youth issues, is that right,

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.590
in the Gayglers?

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.950
This is an issue that
you all have been

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.620
focusing on this year.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.200
We'd love to hear some thoughts
from you guys, if you

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.950
have any, about this issue of
trans youth in particular,

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.590
strategies that you think might
be helpful, questions

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.260
about problems that trans youth,
in particular, face.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.140
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
there's a family that came to

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.900
you from, I think it was
Missouri or one of the other

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.330
states, and then Ohio.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.245
I'm assuming they do so through
finding your website.

00:15:20.245 --> 00:15:22.060
And then you mentioned the
other story of harassment

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.660
intensifying after a picture
being taken by a cellphone.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.410
And I think maybe it would be
helpful if you talked about

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.270
how the internet is enabling or
strengthening the movement.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.670
And then we could think about
some of the tools that we're

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:34.670
developing and how that
can maybe support and

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.010
intensify the work.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:37.560
ILONA TURNER: Sure.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.480
MASEN DAVIS: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.020
So the internet has been
absolutely pitiful--

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.450
pitiful.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.980
MASEN DAVIS: It's so pitiful.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.960
It has been so pivotal in the
development of the transgender

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.450
community and the transgender
movement because for years,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.810
transgender people have been
part of America in small towns

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.300
and all over the country,
all over the world.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.980
And many of us have lived
in isolation.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.270
We were scared of sharing
our own secret.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.660
We didn't know anybody
like ourselves.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.470
A lot of us didn't meet
anybody until

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.970
perhaps later in life.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.220
And the internet has really
changed that.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.900
There are so many resources out
there now for somebody who

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:25.290
is exploring their identity,
thinks, wait, maybe this is me

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.700
when they see a TV
show and wants to

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.860
reach out for support.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.350
It's enough of a support area
that it's hard for us, to be

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.370
honest, sometimes in our legal
cases, because people are used

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.910
to creating a community and
being very open about what

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:39.950
they're going through.

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.850
And if we're litigating a case
of discrimination, the

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.070
Transgender Law Center finds
that our clients have used the

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.630
internet for so much of a
support structure that it is

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:53.540
hard for them to hold back
in what they post on

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.990
social media sites.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.810
And for us, it's a concern
because it might be

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.050
confidential or relate
to their case.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.640
But this is where so many trans

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.840
people are getting support.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.895
It's incredibly critical.

00:17:02.895 --> 00:17:06.490
And that's especially true for
our youth, who may be 10 years

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.109
old in the bootheel
of Missouri.

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:12.045
And 20 years ago, they
wouldn't know a

00:17:12.045 --> 00:17:13.400
soul for many decades.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.790
Now they can go online--

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.400
their parents can go online--

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.180
find out information, find
connections to support groups,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:24.140
realize they're not alone, and
feel empowered to come out

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.650
much more quickly and readily
than they would and to be

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.790
themselves at a much younger
age than we saw

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.380
even 10 years ago.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.280
Even five years ago, at
Transgender Law Center, we

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.400
were not getting the kind of
calls that we get today from

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.860
parents before each school year
or before summer camp.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.840
And a lot of that is because
the internet is

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.420
the place of support.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.460
Now that said, it can also be
the place of harassment.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.050
And so to the extent that it
can help, it can also hurt.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.950
As youth may have social media
sites that reflected their

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.630
original gender, and as they
change, they find it hard to

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.850
get away from that as they go
through their school years.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.580
We get a lot of calls as well
from people asking about their

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.080
privacy because somebody
may have a website.

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.000
They may have had posts.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.570
They may have had a documentary

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.730
they were a part of.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:13.990
And now with the internet,
there's very

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.590
little privacy, actually.

00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.830
It's very hard for somebody to
get away from their previous

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:18.820
identities.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.120
ILONA TURNER: You may
have heard of this.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.610
MASEN DAVIS: Pardon?

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.190
ILONA TURNER: You may have
heard of this concept.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:25.030
MASEN DAVIS: And as you know,
more and more information is

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:26.750
being added to the internet
all the time.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.690
And so we get calls from
people pretty regularly

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.720
saying, oh my gosh.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.810
I realized that there's this
story I wrote when I was 10 on

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:38.360
this website, or this YouTube
video or this comment

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:39.310
somebody's made about me.

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.450
How do I take this down?

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.770
And so this is really a great
thing and a challenging thing

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:47.960
when it comes to the privacy
and awareness

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.440
of transgender people.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.035
Does that help?

00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:52.160
AUDIENCE: That was
great, thank you.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.920
MASEN DAVIS: And it was great
to connect with you all.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.830
Like when somebody really has
something, they're like, oh my

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.700
gosh, how do I get this down,
or if somebody's being

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.080
harassed online, which happens
a lot on the social media

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.680
sites, how to address that.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.580
And I feel like that's an area
for us we really have to

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.750
grapple with, to figure out
what to do when somebody's

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.970
identity's being used
against them online.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:10.790
ILONA TURNER: Right.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.780
We got a call recently from
a parent in Sacramento,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.710
somewhere in the Central Valley
outside of Sacramento.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.970
And it was a mom of a
fifth-grade transgender girl.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.905
And it was like, oh no, what's
this one going to be?

00:19:25.905 --> 00:19:27.800
Oh god, what's the school
doing this time?

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.330
And she said, oh no, I just
wanted to find out how to get

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.590
a replacement Facebook
password.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.510
Because the kid had an old
Facebook account with the old

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.980
gender and wanted
to substitute.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.990
And we were like, OK.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.150
But like, what's going
on at school?

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.230
What's the trouble?

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.760
And she was like, oh no, they're
super accepting.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.650
The school worked with us and
asked the kid when the kid was

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.000
transitioning how she wanted
to make this work.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.600
And she said, I want to have
an assembly, and I want to

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.590
write a letter and have the
principal read it, and I'll be

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.170
standing there.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.080
And they did this.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.090
And after the principal read the
letter, the whole school,

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.380
students and teachers, all came
up and hugged the student

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.720
all together.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.540
I know.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.570
So we get nice calls also.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.050
MASEN DAVIS: So one of the
reasons that youth and

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.260
education issues are important
to us is that we see the

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.700
really negative impacts if
somebody's not able to get a

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.110
decent education.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.710
Even if people are able to do
well in school, we find that

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.310
transgender people face real
barriers to employment.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.370
In fact, in California, we did
some research a few years ago.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.850
And we found that transgender
people were twice as likely to

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.410
have a bachelor's degree
compared to other people in

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.690
the state of California.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.590
Which is awesome, right?

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:42.140
There's a real asset and
resilience in this community.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.660
And yet, as I mentioned
earlier, we also found

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.250
unemployment and poverty
rates that were

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.270
twice the general average.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.800
And salaries between transgender
people who have a

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.190
bachelor's degree and
non-transgender people with a

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.640
bachelor's degree in the state,
there was about a

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.900
$30,000 pay differential.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.150
So we find almost universal
rates of employment

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:03.940
discrimination and harassment
when it comes

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:05.450
to transgender people.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.590
Thankfully, we're not harassed
every day walking down the

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.810
street and at work, or that
would just be absolutely

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:11.760
exhausting.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.920
Most of us find ways
to deal with that.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.350
But nationally, 90% have said
they've experienced

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.700
discrimination at work.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.922
California, those rates are a
little bit better, given that

00:21:20.922 --> 00:21:23.050
we've got some good
nondiscrimination laws.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.580
But still, 70% of Californians
who are transgender say they

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.210
have problems at work.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.820
So given that very few of us are
independently wealthy, we

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.080
still need to be able
to take care of

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.250
ourselves and our families.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.160
So work is really critical.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.710
And we want to figure out how do
we transition the workplace

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.840
so that it can be more accepting
of people who are

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.600
different, whether that
is making sure that

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.420
sex-segregated jobs are
accessible to transgender

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.510
people or looking at what are
traditional modes of female

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.090
and male employment and making
that more open to everybody,

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.740
not just transgender people.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.600
So there's a lot of work
to be done there.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.790
Now it's rare to get really
blatant discrimination.

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.290
Oftentimes, the discrimination
and harassment people face is

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.060
much more subtle.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.090
Because I think we are more
sophisticated these days.

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.610
And to be honest, most people
want to do the right thing.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.460
They just don't know
what that is.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.570
But there are times when
we get very blatant

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.100
discrimination that we have to
act on, and where you can't

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.870
just fix it by education
alone.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.980
You want to talk a little bit
about one big case that we had

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.060
last year that made
a big precedent?

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.770
And then we can talk about
its implications.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:29.360
ILONA TURNER: Sure, sure.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.250
So over the last couple years,
we were representing a

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:37.050
transgender woman named Mia Macy
who was applying for a

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.060
job with the federal
government.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.690
She had been working as a police
detective in Arizona

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.190
for 13 years.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.770
She was highly trained in
ballistics tracking.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:55.630
And she applied for a civilian
job with a lab of the Alcohol,

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.360
Tobacco, and Firearms
Bureau, ATF.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.910
And when she was applying
for this job, she was

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.520
still living as male.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.560
She was assigned male at birth,
but coming to realize

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.990
that she was, in fact, a woman
and starting to make that

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.270
transition.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.740
And so she applied for the job,
and they told her, oh

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.750
yes, you're a shoo-in.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:17.600
You've already been trained
on our equipment.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.690
You're by far the most qualified
person we could

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:21.640
imagine for this job.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.400
So she's going through the--

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.910
they said, we just have to go
through this paperwork and

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.710
background check, but
it's a formality.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.290
The job is yours.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:33.000
So she packed up her family,
moved from Arizona to Walnut

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.210
Creek, where the job was.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.950
And shortly before the job was
supposed to start, just a

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.990
couple weeks, she called up the
lab and said, by the way,

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.670
I need to tell you I've just
been getting my documents

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:51.570
updated, driver's license and
so forth, because I'm

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:53.770
transgender, and so I'll
be coming to work

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.700
as a woman, as Mia.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.950
And they said, oh, OK, and got
back to her just a few days

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.920
later and said, oh, so sorry.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.340
Funding for this position
has been cut.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.040
There's no more job.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.360
Although she later found out
that, actually, somebody else

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.990
had been hired with far
less experience.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:19.710
So we filed a complaint
on her behalf.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.770
And that went all the way
up to the Federal Equal

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.100
Employment Opportunity
Commission,

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:25.930
the EEOC, last year.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.880
And we got an amazing,
groundbreaking decision from

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.900
the EEOC saying that transgender
people are

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.730
protected from discrimination
under federal law, under the

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:40.150
existing sex discrimination
law, Title VII.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.040
So there's currently no
federal law that--

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.800
like we have in California a law
that says that employers

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.010
can't discriminate based on
gender identity or gender

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:48.530
expression.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:50.590
It uses those words right
there in the law.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.580
But on the federal level, we
don't have that yet, although

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.640
there's a bill that's been
proposed, the Employment

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.160
Non-Discrimination Act, ENDA,
to try to do that for both

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.840
sexual orientation and
gender identity.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:04.200
But the really exciting thing
about this case was that this

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.850
agency that exists to interpret
the federal

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.070
employment discrimination laws
said, no, transgender people

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:14.160
are protected now, already,
under the existing sex

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.070
discrimination laws.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.850
To discriminate against someone
because they're

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:22.290
transgender is a form of sex
discrimination, flat out.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:23.900
MASEN DAVIS: And if I can
piggyback on that,

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:25.610
that's a big deal.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:28.340
It means now that transgender
people and gender

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:31.480
non-conforming people throughout
the United States

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:34.520
have legal recourse if they
experience discrimination, as

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.800
long as they work for
a company that

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.510
has 15 or more employees.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:43.800
So in the majority of states
that don't have LGBT workplace

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.660
protections, folks can go to
their local EEOC office, file

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.550
a complaint, and have
it investigated.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.160
It's a really important
opportunity for us, a moment

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.540
for us to educate employers,
too, that they're on the hook.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.050
And that even if you're in the
deep South or in Missouri,

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.970
where I am from, now you have
a legal obligation to make

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.750
sure that transgender people
are able to be

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.800
treated fairly at work.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.480
The other thing that's neat
about this is that this

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.220
interpretation, now, is also
being used in other parts of

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.360
the federal government.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.450
So while it was intended to
determine what sex means

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.910
around employment protections
for Title VII, it's also being

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.530
used by groups like the Social
Security Administration as

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.470
they are looking at their
nondiscrimination ordinance

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.950
and interpreting sex to include
transgender people.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.590
It's being used by Health and
Human Services as they look at

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.800
the nondiscrimination provisions
for the Affordable

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.800
Care Act, where they're
interpreting sex to include

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.930
transgender people.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.760
It's also true for schools
in the federal context.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.840
So we now went from, because
of this decision, very few

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.200
federal protections to actually
having a lot more

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.530
legal recourse for transgender
people when it comes to

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.580
discrimination impacting
the federal government.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.710
That's a real game-changer
for us.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.490
ILONA TURNER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.060
Thinking about what you said,
that a lot of people--

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:00.180
so there's a lot of subtle
discrimination against

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.380
transgender people, right?

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.570
But there also is a shockingly
high amount still of calls

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.440
that we're getting where
employers really just don't

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.940
seem to realize that they have
any legal obligations and are

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.890
still, especially in certain
parts of the country, saying

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.770
things like, if an employee
comes out as transgender,

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.850
saying, oh, I just don't think
that the other employees would

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.920
be comfortable having
you here.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.030
Or we have a client in South
Carolina who was fired after

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.240
she came out as transgender.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.220
She hadn't started transitioning
yet, but her

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:35.420
supervisor let her go just a
couple weeks after she came

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.080
out and said, I'm sorry.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.690
We're a religious company,
and I just think what

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.690
you're doing is wrong.

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.560
And then she was actually denied
unemployment when she

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:49.710
went to claim that after she
was fired because they put

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.150
that she was fired for cause,
and the cause was "intent to

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:57.450
violate the company
dress code."

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:01.380
So yeah, they're really
willing to be pretty

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.070
blatant about it.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.620
And that makes our job
easier for sure.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.850
Because that just--

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.865
yeah, we just say,
look at that.

00:28:09.865 --> 00:28:12.280
That's definitely
discrimination.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.690
Sometimes it's more
subtle, though.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.950
We get a lot of calls about
harassment that transgender

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.150
people are facing on the job.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.970
And sometimes it's subtle, and
sometimes it's more blatant.

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:24.530
A lot of it has to
do with pronouns.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:28.180
Sometimes employers or
co-workers have a hard time

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.980
remembering what
pronoun to use.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.240
And that's normal within
a certain range.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.000
Like people might
make a mistake.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.770
But if it happens over and over
again, especially after

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.640
the person is corrected
or instructed by their

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.440
supervisor, hey, that's not
cool, that's actually really

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.150
offensive and hurtful to that
person, then it crosses the

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.620
line into kind of legally
actionable harassment.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.150
We just recently settled a case
on behalf of a police

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:58.300
officer here in the Bay Area
who went through this.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.000
He transitioned to male
a few years back.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.220
And his fellow police officers
just could not accept this.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.390
And a group of them would just
repeatedly call him by female

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:16.230
pronouns, ask him to come out
and pat down female suspects,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.520
even though he's a guy.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.070
And they would also out
him to new staff.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.530
So even people who had never
worked with him when he was

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.660
presenting as female would start
calling him by female

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:29.670
pronouns and doing the
same harassment.

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:33.470
So really problematic, and we
got a nice settlement for him

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:36.204
from the department.

00:29:36.204 --> 00:29:39.280
MASEN DAVIS: Yeah, and making
mistakes occasionally is fine.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.290
We all understand that.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:43.620
But what Ilona was talking about
is oftentimes people

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.520
will say, I just have a block.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.450
I can't accept who you are.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.400
I just can't get this.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.730
And that's when you really
have a problem.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:53.590
But there's a lot of
unintentional stuff that does

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.855
happen in the office.

00:29:54.855 --> 00:29:56.610
So I'm a transgender
man myself.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:57.850
I was born female.

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.750
I went through a lot of steps
and work and years

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.690
to be who I am today.

00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:04.500
And my last job before I was at
the Transgender Law Center

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.530
was a much larger
organization.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.120
And I would come out to my
friends as transgender.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.930
I've done activism in
the transgender

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.780
community for 15 years.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:15.750
So it's not something I hide.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.240
But it also wasn't my work.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.150
So it wasn't the first
thing I told people.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.280
It wasn't on my forehead yet.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.902
Now it is.

00:30:21.902 --> 00:30:25.500
But I had a really well-meaning
friend who I met,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.810
one of my coworkers, who I still
remember very vividly.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.660
We were in our break room where
all of our mailboxes

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.160
were and our coffee.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.660
And we had just met, a
really nice gay guy.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.420
And he's like, so when did
you have the surgery?

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.610
So do you have a genital part?

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.830
And I'm like, I am in my office,
where everybody comes

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.370
to get their mail,
with the coffee.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.830
My genitals should not be a
topic of conversation here.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.470
He was really well-meaning.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.200
He's become a real-- he was
clueless at the time.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.270
And he was trying to connect
with me and show that he was

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:04.550
supportive.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:07.640
And he really put a
foot in his mouth.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.830
That's what not to do.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:11.880
He didn't mean to discriminate
against anybody.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.670
He wasn't trying to
be harassing.

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.530
But it was definitely
anxiety-provoking as I looked

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:19.730
around to see who all was there
and tried to figure out

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:25.390
how to respond to that in
our break room at work.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.850
So some of this is to be really
thoughtful about, is

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.460
this a question you would want
somebody to ask you at work?

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.390
Are you asking about somebody's
private medical

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:34.750
information?

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.340
Are you asking because you
have a reason to know, or

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.670
you're just curious?

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.100
And generally, try to stay away
from the just curious

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.100
questions, at least until
you have a more intimate

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.890
relationship with
that co-worker.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:48.380
Does that makes sense?

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.770
Now, that's different than the
time in the same job when I

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.500
got a call from one of my staff
who had quit a couple

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:55.920
weeks beforehand.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.950
And she had worked with me
for a couple of years.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:59.900
And she said, Masen, I felt
like I needed to call you

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.970
because nobody wanted
to tell you.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.050
But for the last four years,
you have a staff person, a

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.730
colleague, who's taking all of
your new staff and interns out

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.100
to lunch and telling them that
they're really working for a

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:14.580
woman and making fun of you
every time you turn your back.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.600
And I'm sorry nobody told
you that for four years.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.540
Nobody wanted to hurt
your feelings.

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.490
But I thought maybe
you should know.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:22.600
I needed to know.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.300
I'm so glad that they called me,
and that they trusted me.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.940
But this is somebody I worked
with every day in a relatively

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:31.480
small department who was very
actively trying to undermine

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.480
me with staff.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.000
They were not doing that out
of an area of mistake.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.960
Maybe he had some curiosity.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.630
But this was pretty clearly
somebody who was not happy

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:44.190
that they were working with a
transgender person and wanted

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.610
to make sure all of my
colleagues knew that.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.810
Now, that was the one time in
my life I have called up HR

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.820
and said, we've got a problem.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.890
I'm going to hope and assume
that folks know better than to

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.030
do that these days.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.480
But if somebody does share that
they're transgender with

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.740
you, ask them, is that
information you'd like to have

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.240
widely shared?

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.400
Is that private information
about their background that

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.010
they're sharing with you, and
to really respect that.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.210
It's oftentimes a little
nerve-wracking for a

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.450
transgender person to out
themselves for the first time,

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.680
especially if they tend to just
blend into the woodwork

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.880
which, to be honest, most
folks don't think I'm

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.010
transgender when I first
walk into the room.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:27.890
So to really be aware of that
and go to the, not do unto

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:32.370
others as you want them to do to
you, but do unto others as

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.420
they want to be done to them.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.290
So I'm wondering in Google, and
Emily, if you could do an

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:41.470
Oprah again just for a second,
where do you see some of the

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:46.440
unintentional harassment
happening?

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.310
Or are there opportunities
for that to happen

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:51.440
unintentionally, where a
transgender person can have

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.660
their toes stepped on without
folks realizing it?

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.990
Whether that's through the
systems that you have or

00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:59.090
interpersonal relationships.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.160
And I know I'm asking for folks
to take a little bit of

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.190
a risk here.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:06.590
But I come from the assumption
that unintentional bias

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:11.280
happens all the time for people
who don't experience

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.360
the same kind of prejudice or
oppression that some other

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.250
folks around them do.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.570
Anybody willing to
take a risk?

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.639
Where might it happen?

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.650
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
an intern.

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:27.469
The thing I've noticed in the
past two days is there's very

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:30.719
little gender-neutral
bathrooms.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.590
MASEN DAVIS: Very few
gender-neutral bathrooms.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.900
So as we talked about the
issue of schools,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.820
gender-neutral bathrooms
or bathrooms at work

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.800
are a big deal, too.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.880
And not everybody feels
comfortable going into a men's

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.030
room or a women's room.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.030
A lot of folks are afraid
they're going

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.320
to face more scrutiny.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:47.409
They may have had experiences
with harassment.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.340
They may not feel
comfortable with

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:51.080
either of them as choices.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.400
And we definitely see a
movement to creating

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.166
gender-neutral bathrooms
in a lot of spaces.

00:34:56.166 --> 00:34:59.200
In Washington, DC, for example
they passed an ordinance that

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.380
every single-stall restroom in
Washington has to now be a

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.800
gender-neutral restroom that
can be accessed by anybody.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.890
And that's good for transgender
people.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.200
It's also good, oftentimes, for
people with disabilities

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.540
who may need an assistant.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.620
It's good with families
with young kids.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.830
There's a lot of reasons
to embrace

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.950
gender-neutral bathrooms.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.060
And we're finding more
workplaces that are using that

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.270
as an option.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:23.980
Now we never say that
transgender people should be

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.240
forced to use a gender-neutral
restroom, though.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.760
Anybody should have access to
that, and folks should be

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.860
using restrooms that match who
they are and where they're

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.020
going to feel most
comfortable.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.150
Thank you for sharing that.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.510
So that's one structure in a
lot of companies that most

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.330
folks don't think about but
can create kind of an

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:42.750
unintentional barrier for
some of the employees.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.030
Anything else folks
want to share?

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:52.536
AUDIENCE: In Cambridge, one
thing that I [INAUDIBLE] when

00:35:52.536 --> 00:35:55.370
I first joined Google is that
the Women in Engineering group

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:59.015
is very aggressive about trying
to get new engineers

00:35:59.015 --> 00:36:00.500
who happen to be
female to join.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.790
And so there was a
very awkward, I

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:04.060
do not want to join.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.386
This is the nth time you asked
me, where I was getting kind

00:36:06.386 --> 00:36:07.180
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:09.330
Well, why don't you
want to join?

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.610
That's not really any
of your business.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.620
So it's unintentional,
and they're just

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.225
trying to be nice.

00:36:15.225 --> 00:36:18.270
So that's cool that they're
doing that because in general

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.275
that is a positive response.

00:36:19.275 --> 00:36:23.610
But it's unintentional
weird things.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.340
MASEN DAVIS: Thanks
for sharing that.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.090
That's a great example.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:26.430
ILONA TURNER: Right.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:32.010
And I think that just a raised
awareness about the fact that

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.230
transgender people exist, that
maybe everybody doesn't

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.990
identify the way that you might
think that they do based

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:45.350
on your scan of them, that can
make a big difference in just

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:49.440
being respectful and not pushing
things like that.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.980
AUDIENCE: But I think one
really good thing that--

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.630
I was coming from a university
where people are very aware of

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.160
this, and there's a lot
of talk about it.

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.270
There's a lot of
introductions.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.100
My name is this person, and this
is where I'm from, and

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.880
anything else.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.760
But there's never, this is my
preferred gender pronoun.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.980
And that way people know.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.920
Because it is confusing .

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.600
People don't know
how to read me.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.320
Like which one, right?

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.910
But if you just have that into
your introduction, people will

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:17.190
know, and then they
won't mess up.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.560
MASEN DAVIS: We had a new staff
person start this week.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:22.880
And I checked myself
yesterday, and I

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.460
said, you know what?

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.670
Actually, I realize I've been
referring to you as he, but I

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.530
don't know if that's the
pronoun you prefer.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.610
Can you share what your
preferred gender pronoun is?

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.760
And he said, wow, thank
you for asking.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.660
It is he.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.960
But what's up with
the Bay Area that

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.790
people don't ask that?

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.240
Because he comes
from New York.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.410
He's like, in New York, we're
all asking that all the time.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.940
It's part of just respect and
not making assumptions.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.370
So it is a great practice, too,
especially if you aren't

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.900
certain of somebody's gender.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.210
It's really OK to ask, right?

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.010
And some of us are uncomfortable
with that.

00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:52.740
Somehow we're supposed
to know this, right?

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.500
But it's not always possible.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:54.940
ILONA TURNER: Right.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:00.290
And I think your question also
points out that a way to do

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.030
that that's even more inclusive
and respectful is to

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:06.360
start by sharing your own.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.280
If you meet somebody that you're
not sure, or you're in

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.480
a group setting, just to sort
of make it a universal

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.395
question and information.

00:38:13.395 --> 00:38:16.100
My name's Ilona, and my
preferred pronoun is she.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.420
And that opens it up and
doesn't put all of the

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:21.270
scrutiny on that transgender
person.

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:24.990
Like, oh, I'm assuming that
you're different.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.670
MASEN DAVIS: I appreciate people
who have taken the risk

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:27.010
of sharing.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.010
I think it's helpful, and I
would encourage you all to

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.280
normalize some of that
conversation, too, because

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.160
unintentional bias happens
everywhere,

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.190
with so many folks.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.320
And to the extent you can kind
of share, hey, this is how

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.140
this impacts me, I think it will
help Google to continue

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:42.300
to be a leader in this area.

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.850
And I also think, whether it's
in the Gayglers or other work

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:48.150
groups, to talk through what are
ways that Google and other

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.920
companies can address
unintentional bias that can

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.400
emerge, whether that's
interpersonal or structural.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.800
So the last thing I want to
talk about in workplace is

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.540
some of the strategies that
we're seeing that are really

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.850
helpful at this point.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.870
One is looking at corporate
policy.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:06.390
That's been really important,
especially as large companies

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.550
have integrated transgender
issues

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.660
into corporate policies.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.700
It's been very helpful
for folks.

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.150
As Ilona said, there's a real
push towards Title VII and

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.020
making sure we have federal
workplace protections both

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.400
through Title VII and
the Employment

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.800
Non-Discrimination Act.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.520
And we're seeing more and more
states that are passing

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.960
strong, comprehensive
nondiscrimination laws in the

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.460
states as well.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.950
That's all great.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.850
And we need to make sure things
are really happening on

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:32.370
the ground.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.330
So there are some really neat
programs that are evolving

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.990
across the country right now in
this movement, where we're

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:40.790
seeing homegrown job programs
for transgender people.

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:43.440
Here in San Francisco, there's
the Transgender Economic

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.640
Empowerment Initiative and is
also included, they've got a

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.380
program related to it.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.840
I think it's Transcode--

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.900
is that what it's called--

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.140
that's actually teaching
transgender

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.620
people how to do coding.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.020
We've got a lot of folks who
come from the tech world.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.550
And to the extent they've been
able to help people get a foot

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.530
into the door in the tech field,
that's been really

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.940
awesome, especially given that
many of the tech companies

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.910
have been the most embracing
of folks who are different,

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.390
including transgender people.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.940
So nice job on that,
I really love it.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.840
And I just want to mention
that as we're being more

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.150
successful, as we're seeing more
visibility both with our

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:16.930
youth and in the workplace,
and as we're getting more

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.010
passage of nondiscrimination
laws, we're

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:20.565
also seeing more backlash.

00:40:20.565 --> 00:40:22.350
Anybody pay attention
to Arizona?

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:26.230
Has anybody seen Arizona
in the news recently?

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:30.120
So Arizona had a pretty
interesting bill that they had

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.580
introduced this year.

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.700
The city of Phoenix passed a
city nondiscrimination law to

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.870
protect transgender people from

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:38.620
discrimination, which is awesome.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.950
In a lot of states where they're
not ready to pass a

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.150
state law, city laws have
been really important.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.730
Well, a legislator, John
Kavanagh, in Arizona, did not

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.480
like the fact that there
had been this

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.150
bill passed in Phoenix.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.490
So he introduced his own law for
the state which would make

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.910
it a criminal penalty for a
transgender person to use a

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.820
restroom that did not match
the gender marker on their

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.360
birth certificate.

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.240
Now, many of us cannot change
the birth certificate gender

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.980
marker, depending on
where we're from.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.520
All of that's managed
on the state level.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.010
As somebody from Missouri, I
could have them add my new

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:14.580
name and gender, but I
can't have them take

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.250
away the old one.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.760
In some states, you can't
change it at all.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:21.560
So your birth gender is your
gender, as far as your birth

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.120
certificate.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.500
Well, Kavanagh's bill would have
put somebody in jail for

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.370
six months for using a restroom
if it didn't match

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.990
their birth certificate
gender marker.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.660
Thankfully, there
was an uproar.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.630
And this actually passed
the first committee.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.580
This was a bill that really
had some legs in Arizona.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.050
It was very similar to the
anti-immigrant bill that they

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.140
have there where, again, another
"show your papers"

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.640
bill in Arizona.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.220
Thankfully, folks were able to
rally together and to make it

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.170
clear that this would
be ridiculous.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.920
The logic of that bill would
say that I have to use the

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.090
women's room in Arizona, and
I'll tell you, nobody really

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.630
wants that.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.680
And we were able to stop that.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.040
But what happened with Arizona
and Kavanagh is a good symptom

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.640
of an issue we're going
to see arise.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.170
And it's true for almost every
civil rights and social

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:13.440
justice movement in this country
that the more you

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.220
progress, and the more you
have success, the more

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.330
backlash you will see.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.010
And we are starting to see this
as we are seeing more

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:23.790
harassment of people who
are out as transgender.

00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:27.190
We're seeing more
anti-transgender bills that

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.540
are being proposed.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:31.610
And many of those have to do
with restrooms because, to be

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.380
honest, the United
States folks,

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.660
we do not like bathrooms.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.610
We do not like public
restrooms.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.330
We think they smell.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.170
We want to avoid them
as much as we can.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.090
It doesn't matter if you're
a woman or a man.

00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.310
It's just not a popular place.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.070
And anti-transgender people
realize this and have tried to

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:53.040
pair up nondiscrimination laws
with restroom issues in a way

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.760
that's been really damaging
for a lot of folks.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.830
So I do urge you to keep
an eye on this.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.590
And with Arizona, he finally
realized this was not going to

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:02.100
work and pulled the bill back.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:04.230
But this is really the next
frontier that we're going to

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:08.310
have to continue to fight as the
success that we see also

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:12.594
has an equal and opposite
reaction to it.

00:43:12.594 --> 00:43:14.765
Do you want to talk about
health care quickly?

00:43:14.765 --> 00:43:15.540
ILONA TURNER: Yeah.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.870
So just in a couple minutes,
the last issue we wanted to

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.270
talk about was health care.

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:26.220
This is a major issue for a
lot of transgender people,

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.270
just simply being able to access
health care at all, in

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:34.040
some cases, being turned away,
being denied health insurance

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:37.780
because they are transgender,
which is viewed as a

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.690
pre-existing condition,
transgender people being

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:46.790
denied sex-specific care that
they need just because they

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:48.340
may have changed their
gender marker with

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:49.600
the insurance company.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.660
So we see transgender men being
denied pap smears that

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:57.200
they need, transgender women
denied prostate exams, and

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.620
some people being denied care
for a whole range of bizarre

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:03.330
sounding reasons.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:07.910
We had a client who was denied
treatment for a broken bone

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:11.380
because the insurance company
said, oh, that must be related

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.200
to the hormones that
you're taking.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.650
It must have weakened your
bones, and so we're not going

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:17.500
to cover it.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.790
And this is related to the fact
that a large percentage,

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.400
the majority of health insurance
plans in this

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.500
country right now, have explicit
exclusions written

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.440
into them for health care that
transgender people need.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:33.700
MASEN DAVIS: Thankfully,
this is changing.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.670
There is a surge of activism
to address this issue,

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.530
especially as the Affordable
Care Act is about to be

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:41.920
implemented throughout
the United States.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.920
And there now have been four
states and the District of

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.410
Columbia that have now said that
it is no longer legal in

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.440
those states to have
transgender-specific

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:53.320
exclusions in health
care policies.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.420
Thankfully, California is
one of those states.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.020
So this is a real sea change
where we now have a good

00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.470
percentage of states that are
now starting to look at this

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.510
issue as they're doing
implementation around the

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.210
Affordable Care Act and looking
at opportunities to

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.920
make sure that all people are
actually able to have the

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.260
coverage they need, including
transgender people.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:13.910
There have been some real
interesting focus groups

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.280
around the country to learn
about what people know about

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.540
the Affordable Care Act.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.490
And what we've heard is
transgender people are among

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.720
the most vocal because we have
so much to gain or to lose

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.660
with what's happening.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.580
So for folks who are interested
in getting involved

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.320
in that or learning more,
please come talk to us

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.600
afterwards.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.300
We're tight on time, so I'm
going to make sure we give our

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.980
last few minutes for any
questions folks may have.

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.530
ILONA TURNER: I just want to
add one last thing on the

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:36.730
health care front, which is that
we're also seeing a lot

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:42.720
of action from employers,
including Google was one of

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.830
the pioneers in this area.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:48.110
And it's so helpful when that
sort of thing happens,

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:53.090
especially from such a prominent
company that can set

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:56.460
an example for other companies
to say, this isn't impossible.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.570
You can negotiate with your
health insurance company.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.430
You can make this happen.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.560
And it makes such a difference
in the lives of trans

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.200
employees, makes people more
productive, happier.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.620
It just should be a no-brainer,
but it's really

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:13.030
helpful to have this
kind of example.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.450
MASEN DAVIS: So I hope you all
will join me in realizing that

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.720
we're not done, even as we get
hopefully a great ruling from

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.650
the Supreme Court in
the next 10 days.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:25.200
We have a lot more work to do
around school and our youth,

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.870
around jobs, around health
care, around a myriad of

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.800
issues impacting
our community.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.110
And as we get into the last
five minutes of questions,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.660
we'd love to hear any clarifying
questions you all

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:38.300
may have here and also any ideas
you have of how do we

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.650
spread the word to make sure
people realize that we're not

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:44.430
done, that we have not ended
at all the long march to

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.640
equality, but we have a
lot more work to do.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.720
And if you have thoughts
about that, we would

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.800
love to hear it.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.305
We're starting some social media
campaigns at this point.

00:46:52.305 --> 00:46:57.650
One is called More Than
Marriage, #morethanmarriage,

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.240
really elevating a lot of the
issues that have impacted

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.390
especially more marginalized
members of the LGBT community,

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:05.520
making sure people are talking
about the need still for

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.950
education and health care and
immigration and so many issues

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:12.320
that have not had the same kind
of media presence but

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.040
continue to be really critical
for our communities.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.750
So with that, I'll open up
for questions and ideas.

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.690
EMILY METCALF: As you might
know, Google's mission is to

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:23.990
organize the world's information
and make it

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:26.200
universally accessible.

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.630
You mentioned at the beginning
of your talk that a lot of

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:32.480
folks are finding out about
transgender issues via the

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.370
internet at a younger
and younger age.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.160
What might Google or other tech
companies be able to do

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:42.280
to help the younger generation
find out what they need to

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.305
know to transition earlier
in their lives?

00:47:45.305 --> 00:47:46.320
MASEN DAVIS: That's
a great question.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.700
I think there are a lot
of little things.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:49.620
There's probably a bigger one,
too, that I want some more

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.700
time to think about.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.360
But some things that we've
talked about in our office.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.260
You all have--

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.380
I'm sorry, I apologize, I
don't know what you call

00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.410
them-- but the images that show
up when you first do the

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.240
search engine.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.880
When you first go to Google--

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.760
AUDIENCE: Doodles.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.830
MASEN DAVIS: What do
you call them?

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:05.910
Your doodles, yes.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:06.580
I love the doodles.

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:07.750
I just didn't know what
they were called.

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:09.430
I apologize.

00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.340
But we've talked about how
powerful it would be to have

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.640
an LGBT or especially a T doodle
at some point, maybe on

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.260
some sort of day that we
could commemorate.

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:22.710
That would open up this issue
to so many folks.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.090
How do we make sure that the
organizations that are doing

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.170
really interesting work, and
especially those working with

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:30.000
youth, that provide more public
education, making sure

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.940
that they're able to be high
up on the search engine

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:35.010
results, so people find that?

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:37.720
I think there's been a
lot of improvement.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.560
It used to be if you searched
for "transgender," you would

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.070
not get advocacy groups.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.450
I'll just say that.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.250
You got a lot of
adult content.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.380
And that has already changed
significantly over the years--

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.170
thank you--

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.090
so that people can now get
some basic information.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.970
But we have a lot of different
sites out there that have

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:56.780
pieces of information.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.780
We have yet to really have a
lot of that in one place

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:02.150
that's easily accessible,
especially for the kids.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:03.890
So it might be interesting to
think through how do we make

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.320
sure that that is much easier
to find for folks.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.740
And then the last thing I want
to reiterate earlier, I think

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:11.340
the harassment issue is real.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:16.250
So what can we do to address
when people are being outed

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:20.670
online, if they're bring
harassed in the social media

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:24.540
sites, how do we address that?

00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:28.110
We feel a lot of urgency
around that right now.

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:30.066
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys.

00:49:30.066 --> 00:49:32.980
Before the talk, you were
chatting about issues like

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.910
symbology and branding,
for example, for

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.410
Transgender Law Center.

00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:49.220
Speaking more broadly, how do
we develop iconography or

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:54.080
representatives, heroes
of the trans movement.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.620
What do we have to rally behind,
what people, what

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.500
images, what symbology?

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:03.390
We don't have as much as the
broader LGBT movement yet.

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:05.060
Are we moving in
that direction?

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:06.960
Do we have poster children,
heroes?

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.354
What do we have?

00:50:08.354 --> 00:50:10.760
MASEN DAVIS: Do you have
an answer back there?

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.760
AUDIENCE: There's an inherent
tension for

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.260
organizations like TLC--

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.690
and I think you and I have
had a version of this

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:16.300
conversation--

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:23.260
in terms of how bold its logo is
in terms of they're sending

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.690
letters to people.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:29.020
And having an envelope that
necessarily outs the people on

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:31.850
the other end is problematic.

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:34.330
On the other hand, I personally
feel really

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:38.110
strongly we need something that
is the equivalent of the

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:39.560
HRC equals sign.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:45.540
We need something that
absolutely says, in

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.500
unambiguous terms, "trans,"
that unambiguously says

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.890
"proud."

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:57.585
And there are other
organizations.

00:50:57.585 --> 00:50:58.855
There are other
non-organizations.

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:03.830
A woman named Jen Richards in
Chicago has a project called

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:10.550
We Happy Trans, which is all
about promoting positive

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:15.270
images of trans people
post-transition.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:19.640
And for this exact purpose, she
ran an event called Trans

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.850
100, which Masen was one
of the people who was

00:51:23.850 --> 00:51:31.440
highlighted, and identifying
people who are by action, by

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:41.420
visibility, by impact, heroes,
significant people in the

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.410
trans movement.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.870
But yeah, we need something
that's like the HRC equals

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.350
sign that isn't just TLC.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.650
MASEN DAVIS: I totally
agree with that.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.750
The Trans 100 I think
was great.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.950
They did an event in Chicago,
did social media and print

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.570
media around 100 people who've
been active and made a

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:05.720
difference in the
trans movement.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:09.060
That was a real watershed, in
part because most of the media

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.040
around transgender people has
been-- like the Day of

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.750
Remembrance is our best known
day, which commemorates all

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:17.120
the people we've lost to
anti-transgender violence.

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.310
We've had a lot of things where
we commemorate people

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.840
who have died, but usually
through violence or HIV and

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.090
AIDS, which disproportionately
impacts our community.

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:27.650
There have been very few
campaigns to really get out

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:28.670
the good stories.

00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:31.720
We have folks who have
contributed so much in so many

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.620
different fields.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.070
Many people don't know it.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:36.310
And there are a lot of reasons
for that, but I do think we're

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:40.390
ready to be much more visible,
much more powerful as a people

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:41.270
and as a movement.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.720
We have yet to find that
equals sign moment.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.210
There is a transgender symbol,
but it's a little clunky, in

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:48.910
my opinion.

00:52:48.910 --> 00:52:50.070
We're not quite there yet.

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:51.170
But I think we're
getting there.

00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.880
And if any of you are great
strategists and graphic

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:56.620
designers, let's work together
to create that.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.730
But it is time.

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:00.670
And in many ways, we're very
much like where the gay and

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:03.850
lesbian movement was 20 or 30
years ago, where the media

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:11.072
representations were as victims
or killers or the joke

00:53:11.072 --> 00:53:12.190
of the sitcom.

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.790
And we're ready to move.

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:17.190
We're ready to go and
have our moment.

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:18.160
We have a lot of needs.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.040
We've got a lot of momentum.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.870
And I do think that this is a
moment for us to really make

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.220
this a reality.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:28.690
EMILY METCALF: What I want to
make sure to do before we end

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.590
the talk is to announce that
for those of you who aren't

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:35.510
aware, Go Transgender has a
lot of information about

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:39.120
resources on transitioning and
transgender issues at Google,

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:43.570
including a list of
gender-neutral bathrooms in

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:44.380
various buildings.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.320
So that's a really
great resource.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.190
MASEN DAVIS: And can I also
just say, thank you all.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:52.570
Google has been a leader
in policies supporting

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:55.090
transgender people
here, on the job.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.570
And you've had great
health care.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:58.835
I hope it continues to
be great health care.

00:53:58.835 --> 00:53:59.800
I see nods.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:00.860
That's awesome.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.250
I'm so grateful for you all and
your leadership in this,

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:06.380
and also your support of
Transgender Law Center and of

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:07.500
this movement.

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.750
It's made a big difference to
us, and we look forward to

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:11.150
continuing to partner
together.

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:12.700
Thanks.

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:13.390
EMILY METCALF: Thanks so much.

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.740
And please, everybody give
a round of applause for--

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:22.427
[APPLAUSE]
