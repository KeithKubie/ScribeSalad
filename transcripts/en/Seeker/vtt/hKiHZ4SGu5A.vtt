00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.620
Anthony: Cristen would it weird you out if I
told you I brought you here to talk about

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.799
farts?

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:12.360
Cristen: [Raspberry sound]

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.009
Anthony: That was a good one.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.130
Anthony: Hey guys Anthony here for Dnews.
I've got Cristen here with me with me.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.490
Cristen: Hello.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.199
Anthony: Hello, from Stuff Mom Never Told
You.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.159
Man, we had some questions. We got together
and we were thinking about farts, you guys.

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:37.630
Cristen: Yeah, lots of questions about farts,
and especially who farts more: women or men?

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.840
Anthony: Who farts more? Who farts worse?
Who's more disgusting, basically, is kinda

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.050
what we're into.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.690
We should start out by saying that we compared
and, we didn't directly compare, we didn't

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.250
hang out and fart together all day, but according
to studies, the average person, regardless

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.150
of gender, farts 10 times a day. Ten times
a day.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.980
Cristen: That seems like a lot of farting
going on. What are farts made of? Why do they

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.800
stink so bad?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.020
Anthony: Well the first ingredient of fart
is hydrogen sulfide. So this is kinda that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.890
poisonous, rotten egg smell, and this is the
smell that does come from things like swamp

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.039
gas, sewers, maneur.

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:22.039
And it's kind of like when the exhaust from
these rotting things are in an absence of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.600
oxygen. And so that's actually coming out
of your butt.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.859
Cristen: That is so pleasant.

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.009
Anthony: Yeah it is about is actually poisonous.
That's the thing. It is a legitimately poisonous

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.039
gas, although we don't have enough of it in
our flatulence to actually poison ourselves,

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.929
thank goodness.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.359
Cristen: That's good because I mean that would
mean that dutch ovens could be lethal.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:47.139
Anthony: Yeah methanethiol, which is the second
thing, which I think I said right. I don't

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.759
know. Is the smell of decomposing vegetables.
And also vegetable stew when you're cooking

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.200
vegetables.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.200
And the third ingredient is dimethyl sulfide,
which'm is a sweet smell, according to all

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.920
accounts.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.670
This comes from corn, cabbage, beats, that
sort of thing.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.700
Cristen: It really does sound like something
you'd bring to a potluck.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.760
Anthony: What's interesting about this, is
even though we all have the the same individual

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.360
components in our farts, everyone has a fart
fingerprints.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.610
Each of our farts is a little bit different
and that could lead to why we don't mind the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.939
smell of our own farts or notice them as much.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.769
Cristen: Men, women: who's farting more?

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.269
Anthony: I'm gonna say women.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.430
Cristen: Well, okay you're wrong.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.530
Men fart more because, I mean you've got bigger
bodies, so you gonna produce more fart. And

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.329
the amount of gas that men produce, per fart, is about
half a cup.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.780
Anthony: So that's four ounces, ten times
a day, you are fartin a forty. Yeah think

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.590
about that, men.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.319
So how about women? Where do you guys match
up here?

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.750
Cristen: I mean we're farting less but not
much less. We still produce about a third

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.680
of a cup, of fart, per fart.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.849
Anthony: Huh, daintier for sure. But not that
much.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.180
So whose farts smell worse.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.180
Cristen: Okay here's the thing. Women might
produce daintier sized farts, but not daintier

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.049
smelling farts.

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:26.049
Because, and there has been research on this,
there is imperical, peer-reviewed, evidence,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.920
that women, ladies, we have stinkier farts.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.480
Anthony: How do we cut down on these farts?
How do we make these things stop?

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.150
Number one thing you can do is quit eating
red meat.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.980
Cristen: Yeah. That's actually been number
one dietary culprit of farts.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.579
Anthony: Broccoli, brussel sprouts, that's
gonna make you fart, guys, don't eat those.

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.000
Cristen: And bad news for the weekend, if
you're looking to blow off some steam. Beer.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.870
Anthony: Blow off some steam. I see what you
did there.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.239
Cristen: Yeah, cause beer makes you fart.
But, see there's an upside to this. Because

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.769
beer might make you fart more, but beer also
makes you care less about farting more. So

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.489
I think the beer thing cancels itself out.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.439
Anthony: So there it is. Men and women, equally
farting, equally disgusting. It's kind of

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.319
a beautiful story.

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.159
You know this is normally where I would ask
you a question. A question about the video.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.600
I don't want to know how much you guys are
farting.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.930
I don't know that.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:19.889
So we're not gonna ask that.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.360
Instead we're gonna ask Cristen where can
we see Stuff Mom Never Told You?

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.310
Cristen: You can see Stuff Mom Never Told
You at YouTube.com/stuffmomnevertoldyou.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.639
Anthony: There you go. Is entirely about farting?
The show?

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.400
Cristen: Really only about every other video
is about farting.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.110
Anthony: So either way you're 50/50 you're
covered by watching the show. And be sure
