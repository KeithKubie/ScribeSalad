00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Unit 5 combines ideas from graph search that we studied in Unit 3 with ideas about computing

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
statistic that we look at in Unit 4 and it puts these tools together to give us the way

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of finding shortest path in these networks.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Social networks come in many different flavors.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Some of them consist of simple yes/no connections between the individuals in the network

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but others include more detailed information about the strength of those connections.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll also going to look at approximation algorithms which are key tools

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
for applying algorithms to a very large data seqs like these social networks.

00:00:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's get started.
