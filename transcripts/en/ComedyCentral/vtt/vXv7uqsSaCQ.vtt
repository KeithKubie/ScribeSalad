00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.668
Man, white people
love protesting.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.637
There's like shit going
down here every other day.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.474
Stop cultural appropriation.
Stop karaoke night.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.809
You've never felt injustice
you had to stand up for?

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.544
Uh, even if I did,
I can't do anything about it.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:12.878
The conditions
on my student visa

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.181
prevent me from participating
in political protest.

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.884
No, that can't be true.
Yeah, it is. Wow.

00:00:19.618 --> 00:00:22.355
I had no idea you were
living under this oppression.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:23.990
You're living under
this oppression, too.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.259
What do you mean? You're here
on a student visa, right?

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.494
Yeah, so? That means
you're an international student.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:30.863
Yeah, but I'm American, OK?
Our rights travel with us.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.765
No, that's not how it works.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.534
Guys, can I get you
to keep walking

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.802
because we're just going to
shut down this protest.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.304
Yeah, it's fine.
We're not protesting.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.772
That doesn't matter.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.741
I just need you to move on
so we can clear the area out.

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.409
Or else what? You going to
beat the shit out of us?

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.778
No, I'm just asking you
to move on, mate.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.313
Look, it's OK.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.882
He just doesn't like people
telling him what to do.

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.016
Yo, I will move when
I'm goddamn ready to move

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.518
and not one second earlier.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.054
No, I reckon you'll start
moving right now, champ.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.860
Oh yeah?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.660
You just going to
stand here all day now?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.840
Yeah. You can't let people with
no authority push you around.

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:19.645
That's how dictatorships happen.
OK, Malcolm X, come on.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.147
Let's go before
your visa gets canceled.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:24.583
OK, but I'm only moving
right now because I choose to,

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.252
not because I'm following
your instructions.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.954
Yeah, whatever, asshole.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:40.065
Oh hey, look.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:42.135
They opened a bubble tea place
right next to where Asher works.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.703
Bubble tea?
What the hell is bubble tea?

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.373
Bubble tea. You've never
had bubble tea before?

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.808
No.
What's that floating black shit?

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.044
RONNY: It's pearls.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.813
What the (bleep), man?
Pearls aren't for eating.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.247
They're made of tapioca,
you idiot.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:58.218
Still. God, looks like
something from "Fear Factor."

00:01:58.218 --> 00:01:59.652
You get that reference?

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:01.554
- Yeah. No one's asking you
to try it, all right?

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.256
No offense, man.
It does not look good.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:05.425
You left America to not
experience any other cultures.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.127
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.765
Hello?
Hi.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:14.734
Hey. Thanks for stopping by.
Yeah, no problem.

00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:16.135
Oh, do you want
some raw almonds?

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.837
No, I'm OK.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.108
Is this a shop or where
people dump their used food?

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:25.278
Not fancy enough for you? Fancy?
It's a hygiene issue.

00:02:25.278 --> 00:02:26.946
People are going
to eat this, right?

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.015
As long as I've been here,
we've never had any complaints.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:31.384
Maybe because everyone died
immediately after eating it.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.053
Why is it so grubby?
Oh my God, look at the fruit.

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:35.688
Someone took a bite
out of this.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:36.989
And why does
everything look like

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.524
it's been dragged
through the mud?

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.460
Because it's farm-to-table.
More like shit-to-mouth.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.297
This is where socially conscious
people on a budget shop.

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.798
Well, why are there
no price tags?

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.232
How do you know
how much anything costs?

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:48.935
It's pay what you feel.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.639
Pay what you feel.
Yeah. We have a donation bowl.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.642
OK. So your business model
is begging. Got it.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:58.177
So then why do you
even need to be here?

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.879
It's just a job, Ronny.
Calm down.

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:05.151
[phone beeping]
Oh shit. What?

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.087
I totally forgot I have
a meeting with Professor Dale

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.523
right now to discuss
my last essay.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:13.292
So go. I have to tell him
I can't make it.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:15.995
What, because of this?
No, no, no.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.463
Your first job
is being a student.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:19.632
You don't work and your parents
pay for everything.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.401
I can't do uni work
if I'm homeless and starving.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.769
Wait. Wait.
Hang on. Hang on.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.438
How about I just cover
your shift for the day?

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:26.639
It's harder than you think.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.608
What if you (bleep)
something up?

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:30.610
There is an open vat
of self-serve yogurt

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.111
with animal hair in it.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.547
I'll tell Todd
you're covering my shift for me.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.649
Just please
don't get me fired.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:39.118
Trust me. I got this.
I'll be back in an hour tops.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.953
Take the whole day if you want.
We'll see about that.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:42.721
Just stand behind the counter
and help customers.

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:44.156
What, I can't help customers
from the front?

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:47.159
I'm joking.
I'm just joking.

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.463
See? Behind the counter.
Go, go, go. I got it.

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:12.685
What is this?
What is grass jelly? Red bean?

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:17.856
And tea? What the (bleep)?
Oh. Hey, Wei Jun.

00:04:19.057 --> 00:04:22.261
So what's good here?
Uh, bubble tea.

00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:24.363
CRAIG: What are you having?

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:26.065
WEI JUN: Taro milk tea
with taro pudding.

00:04:26.965 --> 00:04:28.968
Yeah. I'll get one, too.

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.636
First time
for everything, right?

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:35.441
Hey, can I get two taro milks?
You want pearls? Yeah, sure.

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:39.645
You know what? Extra pearls.
Go hard or go home, right?

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:43.116
Put that shit in.
Keep the change.

00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:52.625
Thank you. Cheers, everyone.
To international experiences.

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.666
CRAIG (VOICEOVER): Wait.
What is this taste?

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.870
It's so creamy, but sweet.
And the pearls.

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:10.075
Chewy and refreshing. I've never
had anything like this before.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:17.116
It's-- it's-- it's-- Amazing!

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:26.525
What are you doing?
Get down. These animals.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.896
Paying for stuff with string?
What the (bleep) is this?

00:05:31.763 --> 00:05:33.566
Oh, sorry.
I don't have any spare change,

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.268
but feel free to take whatever
rotting fruit you want.

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:40.373
I'm Todd. Asher told me
you were taking over her shift.

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.141
Oh, Todd.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:45.411
Thanks for letting me take over
on such short notice.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:48.381
No problem. How about you start
with the produce over here?

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:51.250
Oh, like stacking it?

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.387
No, rubbing dirt on it.
People love that organic,

00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:57.990
fresh-from-the-ground
feel with their produce.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.695
OK. Here's a crazy suggestion.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:06.899
I-- I think more people
would buy the produce

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.969
if it looked clean and edible.
Just putting it out there.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.303
Are we going to have
a problem here?

00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:12.939
Because Asher vouched for you.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.040
No-- yeah-- ye-- of course.
I'm sorry. You're right.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.209
Whatever you want I'll rub
wherever you want onto anything.

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:18.543
You're in charge.

00:06:18.543 --> 00:06:20.212
But when you're done
with the produce,

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:21.714
if you really want
to clean something,

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.617
you can deal with the self-serve
grain station over here.

00:06:24.617 --> 00:06:26.151
Oh, you want me
to throw that shit out?

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.686
Yeah, no problem.

00:06:27.686 --> 00:06:29.388
No, I want you
to sort through it.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.794
You want me to-- you want me
to organize the grain?

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.030
No pain, no grain.

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:43.336
Yo, can I get a passion fruit
popping boba with pearls?

00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:54.814
Coconut grape jelly with pearls.
Coconut jelly popping boba.

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:57.483
Huh! Huh!
Huh!

00:06:57.483 --> 00:06:59.352
Can you please put your shirt
back on?
