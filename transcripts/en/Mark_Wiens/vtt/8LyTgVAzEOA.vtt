00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.970
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.530
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Tashkent and this is day three

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.630
of our ultimate food
tour across Uzbekistan.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.177
Today we are driving from
Tashkent to Samarkand.

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:13.130
Samarkand is one of the most historical,

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.340
oldest inhabited cities in Central Asia.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.670
It was an important
stop along the Silk Road

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.030
and so we're gonna drive there today.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.850
We're gonna stop to eat some
amazing food along the way

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.211
and we're on our way now, we're leaving.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.378
(upbeat guitar music)

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.339
Let's go, let's go, go, go.

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:35.418
(baby babbles)

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:37.157
Let's go, Micah.

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:40.731
Let's go, Micah, come on.

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.030
(speaks foreign language)
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.230
- [Mark] Good morning, how are you?

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.800
- How are you, Mark, nice.
- Good, how are you?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.397
Good morning, hello.
- Hello, how are you?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.810
- We've got about an hour
drive to the first stop,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.160
the first food stop,
we're gonna eat some fish.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.850
Okay, that was about an hour drive.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.350
We've arrived to, oh,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.070
we're still along the side of the highway,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.483
but there are some, I guess
these are fish restaurants.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.900
Just, yeah, really cool looking spots.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.800
They're pretty good-sized
fish, river fish.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.440
I think they're carp, a type of carp.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.553
I can't wait to eat fish,
Uzbek fish, for the first time.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:27.291
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.208
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:35.183
(knife chopping)

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.650
She took the fish, she just
machete chopped it into chunks

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.117
and now I think they're gonna fry it.

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:50.867
(fire crackling)

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.597
(laughs) Yes.

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:01.495
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:04.078
(oil sizzling)

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:08.500
They really bumped up the fire,

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.560
stoked it with wood and
then heated up the oil

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.530
and then she tossed in
the fish into that oil.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.313
It's sizzling away, oh, that smells great.

00:02:17.547 --> 00:02:20.010
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.843
That's this restaurant?

00:02:20.843 --> 00:02:23.307
- Yeah, it's this place.
- Chinoz Ri-ber-ja-ka, okay.

00:02:23.307 --> 00:02:24.510
- Chinoz Ri-ber-ja-ka.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.131
- So this place is called
Chinoz Ri-ber-ja-ka.

00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:28.297
- Ri-ber-ja-ka.

00:02:28.297 --> 00:02:29.230
- Ri-ber-ja-ka.
- Yes.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.813
(oil sizzling)

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:40.021
- [Mark] Whoa, what.

00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:53.481
(speaking in foreign language)
(upbeat music)

00:03:02.277 --> 00:03:03.300
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.100
That was incredible, okay,
the fish right out the oil,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.660
sizzling still, like, on fire.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.270
She put it onto a plate,
just drained that oil,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.890
and then she has this garlic lemon mixture

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.710
that she just sprinkled, she
anointed on top of the fish,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.410
and you could just hear the fish hissing,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.110
you could smell the garlic.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.300
Then she drained off the water,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.950
so then it just coated on the garlic.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.413
And then she sprinkled on, I
think it's dill and cilantro.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.860
The fish is just blooming,
it's really blooming.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.710
You can really smell the aroma of the dill

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.030
because the dill has, well, garlic also,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.880
but the dill has just seared kinda

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.150
because of the hot fish.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.620
She put it right onto the hot fish.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.870
And it's just a mountain of fish.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.460
There's salad, there's tomato sauce.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.780
We are all sitting down.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.210
We have a small group here,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.042
all of us that are going to Samarkand.

00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:52.875
Hannah.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:53.968
- Hello. (giggles)

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:55.544
(speaking in foreign language)
(dish clatters)

00:03:55.544 --> 00:03:56.627
- [Woman] Oh!

00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:01.923
- Oh, it is juicy, look at that.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.863
Oh, wow.

00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:05.310
So far since being in Uzbekistan,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.120
we've eaten a lot of
lamb and a lot of meat,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.070
but this is the first time to eat fish.

00:04:11.782 --> 00:04:12.615
Oh.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.693
Oh, wow.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.650
Oh, that's incredible.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.070
It's so, it's juicy.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.560
It's, like, and very soft,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.560
but then you've got that crunchy skin,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.820
you've got the essence of the garlic

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.010
which she just sprinkled all over it.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.623
And what you can also do is
dip it into the tomato sauce.

00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:35.300
This is like a light, just
almost like a tomato soup.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.790
I'll just dip the whole thing in there,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.530
and I think it is tastier to
just grab it with your fingers

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.843
and just bite it, bite into it.

00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:44.867
(slurps)

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:50.030
Mm, mm, mm, the tomato
sauce is just like a,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.360
it's very light, it tastes
like a tomato puree,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.000
but that's been kinda watered down.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.740
It's just refreshing, slightly tart.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.960
I'm gonna go ahead and just pour

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.619
on some of this tomato sauce a little bit.

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:01.177
(lively guitar music)

00:05:01.177 --> 00:05:03.260
(slurps)

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.720
That move where she sprinkled
on the garlic water,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.360
that is a move.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.010
So you just taste the
essence of the garlic,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.380
but it's not that, it's
not a pungent garlic,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.933
but it's just mellowy there.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.610
And you can also pick up the tomato sauce

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.510
and just drink it.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.400
Oh, yeah, I got a whole
strand of dill in that.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.960
It has that kind of
Clamato or V8 taste to it,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.610
like a vegetable juice.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.960
One more piece of fish here

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.190
and you can just see
how the dill and garlic

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.163
is just caked on.

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.690
You do have to be kind of
careful of the bones though.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.653
Their recipe with the garlic is superb.

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:48.830
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.731
Very good, very good.

00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:51.564
It was amazing.
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:52.702
It was amazing, thank you.
(women laughing)

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:53.987
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:53.987 --> 00:05:55.818
And the aunties, they're so friendly.

00:05:55.818 --> 00:05:58.350
They really took care of
us, they're so friendly.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.810
People from all over Uzbekistan,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.210
they stop here for the fish, right?

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.537
And it is well worth it.

00:06:02.537 --> 00:06:04.700
(laughing)
Say that again?

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.290
- Let's go, Mark.
- Next station?

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.070
- Next station, king-sized samosa.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.605
- Yeah.
- Okay, you ready?

00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:13.188
(upbeat music)

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.240
- Another stop along
the side of the highway,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.220
and as I was noticing as
we were driving along,

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.390
you can see just cartfuls of melons,

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.810
and Uzbekistan is known for their melons.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.330
They produce a lot of melons,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.550
a variety of different melons.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.860
I just stepped out of the van

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.890
and as soon as you got out
of the van, I can just,

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.890
this aroma of sweet
honeydew, melony goodness,

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.900
it's overwhelmed my nose right now.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.400
We're about to eat some melon.

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.493
Wow.

00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:50.410
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.460
Oh, wow.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.308
Ying.

00:06:56.308 --> 00:06:58.547
- It's very good, yeah.

00:06:58.547 --> 00:06:59.622
- This one is, like...

00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:00.471
- Like a honey?

00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:01.744
- Yeah, it's like honeydew.

00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:06.268
It's really crisp, but
then unbelievably juicy.

00:07:06.268 --> 00:07:09.101
(melon crunching)

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.443
There's just honey dripping
down my cheeks, mm.

00:07:13.957 --> 00:07:16.670
It's so good, it's really, really good.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.800
Just check out this car
just loaded to the max.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.850
Melons in the trunk.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.300
Man, if you stick your head in the car,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.620
just the melon, it's
pure melon in the car.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.063
That's beautiful, it's
so loaded with melons.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.850
I love these old cars.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.360
Oh, and they said they're
loading some melons over here

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.164
that we should check out, or unloading.

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:37.164
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:37.164 --> 00:07:41.058
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:41.058 --> 00:07:45.475
(men chattering in foreign language)

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.620
Oh, this one? (speaking
in foreign language)

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.361
It looks similar, but
I think it's different.

00:07:55.361 --> 00:07:56.640
(slurps)

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.450
Mm, mm, oh, unbelievable again.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.600
This one is more, it's not
as crisp as the other one,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.653
but just as juicy.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.170
- This one is better?

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.180
- They're both incredibly good.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.077
- Oh, which one you want to buy, Ying?

00:08:12.077 --> 00:08:13.240
Which one do you want?

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.013
This one or the--
- What's the yellow one?

00:08:15.986 --> 00:08:19.903
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:27.693
Mm.

00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:28.526
Oh, man.

00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:30.696
Oh, that one--
- Mark.

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:31.529
- Yo.

00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:32.362
- Test it.

00:08:32.362 --> 00:08:33.360
- What's that?
- It's a dry melon.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.530
- Dried melon?
- Yes.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.510
- Wow, okay.
- So beautiful.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.366
- Thank you.

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:39.199
(chuckles)

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:40.032
Dried melon.

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:45.870
Mm, oh, that tastes
like caramelized melon.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.870
Oh, wow, like melon jerky,
sun-dried, caramelization to it.

00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:53.795
(upbeat music)

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.603
This yellow one is crazy. (slurps)

00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:08.614
Mm, it's unbelievable, it's more like,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.100
more like cantaloupe in taste

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.050
with kind of, I mean,
that refreshing juiciness,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.700
but so silky, so...

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.045
Juice is just dripping from my mouth.

00:09:21.045 --> 00:09:22.920
- [Man] This gentleman's
asking, is it a best melon

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.304
you tried in your life?

00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:28.412
- It is the best, yes, the
best melon I've had in my life.

00:09:28.412 --> 00:09:29.351
(speaking in foreign language).

00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:30.184
Mm, mm.

00:09:38.362 --> 00:09:41.490
(truck rumbling)

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.850
Another melon shipment
right from the field.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.630
And if you can see back here,

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.550
those are melon fields right back there,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.380
so we're right at the source.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.910
And from what Baktruzo's telling me,

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.830
these are the sweetest
melons in the world.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.700
Uzbekistan, right here,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.880
and there's no reason
to doubt him whatsoever.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.253
They will blow your taste
buds with sweetness.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.610
Oh, Micah loves to eat watermelon.

00:10:09.967 --> 00:10:11.970
(slurps)

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.483
Mm, mm, oh, mm.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.614
Oh, the juiciness, it's
just ridiculously juicy.

00:10:18.614 --> 00:10:21.210
(slurps)

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.043
Mm.

00:10:22.043 --> 00:10:23.040
(upbeat music)

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.733
Micah, oh, yeah. (laughs)

00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:26.570
- Any good?
- It's the best watermelon

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.403
I've ever had.

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:29.502
- Mm.

00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:30.335
- Yeah?
- Mm.

00:10:30.335 --> 00:10:31.168
- Amazing.

00:10:31.168 --> 00:10:33.830
That was, by far, the most
rewarding melon experience

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:34.940
I've ever had in my life.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.990
Man, those melons are great.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.860
If you're ever traveling
from Tashkent to Samarkand,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.513
stop by and eat some melons.

00:10:42.348 --> 00:10:45.770
They just fill your mouth with
juice and joy, joyfulness.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.790
And they also say that
the melons are so sweet

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.380
because of the drastic change
of temperature in one day,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.640
so in the night, it gets really cold,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.750
but then in the daytime, it's
still pretty hot and sunny,

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.760
and so that drastic change of temperature

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.678
is what makes the melon so sweet.

00:10:59.678 --> 00:11:02.261
(upbeat music)

00:11:10.038 --> 00:11:11.796
King-sized somsa?

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:12.856
- [Ravshan] King-sized samosa.

00:11:12.856 --> 00:11:15.220
- I've just been dozing off
the whole day in between meals,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.671
but we've arrived to the next spot.

00:11:16.671 --> 00:11:20.590
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.980
Especially for us, the uncle
is gonna make some fresh ones,

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.830
so he's kneading the batter again.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.570
He's using all his muscle
power to knead that dough,

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.930
and then they're gonna fill it up for us

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.433
and make some fresh ones.

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:40.032
(upbeat music)

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:43.949
(speaking in foreign language)

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.590
When he said king-sized somsa,
he was not joking around.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.610
So a whole handful of the meat and onions,

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.530
he said it's an entire half
a kilo into the dumpling,

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.980
wraps it up, gives it a little
pat-down, smashes it down.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.690
That is a half a kilo somsa dumpling,

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.820
and then it goes into the oven.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.020
It bakes and that's
what we're about to eat.

00:12:25.194 --> 00:12:27.861
(tool scraping)

00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:32.735
(upbeat music)

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:43.030
It's half a kilo of meat on the inside,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.230
and I think there is definitely
a technique to eating this.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.730
So you kind of break it
open from the bottom side.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.123
Oh, yeah, oh, the meat and
juices are just sprouting.

00:13:04.037 --> 00:13:06.120
Okay, and you add in some oil.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.020
It's a special type.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.143
Do you know what type of oil it is?

00:13:08.143 --> 00:13:10.000
Is that the flaxseed oil?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.980
You need that fragrant oil.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.780
It's just blooming with
onions and it's so juicy too.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.735
- One, two, three.
- Alright.

00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:19.106
(slurps)

00:13:19.106 --> 00:13:22.403
Oh, it's so juicy, it's
so oniony, thank you.

00:13:22.403 --> 00:13:26.100
You can taste how the onions
just dissolve in your mouth.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.000
Then you've got the meat, the fat, mm,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.690
the bready wrapper, the
cumin in there, wow.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.730
It's just oozing with oily juices,

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.810
and then you can pour in some
of the tomato soup again,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.373
tomato sauce, oh, yeah.

00:13:41.798 --> 00:13:43.881
(slurps)

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.850
I love the whole cumin seeds in there

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.290
because every now and then,

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.730
you crunch on a cumin
seed and it just, like,

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.200
that spice just hits you, it's so good.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.570
So many onions in there.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.732
That's what really makes
it for me, is the onions.

00:13:57.732 --> 00:14:00.315
(upbeat music)

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.350
This has to be the juiciest
bun I've ever had in my life

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.920
and all that oil, and all of
the cumulation of the lamb fat,

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.433
and the onion juice, and that
oil that we added into it.

00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:16.000
It's just a sloppy, dough-saturated,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.758
just juiciness of meat and onions.

00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.841
(slurps)

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.390
You have to kinda inhale as you eat this.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.470
Oh, hi, Micah.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.752
You want another bite?

00:14:29.752 --> 00:14:30.970
(baby babbles)
C'mon, Micah,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:31.853
have another bite.

00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:35.159
Yeah.

00:14:43.312 --> 00:14:44.145
Is this the next stop?

00:14:44.145 --> 00:14:45.124
- [Man] The next stop?

00:14:45.124 --> 00:14:47.037
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:47.037 --> 00:14:48.990
- [Mark] Oh, okay, cool.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.823
Tea and apples?

00:14:49.823 --> 00:14:50.656
Yeah, sure.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:52.770
Oh, kurut.

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:53.603
- You remember?

00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:54.436
- Yes.

00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:55.730
We are gonna make it to Samarkand today,

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.670
but we had many stops,
so we're just stopping.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.480
Then she sells apples, kurut,

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.468
which is the dried
yogurt, and fresh honey.

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:05.301
(apple crunching)

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.240
The kurut balls, the dried yogurt,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.890
and this one is with chili in it.

00:15:11.006 --> 00:15:13.867
(man coughing)

00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:14.890
You okay, man?

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:16.760
- Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.240
- Salty, you can taste
the chili undertone,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.955
and it's kinda animaly.

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:24.510
(upbeat techno music)

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.420
Apple was good.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.880
And that salty cheese
actually went really,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.530
really well together with the apple.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.470
We are on our way now to Samarkand.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:32.553
We're almost there.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.160
Welcome to Samarkand, we finally made it.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.150
It took, we started at 9:00 this morning,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.020
we got here, it's about 5:00 p.m. now,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.100
but we definitely did not drive.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.300
Well, we did drive direct,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.140
we just stopped at many
places along the way,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.770
and it was well worth it.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.570
We're gonna quickly just
check into our hotel,

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:01.340
then I know we have dinner planned,

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.050
but we're not gonna do
any sightseeing today.

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.400
Tomorrow is gonna be the
full day of Samarkand.

00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:10.520
Hold on, let's just
take a seat in this big

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.393
purple king-sized chair, oh.

00:16:13.393 --> 00:16:15.173
Quite the plush hotel.

00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:17.140
(baby babbles)

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.973
Whoa, Micah.

00:16:17.973 --> 00:16:18.806
- [Ying] Whoa, Micah.

00:16:18.806 --> 00:16:20.556
- Look at that La-Z-Boy. (chuckles)

00:16:20.556 --> 00:16:21.389
(Ying laughs)

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:23.045
Micah, let's do a quick bed test.

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:24.352
- Micah, go.
- Oh, nice.

00:16:24.352 --> 00:16:25.473
- [Ying] Micah, go.

00:16:25.473 --> 00:16:27.633
- Come on, Micah.

00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:29.147
- Micah, go.

00:16:29.147 --> 00:16:30.215
Go.
(Mark yells)

00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:31.830
(laughs)

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.677
Why, you're not supposed to be there.

00:16:34.677 --> 00:16:37.170
- Ah, the giant seat is
actually quite comfortable.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.089
And it sort of wobbles.

00:16:39.089 --> 00:16:42.256
(upbeat techno music)

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.010
Mm, oh, that peach is really good.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.433
In about an hour from now,
we're going to dinner.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:56.203
But for the time being, I'm
sitting back in the La-Z-Boy.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.130
(loud pop music)

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.540
We're gonna have kebabs here
and this a huge restaurant.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.990
Walk into the entranceway

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.523
and it feels like you're
walking into a palace.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.310
Wow, this restaurant is buzzing tonight.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:15.140
I guess it is a Saturday
night, but inside,

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.810
the dance floor, there's a dance floor,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.480
there's loud, pumping
music, the flashing lights,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.390
but we got a table on the
outside in the courtyard area.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.335
It's a little quieter.

00:17:24.335 --> 00:17:26.649
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:28.521
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:29.970
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.490
- So the standard of this bread

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.731
is one (speaking in
foreign language) grams.

00:17:33.731 --> 00:17:34.692
- [Mark] One kilo?

00:17:34.692 --> 00:17:36.230
- Yeah, one and 300.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.980
- It looks kinda like a giant bagel,

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.543
and it is dense and heavy.

00:17:42.107 --> 00:17:43.807
- [Man] Is it all the green stuff?

00:17:49.182 --> 00:17:50.376
- Always delicious.

00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:51.209
- Eat some mastava.

00:17:51.209 --> 00:17:52.645
- [Mark] Oh, thank you.

00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:53.478
- Rice soup.

00:17:53.478 --> 00:17:54.527
- [Mark] That's rice soup.

00:17:54.527 --> 00:17:55.860
- [Ravshan] Yes.

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.290
- Next course is the soup and
there's some cream in there.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.070
You stir that cream in,
there's rice in here,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.720
there's chickpeas, there's bits of meat,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.670
and a little bit of vegetable, I think.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.800
Mm, mm, I think I can
taste the dough in there

00:18:13.855 --> 00:18:15.660
and the cilantro,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.696
and then it has that
richness from the cream.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:21.529
(singing in foreign language)

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:23.920
It's not even a plate.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.400
It's a platter, it's like
a chopping board of meat.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.720
There's kebabs, there's
chicken, there's, I think,

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.130
lamb chops, there's
vegetables mixed within.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.445
- [Man] Oh, let's make it
more beautiful so put it here.

00:18:36.445 --> 00:18:38.496
(diners laughing)

00:18:38.496 --> 00:18:40.420
- I think I'm gonna try
some of that kebab first.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.280
Oh, man, that's just a plump, a plump,

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.390
oh, you can see the juices coming out.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.793
That is such a plump kebab.

00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:52.346
Oh, yeah.

00:18:54.069 --> 00:18:57.736
It's so spongy and just,
when you bite down,

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:02.360
you feel the onions and
then you feel the juicy fat

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.853
just squeezing out of it.

00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:09.920
Oh, oh, eggplant is great.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.850
So creamy and feels like
it's dusted in chili powder.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.000
Okay, try this chicken.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.563
Mm, mm, oh, juicy chicken.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.890
Oh, oh, it just slid out of the fork.

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.040
And then what do you do with the sauce?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.450
You just pour it on?

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.546
- Yeah, pour on kebab.
- Everywhere?

00:19:29.546 --> 00:19:30.860
- No, only on kebab.
- Oh, only kebab, here?

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.693
- Yes.
- I'll come back

00:19:31.693 --> 00:19:33.730
for another bite of the kebab
with this sauce on next.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.280
Oh, it's like the tomato sauce.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.191
And also some of the onions.

00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:41.358
(upbeat techno music)

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:44.710
Another piece of the
kebab now with the onions

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.073
and the tomato sauce, thank you.

00:19:51.805 --> 00:19:52.722
Oh, mm, mm.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.210
It's like a light tomato sauce

00:19:58.210 --> 00:19:59.960
that does complement the meat well.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.010
It's a cultural Uzbek restaurant.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.223
People are, hello, how are you?

00:20:11.257 --> 00:20:12.220
- How are you?
- What's your name?

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:13.590
- My name is Jasur.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.540
- Jasur, nice to meet you.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.000
Are you from Samarkand?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.833
- Yeah.

00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:20.160
- [Mark] Okay, good,
good, did you have dinner?

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.563
What did you eat?

00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:23.576
(speaking in foreign language)

00:20:23.576 --> 00:20:24.409
(speaking in foreign language)
- This Jasur, this Jasur.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.240
- It's such an energetic atmosphere.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.320
People are dancing, having
just incredible feasts

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.550
with big, huge groups
of families and friends.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.350
So we're just gonna head
back to hotel from here

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.030
and then tomorrow, coming
up on the next video,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.150
we're gonna go on a full food

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:43.700
and historical tour of Samarkand.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.190
It's gonna be a fascinating
day, so stay tuned.
