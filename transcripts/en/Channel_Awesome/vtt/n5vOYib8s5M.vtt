00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.640
Ever since the movie "Toy Story" came out, I as well as, I'm assuming, a lot of other people really wanted a Buzz Lightyear show.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.560
Everything he described about his world just sounded so much fun.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.040
Flying through space, defeating the Evil Emperor Zerg, fighting aliens, blasting things, blowing 'em up...

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.680
It sounded like a show that practically wrote itself.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
Well, "Buzz Lightyear of Star Command" was the pilot film to get that show going.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.720
And as pilot films go, it is pretty much just an hour-and-a-half long Saturday morning cartoon.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.520
But I mean that in all the best ways.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.580
It opens with the "Toy Story" characters actually watching it on the TV

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.840
as if to already set up, "Hey, this is meant to be like a Saturday morning cartoon."

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.540
And that's exactly how it plays out.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.020
In the movie, Buzz Lightyear -- played again by Tim Allen -- is off again to fight the Evil Emperor Zerg.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.060
Zerg wants to get this technology known as the Uni-Mind. It's a device that the LGMs

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.300
-- you can guess what that stands for --

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.720
use to communicate with one another to become the most efficient race ever.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.800
But Zerg captures the device and plans to use it for evil: turning everybody's minds as diabolical as his.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.080
So, it's up to Buzz, of course, to go in and stop him, but the one downside is they want him to have a partner.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.660
But, of course, he doesn't want a partner!

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.160
Why? Because he lost his last partner, Warp, and the pain was just too near.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.000
So, of course, he turns away the others that try to come to his side:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.820
a ranger named Nova, who's also a princess but doesn't like being a princess,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.460
a bumbling janitor who has dreams of adventure,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.700
and a nerdy robot who always has those clever one-liners.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.640
This setup is, of course, about as stock as you can get.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.900
But the thing is, with the way it's written, it's aware that it's stock, and it has fun with it.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.320
There's a lot of great comedic talent behind these characters, including Nicole Sullivan, Larry Miller,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.400
and Wayne Knight, who's practically unrecognizable  as Zerg.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.000
I think they're distorting his voice a little bit, but, whatever they're doing, they make it sound great.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.260
It's both kinda menacing but super hilarious at the same time.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.960
{You're telling me my plan. I already know my plan. I made up the plan. It's *my* plan.}

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.940
{WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO ACCOMPLISHING MY PLAN!}

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.340
{Yeah, uh, kind of an outdoor voice there. (nervous chuckle)}

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.800
The atmosphere gives you what you're looking for with space men and women traveling through space

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.580
and shooting up aliens, but it also has this clever side to it.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.620
{Rangers! Condition Status!}

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.960
{(pained moaning)}

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.020
{Excellent! Let's roll!}

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.580
The comedy is both mocking but kinda paying homage to these sort of 80's Saturday morning tropes.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.200
Like the climax is stopping Zerg from pointing his death ray to the planet of orphans and widows.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.660
There's, like, a five-minute conversation dedicated to getting nose rings.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.180
{Why can't we have nose rings?}

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.340
{Because nose rings are for punks, little mister!}

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.520
{Well, if you can take on Zerg alone, I don't see why XR can't get a nose ring.}

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.000
{I was just asking a question. I'm not the one getting a nose ring.}

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.500
And all these characters' egos do great at working off of each other.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.400
Trying to show off, trying to be funny, and ultimately succeeding at the end, but just barely.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.720
It doesn't really have any twists or surprises -- or, at least, none that you can't see coming a mile away.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200
But, again, it feels like that's the intention.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.280
It's trying to give us that silly version of "Transformers" or "ThunderCats" or "SilverHawks",

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.560
except there's this self-awareness that makes for a lot of funny comedy.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.920
I'd say the one nitpick I have in the entire thing is that Booster, the big, janitor guy doesn't really seem to have a point.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.260
The other cadets definitely prove their worth, but this guy just sort of acts afraid, and screams, and -- I don't know.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.680
I get why he was there as the scaredy-cat character, but I didn't really get why he was there in terms of the story.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.280
But, again, story is not a big thing here.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.060
What is big is the adventure, the comedy, the characters, and they all do great.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.420
Again, in that cheesy, Saturday-morning way that they're obviously going for.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.740
If I was a little kid, I would love this.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.060
This is the exact show I would want to see, looking at Buzz Lightyear in "Toy Story".

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.520
It feels like this is the show the toy was based on. These were the adventures that they made him out of.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.720
I'd say if you had even the tiniest interest in seeing this at all, you'll get your money's worth.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.260
Like I said, obviously for kids, but has just the right amount of comedy, action, and charm.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.420
Give it a watch and have fun going to infinity and beyond.
