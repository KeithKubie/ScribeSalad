00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course Literature, and you and I are about to experience One Hundred Years of Solitude.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.880
Together, I guess.
Which isn’t really Solitude.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.220
Mr. Green, Mr. Green...I don’t get it.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.640
You know, there’s so many things that happen
in that book that, like, can’t happen.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.260
Indeed, Me From The Past, that’s the kind of searing revelation I’ve come to expect from you.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.180
But there’s a reason William Kennedy, in The New York Times Book Review, called One Hundred Years of Solitude,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.040
“the first piece of literature since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race”

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.740
Which, I have to say, is a bit hyperbolic, both toward One Hundred Years of Solitude, and toward the Book of Genesis.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.400
and then there’s the Chilean poet and Nobel
laureate Pablo Neruda, who called it,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.730
"the greatest revelation in the Spanish language
since Don Quixote of Cervantes.”

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.030
This novel is a work of magic.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.520
And not just because there’s lots of magic
in it.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:52.180
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.740
So, Gabriel García Márquez sets his novel
in the fictional Colombian town of Macondo,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.320
founded by the illustrious and inbred Buendía
family.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.800
From its inception, Macondo is cut off from
the external world.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:11.600
Gypsies passing through introduce fabulous ‘inventions’ from the outside — including telescopes, false teeth, flying carpets and ice.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.380
And the novel relates the history of town’s
incestuous founders,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.960
José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán,
and six generations of their descendents.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.060
It chronicles the lives and loves of these Buendías as they endure civic uprisings and civil wars;

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.740
invasions from ants and North Americans; strikes,
massacres, and plagues;

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.720
and — perhaps most devastatingly — their
own tragic nostalgia.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.900
And this is also one of those families who uses the same names over and over, which can be a little confusing for readers,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.380
and it doesn’t help clear things up that
the characters also share personality traits.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.680
The Aurelianos tend to be “withdrawn, but
with lucid minds”

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.049
while the José Arcadios tend to be “impulsive
and enterprising.”

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.659
This repetition of names and traits gets at
an important idea in the book,

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.990
which is that the boundaries of individual
identity can be unclear.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.900
Like, these characters’ are repeating their
ancestor’s mistakes over and over,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.340
which suggests that human nature may not change
much over time.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.009
One Hundred Years of Solitude is also a masterpiece
of experimental fiction,

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.180
because it blends the imaginary and the magical to present perspectives that are often missing from written history.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.980
Gabriel Garcia Marquez took voices and storytelling traditions that, traditionally, hadn’t been associated with great art,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.220
and showed that they could be awfully great.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.760
But speaking of magic and time, Garcia Marquez
jumps around in time a lot in the book,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.760
starting with the very first sentence:

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.440
“Many years later, as he faced the firing
squad,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.000
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice”

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.900
So there are a lot of different times in that
sentence, right?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.480
I mean, Garcia Marquez is describing the Colonel’s future act of remembering as having already taken place.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.120
And just like a map-maker represents disparate
spaces as seen from a single vantage point,

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.760
Gabriel García Márquez is showing the reader
the past, present, and the future simultaneously.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.260
Later, this will happen again and again in
the novel.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.560
In fact, if you want to keep score, the phrase, “Many years later” appears 9 times in the English translation.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.760
Its truncated version, “years later,”
appears 11 times.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.680
“Months later” 14 times; “weeks later,” 5;
“days later,” 13; “hours later,” 2;

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.840
“minutes later,” 1;
and “later” (on its own), 83 times.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.140
And García Márquez follows each of these “laters” with a scene that his narrator recounts while using the past tense.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.080
And this doesn’t just emphasize the connection
between past, present, and future:

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.560
it undermines the ideas that linear narratives
are the only narratives that make sense.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.080
In that opening line, it’d be logical to assume that the colonel remembered discovering ice right before he was shot and killed.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.620
But, spoiler alert: that doesn't happen.
So, so much for foreshadowing.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.560
I realize that so far we’ve only discussed
the first sentence of the book,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.380
but if I could just pause on it for one more moment, it also reveals another big theme of the novel:

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.220
how individual perspectives influence the
idea of history.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.540
Let me just read it one more time, you know,
because Thought Café made that nice graphic,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.391
and also it just has a nice sound to it.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.760
“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.840
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.”

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.420
Discover is a funny word there, I mean, I
guess discover can mean “Become aware of.”

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.440
But we often use it to mean, you know,
“Be the first to find or observe.”

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.540
The colonel no more “discovered” ice than
Columbus “discovered” America.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.880
History is constructed by those who have the
privilege of naming.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.580
And in a later passage, Gabriel García Márquez makes it clear that these “namers” can be wrong.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.940
Although the colonel’s father pronounces
ice to be “the great invention of our time,”

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.560
we, of course, know that ice is neither a product of human invention nor confined to the temporal existence of humanity.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.940
I mean, ice predated humans by like, literally
most time.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.380
But since the past is colored by the memories of those who record it, it can often be laced with fantasy.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.380
In One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez mixes mundane descriptions of real-world people,

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:04.779
and places, and events with fantastical tales
of supernatural beings, and places, and actions.

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.639
In the Lit Crit game, we call this “magical
realism.”

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.380
So back In 1949, the Cuban novelist, Alejo Carpentier, began to experiment with what he called,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.860
lo real maravilloso.
Marvelous realism in English.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.020
And literary critics have argued that integrating the “logic” of the visible world with magical elements

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.780
provides a way for writers from colonized parts of the world to make sense of multiple realities:

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.560
It allows writers to tell stories from the perspectives of both the colonizers and those of the colonized.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.740
And Latin America has produced a lot of magical
realist writers, including:

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.480
Isabel Allende (from Chile), Jorge Amado (from Brazil), Miguel Ángel Asturias Rosales (from Guatamala),

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.840
Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortazar
(from Argentina),

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.220
and Arturo Uslar-Pietri (from Venezuela),
among many others.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.400
Works of magical realism do away with a lot
of the stuff readers expect from novels.

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.949
All that stodgy stuff like exposition, and
linear time structure, and certainty.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.409
They’re all out the window.

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.800
And their narrators often describe fantastical
elements in a matter-of-fact tone.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.840
And by situating these fantastical elements in a real-world setting, they kind of subvert existing power structures,

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:13.690
and also remind us, as readers, that we have
a role in creating meaning.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.540
Right? A novel that you read exists primarily,
for you at least, in your mind.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.970
And right in the first line, García Márquez
undermines the notion of linear time,

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.340
and also certain conventions of exposition.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.040
And as for the rest of all that stuff, his narrator describes fantastical events, personality traits,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.680
and paranormal/mythological beings as if they're
normal throughout the novel.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.039
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:37.620
For instance, there’s a plague of insomnia,
whose most terrifying symptom is,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.780
“…not the impossibility of sleeping, for
the body did not feel any fatigue at all,

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:46.620
but its inexorable evolution toward a more
critical manifestation: a loss of memory”

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.120
there’s the “light rain of tiny yellow flowers”
that falls after José Arcadio Buendía dies,

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.320
and which “covered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered the animals who slept outdoors.”

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.100
The deluge, which begins after a massacre and lasts for nearly 5 years, uproots banana groves and leaves the town “in ruins.”

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.259
And Fantastical characters inhabit Macondo
including:

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.480
Melquíades, the “taciturn Armenian” gypsy, who haunts the Buendía family “because he could not bear the solitude of death”

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.300
and Rebecca, who “liked to eat the damp
earth of the courtyard

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.720
and the cake of whitewash that she picked
off the walls with her nails”

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.779
Father Nicanor, offers “undeniable proof
of the infinite power of God”

00:07:24.779 --> 00:07:28.659
by repeating demonstrations of “levitation
by means of chocolate”

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:30.789
And then there's José Arcadio Buendía who,

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:36.760
“during his prolonged stay under the chestnut tree…developed the faculty of being able to increase his weight at will”

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.340
Ursula, upon losing her eyesight, cultivates
such clairvoyance that,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.720
"for the first time she saw clearly the truths that her busy life in former times had prevented her from seeing."

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.800
The narrator describes fantastical events
and characters in a matter-of-fact tone.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.430
I mean, consider the “thread of blood,”
which defies convention, logic, and gravity.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.240
After leaving the gunshot wound in José Arcadio’s
head,

00:07:57.249 --> 00:08:01.240
this thread of blood runs through the map
of Macondo and through the Buendía house.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.420
So this straightforward tone the narrator uses to talk about violence continues throughout the novel.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.140
There’s the “electrified chicken yard”
that surrounds the banana company’s compound,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:18.740
the “hired assassins” that guard its gates, the silence that occurs before soldiers open fire on 3000 men, women, and children.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:23.280
This method of normalizing violence is in
many ways a powerful critique of colonial

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:26.309
(and post-colonial) power structures, which
we’ll talk about next week.

00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:31.540
But for now, I just wanna go back to how Garcia Marquez reminds the reader of their role in creating meaning.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.140
So, García Márquez includes in the novel
a piece of “enigmatic literature” —

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.380
the predictions that Melquíades, the dead gypsy, has written in Sanskrit on crumbling parchments.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.160
Melquíades couldn't bear the solitude of death and so returned to the Buendía’s house.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.220
Here he wrote prophecies which, “when read
aloud were like encyclicals being chanted.”

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.600
But he refused to translate the meaning of
these prophecies.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.300
And he explained to one of the Aurelianos,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.260
“No one must know [the parchments’] meaning until he has reached one hundred years of age.”

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.200
We later learn that this “one hundred years” doesn't refer to the lifespan of individuals, though.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.920
Instead, it refers to the parchments themselves.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.680
Melquíades explains that it is only when the “parchments become one hundred years old” that they can “be deciphered”

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.840
But Aurieliano still wants to read them.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.800
So, desperate to decipher the text, he learns
to translate from Sanskrit into Spanish.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.649
And when he discovers that the parchments
contain “predictions in coded lines of poetry”

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:28.329
he comes up with a complicated system to decode
them.

00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:32.929
And this decoding is further complicated by the fact that Melquíades has not arranged the story,

00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:35.680
“in the order of man’s conventional time,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:41.270
but had concentrated a century of daily episodes
in such a way that they coexisted in one instant.”

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.360
Which is precisely, of course, the book that
we are reading!

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.709
We, too, are reading a translated book that’s
filled with poetry —

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:52.160
one that describes fantastical events and
defies conventional notions of time.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.200
But there‘s a significant difference between
Aurieliano’s reading process and ours.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:01.440
As Aurieliano nears the end of the parchments, the wind outside turns into a “biblical hurricane”

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.340
that will wipe out Macondo, its inhabitants,
and their memories.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.840
There is no hope of Aurieliano ever acting
on what he learns.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.420
This information “…was unrepeatable since
time immemorial and forever more,

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.980
because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth."

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.720
But of course, my copy of One Hundred Years of Solitude did not self-destruct when I reached the last line.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.700
There was no hurricane. And unlike Aurieliano,
I survived reading.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.460
And this surviving, while definitely advisable,
presents some ethical questions:

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:38.240
I mean, if history is as provisional as Gabriel Garcia Marquez argues, how should we respond to history in general?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:46.600
Is it even possible to fight the collective amnesia and narrow storytelling that allows human beings to make the same mistakes, generation after generation?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:52.260
Is it possible for human beings to resist the trap of nostalgia that so often keeps us from moving forward?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:59.700
Yeah, I don’t know. I mean, another thing about 100 Years of Solitude that makes it different and special is that it’s not, at least in a traditional sense, hopeful.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.360
Instead, it endeavors to tell the kinds of
truths that so-called realism can’t touch.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.380
Thanks for watching.
I’ll see you next week.

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.920
