00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:14.080
all right we're back this is week twelve
so this is the end, so nice to see so many of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.740
you again

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.170
we will adjourn ultimately to cake in the
pub downstairs but what I thought I'd do is

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.640
begin us today with a little something some
of your teaching fellows made

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.320
first a little reminder as to what inspired
this particular clip so as you'll recall

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.900
this painful experience from a few weeks prior
so we'll just do a minute or so of this

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.900
I'm sorry

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.420
hey, welcome to the party. The four of us, along with host world wide and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.260
you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.750
are launching windows 7 ultimate software

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.850
so you know lets take a minute or so to tell you how great it is to host a launch party

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.500
you can use house party tools to build your guest list, upload your pictures

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.030
which is his favorite, and you can even get a party pack. though you're in your own home,you'll be able to participate with others in this exciting event around the world.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.620
In a lot of ways your just throwing a party with windows 7 as an honored guest.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.280
that sort of says it all. so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.159
as you know the CS50 fair is coming
up and so to get folks excited about this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770
a few of our staff

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.090
decided to put the following together for you,
it's about

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.090
six minutes long here we go.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.950
Oh hi, welcome to the party.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.980
CS 50 and you are hosting the new CS 50 fair 2009 edition.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.320
let's take a minute or so to tell you 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.420
how big it is to be apart of the fair

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.369
you can use the CS 50 website to check the guest list

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.710
and CS 50 servers

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.390
to host your websites

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.080
which is his favorite.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.249
yeah, it is my favorite.

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.390
and you can even get

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.579
an address for that so you can participate

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.199
in this exciting event with students all across this campus

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.569
you know in a lot of ways it's just like throwing an ordinary party with CS 50 as an honored guest

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.449
sounds easy,

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:31.449
and it is. we thought that you'd probably like to know what to do to get
ready and how some students would want their presentations to flow.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.419
Now the four of us did our presentations in past years.

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:41.409
yeah. You know, tried everything out. So we thought

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.659
we'd give you some pointers on how to make your final project

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:48.619
presentation really really fun.
now the first thing you have going to want to do

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.180
is finish your final project

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.840
haha duuh.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.609
make sure you do this

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.099
at least a day before coming to the fair, preferably by

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.179
december 7th at 11 am

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:02.670
talk to your TF's, us,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.479
or consult the bulletin board if you have any questions.

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.829
and you've got to play with your final project

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.079
before actually coming to the fair

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.169
second, look at the list of projects that you and your friends can try at your CS 50 fair

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.909
and visit the ones that seem most interesting to you.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:23.729
there is a handy list of all final projects at the fair and there is a handy set of specs to read online

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:28.150
that sort of tells you ahead of time what you'll be needing

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.439
for your presentation

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.769
hey- again,

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.239
you don't need to do all the things that are specified in the project specs

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.999
just choose your favorites, and try them out

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.499
we just have a sample agenda that we more or less followed.

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.180
for the first part of the fair we let the guests come in, and they just came in and had a drink 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.349
and a snack and just mingled around for a bit.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.439
just like they would

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.519
at any good party

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.900
right? yeah, all those parties we go to al the time.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.680
and then as we gathered around

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.409
I was able to show my project to whoever came by

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.860
exactly.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.099
I just gave an overview of how my project worked, and it only took a minute or two. and you know what was great?

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.369
It was totally informal.

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.629
and everyone was just crowded

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.919
around the table

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:13.479
and after my overview I went

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.499
straight to an activity.

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:18.850
Oooh, you went to an activity?

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.539
well, I just let everyone

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:26.069
fool around with my project for a while.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.020
Haha, I did the same!

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.169
Good, I then started an activity a minute or too later.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.770
well either case works

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.619
I guess you just

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:38.549
have to figure out what your guests want

00:04:38.549 --> 00:04:41.219
and play it by ear.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.499
We each did a demo or two.

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:48.899
Uumm, I did three.

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.969
the demos go for a brief time every once and a while

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.280
when other people come by, so for the rest of the party you can just let your guests play around for a while

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.709
and your guests may have some questions for you or you may
want to show them some things

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:01.490
but it's completely informal.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.629
yeah.

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.060
Again, there are several ways to fill your time at the CS 50 fair

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.649
but in the end, it's all up to you.

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.669
it's all up to you.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.520
you know, the four of us learned a lot of things

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.350
to make our part of the fair a lot of fun.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.100
yes, here's mine:

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.849
make the thing you're demonstrating personal to the person you're showing

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:23.809
like the way I helped someone register for a username and make an order on my online dining hall ordering site webpage program application.

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.069
or how I let students arrange their own custom made schedules

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.180
on my project and gave them LOLcat

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.259
user names.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.719
Okay on a more serious note..

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.680
hahah JK.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.789
pick out your tables,

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.349
and prepare a little bit of information you want to talk about,

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.430
and make sure that you have all the equipment you need.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.430
I mean sure, you have to have your computer to show off your project.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.989
In any case none of the setup is too hard. Just need to make sure that you're ready to go when your guests arrive.

00:05:57.989 --> 00:06:02.679
and hey, help me remember I'm not a salesman at this party,

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:04.820
I'm not supposed to be a total expert either, I mean this is

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.570
a brand-new implementation, and part of the fun of the CS 50 fair is

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.170
seeing what you already know

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.509
and what you can figure out.

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.630
It's so simple anyone can do it.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.590
that's one of the great things about being
a part of this fair that's amongst your peers.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.490
I think the biggest thing is being totally creative and open to your project

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.569
and how you present it at the fair.

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.129
after all it is

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.740
your fair.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:32.740
can you guys believe that David J. Malan put the launch of the CS 50 fair in our hands? What is he crazy?

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:38.310
ROFL haha 'will you be involved?'

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.240
I mean it does make a lot of sense,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.409
CS 50 is about the students

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:42.840
and the community

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.539
and it's all about like,

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.780
thinking about everyday problems in new ways

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.569
and making new things possible;

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.050
this really is our fair.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.249
yeah. you're right

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:58.099
so its about to be a party

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:00.209
have fun out there!

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:04.059
oh, I'm hungry. Let's eat!

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:06.350
This was CS 50

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.830
no TFs were harmed

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.809
during the production of this movie

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:13.560
except me who just starved to death

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.009
{laughter} except you're eating an apple!

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:21.289
hahaha, we also have like eight shots of you eating.

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:28.289
okay

00:07:31.019 --> 00:07:35.749
so actually just noticed that Matt did like three
wardrobe changes during that film

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:36.839
but umm

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:41.189
so the CS 50 fair is indeed coming
up. Oh and just as funny as that

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:45.409
was the photo shoot that went on
afterwards

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:48.909
so we have a lot of clips like this and

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.360
perhaps something will end up floating around
on youtube at some point before long.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.120
But as for this thing, what to expect. so the week of the fair you guys will all get

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.879
an email with some additional instructions so if
you're wondering

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:02.330
what do I do on that day, just check your email on Monday, December 7th,

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.089
the fair again is on Tuesday December 8th

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.659
essentially

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:09.559
it'll go as follows, you will enter the northwest
science which is that relatively new science

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:11.080
building down the street

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.680
roughly nine hundred people attended the
fair last year including last year's students,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.789
you will be pummeled with CS 50 stress balls

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:23.529
as the TFs greet you as you come in, little
things like this.

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:25.740
and up next

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.539
you'll be handed a program and with these things
you will be handed instructions and

00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.510
essentially out of the three hundred plus students in
the class

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.370
about half of the will be directed to show
up at the beginning of fair which is going

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.419
to be one o'clock

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.120
and then half of you will be instructed show
roughly halfway during the fair

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.380
so there will be intentionally a bit of overlap and
the will be essentially a scene change for all

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.100
of you guys show up with your lap-tops

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.840
and projects on it for exhibition

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.550
and then roughly halfway through other people
will take your place

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.329
and it was actually really quite fun as you ma have seen
from the facebook photos online

00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:58.690
and hopefully this little teaser today of
will get you all the more excited coming at

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.500
the end of lecture are two cakes this time
both chocolate and vanilla

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.560
so do stick around; underneath we have
decorated happycat

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.300
in the CS50 garb of this year
that's stored at CS50.net

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.160
at CS50.net

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.200
and let me go ahead and do the sentimental
part rather than leaving that for the end.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.300
A huge thanks

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.060
to the staff of this course, over the past
several months

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.730
who have really made

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.529
this all of the magic in this course happen.
So I maybe the talking face

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:27.330
at the front of lecture

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.829
a couple of times per week, but it's the sixty
plus

00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:34.170
undergraduates and graduates and alumni who
have really made this course

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.890
run so smoothly behind the scenes so even
though just a few of them don't have conflicts

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.869
with class and the rest of them are cutting cake
downstairs at the moment

00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:47.869
could we please at least on camera given them
huge round of applause.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.930
if interested in joining precisely that team
go to CS50.net/ apply

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.990
and the roles were looking for again are teaching
fellows who lead sections and grade, hold office

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.750
hours and really get to know a group
of students over the course of the semester

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.650
CA's who are alumni who will hold two
hours of office hours per week

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.150
pretty much self scheduled by a google calendar
and that's a way of sort of keeping one

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.740
foot in CS-50 while still focusing if
you so choose on other extracurriculars

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.170
and then graders as well.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.450
I wanted to read a little excerpt of a couple of E-MAILS I got

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:31.490
one in February of 2008 and
one in November of 2007

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.890
and this student wrote me, just a
couple of excerpts here,

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.620
Hello David, thank you very much for your
your email,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.780
it really made my long computer science- less
boring

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.740
CS- less boring day

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.260
I was in a model united nations conference
at McGill when I found out about my grade

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.790
I couldn't help but shreek

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.500
right in the middle of my committee

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.800
it was a very embarrassing moment and all
the other 99 delegates looked at

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.260
me

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.529
and I simply pretended that nothing had happened.

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.549
everything about CS50 in my life involves
some kind of drama

00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:04.779
now a few months prior that same student had
written me this note here and incidentally

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:05.200
they

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.810
approved my reading excerpts from these
so don't

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.220
worry about ever sending me an email again.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.119
Hello David

00:11:13.119 --> 00:11:15.839
let's see

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:19.980
after our dinner yesterday, faculty student dinner,
I asked myself

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.690
why I was about to drop the course, this was
in the fall 2007, considering

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.309
how much i adore the course. The main reason
why I was about to drop the course

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:28.480
was rather personal

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.860
but here is the entire story

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.640
it's pretty long

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.110
so excerpts thereof

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.890
even though I was always interested in
the material around the third week right before

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.519
the mid-term I felt overwhelmed and exhausted
by the load of work I had to do

00:11:40.519 --> 00:11:44.480
I tried finishing my PS-2 on Wednesday
because I was leaving on Thursday for Columbia

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.389
for model united nations conference

00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:48.970
I spent an entire day in the terminal room
trying to get help

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.189
I hadn't developed the office hours technique
yet back then

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:54.400
maybe I was just unlucky but I

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.079
only got helped once and the poor TF overwhelmed by the number of students in office hours

00:11:58.079 --> 00:12:01.649
could only talk to me for a few minutes. I
tired the virtual terminal room that night

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:04.040
and for some reason 20 people were online

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.329
and around one AM- in the morning I realized
that it was a lost cause so I tried doing

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:09.230
it on my own

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.850
but somehow I couldn't figure out a way to
make visionare work exclamation point exclamation

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.290
point exclamation points

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.360
in Columbia I literally locked myself in
the hotel room to come up with a logical solution

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.380
to my problems

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.600
but it's the more I tried the more I failed
miserably. I tried virtual office hours again

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.920
and while the poor TF's again tried and
helped two Students at a time

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.479
weren't really able to help me. Honestly I
really frustrated that I needed so much time

00:12:32.479 --> 00:12:35.870
to get a relatively easy key set done so I
said to myself

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.249
if I can't do the problems that the beginning
of the year

00:12:38.249 --> 00:12:39.739
I won't be able to

00:12:39.739 --> 00:12:40.999
handle the course

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:45.649
so dot dot dots and this recalls the same student that
had wrote us at the semester's end

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:47.399
with a much on were gratified

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.430
note

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.180
but I want to excerpt one last quote here since I've asked this student if she

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.260
could give me your perspectives on the course
two years ago which was the first year I

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.300
taught this course

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.519
what suggestions she might have and she wrote

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:03.310
if the sections could be designed in such
a way to put all of the less comfortable students

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:04.529
together in a small section

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:08.709
it might work better. I feel that sections
are important because there you can ask more questions

00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:10.070
without filling intimated by

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.870
200 other comp sci experts looking
at you

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.260
and once you

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.699
and also once you feel like you're not the
only one

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:18.840
you feel better about yourself

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.620
smiley face

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.970
so it was largely the result of this student having
written and other students having echoed these

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.579
same sentiments that we did introduce this last
year these three tracks for those less and

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:28.309
those more

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:31.230
comfortable and those somewhere in between
and I want to take take a moment

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.130
to read these excerpts really just to show
you the before the after because in the course's

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.069
syllabus we do make that promise

00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:41.350
that what matters in the course is not
so much where you end up relative to that

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:44.430
CS- expert you're right in the CS- expert
your left

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.880
but rather where you end up relative to yourself
and in week 12,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.550
Vis-ˆ-vis week zero.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.110
so the student who wrote me this note is
named Jan-Su

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:56.410
who has been the course's head teaching fellow
for the past couple of years and so I just

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.949
wanted to thank her very

00:13:57.949 --> 00:14:01.000
wholeheartedly and very sentimentally
for having written this note

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.049
and for having done such a wonderfully

00:14:03.049 --> 00:14:10.049
and apparently awkward job the past couple
of years so Jan-Su

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.820
and finally

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:20.850
Though I do love all of the TFs and CAs equally, I did want to

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:25.409
take a  moment to just recognize the
boy who has wardrobed happycat

00:14:25.409 --> 00:14:30.030
and all of us this year CS50 honestly
would not be as beautiful or as branded

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.150
as it has become over the past two years
and you've seen perhaps the limited extent

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.290
of my web skills

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.760
and it's really thanks to this fellow

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:44.760
that the course looks the way it does so
huge round of applause would be good for him as well

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.550
and lastly there are many many people
on the sheet of paper who are never in front

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.310
of a camera but behind it but

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.060
Chris and John and Barry the team downstairs
a many many thanks for having me this semester

00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.910
so

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:04.110
flawless and I apologize myself for
any technical gauche they've been

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:11.110
they've been mine and never the crew that supports
us, so thank you.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.590
so now

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.930
now it's all about you guys

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:20.990
so we look back at several problems sets
and there were various fun competitive aspects

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.320
and various interesting submissions over
time and we wanted to take a moment

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.189
to recognize a few of the submissions that
came in over the course of this semester

00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:32.920
this is not to say that these were necessarily
the best this is not to say these were the

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.509
worst but they certainly stood out

00:15:34.509 --> 00:15:37.439
in the staff's mind for better or for worse
and today

00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:39.600
certainly for the better. So we wanted to take a moment

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.970
to recognize this scratch project from many
weeks ago almost none of these students were

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.160
among those more comfortable but what we went
ahead and did was dig up

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.360
a few

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.020
this one here was one of our favorites

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:56.299
actually let me go ahead and put the client side
version and as some of you may recall

00:15:56.299 --> 00:16:00.229
things seem to run better on the local
client and is Tom Rice here

00:16:00.229 --> 00:16:01.350
Tom

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:06.040
so this is Tom Rice's space invaders and
if we can invite him up here for a second and then would

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.930
someone like to play space invaders
up here

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.760
albeit on camera for just a moment

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.440
it's your last chance to volunteer

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.440
Tom pick someone who you think would love
to come up on stage with you.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.410
Alright come on down here, now Tom

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.010
if you would like to come up here and explain

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:33.450
if need be exactly how this is played
we thought we would

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:40.450
feature for just a moment your version
of space invaders

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.610
umm so

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.020
the controls are right here

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.280
right

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.330
shoot to start

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:05.330
click the green light first

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:11.820
yes

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.170
shoot at the aliens

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.839
and don't let them hit you

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:23.839
you've got to hold down the space bar

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:21.820
if you hit lots of them you level up.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.080
two shield left

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:48.950
ah!

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.590
so thank you Tom and to Art, we have a little
parting gift for them today so thank you for

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.799
such a job well done

00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.430
ah thank you Art

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.040
all right so we have two other scratch projects
we wanted to recognize and again even though

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.809
it might not be your project up here

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:07.929
do you think back to what week zero of this
course was like

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:12.790
you may recall specially poignantly in week
one to how damn hard it was to get a simple

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:16.249
little relatively simple little period of
stars

00:19:16.249 --> 00:19:20.379
just to appear on the screen and if you now
think back to p-set 7 p-set 8

00:19:20.379 --> 00:19:23.630
do appreciate those of you who feel
this way just how far

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.830
you've come in these 12 or so weeks so
this next one

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:32.250
is actually a bit musical in fact
both of these

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.300
are musical along these lines so this here

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.950
is Anastasia Rhoda, is Anastasia here?

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.530
Do you mind coming up

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:48.530
for a second? come on up Anastasia.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.120
so this is called music composer

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.970
I'm having some technical difficulties

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.970
let me fix.  There we go. A little heavy
on my computer here.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:08.390
so this I was particularly struck by I
don't play piano very well but it allows you

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.500
to program essentially a piano by
by way of some music. I'm guessing you do know

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.720
some piano

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.200
so if this this might be a little bit of pressure
here but would you like to program us

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:18.650
a little

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.860
few chords

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.960
Anastasia

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:27.820
music composer

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.020
various letters represent the various
musical notes per the legend on the side

00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:02.770
that's got to be hard under pressure so big
round of applause for Anastasia

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.700
in retrospect I probably should have told
Anastasia that I would need her to write

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.150
a song on stage

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.059
so I hope that wasn't too much pressure and
then finally this one actually played with

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:18.789
myself another one that's musical in nature
that caught our eye but again then we love them

00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:20.170
all equally

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.330
this one

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:25.920
is by Ivan Bokov

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.059
apologies if I've mispronounced let's let this
one load too

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:33.710
and this one too can be programmed I thought
I would go ahead and do what I did last night

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.520
while tinkering go ahead and hit the green
flag here

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.330
and I wanted  to so this is the program

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.050
that one run moves this little bar from left to
right and any time it encounters a

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:50.730
note it plays that note and each of these
boxes represents a different note

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.640
that's pretty. so what I thought I would see

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:57.210
is it what CS 50 the musical sounds
like so

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:01.680
I got to playing like this

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.920
and then I did this

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.299
and then i did this

00:22:06.299 --> 00:22:09.300
oops I left some space last night so let's do this
again

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.080
rights

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.200
and that looks like and 'S' kind of

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.220
right now I did this

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.450
it's a decent five

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.870
zero

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.020
and zero

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.220
now is iIvan here

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:35.220
do you mind joining us up on stage and I'll let you hit play?

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.300
so this too was actually very addictive and
I'm frankly amazed when I look at that the

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.610
source code the puzzle pieces the sprites
that you guys implemented there are many that

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.240
are

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.490
far more sophisticated certainly than

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.470
what I once did so  do you want to explain
in just a couple words what motivated this

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.910
or how it works and then go to town?

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:58.970
well I'd like to take full credit for this, but unfortunately I found it on the internet.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.260
There is something called the tone matrix

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.640
hence tone scratch trix

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.840
and it's essentially what you see here except
that it's even bigger, it's a grid of 16x16

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.059
of these little dots

00:23:09.059 --> 00:23:12.540
it's based on a pentatonic scale so

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:16.630
essentially anything any combination of squares
that you press

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:20.250
are almost guaranteed to make a good sound

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:22.670
although I'm not sure if you have this many

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.970
and to be clear you found the tool or the game
online not this particular scratch project

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.010
right

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:31.940
oh

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:33.070
right

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.080
I thought I'd implement a few other functions to it

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.850
to make it not just like a clone of the actual thing

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:43.280
so I have these other buttons which invert mirror reset

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.730
you can change tempo which is just changing the speed of the bar

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.899
as it moves along

00:23:48.899 --> 00:23:49.930
and if you click on sound it gives you

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.890
a different instrument to play.

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:58.890
well show us

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.910
that is what CS50 sounds like

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:08.910
do you want to play with tempo and sound perhaps. so changed the tempo, invert, mirror which makes it go the opposite direction.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:57.840
let's end on a good note

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.530
thank you for that so congrats to Ivan, I mean it was really

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.320
quite fun to play with so these are all linked to todays lectures page

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.600
congrats. so.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.679
that was p-set zero that then brought
us to problem set 5

00:25:13.679 --> 00:25:14.940
which recall

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.360
involves this guy

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.600
in many different places on campus so

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.340
frankly the fact that,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.179
never mind the fact that we own our own happy
cat from Icanhazcheezburger.com

00:25:25.179 --> 00:25:29.499
but in years past we simply took photographs
of fairly inanimate the not people but

00:25:29.499 --> 00:25:30.929
the places and things

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:35.669
this year we decided to spice it up by putting
happy cat all around campus and at the

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:37.330
very last minute so we gave everyone

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:38.950
four weeks to find these photos

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.720
and literally at like eleven twenty three PM-
eleven forty nine PM- all of the submissions

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.830
from sections

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.419
started coming in and so the four sections who
really took this the heart

00:25:49.419 --> 00:25:53.580
were these four here Lee's, John's Drew's
and Rose's section what I thought I

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.169
would do is pull up each of these links Lee's
section

00:25:56.169 --> 00:25:58.149
was in fact the first to submit

00:25:58.149 --> 00:26:02.350
and almost everyone got most all of them I
thought I'd bring up their album here

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.460
ya Lee's Section!

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.560
just us, alright.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.040
here you go

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.150
so you may recognize this is actually fairly
common almost all of the groups submitted a

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.010
photo that looked like this

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:21.280
so this was of course the statue outside of
Boylston and Science Center B actually looks

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.880
kind of cool when looked at from this angle
here

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:29.720
what else do we have this of course is a
favorite

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.010
and what else do we have here

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:38.409
and you did find of the bike rakes what else did we have here.

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:42.559
oh and of course those of you've never seen
winnie the pooh, pooh seems to disappear

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:46.850
every couple of years but is door has
been there for many many years this is a

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.750
little gem outside of the science center
by the law school so it's a little dark on this

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.090
screen but that's pooh's corner there so

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.570
congrats to Lee's section but also congrats
to the other couple of sections let me pull

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.010
up

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:03.529
just a few of their photos this is John section who
rolled around campus

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:06.929
similarly found most of the locations most
of these were taken by

00:27:06.929 --> 00:27:10.690
or featuring Shia who actually did find

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:15.230
the apple tree in radcliffe yard, I had never
known that there was an apple tree on the

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.870
harvard's campus and

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.639
that there is is not necessarily all that
interesting

00:27:19.639 --> 00:27:24.059
but she did find it and this is over near
the admissions office these days takien

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:25.600
at dark apparently

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.860
but there are or were apples there.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.510
And this was not quite the intention when you
go intocambridge common when we decided

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:34.990
we were getting bored at this point
in the day and so we started throwing

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.639
happycat

00:27:35.639 --> 00:27:36.970
and taking pictures

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.179
but she

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:40.090
had decided to take this

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.040
to heart

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.150
so congrats to her section there

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.200
So just a couple of others, the next submission came from our Drew Robs

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.070
by Mark

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:57.080
so pretty much in Mark seems
to have shouldered the entire project himself

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.910
here is Mark in Maxwell Dworkin

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.350
here's Mark outside Maxwell Dworkin

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.869
here is Mark

00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:06.920
in northwest science

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.930
alone there

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:09.970
here is Mark

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.100
in northwest science

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.130
sliding down the poll

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:18.860
here is Mark hiding

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:24.330
and again there's just a theme, here is Mark checking his voicemail

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:28.150
and lastly here is mark with his head in
the statue

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:33.179
so congrats to Mark and Drew's section and
lastly Rose's section they used this new

00:28:33.179 --> 00:28:37.480
future of google maps where you actually pinpoint
where you found things so if you're curious

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.090
as to

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.560
where all the photos did it go find were

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.510
do take a look at this particular
link and what you'll see in just a

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.830
moment hopefully as a bunch of blue markers

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:48.919
still loading

00:28:48.919 --> 00:28:50.890
yes it's slow

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:54.200
and what still see on the map come on

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.360
google maps

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.419
what this section may have or at least one section did or

00:28:57.419 --> 00:28:59.870
may have done

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:02.899
because I may have mentioned
this at one point

00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:06.760
is that when it was getting hard to find some
of the photos especially ones at the tops the

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.580
buildings which frankly I actually forgot too
where so we were hoping you would

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.130
find them

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.960
what you can do is actually look at what's called the exiph data inside of a JPEG, s

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.720
o in addition to recovering the data of the JPEGs, the JPEGs actually have

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.970
some meta data which is things like

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:25.540
the name of the file, the type of camera that took it

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.410
and the date and time at which the photo was
taken so in fact

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.440
if you assumed reasonably that we followed
a path

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.580
through campus and didn't randomly run around
campus taking photos and then revisiting those

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:36.959
places

00:29:36.959 --> 00:29:39.670
you can actually kind of trace or infer our
steps

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:42.450
based on these time stamps in the photos now
two years ago

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:46.440
this didn't even occur to us and there's a little
emblem on the back of the John Harvard statue

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.460
that even no tourist would have ever
seen

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.149
we found this we photographed it and we were
amazed that one of the factions actually found

00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.500
it

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.860
and it was because of that trick. Well last
year we decided to mess with students

00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.630
so we altered all of the time stamps just to kind
of send them every which way

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.929
that kind of hurt participation

00:30:02.929 --> 00:30:06.740
so we didn't do that this year and unfortunately
google maps doesn't seem to be cooperating

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.330
here but you will eventually see from Rose's
section

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.829
a sprinkling of markers all over Harvard's
campus and inside of those little cartoon bubbles

00:30:14.829 --> 00:30:18.200
our the directions to them.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.240
so we'll defer to that one online so with, oh,

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.930
there were four sections, I used my computer to make
four certificates of distinction

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:29.200
this morning

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.990
could if the TF's are here
or one student from each section from Lee's,

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.110
John's, Drew's, and Rose's section, would you
like to come on up

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:41.560
and we'll be taking these sections to a meal
in the square right after thanksgiving break

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.670
as their prize for their straw.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.650
I see Drew, I see Rose

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:51.100
I don't see Lee or John which means
someone from oh Mark!

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.350
Mark is here

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:57.500
come on up, congrats to these guys,

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.110
very nicely done.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.470
we'll be in touch.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:05.690
this is Mark,

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.960
ok, congrats.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.800
Do you mind? oh, the TF's

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.650
here we go

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:13.170
here Rose

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.420
oh you're together

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.460
Drew is right there though

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.750
what are you going to make me come down? here we go.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:27.750
congrats to you guys, we'll have those nice meals before long.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:33.120
all right so if that weren't enough fun,
problem set 6 challenged you to minimize ram and CPU time

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.880
and it's probably just as well
'cause now will get a bit awkward because not only

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.649
did Drew Robb, now teaching follow, win all
of these contests last year as a student

00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:44.809
he seems to have done so again.

00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:49.210
but this is not a bad thing because
frankly we definitely noticed that it seemed

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:51.610
to have incentivized  a number of  your classmates

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.810
namely Kevin, and then Alan up here at the
top of the list

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:59.230
to really try to best that time and even though
they didn't, this is damn remarkable and so are

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:04.100
Kevin and Alan here who would like to come
up to recognize for this accomplishment

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:11.100
come on down.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.409
so the catchis

00:32:14.409 --> 00:32:17.500
if you don't mind just giving us a couple
of sentences on

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.970
how would you minimized your CPU times
if you're up for it.Kevin?

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:27.250
so I actually coded my program in assembly

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:28.400
I used

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:33.990
this X-86 instruction that shifts bits to
make a fast task function

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:38.059
you didn't think of that did you?

00:32:38.059 --> 00:32:45.059
yeah, no, I didn't think of that either,

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.759
Yeah, I don't know, I talked to my TF who is actually Drew, he gave me some good tips. Well congrats,

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:57.520
and here, these are perhaps even more fitting than before, so here you are.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.989
so congrats. So realize that

00:32:59.989 --> 00:33:04.049
winning the big board was not what that was
all about it purely opt in and just making it

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:06.429
to the big board even if you were at the very bottom

00:33:06.429 --> 00:33:07.690
props to you nonetheless

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:12.509
so congrats though to these
guys who really went above

00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:14.539
and beyond putting in the time so

00:33:14.539 --> 00:33:16.110
Drew again

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:19.900
walks away this year with one hundred
thirteen quintillion dollars

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.380
having grown that from ten thousand, Alan
don't go too 'cause I think we'll put you

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:25.540
on the spot

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.350
and I answer the question everyone might have
wondered at the time which was

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:36.350
how did you earn only eleven quintillionin dollars
if you wouldn't mind returning to the stage for a moment

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:46.680
 so what I did is, I stole

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.450
Charle's idea

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.640
of  just trading volume indices

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.289
but Drew

00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:56.340
did it better than me, because he figured out that you need
to wait for them to improve because if you put like

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.630
a bunch of

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:03.460
random characters in there it like only remembered
it some of the time so Drew basically

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.050
made a bunch of trades

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.919
where he basically immediately made

00:34:07.919 --> 00:34:11.169
I don't know, like a quintillion dollars every time

00:34:11.169 --> 00:34:14.169
and then just made a ton of them and crushed me.

00:34:14.169 --> 00:34:19.789
Well congrats nonetheless.

00:34:19.789 --> 00:34:24.959
all right so so admittedly there some bugs
in our big board we'll perhaps take

00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:26.969
care of that next year but this is by far

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:31.769
the first time that someone so completely
vanquished all previous records

00:34:31.769 --> 00:34:34.750
so we wanted to recognize one other student,

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:39.060
we took a look at the
statistics for the bulletin board which is

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.280
if you never tuned in,

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.779
and now we know that you did or didn't
because we looked at the statistics

00:34:43.779 --> 00:34:48.389
is this anonymous bulletin board by which you can
ask questions, answer questions,

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:49.899
and there were three folks in particular

00:34:49.899 --> 00:34:53.490
and I'm happy now to pat myself on the back that
I blew you all away when it came to posting

00:34:53.490 --> 00:34:54.679
to the bulletin board

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:59.379
 followed by Glenn Holloway and who you
never see but who has also been invaluable is

00:34:59.379 --> 00:35:01.859
sort of my behind the scenes consuliary in
the course

00:35:01.859 --> 00:35:05.439
but Jeremy Cushman, if he's here
with one hundred sixty two

00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:09.239
answers really, there was an occasional
question but we're quite grateful that he

00:35:09.239 --> 00:35:11.270
would often pluck off questions before

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:18.270
we even had a chance. So Jeremy we made you
a certificate too.

00:35:22.699 --> 00:35:25.809
very nicely done

00:35:25.809 --> 00:35:28.319
have another

00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:30.539
we always get them afterwards

00:35:30.539 --> 00:35:35.399
so with that said hopefully at this point
you have filled out a few questions on this

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:38.839
piece of paper 'cause you only have a couple
more minutes to do so. So you have in your

00:35:38.839 --> 00:35:40.260
hands when you walked in probably

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.590
a piece of paper in the bottom quarter of
which is either the number one

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.160
or the number two on the back

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:49.910
this was an accident this is what happens
when I send an email to have something

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:52.809
photocopied and don't think we only wanted
you get side two

00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:53.950
or side one

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.780
so we thought we'd leverage some probability
here and we're just saying go ahead and fill

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.849
out with questions and answered either side
one

00:36:00.849 --> 00:36:04.579
or side two and we're hoping purely by
chance that roughly fifty percent of you

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:05.499
will choose one

00:36:05.499 --> 00:36:09.259
and fifty percent of you will choose two.
so if you haven't done that, please take the last couple of minutes

00:36:09.259 --> 00:36:10.359
here to do so

00:36:10.359 --> 00:36:13.240
and come up with a couple of quiz show like
questions

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.189
and what I thought I would do then as you
finish that up

00:36:17.189 --> 00:36:18.430
is this here.

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:22.710
So we looked at the surveys from problem set 5, and you'll be hit by one more towards the

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.640
end of the semester because it's invaluable data
for us as we improve the semester

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.570
and I wanted to give this student his or
her fifteen seconds of fame too, so this is

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.810
respondent number twenty nine who wanted their

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.490
survey put up just like the birthday
boy from a couple of weeks ago

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:43.370
this was interesting and whenever we see
nonsense we tend to assume that it's something

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:44.999
like rot13

00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:48.390
so if we pull this up here rot13 converter

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:53.389
we'll just go over the top the link here, no
not working, we'll go to the second link here

00:36:53.389 --> 00:36:57.419
we could do this by hand of course, we know how,
but I'm just going to go ahead and fill in that

00:36:57.419 --> 00:36:59.769
blank, click rot 13, and this student

00:36:59.769 --> 00:37:01.819
had this to say

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:05.890
so you're fifteen seconds are now up but
thank you for your

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.860
your feedback

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:11.199
and this was also a theme here too in the
survey. So I only took one of one of these quotes

00:37:11.199 --> 00:37:15.550
but throughout the surveys for p-set 5 were comments along these lines

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:20.000
so you'll recall that the course web site
for some time featured a whole bunch of LOLcats

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.569
which, no,

00:37:21.569 --> 00:37:26.229
the course website featured for a whole bunch of time some staff, so teaching fellows,

00:37:26.229 --> 00:37:27.190
course assistants and e

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.880
occasionally me, we decided to swap ourselves
out recently with a LOLcat of the

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.130
day

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:40.239
so this is from a very popular funny web
site called Icanhazcheeseburger.com

00:37:40.239 --> 00:37:45.269
and they provide what's called an
RSS feed. RSS is an XML based language,

00:37:45.269 --> 00:37:46.710
a tag based language

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.329
well we had a bit of free time so we went
to their web site

00:37:49.329 --> 00:37:51.559
we found the link to the RSS feed,

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:56.190
we then were a little PHP program that
every few minutes queries their web site, grabs

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.380
that RSS feed

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.900
and much like our proxy for p-set 8

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.759
traverse the RSS that came back
from google news,

00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:06.699
so do we traverse the RSS that comes
back from Icanhazcheeseburger, we look for

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:08.400
the most a recent JPEG

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.289
that they've embedded in their RSS feed,

00:38:10.289 --> 00:38:13.670
and then we save in our local database a
copy of that URL,

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:17.160
and then we proceed to embed it in our own web
site and so this thing

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.260
doesn't change every minute or so but anytime
they update their feed, within a few minutes

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.690
we've actually captured these changes as well
and we also dove in

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:28.400
and played around with some other things which
we thought we'd draw your attention to because

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.870
as you exit this course

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.339
there will come a point

00:38:31.339 --> 00:38:35.490
where you're certainly not going to be handed a PDF that
tells you exactly how to proceed

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.880
to tackle some problem

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:41.660
so we've been having great fun this year building
up these various API's, application programming

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:41.979
interfaces

00:38:41.979 --> 00:38:45.709
and this is really just to lower the bar to
getting data that's interesting on campus

00:38:45.709 --> 00:38:49.050
but as this wiki page that is linked to the
course's website reveals,

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.700
there are so many fun data sets

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:55.910
and tools that you can patch into, whether
it's for the iphone or  facebook or calendars

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:56.880
or finance

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.019
or maps or any number of things

00:38:59.019 --> 00:39:02.150
and so just to inspire your forthcoming final
projects

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.249
I thought I'd draw your attention to the solving
of two problems for instance so we have a

00:39:06.249 --> 00:39:08.269
number of students who wanted to implement

00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:11.090
some food based projects for their final project

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.720
and by that we mean doing something to the
dining hall, and you may recall that

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.939
crimsondining.org was made by a former CS 50
student and TF,

00:39:18.939 --> 00:39:20.619
that does something along these lines

00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:23.959
but we decided that you know it's not going
to be the best use of time

00:39:23.959 --> 00:39:28.269
if a whole bunch of students go to the www.dining.harvard.edu,

00:39:28.269 --> 00:39:31.440
they pull up the menu and then you have to
figure out somehow

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.299
how to get this data

00:39:33.299 --> 00:39:34.209
into web site.

00:39:34.209 --> 00:39:36.439
so number you at this point in the term

00:39:36.439 --> 00:39:39.529
are probably a. not thinking about final
projects at all,

00:39:39.529 --> 00:39:44.799
or two, are but really have no idea how you're
going to implement what you proposed implementing

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:46.029
in your proposal

00:39:46.029 --> 00:39:49.099
so just to help you realize that you now have
underneath your belt, a whole bunch

00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:50.560
of tools

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.650
and building blocks with which you can figure
these things out on your own

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.979
I thought I'd, in just sixty or so seconds, explain
how we went

00:39:56.979 --> 00:40:02.039
about grabbing all of the data from Harvard dining's web site

00:40:02.039 --> 00:40:06.960
so that we now re-expose it to any student who wants
is in CSV formats or in Jason

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.419
format

00:40:07.419 --> 00:40:10.880
via that wiki page before so I went to
this web site and I said wow

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.260
I'd really like to start screen scraping, as
it's called, grabbing data from this web site

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.410
so I can get into my own database some turkey
sausage, some egg beaters, some egg whites,

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:23.300
so I took a look at the source code for this
page and in the source code of this page

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.359
is alright some HTML or XTML

00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:31.170
and then I noticed alright, let me search
for sausage so I knew that that's in the web

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:31.580
page

00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.229
so here's my turkey sausage

00:40:33.229 --> 00:40:37.029
and I realize that there seems to be a
structure to this page of it's a bit messy

00:40:37.029 --> 00:40:38.869
it's kind of indented all over the place

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:42.770
but notice that turkey sausage is inside of
an anchor tag, a link

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:43.800
that's inside of a span

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:47.660
and that's inside of a div, but even more
interesting is that that div

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.140
has sort of a special moniker its of class
item wrap

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.239
and sure enough it by continued scrolling
down through the file

00:40:54.239 --> 00:40:59.299
pretty much any piece of food, here's egg beaters,
was similarly inside of a div whose class is

00:40:59.299 --> 00:41:01.959
item_wrap. So I noticed this pattern and I figured
oh,

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:02.430
if I can

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.920
now somehow

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:06.720
go after this XHTML looking for
this pattern

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.429
I can do what's called screen scrape

00:41:09.429 --> 00:41:12.229
so I went to my command line and I pulled
up

00:41:12.229 --> 00:41:13.650
a little PHP

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:15.289
I pulled up my text editor

00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:19.289
and I ended up writing something that looks
a little something like this. And how all this

00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:21.900
code works doesn't matter so much now, and I'm happy to
send

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.120
 this to folks  via email, if you'd like to take a closer look,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.130
but in a nutshell

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:31.819
I went ahead and I grabbed the, I
pasted the URL from the browser into this

00:41:31.819 --> 00:41:36.430
script somewhere in a constant and then I
proced to fetch that

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.979
using file get contents or something similar
which actually then goes and grabs the data,

00:41:40.979 --> 00:41:44.409
and then I did this trick, and in this is your
little hint: if you ever have to do this in

00:41:44.409 --> 00:41:45.009
life,

00:41:45.009 --> 00:41:49.419
when you have XML data, there are ways
of querying that XML  data using a language

00:41:49.419 --> 00:41:50.630
called X path

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.739
and X path essentially lets you say something
like this

00:41:53.739 --> 00:41:56.550
if you want to get out all the divs in the
page,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.960
you use a query like /HTML

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.329
/body

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:06.279
and then you can do something like //div and this expression it's sort of like

00:42:06.279 --> 00:42:09.550
a file system path , c:/ or whatever

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:14.680
that path there will return to me an array of
all of the divs inside of the body and

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.130
so the slash notationis is very similar in
spirit to any file system. So a long story short

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.950
I wrote a script that searches through

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:26.030
this source code grabs all of those divs,
and then i check, are you of type class

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:27.770
item_wrap? Are you are you?

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:30.319
and then using very similar syntax that I
pluck out

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:34.750
turkey sausage and egg beaters and egg whites
and then finally I did an insert

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:35.490
into

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.669
a miescual table and the end result

00:42:37.669 --> 00:42:41.450
is that if you ever want to find out what's
coming up for

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:42.249
breakfast,

00:42:42.249 --> 00:42:46.380
you can execute a query of CS50's own
server, get back a CSV file

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.390
that looks much more

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.660
machine friendly, a CSV file with rows and
columns and dates and food types

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.290
and all of that so again

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:57.219
you now have the ability to at least identify

00:42:57.219 --> 00:43:00.579
potential problems and hopefully now have
heard enough details that even if you have

00:43:00.579 --> 00:43:01.580
no idea

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.690
how to go about using X path

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.890
it's really just a google search or wikipedia article

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.849
away at this point. Finally we also had
some fun this weekend

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:10.980
given that

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.310
so many of you have been diving into your
own final projects, we decided to take our

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.609
own map site to search for Mather house

00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:20.750
and now we integrate wikipedia articles
automatically into the thing why

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.619
just because

00:43:21.619 --> 00:43:25.369
and also official photographs of all of
the buildings and so you get little pop ups

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:26.550
like this for Mather house

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:30.440
and if you really like to engage dynamically
in something like this

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.180
and don't like the fact that wikipedia
is telling the world that Mather is the box

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:40.249
that Dunster came in quote unquote.

00:43:40.249 --> 00:43:44.559
we don't censor in 50. Well hey, if you don't like it Matherites, go change it

00:43:44.559 --> 00:43:48.929
will notice that change within an hour or
so of it getting edited on wikipedia

00:43:48.929 --> 00:43:52.680
so perhaps we can do some changes to all
the houses begin now

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.789
let's see what's Lowell house has to say on
wikipedia

00:43:55.789 --> 00:43:58.999
one of the twelve

00:43:58.999 --> 00:44:01.990
it's actually a very nice flattering article
that

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.919
so,

00:44:02.919 --> 00:44:05.419
Lowell house is a is a little nicer and then

00:44:05.419 --> 00:44:09.580
finally did we do anything else? nope,
that's enough for now

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.989
so hopefully at this point in the story you filled
out this form yea or nay

00:44:13.989 --> 00:44:19.879
so we had a few volunteers from staff so
could our staff contestants come on up

00:44:19.879 --> 00:44:24.189
a few faces may look quite familiar

00:44:24.189 --> 00:44:28.329
and really any of the staff who are seated here
are welcome to come up on stage the more the

00:44:28.329 --> 00:44:29.539
merrier

00:44:29.539 --> 00:44:34.920
and now we need at least two maybe three of
those less comfortable more comfortable

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.870
or somewhere in between to take the remaining
chairs up here for our finale

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.400
quiz show of sorts

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.949
for which you, hopefully, just wrote the questions.

00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:51.269
any volunteers would like to match wits
match with the staff?

00:44:51.269 --> 00:44:55.009
ok, you two and three,

00:44:55.009 --> 00:44:56.559
and is there someone down here

00:44:56.559 --> 00:44:58.359
four, come on down

00:44:58.359 --> 00:45:00.519
all right I think we have enough chairs for
everyone

00:45:00.519 --> 00:45:01.780
we have five, fifth

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.279
contestant?

00:45:03.279 --> 00:45:05.019
ok five and six, come on up

00:45:05.019 --> 00:45:08.129
all right so it's now six versus four

00:45:08.129 --> 00:45:12.189
let me go ahead and ask Jan-Su and
the remaining Tf's who are a little too shy apparently

00:45:12.189 --> 00:45:13.059
to come on up

00:45:13.059 --> 00:45:16.460
could you guys just collect the forms that
people have filled out and bring them on up

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:17.260
front

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:24.260
ideally flipping them to the right side based
on what's been filled out.

00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:29.219
come on up

00:45:29.219 --> 00:45:33.459
alright so

00:45:33.459 --> 00:45:35.000
in just a moment

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.199
you'll see another web site we've been working
on

00:45:38.199 --> 00:45:42.389
which looks a little like this

00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:44.139
very high-tech

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:46.909
this is all HTML based

00:45:46.909 --> 00:45:49.150
and it's just this is the biggest

00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:52.440
Jeopardy competition we've ever had

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.209
so in just a moment

00:45:55.209 --> 00:45:58.749
we will have

00:45:58.749 --> 00:46:05.749
the following

00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:08.540
"and now here is your host of Jeopardy, and now here is.." ipod is on loop,

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:10.409
awkward, all right

00:46:10.409 --> 00:46:17.409
normally that sounds better. Alright here we go.

00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:22.950
anyone else?

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:27.629
so okay you don't have to stand there awkwardly, you can take your seats

00:46:27.629 --> 00:46:32.619
so we have just a few minutes before we adjourn
to some cake downstairs, what you have in front

00:46:32.619 --> 00:46:35.759
of you

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.309
are two huge teams

00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:44.309
oh we can get another chair

00:46:48.329 --> 00:46:50.230
ok so

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:55.990
why don't we very quickly go down the row
here and say who you are and say one interesting

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.319
thing interpret as you will

00:46:59.319 --> 00:47:02.960
and be sure to speak very deliberately
into the speakers

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.559
my name is Mathew

00:47:04.559 --> 00:47:10.559
and I'm a CS50 TF

00:47:10.559 --> 00:47:13.169
I'm Rose

00:47:13.169 --> 00:47:16.019
and I'm also a CS50 TF

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:18.419
excellent

00:47:18.419 --> 00:47:22.239
Hi Mike, and I'm also a CS50 TF

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:27.489
ok this is no longer interesting

00:47:27.489 --> 00:47:31.459
hi I'm Greg and I enjoy making juice

00:47:31.459 --> 00:47:34.890
Hi I'm Kevin, and I am Greg's roommate

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:39.769
I'm Robert and I thought it was really interesting
how today in EC 10

00:47:39.769 --> 00:47:46.210
Professor Mankiw allused to a set with measures zero

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.769
I'm John,

00:47:47.769 --> 00:47:50.169
I'm from Leverett House

00:47:50.169 --> 00:47:51.179
Hi  I'm Michael

00:47:51.179 --> 00:47:55.459
I'm an econ concentrator who hates econ

00:47:55.459 --> 00:48:01.129
I'm Josh, I have conducted an orchestra while wearing
a guerrilla suit

00:48:01.129 --> 00:48:01.790
I'm Panit,

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:07.889
I'm from New Mexico and some people don't
realize it's part of the United States

00:48:07.889 --> 00:48:11.619
I'm Anna, I'm from Utah, which used to not wanna be part of the United States.

00:48:11.619 --> 00:48:16.189
and we have Jan-Su who is going to run our scoreboard here we'll have

00:48:16.189 --> 00:48:19.640
the staff score on the left the students score
on the right

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.349
well we did a little coin toss before class
and the students won the toss which means

00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:29.040
you students have control of the board, we're
kind of going to butcher the logistics of

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.189
jeopardy here and kind of just go with what works

00:48:31.189 --> 00:48:34.070
with that said go ahead and pick a category

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:35.910
if you need a little cheat sheet

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:40.279
you've probably will get you some blank
sheets of paper so you'll know what week was what

00:48:40.279 --> 00:48:44.339
go ahead and pick a  week and the dollar amount

00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:47.839
anyone on the students team

00:48:47.839 --> 00:48:48.940
week two for one thousand

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.279
week two for one thousand going in strong

00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:55.959
so your question for week

00:48:55.959 --> 00:48:57.359
two

00:48:57.359 --> 00:49:00.459
should've said write legibly, your
question

00:49:00.459 --> 00:49:02.109
for week two

00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:03.289
ok

00:49:03.289 --> 00:49:05.289
we'll start off with this

00:49:05.289 --> 00:49:09.519
rot13 plus rot13 equals? first hand up gets it

00:49:09.519 --> 00:49:12.969
ok students

00:49:12.969 --> 00:49:17.879
rot0, actually the answer is awesomeness

00:49:17.879 --> 00:49:19.359
we'll give it to them

00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:22.750
so Jan-Sue will be our judge, a thousand dollars
for the students okay and you're still in

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:23.420
control

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:27.689
of the board

00:49:27.689 --> 00:49:31.199
we came prepared with this

00:49:31.199 --> 00:49:32.899
very nice

00:49:32.899 --> 00:49:37.029
ok you're in control what would you
like next

00:49:37.029 --> 00:49:43.979
well ipod is on automatic play  now

00:49:43.979 --> 00:49:46.729
not very good the technology okay

00:49:46.729 --> 00:49:50.059
students what would you like

00:49:50.059 --> 00:49:51.309
week 3 eight hundred

00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:54.499
oh wait I'm not doing this right am I.

00:49:54.499 --> 00:49:55.959
what week

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:57.309
sorry?

00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:59.149
week 3, one thousand

00:49:59.149 --> 00:50:03.309
okay week three for one thousand, your question is

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:05.119
what is the

00:50:05.119 --> 00:50:11.519
 lower bound on the running time of bubble
sort?

00:50:11.519 --> 00:50:17.479
Matt. Omega of n. Omega of n, audience what you think?

00:50:17.479 --> 00:50:20.229
who's going to answer

00:50:20.229 --> 00:50:22.039
yes no

00:50:22.039 --> 00:50:23.499
okay yes

00:50:23.499 --> 00:50:30.409
do we want this to devolve into one of these things, where we

00:50:30.409 --> 00:50:31.710
all right

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.939
Sanders has never been so proud

00:50:33.939 --> 00:50:39.589
Tf's you are in control, what category
would you like

00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:44.989
 week four for one thousand

00:50:44.989 --> 00:50:45.719
week four for one thousand...

00:50:45.719 --> 00:50:51.009
what happens if you don't allocate memory
before signing...

00:50:51.009 --> 00:50:52.599
Robert? segfault.

00:50:52.599 --> 00:50:57.859
bad things

00:50:57.859 --> 00:51:03.209
Very good for one thousand. Students are in
control

00:51:03.209 --> 00:51:06.399
what's left?

00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:10.059
what's left, everything except those two

00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:11.379
I heard

00:51:11.379 --> 00:51:12.779
what was it week four

00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:16.169
all right well there's no week three for one
thousand anymore

00:51:16.169 --> 00:51:21.349
user error.

00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:26.929
week zero for one thousand all right so

00:51:26.929 --> 00:51:29.039
oh my goodness

00:51:29.039 --> 00:51:31.699
this is really not week zero material but

00:51:31.699 --> 00:51:38.699
what is the askey value of the open curly
brace?

00:51:39.979 --> 00:51:43.939
no funnier is, who knows this?

00:51:43.939 --> 00:51:50.939
yes, students.

00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:57.009
cast open curly brace

00:51:57.009 --> 00:52:00.839
audience?
0:52:00.839,0:52:03.729
one ninety eight

00:52:03.729 --> 00:52:04.330
no,

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:05.630
I don't think so

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.459
minus a thousand

00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:09.119
anyone

00:52:09.119 --> 00:52:13.119
who wrote the question? come on, fess up.

00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:17.079
well

00:52:17.079 --> 00:52:18.669
what's the answer

00:52:18.669 --> 00:52:24.469
one hundred twenty three is in fact I'm not
going to throw correctly but here you go.

00:52:24.469 --> 00:52:30.789
wow

00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:32.019
thanks

00:52:32.019 --> 00:52:35.559
I think we should take off the points

00:52:35.559 --> 00:52:37.059
yeah they were wrong

00:52:37.059 --> 00:52:41.140
so it's tied at one thousand and there's time
for a couple more questions in single jeopardy

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:48.140
what would you like your next category to be?

00:52:48.729 --> 00:52:54.889
week one for one thousand eight, your
question here is ...

00:52:54.889 --> 00:52:57.769
what does GCC stand for

00:52:57.769 --> 00:53:04.769
Greg's hand went up first, and then went down very quickly

00:53:06.219 --> 00:53:10.529
Gnu compilation...uh Gnu C Compiler

00:53:10.529 --> 00:53:11.909
yes, did you know that though

00:53:11.909 --> 00:53:14.809
yes it's true so for one thousand.

00:53:14.809 --> 00:53:20.479
Gnu C Compiler so extra credit if you go figure
out what Gnu stands for some day

00:53:20.479 --> 00:53:21.779
Gnu's not Unix

00:53:21.779 --> 00:53:25.420
ok you're all very smart now

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:29.049
The staff are in the lead now with two thousand
we've got time for one more single jeopardy question

00:53:29.049 --> 00:53:33.269
so what's it going to be staff

00:53:33.269 --> 00:53:37.299
oh sorry

00:53:37.299 --> 00:53:40.650
 week four for eight hundred so week
four

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.160
for eight hundred

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.709
and your question's going to be

00:53:45.709 --> 00:53:49.359
week four for eight hundred

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:50.689
blank

00:53:50.689 --> 00:53:53.189
the week what

00:53:53.189 --> 00:53:57.189
I do need help

00:53:57.189 --> 00:53:59.249
what is the name

00:53:59.249 --> 00:54:03.569
we're taking today very seriously. What
is the name of the pointer video we watched

00:54:03.569 --> 00:54:06.169
from Stanford?

00:54:06.169 --> 00:54:08.619
I saw Rose's hand,

00:54:08.619 --> 00:54:10.949
yes?

00:54:10.949 --> 00:54:13.839
Blinky's Pointer Fun?

00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:16.199
judges? Rejected for minus eight hundred

00:54:16.199 --> 00:54:23.199
students? Fun with Pointers?

00:54:25.079 --> 00:54:29.989
No! The answer was Pointer Fun with Blinky

00:54:29.989 --> 00:54:33.890
who knows that? Alright so now was transition

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.960
to double jeopardy where the scores on the
board double

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:41.170
why don't we take a moment to ask students

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:44.749
How is the game going for you thus far
who would like to step up

00:54:44.749 --> 00:54:46.839
and field this type of question?

00:54:46.839 --> 00:54:53.309
what's your strategy moving forward?

00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:56.679
we're trying to write some pseudo code

00:54:56.679 --> 00:55:00.999
and staff what's your strategy for taking these
guys down

00:55:00.999 --> 00:55:04.979
we're just going to continue David,  we think this is working for us
pretty well and we're

00:55:04.979 --> 00:55:06.089
stick with it

00:55:06.089 --> 00:55:09.299
yes your two hundred dollar lead is
massive here

00:55:09.299 --> 00:55:10.780
all right so

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:16.050
i'd let's see I think the staffers still in
control so staff what's your choice

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:17.239
of weeks here

00:55:17.239 --> 00:55:19.989
new weeks on the board

00:55:19.989 --> 00:55:22.569
yes

00:55:22.569 --> 00:55:27.389
no

00:55:27.389 --> 00:55:28.180
yeah

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:31.999
yes Matt, and two thousand it is

00:55:31.999 --> 00:55:38.999
so week ten for two thousand, oh soft ball,
what does CPU stand for?

00:55:39.199 --> 00:55:43.399
a chance to pick the students, ok students? yes?

00:55:43.399 --> 00:55:46.119
central processing unit? audience?

00:55:46.119 --> 00:55:48.789
yes! very nicely done so now it's
