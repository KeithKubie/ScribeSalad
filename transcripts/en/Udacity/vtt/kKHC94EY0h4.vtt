00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.810
Today we started off by discussing
the goals, outcomes, and

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.750
learning strategies for this class.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.010
That led us into discussing the project,
the main assessment in this class.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.630
The project builds on Raven's
Progressive Matrices, an apocryphal

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.220
human intelligence test, an idea
called computational psychometrics,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.080
the application of computer models
to understanding human cognition.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.160
We then discuss the seven main
principles of CS7637 that are going to

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.220
come up again and again in this course.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.280
We recommend you keep and eye out for

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.000
them because they'll come
up in every single lesson.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.700
This is the end of the introduction
to this course, so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.810
we hope you're excited to get started.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.619
We're going to start off with
the fundamentals of knowledge based AI,

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.980
including one of the most fundamental
knowledge structures called

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.760
semantic networks.
