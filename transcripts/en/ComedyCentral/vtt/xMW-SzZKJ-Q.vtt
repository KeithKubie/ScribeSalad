00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.370
IN THE WORLD,

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.540
AND FOR ONLINE DATING WEBSITES
LIKE DATING DNA

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.476
THOSE LONG-HAIRED ANGELS
ARE A PRIZE TO BE WON.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.178
CEO KEVIN CARMONY ADMITS

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:13.347
THAT ATTRACTING MORE FEMALE
USERS TO HIS SITE

00:00:13.347 --> 00:00:14.848
IS THE KEY TO GROWTH.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:19.286 line:0%
 
- 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE
PROBABLY 65% MEN, 35% WOMEN.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.555
- BUT TO DO THIS YOU NEED
A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.657
OF HOW THE FEMALE BRAIN WORKS.

00:00:23.657 --> 00:00:25.893
SO I PAID KEVIN A VISIT
AT HIS PENTHOUSE SUITE

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.862
IN IRVINE, CALIFORNIA,
TO SHARE MY EXPERTISE.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:32.733
THE MAIN REASON MOST WOMEN
ARE AFRAID TO USE ONLINE DATING

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.769
IS BECAUSE THEY THINK
THE PERSON THEY MEET UP WITH

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.706
COULD POTENTIALLY BE A KILLER
AND MURDER THEM.

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:42.376
- UM, I DON'T KNOW
THAT THAT'S A BIG REASON

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.344
THAT WOMEN DON'T SIGN UP
FOR DATING SITES.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.680
WE HAVEN'T HAD WOMEN
CONTACTING US,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.649
"HEY, I MET THIS GUY ON YOUR
SITE AND HE WAS A CREEP

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.850
AND THIS AND THAT HAPPENED."

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.218
WE HAVE ENOUGH--
- WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT HEAR

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.854
FROM THOSE WOMEN BECAUSE...

00:00:53.854 --> 00:00:56.990
- I DON'T THINK THAT IS
THE--IT'S CERTAINLY A CONCERN.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.861
- THE SOLUTION
IS DADDY'S WATCHING.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.329
- OKAY.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.699
- UP UNTIL AGE 18, MOST WOMEN
HAVE A DADDY KEEPING TABS

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.601
ON ANY MAN SHE GOES OUT WITH.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.504
BUT ONCE SHE GETS BIGGER,
DADDY'S NO LONGER AROUND,

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.172
BUT DANGER STILL IS.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.508
SO IF DATING DNA OFFERED
A SECURITY SERVICE

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:16.944
WHERE FEMALE USERS COULD REQUEST
TO HAVE SOMEONE

00:01:16.944 --> 00:01:19.646
SECRETLY WATCH OVER
THEIR FIRST DATES,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.815
THE WEBSITE WOULD QUICKLY BECOME
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.084
FOR WOMEN
LOOKING TO DATE ONLINE

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.120
BECAUSE THEY KNOW
THAT DADDY'S WATCHING.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.288
- EH...

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.757
SEEMS A LITTLE CONDESCENDING
TO ME TO WOMEN

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.960
THAT DADDY HAS TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU AND DADDY'S WATCHING--

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.995
- SO YOU DON'T LIKE THE NAME?

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:36.129
- I-I DON'T KNOW--

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.565
- NOW BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW,

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.702
IT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD ON CAMERA
TO SAY ANYTHING BAD

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.438
ABOUT AN IDEA
THAT MAKES WOMEN SAFER.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:45.973
- YES, BUT--
- YOU DON'T WANNA LOOK LIKE

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:50.110
YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO MAKE WOMEN FEEL SAFE.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.778
- YEAH.
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.915
THAT MIGHT--MAY MAKE A WOMAN
FEEL MORE SECURE, CERTAINLY.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:56.116
- KEVIN LOVED MY IDEA.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.985
BUT BEFORE HE COULD OFFER IT
TO HIS USERS,

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:00.254
I NEEDED TO DEVELOP
OFFICIAL GUIDELINES

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.789
FOR HOW THE DADDY'S WATCHING
SYSTEM WOULD WORK.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.392
SO I FOUND A DATING DNA USER,
KAMARIN,

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.060
WHO AGREED TO LET ME
TRY OUT THE SERVICE

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.896
ON ONE OF HER FIRST DATES.

00:02:08.896 --> 00:02:10.464
SO YOUR DATE
WILL BE ARRIVING SOON,

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.066
AND BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING
THIS OUT FOR TODAY,

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.301
I'LL BE YOUR DADDY.

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:15.369
- OKAY.

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:16.803
- AND WE ALSO
HAVE SOME BRANDING

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:19.072
KINDA ELEMENTS WE'RE TRYING
TO INCORPORATE.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:21.275
SO IF YOU'RE EVER IN FEAR
AT ANY TIME

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:23.677
DURING YOUR DATE, JUST YELL OUT,

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.346
"DADDY, DADDY, COME OVER NOW.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:30.083
SAVE MY LIFE.
YOU MADE A VOW."

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.318
- SOUNDS GOOD?

00:02:31.318 --> 00:02:33.820
- SO DO YOU WANT
TO PRACTICE THAT OR--

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.556
- WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF I JUST YELLED, "HELP"?

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:37.591
LIKE, WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE
IN ME--

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:40.160
- WELL, IF I JUST HEAR, "HELP,"
YOU KNOW, THAT COULD BE ANYONE.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.297
BUT THE DADDY RHYME,
I KNOW IT'S YOU.

00:02:43.297 --> 00:02:44.464
- COOL.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.899
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:46.967
THANK YOU, NATE.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.135
- NATHAN.
- NATHAN.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.403
- YEAH, YOU CAN CALL ME NATE.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:50.771
[awkward chuckle]
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:52.005
WHATEVER.
- THANK YOU.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:53.507
- EITHER WAY...
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:55.209
- IT'S CASUAL.

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.611
WITH KAMARIN PREPPED,
I GOT INTO POSITION

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:59.112
OUT FRONT OF HER BUILDING.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.781
AND KNOWING
WHAT HER DATE LOOKED LIKE,

00:03:00.781 --> 00:03:03.917
I HAD A METHOD TO COVERTLY
VET HIM BEFORE HE PICKED HER UP.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:05.452
HEY, MAN, COULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:06.854
I'M JUST MOVING
OUT OF MY BUILDING.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:07.855
WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO TAKE A PHOTO OF ME

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:09.423
IN FRONT OF MY BUILDING?

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.791
- UM, YEAH.

00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:12.192
- IS THAT COOL?
- YEAH.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.228
- OH, I GUESS
I PACKED MY CAMERA.

00:03:14.228 --> 00:03:15.796
I THOUGHT I HAD IT ON ME.

00:03:15.796 --> 00:03:19.666
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE LIKE
A KNIFE, OR ANY WEAPON,

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:20.968
ANYTHING SHARP
I COULD OPEN THE BOX WITH...

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.402
- I CAN DO IT WITH A KEY.
- GUN OR--

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.304
OH, KEY?
OKAY.

00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.572 line:0%
 
WHERE YOU HEADED?

00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:28.842 line:0%
 
OH, REALLY?

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:30.110 line:0%
 
COOL, THANKS.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.411 line:0%
 
YEAH, WOMEN, HUH?

00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:32.546 line:0%
 
SOMETIMES YOU WANNA KISS 'EM,
OTHER TIMES

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:33.881 line:0%
 
YOU JUST WANNA
WRING THEIR NECKS,

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.082 line:0%
 
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:38.318 line:0%
 
YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.820 line:0%
 
LIKE SOMETIMES
YOU WANNA KISS 'EM,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.524 line:0%
 
OTHER TIMES YOU WANNA
WRING THEIR NECKS.

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:44.525 line:0%
 
YOU WOULDN'T?

00:03:44.525 --> 00:03:45.826 line:0%
 
BUT SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:49.396 line:0%
 
WHEN A GIRL SAYS NO
SHE REALLY MEANS YES, RIGHT?

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:50.964 line:0%
 
YEAH?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.102 line:0%
 
YOU'RE NOT A SEX OFFENDER
OR ANYTHING?

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:56.436 line:0%
 
OKAY.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:57.571 line:0%
 
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

00:03:57.571 --> 00:03:58.805
CODY SEEMED OKAY AT FIRST

00:03:58.805 --> 00:04:00.073
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE,

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.543
I PRESERVED HIS FINGERPRINTS
FROM THE CAMERA

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:04.077
SO I COULD GIVE THEM
TO THE AUTHORITIES

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.747
IN CASE THINGS TOOK A TURN
FOR THE WORSE.

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.216
MOMENTS LATER, THEY LEFT FOR
THEIR DATE AT THE BOWLING ALLEY,

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.518
AND I WAS SURE
TO FOLLOW CLOSE BEHIND.

00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.819
ONCE THEY ARRIVED,

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.422
THEY STARTED THEIR GAME
AND GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.690
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.192
- I'M ORIGINALLY FROM ANAHEIM.

00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:19.193
I LIVE IN WESTWOOD NOW.

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:20.527
- AND FROM A DISTANCE,

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:23.130
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THINGS
WERE OFF TO A GOOD START.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.965
BUT IN CASE SOMETHING
WERE TO HAPPEN,

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.601
I HAD A METHOD THAT ALLOWED ME
TO BE RIGHT NEXT TO THEM,

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:30.737
AND COMPLETELY INVISIBLE
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:33.273
DISGUISED AS A FEMALE BOWLER
IN RELIGIOUS GARB,

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.543
I WAS ABLE TO BE WITHIN EARSHOT
OF KAMARIN AND HER DATE.

00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:38.579
READY TO SPLIT THINGS UP
IF HIS STRIKE CELEBRATIONS

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:41.248
GOT A LITTLE TOO TOUCHY.

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.517
FORTUNATELY,
THAT WASN'T REQUIRED.

00:04:43.517 --> 00:04:45.886
CODY SEEMED
LIKE A GENUINELY GOOD GUY,

00:04:45.886 --> 00:04:47.321
AND I COULD TELL KAMARIN
FELT SAFE

00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:49.356
AS SHE REALLY BEGAN TO OPEN UP.

00:04:49.356 --> 00:04:50.591
- IF TWO PLANES
BROUGHT DOWN THE TWO TOWERS...

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:51.692
- UH-HUH?

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:52.759
- I COULD SEE
THAT AS BEING FEASIBLE.

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:53.927
- OKAY.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:57.931 line:0%
 
- BUT WHAT BROUGHT DOWN
BUILDING NUMBER SEVEN?

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:59.700 line:0%
 
BUILDING SEVEN.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.735 line:0%
 
- MY METHOD WAS WORKING
PERFECTLY,

00:05:01.735 --> 00:05:04.204
AND AFTER CODY
RETURNED HER HOME UNHARMED,

00:05:04.204 --> 00:05:06.840
I WENT INSIDE TO SEE
IF KAMARIN FELT AS GOOD AS I DID

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.075
ABOUT THE SERVICE.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:10.911
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU FELT SAFE

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:12.746
AND EVERYTHING?
- YEAH. FEEL PRETTY SECURE.

00:05:12.746 --> 00:05:14.414
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME,
RIGHT?

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:15.716
- NO.
NOT AT ALL.

00:05:15.716 --> 00:05:17.251
- YEAH, SO...

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:19.453
THAT SHOWS THAT I GUESS
IT WORKED PRETTY WELL.

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:20.854
- YEAH.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:23.290
- THE DADDY'S WATCHING SYSTEM
WAS A TOTAL SUCCESS.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.526
BUT FOR IT TO WORK
WITH DATING DNA

00:05:25.526 --> 00:05:27.327
I'D NEED TO BUILD A STAFF
OF TRAINED DADDIES

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.863
WHO'D BE AS TRUSTWORTHY AS I AM.

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.466
SO I PUT UP SOME FLIERS
THAT OFFERED SECURITY WORK.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:33.634
AND THE NEXT DAY

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:37.070
I MET WITH THE ONE GUY
WHO RESPONDED TO MY AD.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.539
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IN THIS SCENARIO?

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.075
YOU'RE PROTECTING THE WOMAN
AND THE GUY TRIES TO KISS HER.

00:05:42.075 --> 00:05:44.178
- I'M GONNA DROP HIM.
- WHAT DOES THAT--

00:05:44.178 --> 00:05:45.345
- IF I DO IT HARD ENOUGH,
RIGHT HERE,

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:47.614
AND RIGHT IN THE GLANDS
FOR YOUR WINDPIPE,

00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:50.217
I PUSH HARD ENOUGH TO--
LIKE THIS.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.352
FOR ABOUT THIRT--
FOR ABOUT THREE SECONDS--FOUR,

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.654
I CAN PUT YOU OUT.

00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.122
- COOL.
- OR BACK HERE, RIGHT HERE.

00:05:55.122 --> 00:05:57.691
UNDERNEATH THE LOBE.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:05:59.493
BUT YOU HAVE TO GO LIKE THAT
[thwack]

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:01.028
BACK HERE BY THE LOBE
TO GET IT.

00:06:01.028 --> 00:06:02.429
YOU KNOW, IT PUTS YOU OUT
FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS.

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.332
THIS ONE HERE PUTS YOU OUT
FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.

00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:06.500
- SO YOU KNOW LOTS OF MOVES.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.135
- I KNOW A COUPLE, YEAH.

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:10.204
- MARK SEEMED QUALIFIED
FOR THE JOB,

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.306
BUT I STILL NEEDED
TO SEE HIM IN ACTION.

00:06:12.306 --> 00:06:15.175
SO I ARRANGED THE SERVICE FOR
ANOTHER DATING DNA USER

00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:16.743
AND BROUGHT MARK WITH ME
TO HER HOME

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:19.880
TO SEE IF HE COULD HANDLE
HIS FIRST REAL JOB AS A DADDY.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.948
- HOW YOU DOING, POLLY?

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.182
- GOOD, THANK YOU.

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.917
- SO MARK WILL BE YOUR DADDY.
- OKAY.

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:26.053
- AND HE WILL BE FOLLOWING YOU

00:06:26.053 --> 00:06:27.354
AND WATCHING YOU
FROM A DISTANCE.

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.655
SO JUST SO YOU KNOW,

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:31.658
WE'VE GIVEN MARK
ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.

00:06:31.658 --> 00:06:35.062
YOUR ADDRESS, YOUR NAME,
PHOTOGRAPHS, YOUR SOCIAL.

00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:38.432
