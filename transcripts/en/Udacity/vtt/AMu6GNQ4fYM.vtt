00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.880
Let's start exploring
intersections with the following.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.060
Given two lines in two dimensions,
where do they intersect?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.920
First, let's make a definition.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.870
Two lines are parallel,
if their normal vectors are parallel.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.260
So for example, these lines are parallel

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.470
because their normal vectors differ
by a factor of negative two.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.030
Whereas these two lines are not parallel

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.490
because their normal
vectors are not parallel.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.090
It may seem strange that we are using
normal vectors in our definition

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.009
instead of direction vectors.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.390
In two dimensions,
the definitions are equivalent.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.490
However, in higher dimensions, there
will not be a single direction vector,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.350
so using the normal vector will
be more extensible later on.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.850
If two lines are not parallel,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.550
then they will have
an intersection at a single point.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.720
However, if two lines are parallel,
then there are two possibilities.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.480
They might not intersect at all, or

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.520
they might turn out to be the same line,
so-called coincident lines,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.190
in which case they will intersect
in infinitely many points.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.890
In linear algebra, this trichotomy of
cases for intersections is the rule.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.840
When asked whether two linear objects
intersect, the answer is that there will

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.030
either be a unique point of
intersection, there will be no common

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.160
intersection or there will be
infinitely many intersection points.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.880
There cannot just be two or
three intersections.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.720
So given two lines in two dimensions,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.260
how can we tell whether
they have an intersection?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.070
Well, first, we should check
whether they are parallel by

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.080
looking at their normal vectors.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.380
If their normal vectors are parallel,

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.230
then we need to check whether
they are the same line.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.660
How can we do this?

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.090
Suppose the two lines are coincident,
that is, the same line.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.480
Then, if I take any point
from the first line and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.150
any point from the second line,
in reality, from the same line,

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.610
then the vector connecting the two
points will be parallel to both lines.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.000
In other words,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.550
this vector will be orthogonal
to both lines' normal vectors.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.758
On the other hand, suppose the two lines
are not coincident, but still parallel.

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.510
Then these lines have no
common intersections.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.440
So if we pick a point
from the first line and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.210
a point from the second line, then
the vector connecting the two points

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.810
won't be in the direction of the lines.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.720
In other words, this connecting vector

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.650
won't be orthogonal to either
of the normal vectors.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.370
This gives us a computable test for

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.100
whether two lines are the same once
we know that they are parallel.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
Two parallel lines are coincident or
equal if and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.260
only if the vector connecting
some pair of points,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.330
one from each line, is orthogonal
to both the lines' normal vectors.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.270
Okay, now let's suppose we
have two nonparallel lines.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.130
So we know they will intersect.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.530
How do we find their intersection point?

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.580
Let's write the lines in
their standard forms.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.050
Ax plus By equals k1 and
Cx plus Dy equals k2.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.600
I write this left curly brace to
indicate that this is a system of

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.870
simultaneous linear equations.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.810
So how do we go about
solving this system?

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.110
It would be nice to divide
the first equation through by A, so

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.820
that we can solve for x.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.540
However, what if A equals 0?

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.020
Well if that were the case,
we could move to the other equation and

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.580
then try dividing this second
equation through by C.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.180
But what if C is also zero?

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.604
Actually, that can't happen because
if A and C are both zero, then

00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:43.140
the lines are just of the form Y equals
k1 over B, and Y equals k2 over D.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.890
Which are both horizontal lines, but

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.910
since we assume the two lines were not
parallel, they both can't be horizontal.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.790
So that means either A or
C has to be non-zero.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.160
To make matter simpler,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.760
let's just do the following at
the beginning of the whole procedure.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.660
We check to make sure
A does not equal zero.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.030
If so, then we swap the order
of the two equations.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.190
So A and C would swap places.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.420
B and D swap places, and
k1 and k2 also swap.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.310
Then we can always assume
that A does not equal zero.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.820
So with that assumption that A is
not zero, we can go ahead and

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.130
divide through by A giving us x
plus B over Ay equals k1 over A.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.700
Now instead of solving for

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.060
x directly, I'm going to do
something slightly different.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.050
I will now subtract C times
the left hand side of this equation

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.310
from the second equation to maintain
the balance of the second equation.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.540
I'll also subtract C times k1

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.930
over A from the right-hand
side of the second equation.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.268
So now our second equation looks
like Cx plus Dy minus Cx minus Bc

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:58.830
over Ay equals -Ck1 over A plus k2.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.600
The C terms cancel, and after
collecting the y terms together we get

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:12.050
quantity D minus BC over A times y
equals negative Ck1 over A plus k2.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.170
Now let's multiply through by A to make
the equation a bit nicer to work with,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:24.210
and then to solve for y, we can divide
through by AD minus BC or can we?

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.698
What if AD minus BC equals zero.

00:05:25.698 --> 00:05:30.400
Well, if this is the case,
then let's rewrite

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.410
the left-hand side as a dot product
using the trick we used before.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.770
This gives us the vector AB dotted
with a vector D minus C equals zero.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.860
Now this first vector is a normal
vector to the first line and

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.890
the second vector D minus C is
parallel to the second line.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.725
Looking at this geometrically,

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:58.685
this means that the line Ax plus
By equals k1 is parallel to

00:05:58.685 --> 00:06:04.174
the line in the direction of D minus C,
which is Cx plus Dy = k2.

00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:08.916
But this violates our initial assumption
that the lines were not parallel.

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:14.640
So AD minus BC cannot equal
zero under this assumption.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.340
Great so that means we can divide
through by AD minus BC, so

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:27.450
y equals negative Ck1 plus Ak2
over the quantity AD minus BC.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.850
Now let's use the same subtraction
process to go from this equation

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.560
back to our first equation.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.760
If we subtract B over A times
y from the left-hand side,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.670
then we can subtract B over A times
all of this, from the right-hand side.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.920
This gives us the messy
looking equation,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:57.710
x = ((k1 / A)- (B / A))
((-Ck1 + Ak2 / AD- BC)).

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.180
Let's pull a factor of one over
A to make it a bit cleaner and

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.320
then forming a common denominator for

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.170
the k1 term allows us to consolidate
the fraction inside the parentheses.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.780
This let's us kill the BCk1 terms and

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.850
then cancel the factors of A to
get this final form x equals

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:22.020
Dk1 minus Bk2 all over AD minus BC.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.040
So the point of intersection
of these two lines,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.750
Ax plus By equals k1 and
Cx plus Dy equals k2.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.022
Assuming they are not parallel lines,

00:07:34.022 --> 00:07:40.106
is this point x equals Dk1
minus Bk2 over AD minus BC and

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:44.780
y equals -Ck1 plus Ak2 over AD minus BC.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.610
This formula might look rather
messy at first blush, but it

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.570
actually exhibits some nice symmetries
that we'll explore a bit later.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.060
For now though let's go ahead and

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.760
code up a function to compute this
intersection between two lines.
