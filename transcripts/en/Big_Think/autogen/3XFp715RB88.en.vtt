00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
like you've been hooked by the shoulds I
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.090
like you've been hooked by the shoulds I
would suggest that you address them by

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
would suggest that you address them by
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.850
would suggest that you address them by
using an acronym I call the power no and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
using an acronym I call the power no and
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219
using an acronym I call the power no and
by using the power no you step through

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
by using the power no you step through
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.289
by using the power no you step through
the P and the oh and the W and the E and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
the P and the oh and the W and the E and
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.289
the P and the oh and the W and the E and
the R and get really clear on is this

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
the R and get really clear on is this
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450
the R and get really clear on is this
assured that usage say yes to or you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460
assured that usage say yes to or you
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.190
assured that usage say yes to or you
should say no to so the first one is the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
should say no to so the first one is the
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.520
should say no to so the first one is the
purpose questions so what is the purpose

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
purpose questions so what is the purpose
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.980
purpose questions so what is the purpose
behind this should you know who really

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
behind this should you know who really
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990
behind this should you know who really
is driving it and what is this should

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
is driving it and what is this should
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.920
is driving it and what is this should
getting at

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
getting at
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.920
getting at
and then the Oh stand for the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930
and then the Oh stand for the
 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.649
and then the Oh stand for the
opportunity because sometimes a should

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
opportunity because sometimes a should
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.240
opportunity because sometimes a should
could be shining a light on an

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
could be shining a light on an
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.020
could be shining a light on an
opportunity so you could be asked to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030
opportunity so you could be asked to
 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.090
opportunity so you could be asked to
work in a stretch assignment this could

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
work in a stretch assignment this could
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800
work in a stretch assignment this could
be a real opportunity for you so you

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
be a real opportunity for you so you
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.990
be a real opportunity for you so you
want to listen and is there an

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
want to listen and is there an
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.690
want to listen and is there an
opportunity potentially and that should

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
opportunity potentially and that should
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.209
opportunity potentially and that should
that's going through your head then the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
that's going through your head then the
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520
that's going through your head then the
next one is to think about the who who

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
next one is to think about the who who
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980
next one is to think about the who who
is behind this should or who is making

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
is behind this should or who is making
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.260
is behind this should or who is making
this ask of you is it your boss is it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
this ask of you is it your boss is it
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.109
this ask of you is it your boss is it
your manager or is it this old script

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
your manager or is it this old script
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.139
your manager or is it this old script
it's your mom in your head who is this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
it's your mom in your head who is this
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.600
it's your mom in your head who is this
should have been generated from

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
should have been generated from
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.020
should have been generated from
and then think about the expectations so

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030
and then think about the expectations so
 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.300
and then think about the expectations so
what expectations are coming with this

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
what expectations are coming with this
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.500
what expectations are coming with this
should is it an expectation that the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
should is it an expectation that the
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.800
should is it an expectation that the
star performer at work always does this

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
star performer at work always does this
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.820
star performer at work always does this
or this is what a manager should do just

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830
or this is what a manager should do just
 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.110
or this is what a manager should do just
really think about those expectations

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120
really think about those expectations
 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640
really think about those expectations
are they yours

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
are they yours
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.670
are they yours
are they society's whose are they and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
are they society's whose are they and
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.010
are they society's whose are they and
are they really an alignment and then

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020
are they really an alignment and then
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.720
are they really an alignment and then
the last thing I would challenge you to

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
the last thing I would challenge you to
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.390
the last thing I would challenge you to
think about is is it real I mean so is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
think about is is it real I mean so is
 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910
think about is is it real I mean so is
it really true that you have to bake

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920
it really true that you have to bake
 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.370
it really true that you have to bake
cupcakes from scratch that's not true

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380
cupcakes from scratch that's not true
 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.990
cupcakes from scratch that's not true
they're much better cupcakes that are

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000
they're much better cupcakes that are
 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.910
they're much better cupcakes that are
store-bought for most of us so you're

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
store-bought for most of us so you're
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.490
store-bought for most of us so you're
questioning is it real for you and is it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
questioning is it real for you and is it
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.370
questioning is it real for you and is it
real and your organization is every time

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
real and your organization is every time
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.800
real and your organization is every time
you say yes to something you're saying

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
you say yes to something you're saying
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.000
you say yes to something you're saying
no to something else and the shoulds we

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
no to something else and the shoulds we
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.040
no to something else and the shoulds we
ever commit we say yes more than we say

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050
ever commit we say yes more than we say
 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.040
ever commit we say yes more than we say
no and so at the end something suffers

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
no and so at the end something suffers
 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.480
no and so at the end something suffers
it's either our work or our personal

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490
it's either our work or our personal
 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.970
it's either our work or our personal
life
