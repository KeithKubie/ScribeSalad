00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.120
Functions are special R objects
that take in other

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.800
objects as arguments and
produce something.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.030
In many cases, the person who
wrote the function provides

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.460
default values for some or
even all the arguments.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.280
We've now seen a couple of
important functions and

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.360
techniques.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.910
First we saw the concatenate
function that was used to

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.520
create vectors.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.767
And we saw we could create
vectors that are sequences of

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:29.150
integers using the integer
colon integer notation.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.990
We used the length, head, and
tail functions to learn more

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.240
about vectors.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.180
We also saw character vectors.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.590
The letters object is a built-in
vector of letters

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.450
inside of R. If we wanted,
we could exam the

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.440
subset of the letters.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.280
We also saw how to construct
matrices using the matrix

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.700
function, as well as how to
specify the number of rows and

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.900
columns for a matrix using the
second and third arguments.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.660
The dim function provided
the way to check the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.340
dimensions of a matrix.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.740
And we could again use brackets
to examine a subset

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.599
of the matrix, except that we
specified both rows and

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.160
columns or just one.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.700
Videos are great, but they're no
stand-in for documentation.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.365
Thankfully, most functions in
R are very well documented.

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:23.670
To access the Help file for a
function, just type a question

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.040
mark, the function name,
and then hit Return.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.720
Here's the Help file for
the sequence function.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720
At the top of the file is a
description of the sequence

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.280
function and other related
functions described

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.230
in this Help file.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.740
The next section shows
the sequence

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.800
function and its variance.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.370
And the argument section
provides details for what type

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.000
of inputs are reasonable
and how to

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.420
specify additional options.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.290
The next sections of particular
interest are the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.370
See Also and Example sections.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.440
It's a good idea to take a look
at the Example section

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.170
early on when you're exploring
a new function.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.550
On OS X, it's also easy to run
examples from the Help file

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.880
but highlighting the example
text, holding down Command,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.130
and then hitting Return.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.060
Congratulations!

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.420
You've completed the first
section of R videos.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.690
Take some time to try out
what you've learned.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.650
And when R gives you an error,
check for typing mistakes,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.300
which are common.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.690
After you've finished
experimenting, fuel up and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.940
start Section 2.
