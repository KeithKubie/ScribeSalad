00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.703
(gentle music)

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.423
- [Male] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.590
bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.630
lone the master of
fire, tools and language

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.830
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.883
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.475
We grow up slowly,

00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:36.243
we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.893
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.453
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:44.693
of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.737
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:14.648 --> 00:01:17.231
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.089 --> 00:01:40.090
- And thank you,

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.866
it's a pleasure to be here
in this fabulous symposium.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.860
I will be talking about mathematics

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.930
and mathematics is perhaps
one of the most abstract,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.750
complex and precise human
conceptual systems ever invented.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.042
Think about the Euclidean
point, for example.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:02.210
It's an entity that has only one property,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.620
that's location.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.110
No extension whatsoever

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.100
so no Euclidean point exists

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.110
really objectively in the universe

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.150
and we have no biology to
perceive a Euclidean point.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.270
Yet the Euclidean point,
the humble little guy,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.780
is the cornerstone of the
edifice of Euclidean geometry

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.619
that led to analytic geometry,

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.400
non-Euclidean geometries,
differential geometries,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.662
many other fields in mathematics.

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:30.930
So one area that we could look at

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.043
for the origins of this fabulous
human conceptual system,

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:37.567
this abstract thing, is number.

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:42.560
So to begin, consider the following.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.820
If you're presented, let's say,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.270
with this stimuli,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.973
it's very easy for us to
discriminate between them.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.885
But when the amount of dots increases,

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:52.210
it's not as easy

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.410
and we make a few more mistakes

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.981
and we make confusions.

00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:58.143
Now the capacity to discriminate

00:02:58.143 --> 00:03:01.540
when there's only few of
them is called subitizing

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.130
and has been studied by
experimental psychologists

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.923
in the 1940s.

00:03:07.093 --> 00:03:10.160
So this is an ability we
don't need to go to school to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.480
and we share with many other species.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.210
Another ability is the following.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.960
If we're presented, let's say, with

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.360
these groups of dots, black and white,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.040
when their proportions differ considerably

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.470
it's very easy for us to say

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.430
which one has more,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.670
even though we may not
know exactly how many

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.804
but we can tell.

00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:34.391
When the proportions are
closer to each other,

00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.970
it's a little harder and
sometimes very, very difficult.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.070
So this capacity is referred to

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.320
as large quantity discrimination.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.890
Now these two capacities we
share with many other species,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.090
as I was saying.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.230
So this has led to many,

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.560
really to believe that this
is about now mathematics.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.150
So you will tend to see many papers

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.350
and chapters and academic material

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.910
talking about monkey
mathematical abilities

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.398
and kids in infancy without schooling

00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:08.270
and arithmetic occurring
at a single neuron level

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.720
and so on and so forth

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.770
all the way to more recently number,

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.886
numerical cognition in
bees and other insects.

00:04:15.886 --> 00:04:17.900
Now of course, this is academia

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.750
and then the media takes over

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.280
and says well like the
New York Times here,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.480
science section earlier this year,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.740
many animals can count,

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.096
some better than you.

00:04:27.096 --> 00:04:30.257
And I know there's some
individuals in power now

00:04:30.257 --> 00:04:33.440
who also say the New York
Times reporting fake news

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.100
these days.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.770
But that's not the only one.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.270
Sometimes we see animals with tools

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.940
and will kind of lead us to think

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.081
that there's some
mathematical content involved

00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.795
or let's say this one,

00:04:44.795 --> 00:04:47.933
Fish as Good as College
Students in Number Test,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.080
and Mosquito Fish can Count up to 100

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.840
and count in quotes.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.240
So the whole thing as a
package in this society,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.590
there's kind of a widely
accepted view that says,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.058
there's a biologically evolved
capacity that is specific

00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:03.790
for number and arithmetic

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.850
and I will underline
here the word specific.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.840
Now of course, the question
is is it really the case?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.850
And it's been some debate more lately.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.140
And part of the issue is

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.790
that some of these terms are policimous.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.950
Like number we use it for passport number,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.620
telephone number and many other things.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.670
So what do we really mean by number?

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.980
And it turns out that in the literature,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.260
the scientific literature,

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.770
is permeated really with
underspecified conceptions

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.690
of what is numbers

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.290
such that we can ascribe
numerical and arithmetical,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.460
mathematical capacities
to many other species.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.750
So let's examine this a little bit more.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.225
If we leave aside non-human
animals for a moment,

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:49.145
we can focus on human data
that's been overlooked.

00:05:49.145 --> 00:05:52.560
For example, all known languages

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.900
have natural quantifiers like
few, several, many and so on

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.028
but by no means, they all
exhibit exact quantification.

00:05:59.028 --> 00:06:02.494
A recent study about 200
languages in aboriginal Australia

00:06:02.494 --> 00:06:05.020
from 13 different linguistic families

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.155
showed that in fact,

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:10.280
almost 90% of these languages

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.870
do not have a numeral beyond
what we would call five.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.740
So you can't, in cultures
speaking these languages,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.750
refer to seven or 12 or 19 or 23.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.540
Now similar research has been found

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.530
with hunter gatherers
in Australia and Africa

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.670
and South America

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.660
and I strongly recommend also
the book by Caleb Everett

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.683
that goes more in depth analyzing
these particular cultures.

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:38.070
Now the point is here

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.050
that when we look at human language,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.451
language by itself really
does not lead to number

00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:47.040
beyond the subitizing range.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.460
So exact quantification
seems to be a cultural trait,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.494
not a biological trait.

00:06:52.494 --> 00:06:57.494
So how do we get from
perceiving, let's say these dots,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.500
to labeling them as let's
say being nine or eight,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.924
whether with spoken words or with digits?

00:07:05.924 --> 00:07:07.410
Well when we do that,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.460
we're involved in what is
called symbolic reference.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.920
It's not just a purely
psychophysical perception anymore.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.340
It's now another cognitive
activity like symbolic reference.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.680
And we could do this with
many other types of numerals

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.950
like in Spanish nueve and ocho

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.230
or we could do Roman
numerals and other forms

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.860
and different bases in mathematics

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.980
or infinite decimal notation, if you like,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.900
and so on and so forth.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.613
And there's another important property.

00:07:33.613 --> 00:07:36.050
It's their relational inoperable.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.190
So like my laptop computer here says

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.190
number eight is equivalent to
the product of two and four,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.210
it's one more than seven and those things.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.260
So they're all related to each other.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.264
So really our familiar
list, one, two, three,

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:54.320
has very specific abstract properties,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.200
like it quantifies exactly,

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.383
not in an approximate way,

00:07:57.383 --> 00:08:01.760
and it is abstract,
transcending stimulus modality,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.160
visual or auditory,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.280
it has a cardinal sense, an ordinal sense,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.450
a relational property that we just saw,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.991
combinative, operable,
and most importantly,

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:13.870
referred to symbolically.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.960
So the number really is exact
symbolic quantification.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.678
And this seems to be quite different

00:08:19.678 --> 00:08:22.815
from what we observe,
let's say with trained,

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:26.530
by humans of course,
trained animals in the lab

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:28.237
where you can get, for example, monkeys

00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:32.520
in painstaking training,
four months, 20,000 trials,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.080
to discriminate dots in
a ratio three to four

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.410
only to 70% of accuracy.

00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.180
So it seems to be that we're
in a different realm here.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.800
So to summarize here,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.570
we can look at this figure.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.010
Essentially what we have

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.920
is amount of discrete
stuff, let's say dots,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.739
going from center to periphery,

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:54.030
increasing in amount.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.665
So what you see in the bottom left here,

00:08:57.665 --> 00:09:01.840
what you have is subitizing a
large quantity discrimination,

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.150
the two abilities we just exercised

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:05.242
a little bit at the beginning,

00:09:05.242 --> 00:09:08.268
and we share those with many species.

00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:10.749
Now with symbolic reference,

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.270
there's a symbolic gap there,

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.140
we can then label things
like natural quantifiers

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.190
like many, few and so on,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.360
and then with exact quantification

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.215
we get into what you see
clockwise there in blue

00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:27.130
which is now truly numerical.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.985
So the point is here,

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:31.384
what you see on the left

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:34.029
is really about quantity perception.

00:09:34.029 --> 00:09:36.250
It's quantical abilities that we,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.270
it's biologically endowed.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.674
But in order to really get to number

00:09:40.674 --> 00:09:44.130
we need to go across
the symbolic reference

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.060
and that is not biologically evolvable.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.720
So here I'm gonna borrow
a quote from Terri Deacon,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.370
also a member of Carta,

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.410
who says, "Symbolic reference
must be acquired by learning,"

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.747
so this occurs in the
anthology of individuals,

00:09:56.747 --> 00:09:59.177
"and lacks both the natural associations

00:09:59.177 --> 00:10:01.627
"and transgenerational
reproductive consequences

00:10:01.627 --> 00:10:03.177
"that would make such references

00:10:03.177 --> 00:10:05.210
"biologically evolvable."

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.147
So exact symbolic quantification

00:10:08.147 --> 00:10:10.540
beyond the subitizing range

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.338
really needs a whole apparatus,

00:10:12.338 --> 00:10:17.260
a culture that actually cares
about being exact and precise.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:19.240
So motivated by cultural preoccupations,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.560
tracking valuables, trading,
accounting and so on.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.320
And this supported by
and enhanced by tools

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.079
and off-loading cognition

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:30.155
which requires enculturation.

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:31.900
Of course, part of that comes

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.150
and we heard already
previously about this,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.090
the invention of writing
about 6,000 years ago.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.850
Initially, according to many authors

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.539
coming from tokens,

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:43.170
tokens printed on envelope of clay

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.292
and eventually leading to clay tablets.

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:49.040
But you could also have,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.790
in the absence of writing, for example,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.380
like the Inca did with
the use of the apos,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:58.836
doing performing amazingly
sophisticated calculations

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:00.497
without writing

00:11:00.497 --> 00:11:04.720
or what you see in Oceania,
in Papua New Guinea,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.223
many groups, you have
now grammatical tools

00:11:07.223 --> 00:11:10.638
in the language that
could for example codify

00:11:10.638 --> 00:11:12.920
certain types of morphines

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.960
that would characterize
number of quantities

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.580
for counting things you care about.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.420
For example, in this case,

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.490
as you see in the picture,

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:24.490
yams in the culture Nen,
work done by Nick Evans.

00:11:24.947 --> 00:11:27.150
So what's in common there

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.380
is that you need a
conventionalized symbolic reference

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.913
for exact quantification.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.223
Now when there is number,

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:42.160
most number systems are in base five or 10

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.780
and you would say, "Why is that?"

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.757
Well, here we have a very handy tool

00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:48.470
all of a sudden in front of us,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:49.890
you can identify fingers

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.410
and we can sort of,
they're readily available.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.850
So that could explain part of it.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.530
The issue is that gorillas, chimpanzees

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.030
and many species, raccoons,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:01.393
they also are pentadactyl,

00:12:01.393 --> 00:12:03.150
they also have five fingers.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.600
So evolution there,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.282
giving that particular form.

00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:08.070
So we have that,

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:09.280
we have brains that control

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.520
and get all the inputs, et cetera,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.430
but what we don't have in these cases,

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.370
is symbolic reference

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.930
and the capacity to actually use this

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.900
as now potential tools

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.480
which doesn't come with a handbook.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.173
Cultural variations exist

00:12:23.173 --> 00:12:26.240
in how you actually use
the hand for counting.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.970
So here you have top right number eight,

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.940
being characterized by
manually, unimanually,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:33.300
sometimes using the finger,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.240
sometimes using the finger joints.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.760
So number eight, if you use finger joints

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.810
and the tip would be this,
for example, and so on

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:42.809
in some cultures.

00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:46.890
Now, when there is written
exact symbolic number,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.830
it seems all this to be mediated

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.530
by culturally shaped cortical,
phenotypical plasticity.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.270
According to this work by
Tang et. al, for example,

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.750
they presented digits to English speakers

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.540
and Chinese native speakers

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.380
and they just asked

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.090
to do very simple calculations.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.900
And what we observe is
very different recruitment

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:09.734
for neural populations in the two groups.

00:13:09.734 --> 00:13:13.599
You see more recruitment
in the left hemisphere

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:17.330
(mumbles) area in the English speakers,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.070
and much, let's say, more
in the premotor regions

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.740
for the Chinese speakers.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.910
So number then,

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.060
really what we have,
is a language-mediated,

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.400
conventionalized, exact
symbolic quantification

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.240
which is a cultural trait.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.850
And this occurrying quite, quite recently

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.220
and largely outside of
biological evolution.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.870
So it builds on biologically
evolved preconditions.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.960
We need subitizing and large
quantity discrimination

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.440
but themselves, they're not
mathematical or numerical.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.210
So these are motivated by
cultural preoccupations,

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.043
as I said,

00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:55.660
supported crucially by
material and conceptual tools

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:59.195
and the biology that makes
enculturation possible.

00:13:59.195 --> 00:14:01.550
So I want to take this
now to the next step.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:02.680
Once we have numbers,

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.572
we can start creating all
kinds of other things.

00:14:04.572 --> 00:14:09.428
One very ubiquitous, powerful
tool is a number line

00:14:09.428 --> 00:14:11.690
which now we need another system

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:15.050
which is to conceive numbers
as locations in space,

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.610
metaphorically, if you will.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.443
And this of course,

00:14:17.443 --> 00:14:18.740
many of the talks before this,

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.900
when we're using graphs to characterize

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.000
some mounds and so on,

00:14:23.192 --> 00:14:26.980
it's helpful for reading economic graphs

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.210
and look at scientific data

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.230
or develop vector spaces

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:33.967
and fancy visualizations and so on.

00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:35.190
What is interesting

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:36.581
is that these days,

00:14:36.581 --> 00:14:40.540
this is learned or
presented in kindergarten.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.483
So kindergarteners already
start to see little bunnies

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.650
jumping back and forth and froggies

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.221
doing jumps and so on and so forth.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:50.190
So this has led a lot of people

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.030
to think that perhaps we have,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.900
again, a biologically
endowed mental number line

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.030
which is housed in the
intraparietal sulcus

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.113
of the human brain.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.380
Well that's true if you
only look at westerners

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.820
who already went to school

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:04.950
and have done all this work.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.270
So a lot of papers support the idea

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.580
that you would have very
spontaneous mappings

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.680
and occurring in infants and macaques

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.215
and more recently a paper in Science

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:18.070
saying that newborn chicks now,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.064
so go figure, what kind
of cortex they would have,

00:15:21.064 --> 00:15:25.023
would actually have a mental
number line like humans.

00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:27.606
Now if that were really the case,

00:15:27.606 --> 00:15:30.450
let's cross that with
some other type of data.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.260
For example, we would expect culture,

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.280
number-savvy cultures
like Babylonia, let's say,

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.410
to have some manifestation
of number lines somewhere

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.405
in all the number crunching they did.

00:15:41.405 --> 00:15:43.620
Well, when you look at
half a million tablets

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.460
that we know today,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.859
there's not a single number line there.

00:15:46.859 --> 00:15:48.250
So that says something.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.950
They did a lot of numbers
without a number line.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.480
In fact, you have to go to 17th century,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.920
it's not even in La
Geometrie by Rene Descartes

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.730
who invented analytic geometry,

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.543
not a single number line there either.

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:04.590
There first appears to be,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.960
John Napier when he's
introducing algorithms,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.341
a very sophisticated notion

00:16:08.341 --> 00:16:11.950
and he is saying, okay, here's a line,

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.605
we're gonna start thinking this way.

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:17.270
But the first who does the
operational use of a number line

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:18.147
is John Wallis.

00:16:18.147 --> 00:16:21.010
And here, if you really
look at the text it says,

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.430
okay, the audience is
(speaking in foreign language),

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.240
the top of the top of mathematicians

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.925
in Europe in the 17th century saying,

00:16:27.925 --> 00:16:30.680
think of a man walking five steps

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.190
and then walking two back

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.450
and that's gonna be five
minus two equals three.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.760
That's what you hear today
in a kindergarten class

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.473
but this is now a few
hundred years ago in Europe.

00:16:40.473 --> 00:16:42.377
So we also wanted to test

00:16:42.377 --> 00:16:44.080
how spontaneous is this?

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.540
So we went, we did a study

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.730
among the Yupno of Papua New Guinea,

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.025
and we presented a line segment

00:16:50.025 --> 00:16:52.340
and following other methods

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.697
that have been used in the Amazon,

00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:57.080
and we could see that for example,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.550
even though they had
numbers to at least 20,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.577
and numerals,

00:17:01.577 --> 00:17:06.012
they essentially mapped
small numbers on one end

00:17:06.012 --> 00:17:08.030
and bigger to the other end,

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.916
whether it was dots or
tones or other things

00:17:10.916 --> 00:17:13.350
unlike the schooled Yupno

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:15.810
and California controls.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.850
As you can see, on the right side.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:19.390
So the red one being the unschooled

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.390
using only the extremes.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.010
So no use of the path whatsoever

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:26.840
which is required for the number lines.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.650
So the intrusion doesn't seem to be,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.081
again, universal in that sense.

00:17:31.081 --> 00:17:33.620
So what do we do with these abstractions?

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.923
Well, we do crazy things.

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:36.757
So of course, we have the mathematicians

00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:39.229
very recently developing it

00:17:39.229 --> 00:17:42.733
but today is introduced
in the kindergarten class.

00:17:44.027 --> 00:17:48.460
But this could be taken
to further directions

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.780
to develop the notions of hyperreal lines.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.100
So all of a sudden now,

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.830
the number line and the real line

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.310
which is now housing irrational numbers

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.680
and rational numbers

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.690
and by virtue of least upper bound axon,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.820
you have a complete order field,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.600
no more thoughts could fit in there.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.530
Well you can when you go
to non Euclidean umbers.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.020
Infinitely, tiny,
infinitely small numbers,

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.620
the absolons you see there,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.930
or huge numbers, their
reciprocals, the omegas,

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.791
that are bigger and larger
than any real number.

00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:20.470
So then you start to have embedded,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.337
mutually incompatible, non-commensurable,

00:18:22.337 --> 00:18:26.000
number lines embedded
in infinitely many spots

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.250
in infinitely many of these lines.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.660
All this going back to
the simple number line

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.554
that we develop about 300 years ago.

00:18:33.554 --> 00:18:36.770
So really the story of numbers

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.300
and tools and mathematics

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.060
can be reduced to this
process of enculturation

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.110
where you do need an
a biological apparatus

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.170
that would support it.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.950
So I would like to close with this quote,

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.767
and I thank Pascal Gagneur
for pointing me to this one,

00:18:48.767 --> 00:18:51.027
by geneticist and evolutionary biologist,

00:18:51.027 --> 00:18:52.986
Theodosius Dobzhansky who said,

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:55.647
"Human evolution has two components,

00:18:55.647 --> 00:18:57.867
"the biological or organic,

00:18:57.867 --> 00:18:59.781
"and the cultural or superorganic.

00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:02.587
"These components are
neither mutually exclusive

00:19:02.587 --> 00:19:03.447
"nor independent

00:19:03.447 --> 00:19:06.337
"but interrelated and interdependent.

00:19:06.337 --> 00:19:08.627
"Human evolution cannot be understood

00:19:08.627 --> 00:19:10.847
"as a purely biological process,

00:19:10.847 --> 00:19:12.757
"nor can it be adequately described

00:19:12.757 --> 00:19:14.397
"as a history of culture.

00:19:14.397 --> 00:19:17.600
"It is the interaction
of biology and culture."

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.180
And I think mathematics
exemplifies this perfectly well.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.013
Thank you.

00:19:22.013 --> 00:19:24.768
(audience applause)

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.630
- So I'd like you to raise your hand

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.020
if someone in your life,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.350
a young person in your
life, often looks like this.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:33.850
So maybe it's a child, a grandchild,

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.680
the person in the line for
coffee in front of you.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.772
Okay, you are not alone.

00:19:38.772 --> 00:19:41.630
Meet this generation of digital natives.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.190
Right, so we've heard that term,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.860
a generation of young people

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.908
that were born without knowing
a time before the internet.

00:19:48.908 --> 00:19:50.890
So I'm a digital immigrant.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.851
I won't ask you to identify

00:19:51.851 --> 00:19:52.708
if you are or not

00:19:52.708 --> 00:19:55.871
but I remember a world
without the internet

00:19:55.871 --> 00:19:59.152
and having to learn how to
integrate the digital world

00:19:59.152 --> 00:20:02.440
into how I work, how I communicate,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.907
and that's a very different space

00:20:03.907 --> 00:20:06.140
than our kids are growing up in now.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.120
So in the digital age,

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.118
the one thing we do know

00:20:08.118 --> 00:20:10.790
is that the young people among us

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.804
are early adopters,

00:20:11.804 --> 00:20:15.979
they are enthusiastic
adopters of new technologies.

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:18.860
Here's some data just from 2004.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.850
We started following kids
around on their mobile devices

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.180
around 2007

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.504
and this just shows you
some of the changes we saw

00:20:25.504 --> 00:20:26.752
during that time.

00:20:26.752 --> 00:20:30.010
2018 is a last time for which we have

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.620
a representative sample

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.870
and 95% of adolescents now
have access to a mobile device.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.220
They're on them quite a lot.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.500
And so a recent survey showed us

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.474
that tweens, those are
eight to 12 year olds,

00:20:43.474 --> 00:20:48.230
they're on 4.36 hours,

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.170
and this is just for media screen time.

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.150
So this doesn't count
screen time for homework

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:55.300
or other activities.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.610
Teens, it's 6.4 hours a day,

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:00.290
so almost six and a half hours a day.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.505
And I want you to hold
the number in your mind,

00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:05.878
that's the three hours more per day

00:21:05.878 --> 00:21:09.540
that children from low-income
households are on a screen.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.370
So there's a huge
difference in screen time

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.165
based on the income level of your family.

00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:16.590
So we have a sample

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.250
of 2,000 young adolescents
we've been following

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.130
and these are some data on them.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.960
This is just them across age.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.830
So on the bottom of the screen,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.050
you'll see age here from 11 to 15

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.620
and you'll see if the
young people in your life

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.330
are around 11 years old,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.812
about 48% of their peers
own a mobile device.

00:21:35.812 --> 00:21:39.449
As we get older in our sample,

00:21:39.449 --> 00:21:42.284
we get up here to almost full saturation.

00:21:42.284 --> 00:21:45.840
This line up here is access
to the internet at home.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.440
So something we used to worry
a lot about in education

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.810
was a digital divide.

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:52.370
So some kids not having
access to the internet,

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.875
that's no longer true.

00:21:53.875 --> 00:21:57.340
And smartphone use is actually higher

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.486
among children from lower income families.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:02.997
So we don't see that
traditional digital divide.

00:22:02.997 --> 00:22:06.620
We see few differences in
mobile device ownership

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.870
by socioeconomic status

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.260
but as I'm gonna show you,

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.502
we see differences in
experiences and maybe effects.

00:22:12.502 --> 00:22:14.342
So what does this all mean?

00:22:14.342 --> 00:22:16.646
If you pick up a paper,

00:22:16.646 --> 00:22:18.320
probably today or tomorrow,

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.313
you'll read some story
about how digital devices

00:22:21.313 --> 00:22:23.102
are ruining our children,

00:22:23.102 --> 00:22:25.469
smartphones are destroying a generation.

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:28.180
Recently we had a number of psychologists

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.384
sign a letter, an open letter to Apple,

00:22:30.384 --> 00:22:32.570
demanding that tech companies

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.140
end their addictive
practices toward our children

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.282
based on evidence, they said,

00:22:37.282 --> 00:22:40.270
that smartphones were
making our children lonely,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.170
depressed, suicidal,

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:44.840
stealing things from them.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.008
These are big claims,

00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:47.680
these are big claims.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.090
So is this constant connection,

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.330
is it harmful to our kids?

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.365
And I'm gonna show you
two pieces of evidence.

00:22:52.365 --> 00:22:54.950
The first one is from a team in Britain

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:57.260
and they've assembled
large amasses of data

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.016
on hundreds of thousands of adolescents.

00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:00.260
Now these are surveys,

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.624
so just correlational research

00:23:01.624 --> 00:23:04.710
asking kids to report
on the amount of time

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.294
they're on their devices and
their mental health problems.

00:23:08.294 --> 00:23:10.070
I'm gonna show you a graph here

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:11.151
but the thing to focus on

00:23:11.151 --> 00:23:15.340
is just this pattern, a
Goldilocks effect, right?

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.660
So here are the kids that
are not on screen time

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.410
at all in a day.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.620
Here are the kids in
those one or two hours

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.925
and then here's kind of a
deterioration of wellbeing

00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:25.493
across time.

00:23:25.493 --> 00:23:27.910
So described as a Goldilocks effect,

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.277
the kids that are on not at all,

00:23:29.277 --> 00:23:31.150
don't look so great on mental health,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.600
the kids in the one to
two hour range look good

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.320
and then out at the lower ends of the tail

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.370
or the higher ends of the tail,

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.390
those kids are experiencing some problems.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:41.884
Now remember, this is correlational.

00:23:41.884 --> 00:23:43.380
The other thing to remember

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.906
is that these data

00:23:45.906 --> 00:23:47.990
and all the data that are presented,

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.476
including the data where people

00:23:49.476 --> 00:23:52.717
argue that smartphones are
causing mental health problems,

00:23:52.717 --> 00:23:56.063
these actually explain
less than one percent

00:23:56.063 --> 00:23:59.660
of the differences between
kids and their mental health.

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:00.788
So said another way,

00:24:00.788 --> 00:24:05.788
99.5% of the reasons that kids
are different than each other

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.280
on their mental health problems

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.815
is due to something
other than screen time.

00:24:09.815 --> 00:24:11.450
These same authors

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.730
took other variables they
measured in the data chips,

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.220
oh chips, in the data,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.950
including potato chips,
eating potato chips,

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.043
higher correlation than screen time,

00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:24.891
eating breakfast, 14 times
higher than screen time.

00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:27.778
So just a word of caution.

00:24:27.778 --> 00:24:29.450
Now we took a different approach.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.120
We've been following kids on their phone.

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.010
So we had the advantage

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.230
of not necessarily comparing
kids to each other.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.370
So a kid who's on zero hours a day

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.405
and a kid who's on five hours a day,

00:24:39.405 --> 00:24:43.000
they look very different on
things other than screen time.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.280
Their parents probably have them

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.550
in a very different
structured environment,

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:47.590
lots of things are different.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.100
So we looked and followed
the same kids over time

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:52.151
and asked the question,

00:24:52.151 --> 00:24:56.050
on days when Sally is using screens a lot,

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.670
what does her cognition look like,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:58.890
what does her mental health look like,

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.139
what does her sleep look like

00:25:00.139 --> 00:25:01.610
on days when she's using less?

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.876
So we use her as her own control.

00:25:03.876 --> 00:25:06.260
This is a study done by Michey Jensen,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.400
one of my postdocs

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.000
and this is in North Carolina,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.738
this is the state of North Carolina.

00:25:10.738 --> 00:25:12.540
Each one of those red dots

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.770
is where a family in our
study lives of the 2,000 kids

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:16.950
and 400 of those kids

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.720
we followed intensively on their phones.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.800
So every day, they're reporting to us

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.241
on how much they're using their devices,

00:25:22.241 --> 00:25:24.370
their mental health, et cetera.

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.238
And we find very few associations

00:25:27.238 --> 00:25:30.613
between how much they're
using, their mental health.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.429
And where we do find signal

00:25:33.429 --> 00:25:35.610
is actually in the opposite direction.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.460
So days that they're
more closely connected

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.050
to their friends and family online

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:40.820
are days that they're
less lonely and depressed.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.533
But again, really small effects.

00:25:43.504 --> 00:25:45.370
We've been interested in this.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.980
We've been using digital
technology and mobile phones

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.420
as a tool to study
adolescent's mental health

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.450
and when we first started in this area,

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:54.810
parents were asking for advice.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:55.830
It's scary.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.450
It's scary to have an adolescent, period.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.287
It's scary to have them glued
to their phone all the time.

00:26:01.287 --> 00:26:05.090
And so what we wanted to
dig a little deeper in

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.860
was what are the fears that parents have

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:09.820
and what's the science?

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.338
What do we really know

00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:13.560
and then what's the narrative?

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.710
So we went through and we identified

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.180
these seven fears that
parents and adults have

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.880
when they see young people
walking around on their devices.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.860
And then we went to the
scientific literature

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.600
and we started to examine

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.650
what do we actually
know about the effects.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.520
And here, I won't have time
to go into them all today

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.610
but I'll just summarize
with a couple of messages.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.548
In most cases we found mixed
results, we need more data.

00:26:38.548 --> 00:26:41.470
But in the majority of cases,

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:44.270
we actually found evidence
for positive effects.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.878
So kids that were the
most connected online

00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:49.270
were also most connected offline.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.230
If there were signs of vulnerability,

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:52.590
bullying, et cetera, offline,

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.040
those kids were also
experiencing problems online.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.530
So it was a bit of a mirror

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.275
between online and offline life.

00:26:59.275 --> 00:27:01.091
Parent time,

00:27:01.091 --> 00:27:04.810
so it was displacing time
you'd spend with parents,

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.847
but it wasn't impacting the relationship.

00:27:06.847 --> 00:27:10.280
Where we do find some negative effects

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.520
is in multitasking.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.190
So Paolo mentioned that before,

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:14.587
we need to keep our eye on that

00:27:14.587 --> 00:27:17.070
and sleep is critically important.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.480
So there is no question

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.810
that being on your phone late at night

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.153
which many kids are, is impairing
sleep in important ways.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.553
But when we publish these results

00:27:26.553 --> 00:27:28.854
people were angry.

00:27:28.854 --> 00:27:31.310
Parents were angry at us.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:32.410
We were saying

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.670
that there are these things

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.707
that are happening with our kids,

00:27:34.707 --> 00:27:36.775
there are things that we worry about

00:27:36.775 --> 00:27:40.326
but we don't think the
phone is the problem.

00:27:40.326 --> 00:27:42.680
And this wasn't a popular message

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.751
and in the discussion section,

00:27:43.751 --> 00:27:45.450
you guys can yell at me then,

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.400
I'm used to it now.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.730
I wasn't ready for it here

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.105
but I'm ready now.

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:52.060
And so what we asked
is what are the risks?

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.220
What are the risk of assuming
that phones are to blame

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.835
for these really important
problems facing our kids

00:27:57.835 --> 00:28:01.037
versus taking a more holistic view?

00:28:01.037 --> 00:28:03.040
Now Paolo did a wonderful job

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.870
of asking this question
of rewiring the brain

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.770
and Leah showed us signs
of developmental plasticity

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:10.603
in the brain.

00:28:10.603 --> 00:28:14.514
And this has been the focus of
extreme attention right now.

00:28:14.514 --> 00:28:19.179
So headlines, are smartphones
rewiring the brain?

00:28:19.179 --> 00:28:22.503
And again, this isn't a new concern,

00:28:22.503 --> 00:28:25.517
whether tools are impacting
the brain in some way.

00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:28.140
This is from the New York Times in 1904.

00:28:29.912 --> 00:28:32.470
Concern that these race car drivers

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.303
might have a different brain.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.040
We've seen concern.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.290
We see fears about new technologies.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:42.150
We saw this with writing,

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:43.100
people starting to write.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.920
This is gonna impair our
ability to remember things

00:28:47.484 --> 00:28:49.230
with kids, with kids.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.380
We've seen this with numerous things.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.970
We've seen it with the
introduction of romance novels,

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.140
the introduction of public libraries,

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.270
rock and roll,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.270
things that kids are doing we don't like.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.818
My husband started to complain
about this and I said,

00:29:02.818 --> 00:29:05.187
"Stop complaining because
I think this means

00:29:05.187 --> 00:29:06.997
"that we're not kids anymore."

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.560
Kids these days.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.977
So this is Scientific American,

00:29:12.977 --> 00:29:15.260
"Are Smartphones Really
Destroying the Adolescent Brain?"

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.510
And I think that this
is an important question

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.390
of how the brain has become rewired,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.120
how we're learning language
differently, et cetera.

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.740
There's a recent article that showed,

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.650
in fact, digital technology
use and thumb movement

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:30.820
can be traced, differences
in this on a day to day level

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.560
to cortical activity based on an EEG

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.903
and those are important questions

00:29:34.903 --> 00:29:37.690
but I think maybe they're
the wrong ones right now

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.730
if we're thinking about
our kid's wellbeing.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.780
I think the questions
that we need to be asking

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.100
are how are these tools used,

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.710
how are we scaffolding

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.640
and how are we engaging
with these new technologies

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.610
with our kids and optimizing them

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.410
for their potential and their future?

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.184
So we wrote recently that smartphones,

00:29:56.184 --> 00:29:59.168
they might be bad for some teens,

00:29:59.168 --> 00:30:00.470
but not for all

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.960
and if you take you back

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.712
to that initial data that I showed you,

00:30:04.712 --> 00:30:06.750
children in low income households

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.983
spending on average three more
hours a day on their phone

00:30:09.983 --> 00:30:12.110
than kids in more affluent households,

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.570
it's not just a time difference,

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:16.140
it's what you're doing online.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:17.794
So higher income households,

00:30:17.794 --> 00:30:20.579
more likely to be using
digital technologies

00:30:20.579 --> 00:30:23.716
for educational purposes,
looking up information.

00:30:23.716 --> 00:30:25.678
Lower income households,

00:30:25.678 --> 00:30:30.350
less parental involvement, less
adult involvement on average

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.270
in scaffolding those behaviors

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.060
and building digital literacy

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.560
and the other things that we
know our kids are gonna need

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.675
if the future is in fact digital.

00:30:38.675 --> 00:30:40.470
In our study we found

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.980
that children in disadvantaged households,

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.240
they actually experienced more
spillover from social media.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.480
So something that happens on social media

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.780
actually they report results
in an offline problem,

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.420
a fight, an argument, trouble at school.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.510
So it might not just be
different experiences,

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.010
it might be different effects

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.516
for kids that are the most vulnerable.

00:30:59.516 --> 00:31:02.238
So as we look into the future,

00:31:02.238 --> 00:31:04.330
it's really not so much

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.623
about the effect of the tool,

00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:10.380
the access to these tools is equaling out.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.278
Kids have access to computers,

00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:14.700
kids have access to smartphones

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.754
across socioeconomic status

00:31:16.754 --> 00:31:20.290
but the types of experiences
they're having online,

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.070
the type of help that they're getting

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:24.730
to ensure that they build
the skills in an online world

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:25.636
for an online future

00:31:25.636 --> 00:31:26.900
are very different

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.108
and it's possible that there
might be more negative effects

00:31:29.108 --> 00:31:31.800
for certain populations of children.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.971
So I would encourage us
as we kind of look towards

00:31:33.971 --> 00:31:36.520
supporting children in the digital world

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.690
that we look past some of the headlines,

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.043
some of the fears that we have,

00:31:40.043 --> 00:31:42.040
some of the reasons that we don't like

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.285
the technology itself

00:31:43.285 --> 00:31:47.460
and for parents who
report the biggest sources

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.870
of conflict in their home

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.620
is fights over how long
their kid is on a device,

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:53.900
and I screamed at my
child yesterday for this

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.786
and caught myself.

00:31:54.786 --> 00:31:57.910
So instead of focusing on the time limits,

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.610
focus on what they're doing.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:00.760
Take some time,

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.710
spend some time with them there.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.920
And we're entering into a whole new world

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.929
as our homes get smarter.

00:32:06.929 --> 00:32:10.693
So here's a little boy
talking to his Alexa

00:32:10.693 --> 00:32:13.700
and I'm sure we'll have
a lively discussion

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.330
of what it means to have Alexa

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.790
raising our children soon.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.858
So thank you for your attention

00:32:18.858 --> 00:32:21.274
and for the opportunity.

00:32:21.274 --> 00:32:24.274
(audience applause)

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.970
- Alright, so to address this question

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.637
of the impact of tool use and technology

00:32:30.637 --> 00:32:33.225
on the evolution of the human mind,

00:32:33.225 --> 00:32:36.520
I want to begin by
addressing this question,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.260
how can we account for our species'

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.100
immense ecological dominance

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.210
and our stunning technological prowess?

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:44.950
Now when people approach this question

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.010
they come to it with certain intuitions.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.870
Intuitions that we're smart,

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.480
we're good at building causal models

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.561
of how the world works,

00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.620
we're good at individually figuring out

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.064
and this must be the
secret of our success.

00:32:56.064 --> 00:33:00.110
But it turns out that
that's not the best story

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.740
and that we're actually not that good

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.850
at figuring things out.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.628
And so what I'm gonna
try to convince you today

00:33:04.628 --> 00:33:07.860
is that in fact, there's
another way of approaching this

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.340
and there's a different explanation

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.840
for the secret of our success.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.030
Okay, so I'm gonna just begin

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.390
with a little bit of data.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.494
So this comes from a
battery of cognitive tests

00:33:17.494 --> 00:33:19.750
administered to three different species.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.732
So two and a half year old humans,

00:33:21.732 --> 00:33:24.040
chimpanzees and orangutans,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.830
and this research is done by Esther Herman

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:26.860
and Mike Tomasello

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.860
at the Max Planck Institute
for Evolutionary Anthropology.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.038
And so 18 different cognitive tests

00:33:32.038 --> 00:33:34.290
broken down into three different areas.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.667
So space, a subset of tests on space,

00:33:37.667 --> 00:33:40.680
quantities, causality and social learning.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.302
And what you can see from this figure here

00:33:43.302 --> 00:33:48.302
is that the humans do about
as well as the chimps,

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.951
they get about 70% right on this space.

00:33:50.951 --> 00:33:53.830
The chimps actually do
sightly better than humans

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.189
on quantity.

00:33:55.189 --> 00:33:57.300
So its within the margin of error

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.950
but the chimps do a little bit better.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.166
And same thing on causality,

00:34:00.166 --> 00:34:02.145
the chimps do marginally better.

00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:04.270
Now if you dig into the causality test

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.763
and look specifically at the tests

00:34:05.763 --> 00:34:08.100
that try to measure
differences in tool using,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.500
the chimps actually do
much better on tool using

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:12.587
than the two and a half year old children.

00:34:12.587 --> 00:34:14.835
Now I think the real telling point here

00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:16.678
is that if I were to give

00:34:16.678 --> 00:34:19.140
this battery of cognitive
tests to you guys,

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.020
you would blow the roof off the test

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.670
and you'd do much better than the apes.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.980
So between two and going
up well into the 20s,

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.970
humans still,

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.080
we get better and better

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.450
at solving these cognitive problems.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:33.010
So something is happening
during that time.

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.010
Meanwhile, if we look at the chimpanzees,

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.980
there's no change over
the course of their lives.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.960
In fact, sometimes the young chimpanzees,

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.390
the five year old chimpanzees

00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:43.130
are better at the tasks
than the older chimpanzees.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:45.828
So that's a hint to what
must be going on there.

00:34:45.828 --> 00:34:46.970
There's nothing special

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:48.660
about these particular measures.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.718
I could show you data on working memory

00:34:50.718 --> 00:34:53.950
or chimps and humans engaging
in strategic thinking

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:56.360
and you would see that
there's no particular

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.250
human advantage in this.

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.750
Another way of getting at this

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.583
would be to think about

00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:03.140
taking this room of very smart people

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.760
and parachuting you into the Ituri Forest

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.130
or into the Amazon basin,

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.170
and having you try to survive.

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.310
And you would no doubt struggle,

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:12.320
you couldn't start a fire,

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.758
you couldn't make tools,

00:35:13.758 --> 00:35:15.710
if it was a game of Survivor,

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.283
you would probably lose
to Dorothy's capuchins.

00:35:19.864 --> 00:35:21.570
So we're clearly missing something.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.750
Humans rely on this large
body of cultural inheritance.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.360
So it's not our innate intelligence

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.740
or our problem solving abilities

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.057
or our ability to build
causal models on the fly

00:35:30.057 --> 00:35:31.463
but something else.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.034
So where do our fancy tools
and technologies come from?

00:35:35.034 --> 00:35:36.075
So I'm gonna make the case

00:35:36.075 --> 00:35:38.650
that it comes from our collective brain,

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.480
and particularly, our collective brain

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.650
is anchored in our cultural
natures and social natures.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.170
So these are two separate things.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.890
Our cultural natures is our
ability to learn from others,

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:49.840
to look out into the minds and behaviors

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.347
of others in our social milieu

00:35:51.347 --> 00:35:55.224
and filter out and learn ideas,
beliefs, values, practices,

00:35:55.224 --> 00:35:56.765
from other members of our group.

00:35:56.765 --> 00:35:59.930
The social part is that
for various reasons,

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:01.270
we're able to live in large groups

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.100
and the larger the group, the better,

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.350
the more we're able to
generate ideas, beliefs

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.213
and values that are adapted
to our environments,

00:36:07.213 --> 00:36:09.383
more sophisticated technologies.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.180
Alright, now to get at this question

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.745
from an evolutionary perspective,

00:36:13.745 --> 00:36:17.657
this approach was actually
Marcus Feldman led us off today

00:36:17.657 --> 00:36:21.810
and in 1976 he wrote a paper
with Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.266
in which they made the first effort

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:26.090
to take the logic of natural selection

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.290
and of genetic evolution

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:29.560
and to think about how it might've shaped

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.760
our psychology for cultural learning,

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.790
our abilities to adaptively extract

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.080
ideas, beliefs and values

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.950
from other members of our social group.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.180
others like Boyd and Richardson

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.800
went to build a large research
program on that process.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.633
And since then,

00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:45.420
there's been a great deal of research,

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.830
much a bit with young children

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.230
showing that from even before age one,

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.070
we keenly attend to who we learn from.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.240
So we learn from certain individuals

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.891
or particular about what we learn from,

00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:58.930
how we integrate information
across individuals

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.070
and when we choose to use social learning

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.360
over our own intuitions
or our own experience.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.580
And together when you
put all this together

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.700
in large groups over many generations,

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.080
it produces what I call
cultural adaptations.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.410
And this includes the fancy
tools and technologies

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:15.510
that we're so impressive
for in the natural world.

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.670
Now this process can and often does

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:19.920
operate outside of conscious awareness.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.060
Now one of my favorite things to do

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.690
is to regale people
with many, many examples

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.690
of all the ways in
which cultural evolution

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:26.970
builds adaptive behaviors

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.961
in ways that are unconscious
and unseen behind the scenes.

00:37:29.961 --> 00:37:31.924
I'll just give you one example today.

00:37:31.924 --> 00:37:34.940
It's something you're already
familiar with, spices.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.028
So people use spices in different ways,

00:37:37.028 --> 00:37:39.710
different cultures have
different spicing traditions,

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.240
some places use many more
spices in the recipes

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.145
than other places.

00:37:43.145 --> 00:37:45.001
But once you realize that spices

00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:49.030
are an adaptation to the
problem of food-borne pathogens,

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.450
you can predict a whole bunch of things

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.890
about the kinds of plants
for which we'll harvest

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:54.070
their chemical properties

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.390
and put them in our foods,

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.260
which societies will tend
to use a lot of spices,

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.498
which spices they'll use

00:37:59.498 --> 00:38:02.760
and how they'll recombine
spices in synergetic ways

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.341
that make it more powerful
and more antimicrobial

00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:07.600
and you can predict which kinds of foods.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.830
And this can all happen
outside of conscious awareness.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:10.790
Many of you probably didn't know

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.560
that spicing was a protectant

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.050
against foodborne pathogens.

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:17.260
And in some cases, it's
even possible to show

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.473
that if people understood,

00:38:18.473 --> 00:38:20.780
they might be less
likely to do the behavior

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.880
and it would be maladaptive.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.880
So understanding is a
bad thing in some cases.

00:38:27.184 --> 00:38:29.860
Now when you begin to build models

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:31.210
and think about how humans learn,

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:32.850
so we take what we know
about human learning

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.580
and we allow humans to learn in groups,

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.093
interconnected in different ways,

00:38:36.093 --> 00:38:37.840
one of the robust findings

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.209
from what is now a
decent body of literature

00:38:40.209 --> 00:38:43.223
is that larger and more
interconnected populations

00:38:43.223 --> 00:38:45.380
evolve technologies and tools

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:47.410
and other aspects of culture more quickly

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.820
at adapting to their environment

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.653
and their ability to hold and preserve

00:38:50.653 --> 00:38:53.940
large bodies of different
tools and technologies

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:56.343
is bigger, is more,

00:38:56.343 --> 00:38:59.150
they can hold more than
in larger populations.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.983
Even more interesting,

00:38:59.983 --> 00:39:02.170
and something that you can
use to solve various puzzles

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.090
throughout human history
and around the world

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:05.044
is that a sudden reduction

00:39:05.044 --> 00:39:07.340
in the size of a population

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.690
will cause populations
to ebb away technology,

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.445
to lose things over time.

00:39:11.445 --> 00:39:14.510
Now one piece of evidence
that I like for this

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.175
is research done by Michelle
Klein and Robert Boyd

00:39:17.175 --> 00:39:19.210
and what these anthropologists did

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:20.800
is they went back to the ethnography

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.270
from societies all over Polynesia

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:26.110
and they coded marine foraging technology.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.680
And they counted the number of tools

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:29.636
these different islands
around the Pacific had

00:39:29.636 --> 00:39:32.410
and they also assessed the complexity.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.243
And you can see here,

00:39:33.243 --> 00:39:35.810
this is an example of
how very simple method

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.270
developed by Wendell Oswald

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.199
in which you just count
the parts and the tool

00:39:39.199 --> 00:39:42.203
and you can get a number of
techno units for that tool.

00:39:43.337 --> 00:39:45.560
Show you the results here quickly.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.220
So in this plot here on this side,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.080
you can see this is the population size,

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.450
it's a log scale.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:51.850
These dots are the different islands

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.134
and this is the number of tools.

00:39:53.134 --> 00:39:54.463
So larger islands

00:39:54.463 --> 00:39:58.350
had more different kinds of
tools for marine foraging

00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:01.090
and this is the mean
number of techno units.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.446
So not only did larger
islands have more total tools,

00:40:03.446 --> 00:40:05.920
those tools were on average more complex,

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:07.180
they had more parts.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.300
You can see that they also
differentiated by contact.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.180
So in addition to the population size,

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.140
they got a measure of how
connected the islands were.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.380
And islands that had more
contact with other islands

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.500
in the Pacific were,

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:19.540
they're above the line,

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.530
which means that they have an extra boost

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:23.161
over and above their population size

00:40:23.161 --> 00:40:24.700
from the interconnectedness,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.384
from being a little
bit more interconnected

00:40:26.384 --> 00:40:28.726
with other populations.

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:32.480
And one thing that's interesting

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.990
from the point of view of looking back

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.913
at the paleoanthropological record

00:40:35.913 --> 00:40:37.870
is it's not an uncommon practice

00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.188
to try to infer things about the cognition

00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:41.760
of ancient creatures

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.440
based on the kind of tools they make.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.399
But if you were to use
that same approach here,

00:40:45.399 --> 00:40:46.730
you would deduce

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.002
that the folks who lived
in Hawaii traditionally

00:40:49.002 --> 00:40:51.973
were much smarter and more
mentally sophisticated

00:40:51.973 --> 00:40:53.950
than the folks who lived
in the small island

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.433
off the coast of New Guinea.

00:40:55.433 --> 00:40:58.530
The lesson here is that it's
really the collective brain

00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.430
that's doing work,

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:02.780
not the individual smarts
of the people in the brain.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:03.613
Incidentally,

00:41:03.613 --> 00:41:05.560
this is part of the Austroasian expansion

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.110
so it's relatively recent.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:09.843
We can be confident there aren't
genetic differences there.

00:41:11.669 --> 00:41:13.510
Alright, now I don't want you to think

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:14.750
that this is just interesting

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:18.720
for thinking about ancient
Polynesian societies.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:19.825
So I put in this plot

00:41:19.825 --> 00:41:21.381
which is US cities

00:41:21.381 --> 00:41:24.180
and the number of innovations they produce

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.600
based on patent data.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.320
So the larger the US city, over 10,000,

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.131
the more patents they produce.

00:41:30.131 --> 00:41:31.846
That's not too interesting

00:41:31.846 --> 00:41:34.230
in that we would expect larger cities

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:36.270
to have more people to
produce more patents,

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.978
but this is a super linear relationship

00:41:37.978 --> 00:41:39.970
which means controlling for things

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.730
like education and occupation,

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.960
the same person put into a larger city

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.740
is more likely to produce
patents and innovations.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.500
So the people get more
innovative in larger cities.

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.530
There's a number of data sets

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:52.263
showing this same relationship.

00:41:53.808 --> 00:41:57.060
Okay, now those are all
interesting correlations

00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:59.870
but we can't be too confident

00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:01.710
there's actually a causal relationship.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:02.651
So what researchers have done

00:42:02.651 --> 00:42:04.067
is to go to the laboratory

00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:06.166
and try to create microsocieties

00:42:06.166 --> 00:42:08.250
which allow us to get some insights.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:10.644
So the typical microsociety

00:42:10.644 --> 00:42:12.960
that's been used by a number
of different researchers

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.750
is to take a bunch of,
say 100 undergraduates,

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.471
and create generations.

00:42:17.471 --> 00:42:19.610
So each individual gets a task

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:20.690
that they have to solve,

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:21.943
they do their best on the task.

00:42:21.943 --> 00:42:24.980
My tradition likes to pay
people for right answers.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.580
And then they transmit the
information in some way

00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:30.040
down to another generation
of undergraduates,

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.250
laboratory generation,

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:32.199
who then takes that information,

00:42:32.199 --> 00:42:34.305
does their best, and passes it down.

00:42:34.305 --> 00:42:36.423
So we're gonna run this
for 10 generations.

00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:38.610
Now the key thing in this set up

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.610
is that in the individual condition,

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.953
you can only learn from one teacher,

00:42:42.953 --> 00:42:45.810
so not much interconnectedness.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:46.940
In this condition,

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.760
you could learn from any one of the five

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.890
in the prior generation.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.850
So you could potentially recombine ideas

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.001
from different individuals.

00:42:54.001 --> 00:42:56.290
They had to replicate this image

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.487
with a notoriously user
unfriendly image editing program

00:43:00.487 --> 00:43:02.355
and they had a time limit.

00:43:02.355 --> 00:43:03.520
As I mentioned,

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.760
they were paid for their performance

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.870
but they're also incentivized

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.340
for their student's performance.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.584
So they get more money if
they send good instructions

00:43:09.584 --> 00:43:11.410
which then after the task,

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.585
they can write up to two pages

00:43:12.585 --> 00:43:14.696
which goes down to the next generation.

00:43:14.696 --> 00:43:17.486
It allows us to analyze the
kinds of things people said.

00:43:17.486 --> 00:43:19.750
And then so in the next generation,

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.870
everybody after generation one,

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:22.959
they get the model's product,

00:43:22.959 --> 00:43:25.130
which they can compare
to the target image,

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.963
this image,

00:43:25.963 --> 00:43:27.514
and they get the write-up

00:43:27.514 --> 00:43:30.076
and then they have a go
at the task themselves.

00:43:30.076 --> 00:43:32.120
This is the results.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.669
So 10 generations.

00:43:33.669 --> 00:43:35.776
You can see here in generation one,

00:43:35.776 --> 00:43:37.880
they actually had a pretty good group

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.754
of the single learning tradition group.

00:43:41.754 --> 00:43:43.860
But in the more interconnected group,

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.740
they didn't have such a lucky first group.

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.950
But here, a cumulative
cultural evolutionary process

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:49.783
kicked in

00:43:49.783 --> 00:43:51.475
where they could take from
the previous generation,

00:43:51.475 --> 00:43:52.800
they could add to it,

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.723
any lucky insights were brought together

00:43:54.723 --> 00:43:56.045
and then passed down.

00:43:56.045 --> 00:43:57.583
So that by the end,

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.512
the 10th generation is twice as skilled

00:44:01.512 --> 00:44:04.283
as the 10th generation
in the other treatment.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.743
Not only that,

00:44:06.743 --> 00:44:09.200
if you break down and look
at the data individually,

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.100
the worst person in the
interconnected population,

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.100
so the population that
could learn from others

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.865
is better than the best person

00:44:16.865 --> 00:44:18.370
in the single population

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.390
where you just have one to one learning.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:21.710
So it makes a big difference

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:23.370
in how apparently smart people look.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:25.620
It looks like they can
just do things better.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.103
Alright,

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.156
so I want to get back to the question

00:44:33.156 --> 00:44:34.790
that I began at the beginning

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.424
when I introduced the apes and the humans.

00:44:37.424 --> 00:44:40.070
And this was the idea

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.904
that so something from going
from a two and a half year old

00:44:41.904 --> 00:44:44.340
when your cognition is
not that much better

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.970
than a chimpanzee,

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:46.970
till you're 20 something

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.460
when you can blow the roof off
the test, what happens there?

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.301
And part of what's going on here

00:44:51.301 --> 00:44:53.720
is a download of prebuilt solutions

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.865
that have accumulated
in our inherited body

00:44:55.865 --> 00:44:58.580
of know-how over many generations.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.090
So simple things like springs and screws

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.300
and levers and pulleys

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.238
are hard to invent for the first time

00:45:05.238 --> 00:45:07.500
but once you grow up in an environment

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.336
that has springs and screws
and levers and pulleys,

00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:12.190
they're easy to figure out

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:15.800
and then reapply to new contexts.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.450
One example that I like is the wheel.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:18.808
It seems relatively simple.

00:45:18.808 --> 00:45:20.610
You see Gary Larson cartoons

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.973
with ancient human ancestors

00:45:21.973 --> 00:45:23.857
experimenting with wheels.

00:45:23.857 --> 00:45:27.500
But actually, the wheel
arrives relatively late

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.430
in human history,

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:29.940
about 6,000 years ago.

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.060
It appears on carts and then pottery,

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.605
eventually it's used to transfer power

00:45:33.605 --> 00:45:35.026
but only in Eurasia

00:45:35.026 --> 00:45:38.190
and doesn't appear in the
North America, South America,

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:40.170
Oceania, Australia.

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.580
So they don't invent wheels.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.870
Sometimes people have pointed

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:46.050
to certain kinds of animals being present

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.983
but the dog's everywhere.

00:45:46.983 --> 00:45:48.650
And you can see the Belgians here

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:50.620
are using this dog to pull their cart.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.370
So there's at least some kind
of animals that can pull.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.820
And then once you have wheels,

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.590
you can do all kinds of things with them.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:58.930
Elastically stored energy,

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.229
used to make a bow and arrow,

00:46:00.229 --> 00:46:02.300
never invented in Australia,

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.249
you don't see anything with
elastically stored energy.

00:46:04.249 --> 00:46:06.770
Fletching is not invented in New Guinea,

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.576
although New Guinea folks
do have bows and arrows.

00:46:09.576 --> 00:46:12.468
We heard from Rafael about
the counting systems.

00:46:12.468 --> 00:46:15.290
So lots of societies like the
Machiguenga who I worked with

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.773
count one, two, three, many.

00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:19.860
This group counts to 27.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.475
You can see Rafael and I
read the same literature.

00:46:22.475 --> 00:46:25.660
And you can find everything in between.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.720
So you can find groups that
can count to 11, 13, 36,

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.440
some groups figure out how to cycle

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.750
but you guys have all been
bequeathed a counting system

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.900
that allows you to count without bound.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.720
Another example is the number zero.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.470
So the number zero that has a placeholder

00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:42.610
has only been invented
twice in human history,

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:43.590
once by the Mayans,

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.110
and a second time in India.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:48.343
It diffuses to Europe
through Islamic societies.

00:46:49.297 --> 00:46:52.740
My favorite example is the abacus.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.730
So you can track the
evolution of the abacus

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:56.400
from Babylonian counting boards

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.830
and you can see how the
abacus is evolving culturally

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:02.270
to take use of how we use
space and how we clump things

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:06.150
in order to exploit aspects
of our evolved cognition.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:07.740
But then what's amazing to me

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.970
is that children can train on the abacus,

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:10.920
the physical device,

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.230
and with sufficient training,

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:13.749
they can put the abacus aside.

00:47:13.749 --> 00:47:16.160
And then you can give
them incredibly complex

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.540
calculation problems

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.650
where they're adding up large numbers,

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.897
10 or 15 of them,

00:47:21.897 --> 00:47:24.650
and they do it, you can
see their fingers moving

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.230
and they're not touching anything physical

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.820
and they seem to be looking up in the air

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.720
and then suddenly they
come out with the answer.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.070
And they have races
between the mental abacus

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.120
and the calculator.

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.924
So this is a whole new cognitive ability

00:47:34.924 --> 00:47:36.810
that's kind of bootstrapped up

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.147
from this physical apparatus

00:47:38.147 --> 00:47:39.580
which evolved culturally

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.063
to fit aspects of our minds.

00:47:43.131 --> 00:47:45.660
Alright, and so this gives
us a different picture

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.800
of how humans have evolved.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.280
So culture-driven genetic evolution.

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.790
Sometime in our species'
evolutionary history,

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:54.790
I think it happened actually

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.920
before about two million years ago,

00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.040
we became a species with
cumulative cultural evolution.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.740
What we passed down from one generation

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.932
was built upon by the next generation.

00:48:03.932 --> 00:48:05.628
How this happened,

00:48:05.628 --> 00:48:07.930
if you want to know that
you'll have to read my book,

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:09.600
The Secret of Our Success.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.480
I actually favor a kind
of social explanation.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.761
So if we became more social
and had larger groups,

00:48:14.761 --> 00:48:17.540
that could push a group of primates

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.450
across this threshold,
what I call the rubicon.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.290
And this leads to ongoing
cultural evolution.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.240
Now of course, genetic
evolution doesn't stop

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.640
and hasn't stopped now.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.220
So we have two parallel
inheritance systems

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.890
and these inheritance systems

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:34.160
have been interacting over
millions of years potentially,

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.800
or at least hundreds of thousands.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.038
So you can produce
things like stone tools,

00:48:38.038 --> 00:48:39.950
like Dietrich told us about,

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:41.260
that allow you to process food

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.210
and reduce the selection
pressure on your teeth

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.890
and your chewing apparatus.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:46.990
It can produce things
like fire and cooking

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.310
which allows us to externalize
our digestive system

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:53.102
and shrink our colon, shrink our stomachs.

00:48:53.102 --> 00:48:56.485
It supplies energy to allow
us to have larger brains,

00:48:56.485 --> 00:48:59.380
it gives us extra dexterity in our hands

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.690
to use those tools

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:02.350
and in particular, in this world,

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:04.930
our brains are being
selected for their ability

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.170
to acquire, organize, store

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:09.192
and retransmit cultural information.

00:49:09.192 --> 00:49:11.230
We're cultural learners

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.760
because the more our brains get better

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.953
at doing this culture thing,

00:49:14.953 --> 00:49:17.732
the more cumulative cultural
evolution is gonna create

00:49:17.732 --> 00:49:19.510
things that we need to learn.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:21.920
So now the game is all the
valuable stuff I need to know

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.280
is in the minds of the prior generation.

00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.020
And if I can learn something from him

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.970
and something from him
and something from her,

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.160
then I can recombine them
and have an even better

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.630
cultural repertoire.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.107
So things like throwing and
finding tubers underground,

00:49:35.107 --> 00:49:37.120
water containers can allow us

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:39.396
to engage in long distance running

00:49:39.396 --> 00:49:40.700
and persistence hunting.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.800
This is gonna create a pressure

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.910
for even larger brains

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.820
to learn all those tools and technologies,

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.885
clothings and adhesives,
eventually projectiles.

00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:48.302
And this can explain why we have a,

00:49:48.302 --> 00:49:51.873
why we seem to have a
specialized cognition

00:49:51.873 --> 00:49:53.763
for learning about artifacts.

00:49:53.763 --> 00:49:56.516
And we regard and learn about
those in a different way

00:49:56.516 --> 00:49:59.470
than we learn about things
in the biological world,

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:00.670
so plants and animals.

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:01.850
And in particular,

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:04.410
it helps explain why
we're willing to put faith

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.750
in the wisdom of prior generations.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.290
Developmental psychologists
call this over-imitation,

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.940
why we copy all the steps.

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:13.060
But it also explains
why we might be willing

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.130
to believe in invisible beings
or other magical powers.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:17.440
There's a lot of wisdom in the tradition

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.263
and we can't always tell what
the useful information is

00:50:20.263 --> 00:50:22.450
from the not so useful information.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:24.290
So the key to understanding humans

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:27.956
is to recognize this long term
period of dual inheritance

00:50:27.956 --> 00:50:31.157
and that's it.

00:50:31.157 --> 00:50:34.157
(audience applause)

00:50:37.155 --> 00:50:39.738
(upbeat music)
