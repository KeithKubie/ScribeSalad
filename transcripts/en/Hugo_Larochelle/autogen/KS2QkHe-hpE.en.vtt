00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 this capsule we will see pruning 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.340
 alfa beta so when we saw the jaws 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.860
 max mini pace is still not bad 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.380
 there and so we would like on power 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 accelerate accelerate the associated research 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.760
 to the minimax algorithm what we are going to see 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 in the next capsule including 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.580
 these two these different approaches 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.920
 to do this acceleration is the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.199
 first that we will see will allow 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 to maintain the accuracy of the solution 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.840
 that is to say once again have a 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.640
 algorithm that allows us to get 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.170
 the optimal action for another seal and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 have a second approach that she's going 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.340
 to be of a certain approximation so 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.149
 we will actually lose the optimality of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.969
 our joy but it allowed me to have 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.360
 as many improvements as we need 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.460
 for example in a context one has to 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.899
 take an action in real time so 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.059
 in this capsule 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.309
 we will see more precisely the first 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.530
 body to know a cock that keeps 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.180
 the accuracy of the solution that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.720
 is what is called pruning 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 alpha beta - will do in English forgiveness 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 alphabet the prow ning and the idea here that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.159
 is going to be actually identifying paths 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.170
 which are explored unnecessarily in order to 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.530
 just do not explore them and so 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.759
 reduce the amount calculation in our 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 research to illustrate the idea behind 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.009
 alpha concrete is going to see a very simple case 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.590
 where we finally have a part where max plays a 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.290
 turn then mine plays a trick and then 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.750
 finally the game ends and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.240
 the idea behind the station alfa beta this is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.490
 that at any time we will maintain a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.909
 kind of confidence interval so a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.040
 interval on the minimax values 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.700
 possible so the values ​​actually 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.649
 of utility that are attainable 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.430
 according to which part of the graffiti that explored 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.290
 until now 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 so it's a kind of interval that 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.810
 allows us to maintain our certainty 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.530
 on what is the worst that max could 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.119
 reach and what is it better than max 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.630
 could reach at any time from the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.920
 research 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.379
 and when we will want to offend 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.640
 identify places from the clouds 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.910
 states parties that are in contradiction 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.830
 with 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.340
 this lotion confidence interval so 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.080
 let's go step by step 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.770
 at the very beginning of the algorithm we are going 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.630
 initialize our interval on 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.480
 possible values ​​of the minimum max value 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.610
 has less finished well the lack of 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.540
 means finished at more infinity they have 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.330
 closed measure we are going to execute 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.600
 the algorithm we will spend this interval 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.370
 there from one place to another so that as 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.110
 and as we go through our soul 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.090
 we are able to detect in a 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.860
 internal that has some contradiction 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.410
 that we do not need to continue 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.930
 to do our exploration so at all 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.250
 start one to turn max who calls his sa 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.520
 first action his first our 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.950
 successors and asks that it is for 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.190
 this we successor there the value mini max 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.810
 so this calls ends so we have a 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.960
 call of phantom a roissy stand and 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.490
 have wanted to spend the gap on 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.410
 max mini values ​​- and ends up more 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.940
 infinity on the site ends makes the 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.830
 same thing so he recursively 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.890
 he will call his first action is 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:25.870
 called tomax what will bring us to this 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:31.570
 no one here because it's a bit of a 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:36.370
 final tomax will return 3 and so mine 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.610
 will observe that his call to max turn which 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.090
 is the call that returns 3 and will put 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.790
 its internal minimal uselessness 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.530
 so will start calculating its value 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.160
 of its minimax value at this point if this 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.459
 so we know since mines minimize 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.620
 utility we know that the value 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.160
 minimal to xv has returned to this everywhere 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.310
 to mines by this void vote is 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.930
 necessarily smaller than or equal to 3 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.489
 means that we can update 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.450
 our interval on values 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.489
 possible of the max mini value between 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.340
 other mines will be able to update the 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.950
 upper bound of this interval so 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.810
 we now know that the value of 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.130
 part of the mini max pageantry is located 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.130
 between less defined and 3 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:38.030
 then two men finish ends going 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.480
 call will explore his second success 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.300
 it is the second action that is associated 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.000
 to whom corresponds to a final that a 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.470
 utility of 12 in observation that puts me 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.170
 not up to date its its value its better 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.050
 min max value we do not update 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:05:00.520
 also that she is the interval on 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.520
 the minimax walls of the part 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.420
 third faction so we arise in 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.740
 this example if there are three actions 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.040
 possible for each player 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.470
 we were 8 so we finished 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.710
 the iterations on actions at the level 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.020
 of a mine and then we return 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:24.320
 utility of troy that would correspond to 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:26.810
 take this action monday if we 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.180
 then go back to this part of 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.410
 running around maxi just having the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.860
 min max value for this successor 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:39.500
 here and then which maximizes so he 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.140
 observe that it does not return 3 so 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.750
 he knows that the value its minimax value 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.600
 at the level of this draw may have more 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.960
 big or equal to 3 so we can put to 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.200
 day our the interval at this level 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.800
 also on the mini max value of the 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.420
 part by updating 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.610
 in this case the lower bound 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.730
 since it's a maximum income 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.850
 attempt in fact to maximize the utility and 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.760
 so we know that at this level too 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.710
 mini maxis value dress of three or more 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.710
 we agree to update our intervals 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.990
 the max node then observes or explores 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.080
 so his second action what we 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:28.200
 brings to this one is passed the 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:31.290
 current value of our kid interval 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.440
 between 3 and more infinity we come to this 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.480
 level 6th round so that's the result 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.940
 of max who calls everything to mines for 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.880
 that we are there and we pass without the values 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:44.460
 of the interval it is to the mines him 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:49.260
 must explore his children to him that's 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:51.600
 our successors so call him 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.370
 now tomac on his first 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.870
 successor who is this here since 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.260
 it's a final it returns the shot 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.150
 was the utility that returns and then c2 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.070
 to snow if what is observed is that the 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.510
 min max value that will be calculated which 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.940
 would be calculated by exploring all the 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.950
 kids are going to be necessarily more 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.480
 small or equal to 2 however a 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.120
 contradiction with the fact that until 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.300
 now we know that the minimum value 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.960
 max of the party at the root is going to 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.730
 find between 3 and infinity so that wants 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.340
 to say that even his exploit is a law 

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.750
 here then we could imagine a part 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.150
 more complex and the more towers that 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.240
 may have many more under 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.580
 here in this case this is an example 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:37.080
 play so we have a part to only 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:39.690
 two rounds but so since we observe a 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.190
 also argued that what will calculate this 

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.140
 which will be returned as by the mini 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.080
 maxi will necessarily be more than 2 

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.210
 but we know that at the level of the parent 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.950
 the lake bar is expected 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.110
 either three or more 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.870
 so when it's exploration 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:56.130
 from the rest of the nude success seems so 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.810
 that's why x and xi assume 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.810
 we do not see these children explored 

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.420
 then we come to the level of the max 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.770
 since we stopped the exploration at the bottom 

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.330
 max will now explore his third 

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.990
 action his third does not arouse 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:19.170
 successor he will spend the interval of 

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:19.170
 their mini max for the root part 

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.860
 mines in turn call max for his 

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.990
 first child his first successor 

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.020
 in this case if it happens to be a 

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:36.370
 final so round max will go back 

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:38.440
 the usefulness of a num initie observes 

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.760
 a utility that returns and 14 and 

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.690
 so he knows that his value has also sounded 

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:47.500
 laval a minima that will necessarily 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:49.540
 smaller or equal to 14 so we can 

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.020
 update the interval on which 

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.450
 values ​​could take the helm to 

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:58.890
 max mine of the part we know now 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:03.750
 that it will be between 3 or 14 

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:07.750
 so that makes fourteen would correspond to 

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:10.030
 if the others do not here and is bigger 

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:12.040
 we would fall 14 bis actually here 

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:14.950
 ben max tells irene action that 

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.840
 would bring a utility of 14 so this 

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.600
 would be in the best case for max 

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:22.960
 in the worst case the other children 

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.540
 here for mines would be worse than three 

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.850
 so three or so so that would be 

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:30.070
 the worst case that would allow us 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:35.860
 to reach that part of the bank of 

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:39.310
 the second child interval which is 

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:42.310
 generated is so it's a final 

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.230
 and the uselessness of 5 

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:46.600
 so now at cenon here too that his 

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.060
 dot to be smaller than or equal to 5 against 

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:54.370
 small this our downstream by changing the 

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:57.010
 upper bound finally last 

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.970
 action the action of 2 

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.490
 in this case too we would have a 

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:01.810
 contradiction with our interval this 

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.220
 that they would stop the exploration but 

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.480
 anyway this is the last action 

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.840
 so art exploration is 

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.790
 necessarily and that means that 

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.150
 at the root level the best 

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:16.000
 lavalas minimax value so the action that 

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:18.850
 allows us to achieve utility that is 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.150
 the largest assuming that mines and 

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:25.120
 rational and optimal would be 3 and 

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:29.440
 would correspond to having taken 17 action 

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:31.360
 also so we notice with this 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.110
 reasoning there and we move on to 

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:37.780
 information on an interval of 

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:40.200
 possible values ​​of the minimum max value 

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.910
 for the part one is able to 

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.580
 delegate the search so eliminate 

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:48.100
 some certain explorations of 

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:51.960
 notable search and therefore to do 

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.960
 a calculation that is more efficient 

00:10:53.040 --> 00:11:00.040
 we see here a pseudo code of 

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:01.360
 the algorithm and before moving on to 

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.090
 through I'm going to do right now 

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.760
 notice that it's like the algorithm 

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:08.980
 put the minimax booth that we saw in 

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:11.770
 a previous capsule but what changes 

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:15.660
 that's what's framed here now 

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:17.560
 we must pass alpha and beta values 

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.320
 alpha corresponds to the lower bound 

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:22.480
 pub and at the top of the notes 

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.260
 interval all the name the alfa range 

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.630
 beta so that must have been there at 

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.500
 each of the routines each of the 

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:36.400
 functions and we have two more 

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:41.020
 additional operations to be done when 

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.420
 max or mines makes a selection of the 

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.850
 best action learns when trying to 

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.150
 find the action that has a bar 

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:52.300
 max the lowest possible 

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:56.710
 so let's go through his actions his 

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.630
 uses or their imax algorithm I'm going 

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.820
 start with mean as it's a 

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.950
 body we talked about a bit more in 

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:07.080
 the example so undermines what makes more 

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:11.800
 in fact it is that after getting 

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:13.600
 the utility of max towers and possibly 

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.120
 if a mother utility to have updated 

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.700
 its utility that consider returning on 

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.960
 will watch what this utility is there 

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.790
 in contradiction with monterrey 

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.320
 the interval and among others is that 

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.329
 it is a utility that is much better 

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.009
 that the minimum value 

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:31.189
 of the real mini max for the whole 

00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:33.049
 part according to our current interval 

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:34.369
 so is alpha it's the lower bound 

00:12:33.049 --> 00:12:36.709
 of my intervals 

00:12:34.369 --> 00:12:38.929
 so if I have a utility value that 

00:12:36.709 --> 00:12:42.230
 is already lower than I can 

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:43.369
 guarantee to be the smallest mini value 

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.449
 max for the whole party 

00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:46.189
 I know I can stop 

00:12:44.449 --> 00:12:48.920
 exploration and I'm going back in 

00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:52.759
 this case also booed the action at but of 

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:55.369
 anyway it's going to be ignored by by 

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:56.749
 the call at the top which is a call of 

00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:58.369
 tournhac what they call tomine 

00:12:56.749 --> 00:13:00.889
 know ignore because it's going to be a 

00:12:58.369 --> 00:13:02.170
 action that is not as good as the 

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:04.910
 previous 

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:06.920
 so it's a default return on 

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.459
 could have actually returned alpha too 

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.749
 it's the same thing and if 

00:13:10.459 --> 00:13:14.480
 we did not have this stop condition 

00:13:11.749 --> 00:13:16.369
 the time we will update the beast so 

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:20.600
 the upper limit will be updated 

00:13:16.369 --> 00:13:22.249
 by the player's turn mines and we do 

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.499
 that simply by taking the minimum 

00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:28.790
 between the current upper bound and 

00:13:24.499 --> 00:13:31.160
 the utility currently considered the mother 

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:35.540
 currently uses found by the 

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.429
 player mine the same way the player 

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.649
 max yes will rather be a 

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:41.089
 comparison with beta cracked to do 

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:42.910
 a kalfat comparison so we will do 

00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:44.749
 a comparison that the upper bound 

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:47.449
 check that we have not found a 

00:13:44.749 --> 00:13:49.610
 utility that is better than the maximum 

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:51.919
 of utility or min max value 

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.720
 find so far if this is the 

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:55.910
 case we will stop the exploration for 

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.239
 you return the utility find up 

00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:02.809
 now in this in the turn the tower 

00:13:59.239 --> 00:14:05.209
 current of max and otherwise we will put to 

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:07.699
 day the lfh to the lower bound in 

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:09.470
 taking the max between alfa and 

00:14:07.699 --> 00:14:12.470
 the utility and the best activity 

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:15.139
 was currently per tour max onu 

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.579
 current in um so that's 

00:14:15.139 --> 00:14:19.489
 the algorithm a small local of 

00:14:16.579 --> 00:14:21.829
 the alfa beta pruning algorithm that 

00:14:19.489 --> 00:14:24.769
 allows that makes a modification of 

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:28.790
 the max mini booth but that allow 

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:31.660
 to explore - we in search of a 

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.660
 notable research 

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:36.770
 some properties of alfa pruning 

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:38.810
 beta the first thing is that it 

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:40.490
 does not affect the final result of 

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.370
 the mini max algorithm ie 

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.230
 it really falls back on true value 

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.910
 it calculates well and truly the mini value 

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.950
 max as previously defined 

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:52.280
 and it gives us the action 

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:54.800
 which associated with this minimum value will be 

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.270
 so the best action to take if we 

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.840
 suppose our opponent and 

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:01.640
 rational and optimal for what 

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:04.490
 computing time in the worst of 

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.380
 alpha beta body will look at another one 

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:11.510
 times beal am opus d allah do not like 

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.970
 internal in the algorithm like the 

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.920
 max mini sentry box I remind that lower 

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.870
 the maximum number of shares for 

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.370
 guys at every step that m sila the 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.840
 depth of notable search so 

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.580
 the maximum number of shots to finish 

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.370
 a part 

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:27.650
 on the other hand, if we explore our 

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.370
 successors in a good scheduling 

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:34.070
 it's a scheduling that allows us 

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:36.500
 to have the most elimination possible 

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:39.440
 of way explore in the best of 

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.720
 case if we knew the cough the moment 

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.640
 what is the island the successor we should 

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.910
 first explore the action considered 

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:49.580
 first in order to get us done 

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.830
 a most optimal release 

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:53.810
 we could reach a complexity that 

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.970
 would be of the order of b to hate on 

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:59.230
 two what does that mean is that 

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:02.450
 at the same time we will be able 

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:05.540
 to explore research purposes in 

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:07.100
 depth twice as deep as 

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.220
 with the algorithm and minimath 

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.930
 ok which is still a gain 

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.940
 meaningful that allow us to see 

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.560
 twice in the future for 

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.110
 make our decision on the best 

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.600
 action learns but that's a case a 

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.710
 not very idealistic 

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.600
 whereas we assume we are 

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:26.660
 able to have the best successor 

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.550
 in terms of punctuality the cost 

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.690
 way of a little more representative in 

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.390
 what if we still have a reduction 

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:35.860
 that is to say, we will be at home 

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.860
 three quarters of a meter
