00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:01.812
Voiceover: What I want
to do with this video

00:00:01.812 --> 00:00:06.278
is explore the idea of allele frequency.

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.578
Allele frequency.

00:00:08.578 --> 00:00:12.444
Just as a reminder, an allele
is a variant of a gene.

00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:15.794
You get a variant of a
gene from your mother,

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:17.267
and you get another variant of the gene

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:18.480
from the father.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.241
So, when we're talking about
the allele, we're talking

00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.960
about that specific
variant that you got from

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.449
your mother or your father.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.993
We've seen this before, but now let's dig

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:27.537
a little bit deeper.

00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:30.858
To help us get our heads
around this, we'll start

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:35.848
with a fairly common model for this.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.312
We're going to think about eye color.

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.453
Obviously, this is a very
large simplification, but

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:42.424
let's just assume that we
have a population where

00:00:42.424 --> 00:00:44.936
there's only two variants
of an eye color gene.

00:00:44.936 --> 00:00:46.800
Let's first assume there
is an eye color gene.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.569
Let's assume there's two variants.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:52.393
One variant, one allele for
eye color, we'll use the

00:00:52.393 --> 00:00:54.072
shorthand, capital B.

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:56.601
Let's say that's the allele for brown.

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:58.909
Brown eye color.

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:01.829
We're going to assume
that this one is dominant.

00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:04.609
It's dominant over the other allele.

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:07.081
Now the other allele, we're
going to assume is for

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.969
blue eye color, and we'll
represent that with a

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:10.205
lower case B.

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:14.144
So that is blue eye color,
and we're going to assume

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:16.305
that this is recessive.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:17.849
Once again, this is review.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:21.840
Someone who has one of
the big B alleles, the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.936
brown alleles, it doesn't
matter what their other

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:25.987
allele is going to be, because
it's either going to be

00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:28.862
another brown or it's
going to be a blue, they're

00:01:28.862 --> 00:01:30.833
going to show brown eyes.

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.216
This is going to be brown
eyes, and this is going

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:36.073
to be brown eyes, because the capital B is

00:01:36.073 --> 00:01:37.180
dominant.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.752
The only way to get blue
eyes is to be a homozygote

00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:45.528
for the recessive allele.

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:48.153
All of that, of course, is review.

00:01:48.153 --> 00:01:49.608
We've seen that before.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:52.200
Now let's think about allele frequency.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.329
To think about that, I'll
set up a very artificially

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.930
small population.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.137
Let's say our population has
exactly two people in it.

00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:04.408
Population has exactly
two people in it, Person 1

00:02:04.408 --> 00:02:08.409
and Person 2, and let's
say we're able to look

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:12.753
into their DNA and figure
out their genotypes.

00:02:12.753 --> 00:02:18.352
Person 1, say, has a capital
B allele, has a brown

00:02:18.352 --> 00:02:22.424
allele and a blue allele,
while Person 2 has two

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:25.540
blue, two blue alleles.

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:28.333
Given that we know the
genotypes in this artificially

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:31.060
small population, we
could start thinking about

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.240
the allele frequencies.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.688
Or the frequencies of
the different alleles.

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:38.281
What do you think is
going to be the frequency

00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:43.196
the frequency of the brown
allele in this population?

00:02:44.117 --> 00:02:45.740
I encourage you to pause
this video and think

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.624
about this on your own.

00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:50.968
I'm assuming you've had a
go at it, so you might be

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:52.655
tempted to say, "Looks
like one out of two people

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.660
"have it, maybe it's 50%."

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.177
But that wouldn't be the
right way to think about

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:57.416
allele frequencies.

00:02:57.416 --> 00:02:59.135
In allele frequencies, you
want to dig a little bit

00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:01.976
deeper and look at the individual alleles.

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:03.345
When you look at that,
you say, "Okay, there's

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:08.337
"four individual alleles in
this population, or there's

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:12.041
"four variants, or there's
literally four chromosomes

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.662
"that are carrying that
gene in this population."

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:20.065
Out of them, one of them
carry, one of them is the

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:26.392
capital B allele, so we could
say that that is going to

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:30.873
be zero point two five, or 25%.

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:38.488
Once again, 25% of the
genes for eye color have the

00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:42.904
capital B allele, have the brown allele.

00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:46.248
Now we can do the same,
ask ourselves the same

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:49.960
question for the lower case B allele.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.536
What fraction of the genes
in this population are

00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:59.872
code for or represent
the lower case B, the

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.104
blue allele?

00:04:01.104 --> 00:04:02.654
Once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:04:02.654 --> 00:04:03.857
and think about it.

00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:05.489
Well, very similar idea.

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.962
There's four genes in
the population that are

00:04:09.962 --> 00:04:11.112
coding for eye color.

00:04:11.112 --> 00:04:18.585
Of them, one, two, three
code for or are the lower

00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:22.129
case blue allele.

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:27.513
So that's zero point seven five or 75%.

00:04:27.513 --> 00:04:33.494
75% of the genes code for
the lower case blue allele,

00:04:33.494 --> 00:04:39.134
while 25 are the brown allele.

00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:41.150
I really want to hit this
point home, how this is

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.126
different than, say,
the phenotype frequency.

00:04:44.126 --> 00:04:49.407
If I asked you, in the
population, if I asked you the

00:04:49.407 --> 00:04:58.758
percent of brown-eyed
people, so now I'm talking

00:04:58.758 --> 00:05:01.238
about phenotype, what would that be?

00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:03.031
Well, there's two people
in the population.

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.609
One of them is exhibiting
brown eyes, so that's

00:05:05.609 --> 00:05:06.950
going to be one-half.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.160
Similarly, if I were to ask
you what is the percentage

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.366
of people who are
blue-eyed that, too, would

00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:14.713
be one-half.

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:16.282
This person is one of
the two people, they're

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:17.539
exhibiting blue eyes.

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.184
But allele frequency,
we're digging deeper, we're

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:21.066
looking at the genotypes.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:26.952
We're saying out of the
four genes here, one of

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:34.896
them is the big B allele,
so that's 25% of the gene

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:38.798
population codes for the brown allele and

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:41.416
75% is the blue allele.

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.000
This is really important to internalize.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.608
Because once we internalize
this, then as we'll see,

00:05:45.608 --> 00:05:48.690
that the ideas in the
Hardy-Weinberg principle

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.390
start to make a lot of sense.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.736
I'll do a little bit of foreshadowing.

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:56.136
We can denote this, this
is just a convention that's

00:05:56.136 --> 00:05:59.904
often used, by the lower
case letter P, and we can

00:05:59.904 --> 00:06:04.760
use lower case Q to denote the frequency.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.096
So lower case P is the
frequency of the dominant

00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:09.530
allele, lower case Q the frequency of the

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.976
recessive allele.

00:06:10.976 --> 00:06:12.496
What's true here?

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:16.744
What's true of P, what's
going to be true of

00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:22.349
P plus Q, what's P plus
Q going to be equal to?

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.187
I encourage you to pause the video again

00:06:24.187 --> 00:06:25.544
and think about that.

00:06:25.544 --> 00:06:27.816
What is this going to be equal to?

00:06:27.816 --> 00:06:30.872
Well, when we started
off, we said that there's

00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:33.424
only two potential, that's
one of the assumptions

00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:35.432
we assumed, we assumed
there's only two alleles

00:06:35.432 --> 00:06:37.864
in this population, in kind of the allele

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.608
population for this gene
population for this trait.

00:06:41.608 --> 00:06:45.388
The frequency of the
dominant ones plus the

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:47.808
frequency of recessive
ones, well everyone's going

00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:50.080
to have one of those two,
so if you add those two

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.442
frequencies, it's going
to have to add to 100%.

00:06:55.442 --> 00:06:56.433
We see that there.

00:06:56.433 --> 00:07:00.090
One-fourth plus three-fourths
is one, or 100%.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.672
And 25% plus 75% is also 100%.

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:06.920
So we could say P plus Q
is equal to 100%, or we

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:13.104
could say that P plus Q is equal to one.

00:07:13.104 --> 00:07:15.150
Is equal to one.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.090
So, in the next video, we're
going to start from the

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.020
seemingly fairly simple
idea, to get to a more richer

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.228
and fairly neat idea
that's expressed in the

00:07:23.228 --> 00:07:26.073
Hardy-Weinberg equation.
