1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,580
The Joe Rogan experience. Well, I
read about you a fellow Boston native,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,660
and I've read about your
Tesla journey and I was like,

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:13,320
this is a fucking interesting story.
This guy buys a broken Tesla, right?

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,410
And then you couldn't get
parts for it anywhere. Nope.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,680
So what had happened to the car had
been in an accident? No. So the, I,

6
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:23,000
I met the previous owner
and he actually has,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,340
I think it was during Hurricane Sandy.
Oh. He thought that, uh, he goes,

8
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:30,000
wait a minute, that water level seems
low enough for me to drive through it.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,990
And he just said to driving through the
water, I think it got up to like the, uh,

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,960
almost like the B pillar.
Oh No. Like where his neck,
his, yeah. And Jesus Christ.

11
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,530
Yeah, I know. Right. So he thought he
could fight the water. He lost obviously,

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,800
and um, it was just under water
and I'm like, you know what,

13
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,100
I've got to try this thing. And so what,
what would Tesla do in that situation?

14
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:49,920
If he wanted to bring it back to them?
They would have to rebuild the entire car.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,850
They wouldn't even do it because at that
point, uh, once, uh, anything liquid,

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,360
you know, any kind of like water
intrusion happens at an EMV phase. Right.

17
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:59,250
The whole car off insurance
companies just like,

18
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,040
we're not going to do with too
risky. Too risky. Not Worth it. We,

19
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:07,041
you aware of the Fisker a dilemma at
the hurricane sandy when they had a,

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,400
the Fiskars that were parked at the,
it was like at a, some sort of a doc.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,500
Right. They ought to ship.
They all exploded. Yeah.
They'll burn the water level.

22
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:20,890
Rose, the water got into them and they
just went off and they fucking firewalls.

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,370
The whole bunch of them. Yeah.
Look, this is a video of it.

24
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,160
You can watch the video of
them fucking blowing up.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,190
So as the water level rose and the hurt,
you'd see the water breaching. Yeah.

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,900
Well the water gets to the cars
and when it gets to the cars,

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,660
they just start going off like fucking
fireball. Oh yeah. I know that feeling.

28
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,140
Oh Wow. Look at that. Boom, boom, boom.

29
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,030
I knew
it was like a supernova.

30
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,220
I mean those are big ass fucking
batteries. Just blowing the fuck. Chokes.

31
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,400
It turns night in the day.
It's amazing how many,

32
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:56,520
they lost like 40 cards with me that
they lost a fuck load and the company

33
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,270
essentially went, they went radio
silent. Yeah. For like a year.

34
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:02,260
That's a big L to take.
Yeah.

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,400
Once people realize their car could just
explode out, that's not good. Sorry,

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,580
what happened? This kid, this video part,
I didn't look at the name of the video.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,810
I popped up when I type it
into the Fisker explosion,

38
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:17,500
but this was the explosion of the con Ed
plant. Oh, that's a big difference. Yeah.

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,890
That was a John [inaudible] cars.

40
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,680
But there is a video of the actual
Fiskars exploding isn't their thing.

41
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,070
There's definitely pictures. Pictures.
The second video won't be as exciting.

42
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:32,540
Now let's leave it off.
Fuck it this more.

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,580
This is information set us back an hour.
So that's the cars.

44
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,700
That's what was left of them.
Wow. And they all fucking blew up.

45
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,720
It's a beautiful car though.
Fisker did a great job of making a car.

46
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:45,060
That looks really good. Right?
But you know what's funny, I,

47
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,840
I think the backends kind of ugly to
you think the front looks like a fish.

48
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,670
The back kind of ugly and then
actually, have you ever driven one? No.

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,580
You've been in one? No. When you
drive one you'll be like, ah,

50
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:58,470
I get why this didn't work out well
Justin Bieber had all chrome one.

51
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,990
I remember that. Yeah. Does he still
have it though? Cause you still have it.

52
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,630
He probably, he probably
doesn't even know. Yeah,

53
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,750
he probably doesn't know at this point.
Yeah.

54
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,840
You know the amount of money
that dude myself, yeah,

55
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:09,040
probably has no idea if he has that car.
No kidding.

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,000
It's got it tucked away somewhere. But
what do they drive? Like they're just,

57
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,220
they're just not really great cars.
It's not really a driver's car.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,790
It's a two plus two. The a the center
console thing. Like you're closer to,

59
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,400
sorry that. Sorry. You can move around
if you want to take away the, uh,

60
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,100
the center console is super wide.

61
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,030
It's a super awkward car to drive and
it's not really good at really anything,

62
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,020
you know, it doesn't styling wise
I'm like, oh there we go. Yeah.

63
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,370
So you think that back end looks ugly?
I don't think I could that much. No, no.

64
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:39,070
I like it. But you know what's funny?
The Chromos and looked that bad.

65
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,650
Some guy got arrested in Germany.

66
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:46,651
They pulled them over and it compounds
it his car cause he had a gold shiny wrap

67
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,770
on it. It was a two reflective
or something. I see now
there's a couple on sunset,

68
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,500
like a Lamborghini or something.
They'll let you do that in America,

69
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,030
but in Germany they're like fuck off.

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,140
I took that Shit Bro. You
know they're like harsh, cold,

71
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,180
stoic folk.
They don't want you doing that.

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,900
And then I want you flexing too
much over there. Not Too much. No,

73
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,190
I bet they were like reluctantly are
making cars like super flashy for like

74
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:16,690
American markets and shit. I think
so too. I, you know, I wonder.

75
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,130
You think so? I don't know.
I don't know. Yeah, me,

76
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,760
I wonder how much of an influence it has.

77
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,460
Like if you could leave
them to themselves, right.

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,380
What kind of crops did
they make? Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,120
Cause I feel like so much of it
as like market driven, but they,

80
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,300
when it comes to like engineering and
handling like God damn German cars have it

81
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:40,480
nailed. They really do. They really do.
But you know what the Americans are,

82
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,700
they were trying to sneak up
and get clothes for a while.

83
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,550
But I mean like the German, just
to this, this, this, the standard,

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,300
the benchmark for every police with
the Americans fuck with it is like,

85
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,480
have you ever driven a
Camaro? Zl One I have. Yeah.

86
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,310
That's a preposterous car. It's an awesome
car. It's amazing. I have a, um, uh,

87
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,940
a corvette [inaudible] Ooh.
Which year ends that, oh, six
Oh six, which is, you know,

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,930
the ls seven seven liter.
And uh, it's an insane Chi.

89
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,400
By today's standards. It only has like
505 horsepower. Funny. But like, it's,

90
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,810
it's not a lot. It's a meme.
It's a mean car. The car,

91
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:16,060
I'll put you on your ass really
quick, man. Talking to a man,

92
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,560
our friend Taylor out there was telling
us that they put a Tesla in ludicrous

93
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:25,561
mode on a dyno and it had
some insane number of Torque,

94
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,240
900 pound pound feet of
Torque and somewhere in the
neighborhood of a thousand

95
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,130
horsepower and the dyno
could barely even read it.

96
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,620
A lot of times they even go that
high and a lot of cases, yeah,

97
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,650
they're insane cars, man. I'm telling
you, the Americans know how to do it now.

98
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,530
I think it's interesting that you know,

99
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,360
people don't realize this
when they see a Tesla,

100
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,390
it's a fully American car and they don't
realize that. They're just like, oh,

101
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,880
it's probably something like,
you know, German or Japanese car,

102
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,570
but the car is 100% made here. Is
this it right here, Jamie? Yes.

103
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,660
Is this the,
which model is this?

104
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,280
[inaudible] so that's the biggest one.
So what does it say on a Mustang Dyno?

105
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,070
So we're going to go from like a 20 mile
an hour roll sound like these little

106
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:12,071
boys will tell you this Tesla up here
trying to figure out how fast she goes.

107
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,210
I think I'm getting to jump. I thought I
said 56 seconds. Yeah, no, I think it, uh,

108
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,580
look at a community and even almost
jumps off the diner at this point.

109
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
There's so much torque.

110
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,740
Yeah. It's a very,
very, very powerful car.

111
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,900
What I've tried to describe it to people,

112
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:36,820
especially people that have never
driven an electric car, I'm like,

113
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:40,270
it doesn't even seem real.
It seems like it violates physics.

114
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:41,880
So how do you like yours,
by the way? So I know,

115
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,980
I know that Ilan mosque came here and
bamboozle you into buying one pretty much.

116
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,080
How do you, how dare you?
I love it. I love it.

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,490
It's great, isn't it? It makes other cars
seemed stupid. Right? And I love cars.

118
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,560
Oh yeah. I know. You're
a car guy. I love them.

119
00:06:56,561 --> 00:06:58,930
I love cars that don't
even drive that fast.

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,020
I love mechanical engineered excellence.

121
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,130
I love that when people figure
things out, right? Yeah.

122
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,530
Which is what brought me to you.

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,500
I love the fact that you took this
car that was fucked up, right?

124
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,400
And you refuse to let it go.
You like,

125
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,500
I'm going to figure out how
to fix this fucking thing.

126
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,950
How much did you buy it for? It was 15
grand. Just to be clear on something.

127
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,710
I'm not like some like
evil genius or brainiac.

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,920
This was driven by my cheapness because
I didn't want to spend the kind of money

129
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:30,590
they were asking for one,
right? So, so basically this
car is like 15 grand. And um,

130
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,950
the whole story started
with my friend came over,

131
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:37,030
he actually had a job at Tesla and he's
like, buddy, listen, do these crazy cars.

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,970
Uh, I knew you have a zero six
but there's cars faster than that.

133
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,100
You're going to love this thing. I
was like, that electric crap box.

134
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:45,460
I don't want anything to do with that.
Whatever. Right? You brought the car over,

135
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,970
great looking car. I said, all right,
and I'll take it for a drive or whatever.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,390
And the thing was amazing,
right? Amazing car.

137
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,860
So I was in tech and I'm just
like, listen, like, you know what,

138
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,270
how much does this thing cost?
Like I make decent money, whatever.

139
00:07:58,271 --> 00:07:59,890
I'll just throw some money
at it. And he's like, listen,

140
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,500
this is the cost about 120. I said,
you know what? Have a nice day.

141
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm not buying that shit. Um, and then he,

142
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,850
so he left and I thought to myself like
every night I was like, you know what?

143
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:13,060
I got to get my hands on one of these
cars, man. I gotta get one like, you know,

144
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:17,860
sell a kidney, whatever. I sell a
testicle or whatever I can do. And it's,

145
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,780
I was searching online and you know,

146
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:24,010
at what happens is whenever a car
gets messed up, whenever a car gets a,

147
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:27,150
as I say total in a way, and it's
a total loss and insurance company,

148
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:29,860
you'll take it and they'll kind of
auction it off to like the highest bidder.

149
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,230
So I went to an auction site and I saw
one for sale was like, you know, 15 grand.

150
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:39,010
They said it didn't run her drive and
it wasn't a flood and I'm just like 15

151
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:41,950
grand. I could do that. That's a piece
of cake, man. I threw some money at it.

152
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:45,730
Whatever. How hard can it be? You stick
it in a bag of rice and I tie it up.

153
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,110
He's like an iPhone, you know, you've
got a rifle in the toilet right here.

154
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,320
What I mean it's,
it's like all had socks.

155
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,530
You want a bag of rice and you get to go.

156
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,730
So I figured out how to do it is by
more rice for this thing. And uh,

157
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:59,000
I got home and um, I was like,
you know what, this is a,

158
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,560
I got myself into some shit here cause uh,
this,

159
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:06,160
it was a lot more work than I thought
I was going to be sight unseen. Nope.

160
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,280
Sight unseen. That's, that's
the way it is the most times.

161
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,260
They don't really let you on
the auction lots too often.

162
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,240
So they took five photos of it.
It was sent from the interior,

163
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,880
some from the side and I'm one
under the front and I was just like,

164
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,910
I could probably do this. Right, no
big deal. So this begins his project,

165
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,190
which takes how long to completion?

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,110
I think it took me about maybe six or
seven months or so of straight work. No.

167
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:31,520
So I have, um, so I was
working at the time and uh,

168
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,620
I think only between the hours of like
7:00 PM and like 11:00 PM like every

169
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:41,550
night and then weekends for a few
hours until I figured it out. Yeah.

170
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,520
So goodbye social life
pretty much. Yeah. I was,

171
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:48,660
I was a hermit for there for those months.
And what actually ended up doing was,

172
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,930
so I had the car right. So I was freaking
out because my wife was just like,

173
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:55,680
how much was that thing? And like,
you know what I mean? Of course. Yeah.

174
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:58,680
She had a divorce papers
ready pretty much. And uh, oh,

175
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,930
I know this was a different one. Yeah.
Fuck yeah, that was really messed up.

176
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:08,760
Now I couldn't say if I want to get that
one for that one was about guests for

177
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,470
grand 20 grand. I paid for that. Yes. Yes.

178
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,590
Total. Yeah, I know. But these,
they're so valuable man. Really?

179
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,900
Because you know why it's the,
the,

180
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,530
the battery technology on the motor
technology that tussle is using.

181
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,800
Everyone's just dying for that
stuff, man. That's so any, any,

182
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:30,270
any rec test so that you find minimum,
I know I'm spilling the secret sauce here.

183
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,410
Minimum Worth 15 grand. Even if it looks
like that. Dead serious. That's insane.

184
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:37,960
What that thing doesn't even have doors
yet. Still we took, I took the doors off,

185
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:41,070
took the doors off, put the battery
pack is still in there. Right.

186
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:43,350
And the multitudes and the
motor was still in there too.

187
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,820
Do people take those and put them in like
old cars or anything yet? Absolutely.

188
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,110
It's a he that's the new
generation of hot rodders man.

189
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,730
Cause you saw something like that
about a Mustang. It was like a 65,

190
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:57,810
66 Mustang that was electric, but I
didn't know what train it used. So,

191
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,870
so you know how um,
you're a gearhead,

192
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,450
you know this is the ls swap.

193
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,950
They put literally an ls into everything.
Yeah. I a landscape land cruiser,

194
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,940
Toyota Land Cruiser with one
ls, swap went. Oh Shit. Um,

195
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,770
so that's the new ls swap basically.
So the Tesla Motor is the new ls swap.

196
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,310
Everyone is swapping the Tesla motor
until you know Volkswagen bugs into Audis,

197
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,160
into, into Porsche's, into everything.

198
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,810
Well I know that people were doing ls
swaps into nine 11 and Porsche people are

199
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:32,090
losing their fucking minds. I now
take an old air cooled cars. Yep.

200
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,850
Which are really notoriously difficult
to get to a high horsepower. Exactly.

201
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
Cause those air cooled cars,

202
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,470
like you can only get them like
around 400 plus horsepower.

203
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:42,160
These stay stocked crumbling
unless your singer, right?

204
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,180
Well they've got that insanely engineered
a new one. What is that called?

205
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,840
Lionel lakes call. Either way it's
going to cost you like you know,

206
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,380
damn near $100,000 sitting at 80 power,
something dynamic, lightweight, something.

207
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:57,660
It's the most gorgeous looking of those
portions have ever seen ever. Sanders.

208
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,050
And they built that one up to 500
plus horsepower. Right? That's Hammad.

209
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,050
How much does it cost though? That's the
thing. Fucking million. 6,000,006. Yeah.

210
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:09,970
You can buy one. That's a giant
house, man. That's a house with land.

211
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,940
You might have a, well actually that's not
true. And in La that's not a house. No.

212
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,880
But la is not the real world. What
is that? 67 Mustang meets Tesla.

213
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,460
Avr Motors, all electric muscle
car. Holy Fuck. That's a 68.

214
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,780
That's a good looking too.

215
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,080
That's one of the best looking rear ends
of any car ever. An awesome looking God.

216
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,370
Fuck. That looks
incredible. 2.2 to 60. Yeah,

217
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,940
there you go. What the fuck? So that's
a new, that's a new one. So there's,

218
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,040
it was going to cost
you a ton of work that

219
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,770
it's going to cost you a ton of
money to recreate that same look.

220
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,820
God with the look has this nice screen
to what did, that's so weird though,

221
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:53,410
to not shift a muscle car. I'm thinking
I'm out. I'm out. I'm backing out.

222
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,950
But you love your Tufts,
although you don't shift that,

223
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,320
but it doesn't look like that. That
would be a super ultra poser. Right?

224
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,050
The door handles come out
like a test all the way.

225
00:13:01,051 --> 00:13:04,780
It doesn't the Tesla
doorhandles Oh fuck off next.

226
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,820
No, no, no. There's a company that
does, um, it's a company called Rev.

227
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:14,821
Ology that makes old like
1966 to like 68 mustangs.

228
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,920
But they do it with all new parts and
modern technical resto mod pretty much not

229
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:28,150
though because it's a new car there.
They buy the full, um, that's uh,

230
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,340
that's actually a brand new car
that's never existed. Oh really? Yeah.

231
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,900
It's a ground up build, ground up built.
They buy the whole, you know, cause it's,

232
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,800
I think it's called a unibody
construction. Is that what
it is? There's something,

233
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,560
the way that these
mustangs are constructed,

234
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:46,561
the body's built into the frame and
they bought this company sells them like

235
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:50,810
completed versions of the body kit that
are perfect with perfect tolerances.

236
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,060
Right. So like that. Like it's cool. Like
that's one, there's 67 Shelby gt 500.

237
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:58,360
What's the pricing? Oh Wow. Stupid
expensive. Yeah. It's not gonna work.

238
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,350
It's like two Teslas. Yeah, pretty
much. Yeah. But they're dope.

239
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,740
It's dope as fuck. If you look at
like what it looks like, go down,

240
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,010
see some pictures of it, Jamie, you'd
get a better, better sense of it.

241
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,830
But this guy is, that's meticulous.
Yeah. This company is very meticulous.

242
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,560
I'm, I've been following their stuff for
quite awhile and what they do is really

243
00:14:17,561 --> 00:14:21,520
incredible. Right? That's an all met all
new sheet metal. I can, everything's new,

244
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:26,521
but it has some killer brakes and it
has a modern Coyote Mustang engineer,

245
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,790
right?
Fibo Yup.

246
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,850
So it's a 460 horsepower engine
in these old badass muscle cars.

247
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,180
And that one's the gt 500 that
was actually super charged.

248
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:40,090
That is a 600 horsepower engine that
it's dope. They're fucking gorgeous.

249
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,270
They're gorgeous cars.
There's really pretty so,

250
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,970
so what would you think about someone
dropping an electric motor on one of these

251
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,690
things? See, I love it. Look, I
love, I love people doing crazy shit,

252
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,250
but it's not for me.
I need to shift if I'm driving that thing,

253
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:56,900
I got to pretend I'm Steve
McQueen. I hear you man. Oh Oh.

254
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,230
Basic thing. So what do you think about
the new, you seen the new Tesla roadster,

255
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:02,620
right? Gorgeous. What do you
think about it? I love it. Yeah,

256
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,480
but it's theirs from the bottom up.
You know what I'm saying? It's like,

257
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:06,830
I don't mind not shifting in it.

258
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,520
That thing seems like it's going to
literally punch a hole through space time.

259
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,080
Yeah,
I think so too.

260
00:15:12,081 --> 00:15:15,020
I think they're looking at it like
zero to 60 in like one point something

261
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,110
seconds. I think it's one nine. That's
what they're saying. It's insane.

262
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,850
That's bizarre. I know. It's crazy when
you feel it in the p 100 deep mine.

263
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,330
Like everybody that I get in the car
and I stomp on the gas, they're like,

264
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:29,990
they can't believe it. They can't
believe that these are around you.

265
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:32,660
It's like it's like vampires
being around people.

266
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,620
But people that just leap to the top
abilities that walking around can regular

267
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:40,190
until some shit goes down.
Yeah. No, they're, they're
absolutely amazing cars, man.

268
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,420
And I think that's the main reason why I
was like, I gotta get one of these man.

269
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,020
So what was the struggle? Initial
struggle. You have the car,

270
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,660
you take it apart and what did you see?
It's pretty much,

271
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:53,690
I was kind of taking my time because I
knew there was a point where I couldn't

272
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:56,300
fix the damn thing. And I've just kind
of wasting everyone's time. Wife's like,

273
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,610
Hey, is this thing almost done? I was
like, yeah, babe, don't worry about it.

274
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,750
We're good. Don't worry.
Your money's safe. And, um,

275
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,380
so there's a certain point where I took
everything apart and I was like, alright,

276
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,920
cool. I found a dead fish in the
back of the car. So actually,

277
00:16:09,921 --> 00:16:10,780
you know what the turning point,

278
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,310
this whole thing was that the
turning point yeah. Was, um, I,

279
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,640
I realized it was salt water and
not fresh water. So, you know what?

280
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:22,360
Saltwater does this stuff, right? So it
just, it just kills everything. So, uh,

281
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,950
90% of the car was kind of toast.
And, uh, I said to myself, all right,

282
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm going to call Tesla, you know, buy
a motor by a battery pack, I'll be good.

283
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,411
You know what I mean?

284
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:35,310
Maybe I'll spend like 20 grand for a
battery and like maybe 10 for a motor,

285
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:38,930
I'll be filling for 40. It's still
cheaper than a hundred. Right, right. So,

286
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,700
so I called them up and uh, you
know, they were like, hey, you know,

287
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:44,280
how's it going man? I was like, Hey, you
know what a crazy thing happened, right?

288
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,900
So I bought this tussles under water
and um, I need like a couple of things.

289
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:52,020
I need a battery, I need like a motor,
you know, just, just told me those things,

290
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:54,450
it's fine. They're like, well,
we're not going to sell it.
To was like, well why not?

291
00:16:54,451 --> 00:16:57,630
Because you have no capability of
fixing the car yourself. You know,

292
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:00,180
you're going to get yourself killed.
It's not going to work. You know,

293
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,880
give me your vin number. And I gave
him the Vin number. They're like, no,

294
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:05,100
that car is listed as salvage.
That thing was underwater.

295
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,950
We're not going to help you. And they
just hung up the phone pretty. Ooh. Yeah.

296
00:17:07,951 --> 00:17:11,490
So like this is the crazy part
two is that they know, you know,

297
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:15,480
I'm putting my conspiracy theorist hat on.
They know where every single car is.

298
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,270
They know what it's doing.
They know if the airbags went off,

299
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:21,510
they know if you farted the front seat,
they know everything about these cars.

300
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,270
So pretty much when you give
them the vin number, you know,

301
00:17:24,271 --> 00:17:27,300
the cars are always kept it back to the
mothership to give you the status in the

302
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:30,960
car so they know what's going on. So
you know, if you try to hide from you,

303
00:17:30,961 --> 00:17:35,760
just you just can't do it.
Um, so, so I had the, I had
the car and I said to myself,

304
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,680
you know what? This isn't going to
work. I've got to figure something out.

305
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,251
So what I did,

306
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:43,251
basically I bought another car
for 15 grand and I was like,

307
00:17:43,651 --> 00:17:45,560
I got to swap this stuff over.
So I saw,

308
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,610
so the other one that you bought for
15 grand, everything worked well.

309
00:17:48,611 --> 00:17:49,890
He was on a end collision.
Okay.

310
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,070
It wasn't a hard front end collision
and the frame's bent or something.

311
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,010
Rain was banned to thing was toast and
I just took all the electronics from one

312
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:59,930
to the other. How do you check to make
sure that everything is damaged again?

313
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,140
Well,
that's a good thing.

314
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,190
A lot of the wiring harnesses were cut
right in the front end collision car.

315
00:18:05,191 --> 00:18:08,880
But the interesting part was that in
the flooded car, the wiring harnesses,

316
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,080
we're still good for the most part in
the front really. So what I did was,

317
00:18:13,081 --> 00:18:15,840
I mean meaning not broken or
torn or have Ben connectors,

318
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,440
I just took those connectors off and
actually clean them because they couldn't

319
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:21,030
get parts, you know, from Tesla.

320
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,490
And I took like the wet wiring
harnesses that we're all corroded,

321
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,270
pulled them out, got like, you know,

322
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,350
a Qtip toothbrush and all that
stuff he cleaned them with.

323
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,930
So I cleaned them with um,
with baking,

324
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:35,931
speaking soda and I'm like a wire
brush and like I got a toothpick to,

325
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,700
to really get in there and like
cleaning the contacts and stuff.

326
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,630
I just rinsed them out with water. By this
time your wife was probably like, what?

327
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,740
She's pissed. She goes, I noticed we're
missing $30,000 from our bank account

328
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,140
and two cars that don't work exactly
to printers don't work, you know,

329
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,840
and if there is a $30,000 missing
from our bank account, like,

330
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:59,550
what's going on here? So, um, it was
just, it was painstaking, but eventually,

331
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:04,260
you know, I got the job done then, so, so
I ended up doing was so 30 grand, right.

332
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,060
I told my friends, hey listen, you know,

333
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,370
I'm in a mess here and we're building
a test on it. Just like, you know,

334
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:10,680
you're an idiot, you're not going to
figure this out. Like no one's doing that.

335
00:19:10,681 --> 00:19:12,420
Cause this was,
this was years ago,

336
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,780
this is when the cars were still kind of
coming onto the scene and they weren't

337
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,260
as popular as they are now. And like you
can't fix that. Like you're an idiot,

338
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,820
you can't do that. I've
seen your work. And uh,

339
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,210
so yeah, so after a while, you know,

340
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,090
I took all the parts from
one to the other, um,

341
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,040
got one running and then the
parts I didn't need anymore,

342
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,550
like the, like the old battery
pack and some of the action.

343
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,850
So there were some parts of the
battery that we're still good.

344
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,320
So I actually sold those parts like
online and on Ebay and stuff like that.

345
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,170
And then I sold like the motor,
he had water in it. Someone got,

346
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
give me five grand for a
motor that had water in it.

347
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,410
That's how valuable these parts are.
So mad.

348
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,580
Was he planning on doing the same
thing with cleaning it out? I,

349
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,180
I have no idea to this day. I don't know.
So I think he has in the same situation.

350
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:02,270
I think he brought it home to his
wife. He's like, hey look what I got.

351
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,900
I'd probably still at his house and uh,
so after all of that,

352
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:10,650
so all of the parts I ended up getting
the car I have now for about six grand.

353
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,080
So you take the engine and is that
one of the four wheel drive ones?

354
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,700
The ones you have.
This was just the rear wheel drive one.

355
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,380
And so it has just the rear engine.
The single motor. Yep. One engine.

356
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,740
And so you take those out,
you put it all back in,

357
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,130
you'll replace the wires and then it's
good to go. What about the computer?

358
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:31,560
What about, Gosh, so pretty much the,

359
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,940
the computer thing was interesting because
there was, so I called Tesla again,

360
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,070
right? I was like, hey buddy, like
this car is like 99% of the way there.

361
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,410
Do you know,
do they know who you are at this point?

362
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,420
They still don't know who I am.
Nor did they care.

363
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,830
They still probably don't care who
I am but, but did you say, hey man,

364
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:52,450
you remember you hung up on me? Like
yeah, right. The car still doesn't work.

365
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,160
Well still didn't work. Right.
So the tough part was I had to,

366
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,480
so remember I had no, I
had no key for the car. Oh.

367
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,180
So I was like, Hey, I need
a key. You know what I mean?

368
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,770
Like help me out here and get a
key. And they were like, well,

369
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,550
are you the same idiot that called my,
yeah, I need the key. They were like,

370
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:13,600
we can't, as I stated before, we
can't help you because you know this,

371
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:18,490
this is a salvage car, so you're on your
own. So what I did was I actually in the,

372
00:21:18,491 --> 00:21:22,470
in the GPS screen, because
the screen turned on the, the,

373
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:26,830
the guy still had the home location.
So I pushed home on the GPS screen.

374
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,540
Found the guy's address, right?
This is creepy. I gets creepy,

375
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,340
right? Found the guy's address.
And I was like, Hey, you know,

376
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,100
can we, uh, I called
them up. I was like, hey,

377
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:44,010
did you own like a white Tesla by
chance? And he's like, who is like,

378
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:48,880
yeah, I own one. I was like, yeah,
um, so I bought it and I need the key.

379
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:52,900
Do you have the key to the
car? And he's like, no, I
don't, I don't have that. Like,

380
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,570
what do you call me for like,
I don't understand is like,
well, I'm rebuilding it,

381
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:59,590
I'm putting the electronics from
your condo or another, and, um,

382
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:02,230
I want to figure it out. And he's
like, you know what, I can't help you.

383
00:22:02,231 --> 00:22:04,780
I don't have the key. And I was like,
damn socks, you know, cause you know,

384
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,500
I have a family and stuff and you know,
kind of give him the sob story, like,

385
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,830
you know, he could really look for and
helped me out would be good. And, uh,

386
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,980
we started talking about general topics
and he's like, you know, you know,

387
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:18,000
I know you're a car guy.
That's awesome. Um, I had, uh,

388
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:22,420
I had a zero six once and I was like,
Hey, I have a zero six two. And he's like,

389
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:25,300
yeah, it was, it was Le Mans blue. And
I was like, Hey, mines the mines blue.

390
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,540
And he's like, what year is it? I
was like, it's an o six. He goes,

391
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,250
I sold that same car or car like it
like two years ago to a guy in Florida.

392
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,430
I was like, I bought the car from a
guy in Florida. So we started bonding.

393
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:40,810
So it turns out I actually owned his
old six. Yeah, it's crazy. Right?

394
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:42,820
What are the odds of two
human beings on the planet?

395
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,300
You own both of this guy's car pulls of
this guy's car. It wasn't. It was insane.

396
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,420
So he's like, listen. He goes, hey,
awesome. You know, I'll see if I could,

397
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,060
I'll see if I could find, you know,
the key friends with that dude. No, no,

398
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:54,060
we never talked again after that. I
was like, you should be free. Well,

399
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:57,090
here's the reason why.
So he, Hey, well one,

400
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,280
it was super creepy for me to
call the guy in. Number two. Um,

401
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,330
when I went, you know, I went
kind of silent for a week,

402
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:08,200
he called me back and said, buddy, I found
the key. Oh, I found the key to the car.

403
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,360
I was like, awesome dude.
Like, you're fantastic.

404
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,050
I'm going to send you an envelope to
your address so you could kind of give me

405
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:17,950
the key. And he's like, yeah, yeah, great,
great, great. How about like 600 bucks?

406
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,340
And I was like, Bro, Haim,

407
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,270
we just bonded over the fact
that I owned both of your cars.

408
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,930
What are you doing to me here? 600.
Yeah, 16. I remember like, you know,

409
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,140
to a lot of people that's nothing but
like to me like I was trying to be cheap

410
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:33,490
and scrappy sometimes a bit much.
600 bucks. Yeah, that's a bit much.

411
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:37,500
A lot of money. And I was like,
Hey, I was like, you didn't,

412
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,040
the key didn't exist to you as of a week
ago, but now you can make money from it.

413
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,750
Like now you want to talk
to 100 bucks? And he's just
like, you know, you know, Dah,

414
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:48,920
Dah, Dah. I be talking again and he goes,
how about 400 bucks? And I was like,

415
00:23:48,921 --> 00:23:50,840
you know, a guy, I'll just
just give you the money.

416
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,880
Just take the damn money and blood money.
Yeah. Right, exactly right. So I sold,

417
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,230
I sold my soul pretty much. And he did.
Yeah. He's got that blood money. No,

418
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:03,350
but I shouldn't have, I feel like
I was, I shouldn't have taken it.

419
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,730
I would've rubbed that money
on my balls. [inaudible] Bro.

420
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,830
Make sure you sniff that hundred dollar
bill first. I mean, it's, look, I get it.

421
00:24:11,831 --> 00:24:16,060
He's just being a dirt bag. Right. But
no, but after that you got the key and um,

422
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,720
it's, it's, that's what it is. And then
the car's running and driving today.

423
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,450
So as soon as you got the
key, you're good. Do you have
one key or two? Just one.

424
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,550
Oh, if I lose that, I'm screwed. Can you
make, does the phone work like your APP?

425
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,500
Does it work on the car? Nope. Damn. No,
that's big. That after this huge, yeah,

426
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,140
I, let's go then you get the car to
come to you. You can summon it. Yeah.

427
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,010
You can park like, like literally than
branch on each side. Right? That's the

428
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,050
[inaudible].
