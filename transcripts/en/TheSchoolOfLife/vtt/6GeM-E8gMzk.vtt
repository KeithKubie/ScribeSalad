00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.440
One of the most calming things that societies
have ever devised is the lullaby. In almost

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.360
every culture there has ever been, mothers
have rocked and sung their babies to sleep.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.660
A humbling point that a lullaby reveals is
that it’s not necessarily the words of a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.720
song that make us feel more tranquil. The
baby doesn’t understand what’s being said

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.280
but the sound has its effect all the same.
The baby is showing us that we are all tonal

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.660
creatures long before we are creatures of
understanding.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:20.320
As adults, we grasp the significance of words of course, but there remains a sensory
level which cuts through and affects us far more

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.900
than an argument or idea ever could. The
musician can, at points, trump anything the

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.080
philosopher might tell us.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.280
Ancient Greek mythology
was fascinated by the story of the famous

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.840
musician Orpheus. At one point he had to rescue
his wife from the underworld. To get there

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.660
he needed to make his way past Cerberus the
ferocious three-headed dog who guarded the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.760
entrance to the land of the dead. Orpheus
was said to have played such sweet, enchanting

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.180
music that the wild beast calmed down and
became – for a while – mild and docile.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.940
The Greeks were giving themselves a reminder
of the psychological power of music. Orpheus

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.520
didn’t reason with Cerberus, he didn’t
try to explain how important it was that he

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.180
should be allowed to pass, he didn’t speak
about how much he loved his wife and how much

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.940
he wanted her back. Cerberus was – as we
ourselves are at times of distress – pretty

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.920
much immune to reason. But he was still open
to influence. It was just a matter of finding the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.930
right channel to reach him. When we feel anxious
or upset, kindly people sometimes try to comfort

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.340
us by pointing to facts and ideas: they try
to influence our thinking and – via careful

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.700
arguments – to quieten our distress. But,
as with Cerberus, the most effective way to

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.060
deal with the problem may simply be to play
us some music.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.960
We might need to be quietened and made mild (by a lullaby, a Chopin prelude
or something by Natalie Merchant), before

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.760
we are in any position to listen to reason.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.200
Music is the greatest mood adjustor we have ever invented. Its benefits can be broken
down as follows:

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:36.380
Music can reunite us with feelings we need but have lost touch with. It reconciles
us to a sadness within, which we have had to be too

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.260
be brave and stoic not to feel.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.540
It is the axe that
breaks the frozen sea within us.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:56.620
Music can lend dignity to our sorrows, framing and containing
what might otherwise be unmanageable grief.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.740
Music is there for us like a comforting parent
in moments of despair. Music returns us to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.980
life, gently nudging us to return to the side
of generosity and hope. We can follow in music's

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.819
grooves of confidence, when our own will is
sagging.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:28.540
Music is there to take us beyond the everyday, to transcend the ordinary and survey
ourselves from a lofty height.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.920
Music reconnects us with our instinctual, bodily selves when
reason, logic and discipline are in danger

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.440
of crushing us. Music breaks down the barriers
between strangers – urging us to see what

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.550
we have in common, rather than what divides
us. We fully discover our debt to music when

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.470
we can acknowledge just how powerless we sometimes
are to change our moods through reason alone.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.180
A good life doesn't only need a library of
ideas: it requires a vast and ever-changing

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.630
playlist that can systematically tug us back
to our more hopeful, sensitive and resilient selves.
