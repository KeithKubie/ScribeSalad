00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.160
Actors get paid to pretend they’re someone
else, and when they’re totally overtaken

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.640
by their own performances, unexpected things
can— and will— happen.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.860
Some of the best cinematic moments have come
from on-set surprises.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.580

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:37.479
Here are ten popular actors who lost control
and took it too far.

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.179
Seth Rogen, The Interview
Once a movie is released, the creators have

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.239
very little control over what happens next.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.280
Sometimes it makes it all the way through
production and gets shut down just before

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.819
crossing the finish line.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.299
Directors Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg know
this all too well, and if you’ve ever heard

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.090
of 2014’s The Interview, then you do too.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.449
The story centers on a producer and TV host
who travel to North Korea, and are given the

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.399
assignment to kill Kim Jong-Un.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.820
As you can probably imagine, the real Kim
Jong-Un wasn’t a fan of the storyline.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.840
And threatened retaliation if the movie were
to be released- saying all publicity for the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.590
movie would be considered an act of terrorism.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.010
Leonardo DiCaprio, Django Unchained
Over the course of his career, Leonardo DiCaprio

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.500
has cemented his reputation as a serious actor.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.789
He’s a profitable Hollywood star and he’s
been in some of the best films of the past

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:26.789
decade.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:30.670
While his roles have been varied, his turn
as Calvin Candie in Django Unchained was the

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.460
first time the renowned actor got to be the
bad guy.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.850
And he was really, REALLY good at it.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.229
DiCaprio got so deep into the character that
when he sliced his hand open on a broken glass

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.189
during one rant, he didn’t even notice.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.130
Nothing looks better than the real thing,
so obviously Tarantino chose that take for

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.220
the final cut.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.600
Isla Fisher, Now You See Me
Everyone loves a good underwater trick.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.399
But because of their environment, safety crews
sometimes have a difficult time figuring out

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.579
where the acting ends and real distress begins.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.979
During the filming of her scene in the opening
montage of Now You See Me, actress Isla Fisher

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.899
almost drowned after getting tangled up in
her submerged chains.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.519
Since that’s also what’s happening to
her character at the time, people on set have

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.849
admitted to not knowing if Fisher needed assistance
for real, or if she was just a really great

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:17.849
actress.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.680
Thankfully, the actress was able to untangle
her own chains before the situation turned

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.209
fatal.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.540
George Clooney, Syriana
George Clooney is one of the most popular

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.170
actors in Hollywood history.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.920
So, of everyone on this list, you might think
that production would work the hardest to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.099
keep him safe.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.560
But nevertheless, as we’ve seen before,
accidents have a way of happening regardless.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.569
While filming a torture scene for Syriana,
the actor flipped his chair just a little

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.209
too hard, and the result was an injury so
horrific the actor has openly discussed how

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.660
the pain of it made him contemplate suicide.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.709
The actor went some time without knowing what
was wrong, but after getting checked out it

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.860
was learned that he was leaking spinal fluid.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.510
We’re not medical professionals, but even
we know that’s not good.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.579
Like, really, really, not good.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.689
Jason Statham, Expendables 3
Everything about Jason Statham screams “cool”.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.799
His accent, attitude, and ability to kick
anyone’s ass are all intimidating traits,

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.799
to say the least.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.470
Oh, and he does all his own stunt work.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.800
Not many actors can say that.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.269
Statham comes from a background of lower-budget
fare, and got used to the risky maneuvers.

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.720
But when filming Expendables 3, the actor
almost met his maker.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.799
The stunt was rigged so that a truck he was
driving would stop, allowing him to get out

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.099
and start shooting.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.880
Except that the truck didn’t stop.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.470
And when it went over the edge into the black
sea, it took the actor with it.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.909
This is where normal people might start pooping
their pants, but not Statham.

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.910
The former champion diver got out and swam
to safety like it was no big deal.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.550
Channing Tatum, Foxcatcher
Channing Tatum has been in movies all over

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.550
the map.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.280
The actor can handle comedy, drama, and action
to be sure.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.719
For his role in Foxcatcher, the actor got
deep into character.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.239
So deep that he actually put his face through
a mirror.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.810
That’s right folks, Channing Tatum was so
devoted to the role that he put.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.810
his.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.810
face.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.810
through.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.810
a.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.810
mirror.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.910
And even though it was covered with a sheet
of plastic, the mirror was a very real one,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.530
and resulted in very real lacerations that
bled very real blood.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.590
The actor was so immersed in his performance
that he hardly noticed, but nobody on set

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.580
could look away.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.050
Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool
With the exception of one movie where he dons

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.030
a fat suit, Ryan Reynolds has never looked
out of shape.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.400
But that doesn’t mean he didn’t FEEL out
of shape.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.310
No stranger to the world of comic book movies,
the actor was over the moon to be playing

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.000
Deadpool in a right, proper Deadpool story.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.220
Reynolds was so stoked, in fact, that on the
first day of his Deadpool workout, the actor

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.230
went so hard that he put his back out first
thing.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.250
The actor described literally crawling on
all fours home from the gym because of the

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.250
immense pain.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.000
It’s not the first time he’s been injured
in the line of duty either, he also separated

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.190
his shoulder during filming on The Green Lantern.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.750
Jeremy Renner, The Avengers
A large part of what makes superheroes “super”

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.910
is their ability to run into the middle of
a brawl and emerge relatively unscathed.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.290
Sure, caped crusaders end up with some bumps
and bruises along the way, but they definitely

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.390
don’t see it as a reason to slow down.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.690
Except that those near-invincible characters
are played by humans, and are therefore susceptible

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.320
to things like fatigue, injury, and full-on
incapacitation.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.530
This is exactly what happened to mortal man
Jeremy Renner while filming The Avengers.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.080
According to Joss Whedon, the actor hurt his
back and shoulder badly enough that the movie’s

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.330
production shut down for days afterward.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.870
Chris Evans, Captain America: Civil War
Captain America is an all-around useful guy

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.920
to have on your team.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.720
He’s in perfect physical condition, wields
a vibranium shield, is hella smart, and he’s

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.770
nice to boot.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.460
Chris Evans plays him so well that it’s
hard to imagine a time where he wasn’t playing

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460
The Captain.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.900
It’s a role that has required the actor
to stay in shape for years at a time thanks

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.250
to the character’s prominence in the MCU.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.240
That super-strength has its limits, though.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.560
And as much as we’d like to believe that
Evans really CAN stop a helicopter mid-takeoff,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.710
it’s just not the reality.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.050
While performing the stunt where Cap’ holds
onto a rope to do just that, the prop helicopter

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.270
slipped in a direction it wasn’t supposed
to.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:13.740
And as a result, the actor’s arm is messed
up— apparently it STILL hurts.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.030
Margot Robbie, The Wolf of Wall Street
Margot Robbie’s career is so hot right now

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.080
that she could probably smack the pope and
get away with it.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.090
But back when the actress was filming The
Wolf of Wall Street, she was a relative unknown.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.320
Sharing a screen opposite Leonardo DiCaprio
is a noob’s worst nightmare.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.430
That’s the guy from Titanic!

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.290
He’s a megastar!

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.720
We’ve heard how Robbie downed tequila in
preparation for a nude scene, but nothing

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.550
could have prepared her for another tense
moment on set.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.020
In the heat of her performance, the actress
slapped DiCaprio in the face and yelled “fuck

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.020
you”.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.990
After realizing that face was attached to
a multi-billion dollar celebrity, she worried

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.310
the actor might sue.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.930
But quite the opposite happened— he was
so impressed that he insisted she do it again.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.820
Margot Robbie just can’t lose.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.300
