[SWOOSHING]

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.070
We're all human.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.480
And yet we all look different.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.520
Now, a lot about the way
we look is down to our DNA,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.600
as we can see so brilliantly
with these identical twins.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.560
From eye colour to hair
colour to dimples to height,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.980
each pair of twins
looks very similar.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.439
But look a little more
closely, and you'll

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.120
see that each person
here is unique.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.930
In this lecture, we'll explore
how much of the differences

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.440
between us are down
to genes and how much

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.050
is due to everything else.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.209
We'll be looking at
what makes you unique.

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.880
I am Professor Alice Roberts.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.750
Welcome to the third of this
year's Royal Institution

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.340
Christmas Lectures.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.790
And this lecture is all
about us as a species.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.450
It's all about human diversity.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.980
But first, let's start off
with a different species

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.945
which is very diverse indeed.

00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:48.770
You stand here.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.090
So we've got an amazing
range of different dogs here.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.280
And the astonishing thing about
this is that they are all dogs.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.830
They all belong to
the same species.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.570
And yet they look so incredibly
different from each other.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.620
We've got to we've got a Great
Dane, got a little Shih Tzu,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.280
and a tiny little
miniature dachshund.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.740
Now, isn't it amazing that
there's all that variation

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.210
in one species?

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.550
Humans first started
domesticating dogs

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.610
about 30,000 years
ago, when our ancestors

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.770
were hunter-gatherers.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.800
And then over
thousands of years,

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.730
we've somehow moulded
all of these changes.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.700
So we've bred dogs
that are really

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.040
good at going down burrows
and chasing animals,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.420
like the dachshund.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.760
And this is all down
to us interacting

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.680
with this other species.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.710
Now, to explore this diversity
and how it comes about

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.270
in more detail, I
need to introduce

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.945
one more species and, my friend,
geneticist Professor Aoife

00:02:49.945 --> 00:02:50.445
McLysaght.

00:02:50.445 --> 00:02:53.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:56.562 --> 00:02:59.610
It wasn't entirely clear
if you were referring to me

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.070
as the additional species
or this beautiful chihuahua

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.060
in my arms.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.300
But this Chihuahua, of course,
was bred as a companion dog.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.280
And you can see,
he's very, very cute.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.620
And dogs are especially
interesting in terms

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.790
of genetics because
this huge diversity

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.540
that we can see in
front of us is actually

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.630
down to quite a small
amount of genetic diversity.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.980
They are, after all,
just one species.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.920
And that makes it
much easier to be

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.300
able to figure out how the
genes contribute to the changes

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.240
that we can actually
see on the outside.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.990
And so for example,
this little Chihuahua,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.390
and other miniature
dogs like this,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.690
the size variation is
largely down to just changes

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.700
in just one gene.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.503
Now, we are actually able to
understand the genetic basis

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:42.170
of some of this?

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.670
Yeah.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.310
So many of the origins
of these traits

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.250
has been traced genetically.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.670
So we can get a real handle
on how variation in our genes

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.460
contributes to the kind of
variance that we can see.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.950
So let's have a think about
how all of this variation

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.710
comes about.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.980
But for now, let's say
"thank you very much"

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.500
to our brilliant dog lineup.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.949
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:02.915
Here we go.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.370
So all those
differences have been

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.040
bred into different
breeds of dogs

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.100
by breeders choosing
dogs of particular traits

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.950
and then breeding them on
to the next generation.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.019
That's something called
selective breeding.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.410
It's what Charles Darwin
called artificial selection.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.570
And he imagined how
he could continue

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.130
thinking about
this to see, well,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.050
does this happen
in nature, as well?

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.300
How do we get natural selection?

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.800
And to really
explain this, we're

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.690
going to play a
game with this demo.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.340
And we need two volunteers.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.840
OK.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.040
Let's see.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.540
Yes?

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.480
You there in the lovely jumper.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.230
Lovely Christmas jumper.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.818
Come on down.

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:45.360
And also put one
down there, as well.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.860
Great.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.540
So are you excited?

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.410
Freddy.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.910
Freddy.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.050
Lovely to meet you, Freddy.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.770
And what's your name?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.270
Rebecca.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.360
Rebecca.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.570
So what you see beside
you here are two habitats.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.330
And you can see very
quickly that this is mainly

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.200
orange habitat.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.610
The floor is orange.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.100
And it's filled with these
balloons, which are mostly what

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.840
we're calling "orange pebbles."

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.390
And over there, we've got a
grey habitat with grey floor

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.560
and grey pebbles.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.490
But in amongst the pebbles,
there is something else.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.820
So here we have a mouse.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.990
And there's orange and grey
mice in each of these habitats.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.620
And so we're going to
put these in there.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.770
And Freddy, what
we didn't tell you

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.720
is that your job is to
actually be a predator.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.980
You need to catch some mice.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.970
And you need to catch
some mice, as well.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.640
So you're going to
have to go in there.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.070
And I want you to catch
mice but not pebbles.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.510
So you can go around the back.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.810
And just the ones
with faces, all right?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.070
Yeah.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.490
So only the ones with
faces we're interested in.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.650
If you go around the
back, they'll let you in.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.150
Yeah.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.108
So don't start catching
mice yet because that's

00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:47.180
far too easy, actually.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.680
Yeah.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.860
Let's make make
them more energetic.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.010
Yeah.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.302

bit more difficult for you.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.650
OK.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.400
Let's have a look.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.510
Well, that's a mouse.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.680
These are pebbles.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.000
So we'll put those back.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.710
And if you've
gotten your rocks--

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.460
We've managed to catch four
orange mice and just one grey

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.960
mouse.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960
Well, Freddy managed
to catch one of each.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.210
So what did you think, Freddy?

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.040
What did you think of trying
to catch the mice in there?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.640
What was it like?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.150
Hard.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.800
Was it hard?

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.120
Were either colour easier?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.650
Not really, no.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.520
What about you over there?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.078
Oh, it was easy.

00:06:55.078 --> 00:06:57.370
It was easier to see the
orange on the grey background.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.630
Yeah, you were going after
the orange ones, weren't you?

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.820
Yeah.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.320
And this is kind
of what we expect.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.170
We see that naturally.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.290
In parts of the world where
we have kind of black rocks,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.940
you tend to find
more black mice.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.410
And in parts of the world
where you have these golden,

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.600
sandy rocks, we tend
to find these yellow,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.880
sandy-coloured mice
because what we expect,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.280
especially in the grey
habitat over there,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.370
the orange mice were picked
off quite easily by this fierce

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.090
predator.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.950
And the grey mice actually have
survived to live another day

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.840
and to pass on their genes.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.070
But we did ask you
to be a predator.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.570
We did.

the job, have you?

Thank you so much.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.930
So artificial selection has
created all the dog breeds

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.130
that we see today.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.320
Natural selection picks
off some orange mice

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.170
in that demonstration.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.220
And natural selection has also
acted on us humans, as well.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.230
So our species originated in
Africa hundreds of thousands

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.830
of years ago.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.380
But then we spread out of
Africa and colonised the globe,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.880
so we encountered all sorts
of different environments

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.990
as we went.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.900
And there are lots of
ways that humans can fit

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.580
into different environments.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.020
We're quite clever, so
we can create culture.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.150
And that can help us.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.100
So if we move into
a cold place, we

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.010
might make ourselves
warm clothes to put on.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.560
There's also a
physiological adaptation.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.600
And that means
that your body can

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.510
get used to an environment
over your lifetime.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.320
But you don't pass those kind
of changes on to your children.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.700
So natural selection is when
there is a genetic difference

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.640
generation by generation.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.100
And we can see some great
examples of that in us humans.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.580
And one really good example
comes through the variation

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.450
that we can see in skin colour.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.250
And it tends to
map onto geography.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.760
Now, most of us tend to have a
fairly consistent skin colour

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.460
that we've inherited from
our parents and from earlier

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.540
ancestors.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.680
So over most of your body, your
skin colour is fairly similar.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.100
But I want to introduce you
to somebody now who's got very

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.820
striking differences in
skin colour across his body.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.420
And he is fashion
model Bashir Aziz.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.408
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:21.408 --> 00:09:23.351
Bashir, hello.

00:09:23.351 --> 00:09:23.893
Much respect.

00:09:23.893 --> 00:09:24.887
Fantastic.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.850
Bashir, you've got a
really striking look.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.300
You've got two completely
different colours of skin

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.210
and hair, as well.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.010
So how long have you had that?

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.000
Were you born like it?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.030
Yeah, all my life.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.245
So that's what I've known.

00:09:42.245 --> 00:09:43.870
So across your body,
you've got areas--

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.500
and obviously, we
can see on your face,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.308
you've got areas quite pale skin
and then dark skin, as well.

00:09:48.308 --> 00:09:49.600
I mean, look at your arm there.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.100
Yeah.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.700
So you've got a real mixture.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.200
Yeah.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.700
So we can actually have a look
and see how much skin pigment

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.500
you've got in different areas.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.580
So we can use this
instrument here.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.080
So yeah.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.380
Have look at the back
of your hand there.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.240
And there we go.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.470
So that says you've got 70%
skin pigment on that area.

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:10.900
Let's have a look at areas of
your skin that's pale, then.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.512
Can I try it on that area there?

00:10:12.512 --> 00:10:14.470
If I just pop it on there,
it should just work.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.720
Yeah.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.910
See, look at a different there.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.750
That's astonishing.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.560
So where you've got pale skin,
there's only, what, about 9%--

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.130
9%.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.640
--pigment.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.270
So really, really
big difference.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.950
So Bashir, we've got slides
here of pale skin-- rather

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.723
like the pale areas you've got--
and then dark skin, as well.

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:32.140
And you can see that they're
very different when you first

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.100
look at them.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.150
And this difference is all to do
with the skin pigment melanin.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.230
And there are very few granules
of melanin in this skin.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.180
But you can see, in
this section here,

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.630
all of those cells completely
packed full of lots

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.407
and lots of melanin granules.

00:10:49.407 --> 00:10:50.740
I'm going to try on me, as well.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:50.990
Go on.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.210
Go on.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.210
And let's see what--

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.300
let's see what I've got.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.753
There's a little bit
of melanin in there.

00:10:55.753 --> 00:10:56.253
19.

00:10:56.253 --> 00:10:56.967
19.

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:57.550
There you are.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.810
Well it is my hand,
though, so it is

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.320
exposed to the sun quite a bit.

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.170
That's all right.

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.750
So do you notice any difference
between your dark skin

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.650
and your light skin?

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:06.775
What, as in like naturally?

00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:09.317
When you're exposed to the sun,
do you notice any difference?

00:11:09.317 --> 00:11:10.400
Do I see any difference?

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.560
I don't feel a difference.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.860
I don't notice a difference.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.000
I just walk the walk
and talk the talk.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.830
I would like, say,
put a little sunscreen

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.620
if it was very,
very, very sunny.

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.120
So--

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.328
So it's interesting because
the difference in pigment

00:11:22.328 --> 00:11:24.730
and the kind of pigment that's
there to begin with anyway

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.590
gives us a clue as to why we've
got this colour in our skin.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:31.990
And it is to do
with sun protection.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.240
So in fact, your dark
skin is giving you

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.740
some pretty significant
sun protection here.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.770
And Bashir's dark
skin is coming out

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.590
as about factor 20 sunscreen.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.090
Naturally.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.850
So you've got your own
natural sunscreen there.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.390
Oh, perfect.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:43.890
Lovely.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.150
And if you have got very
pale skin, of course,

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.300
you have to put sunscreen on if
you go out into bright sunshine

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.560
because you could
burn your skin.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.930
And every single
episode of sunburn

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.450
means that you have a higher
risk of developing skin cancer.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.730
That's the seriousness
of it a bit later on.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.370
Bashir, thank you so much.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.370
Thank you for having me.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.870
Thank you.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.666
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:12.426 --> 00:12:18.070
See, that connection between
skin colour and sun protection

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.640
gives us a clue as to how this
evolved in humans, as well.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.090
So our ancestors who
expanded out of Africa

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.620
would have all had dark skin.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.470
So the first Asians,
the first Europeans

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:31.000
would all have had dark skin.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.120
And in fact, it's not until
much later that some mutations

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.020
started to pop up in genomes so
that skin started to get a bit

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.860
paler, particularly in very,
very northern areas where

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.100
the sun just isn't as bright
as it is in the tropics

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.660
and around the Equator.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.860
And in fact, we still see these
patterns of skin colour today.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.520
So we still see that people
whose ancestry is predominantly

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.450
from those sunnier places of the
world tend to have darker skin.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:01.270
And people who've got more
ancestry in the far north

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.270
tend to have paler
skin, as well.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.240
Well, next we're going to
look at another adaptation,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.270
another way that natural
selection has acted on humans.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.790
But this time, it isn't
to do with interacting

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.800
with the environment
as we find it.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.020
It's about interacting
with an environment

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.090
that we've actually changed.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.180
And it's about the
beginning of farming.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:28.570
I'd like you to gently give
a round of applause for Jade

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.370
the cow and her calf, Hazel,
who are going to come on now.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.522
Aw, she's lovely.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:35.230
Hello, Jade.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:41.390
(SOFTLY) Hello.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.293
So Jade is a Dexter
cow, isn't she?

00:13:44.293 --> 00:13:45.460
And this is her little calf.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:45.960
Yes.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960
Yeah.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.200
So obviously, calves
drink their mother's milk.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.430
And when our ancestors
started farming

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.430
and they started
domesticating cattle,

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.720
they could keep cattle
for their meat, of course,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.140
but also for their milk.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.200
Now, we want to
demonstrate some milk here.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.110
So I want a volunteer
from the audience

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.770
who's going to come
down and milk Jade.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.350
Let's see.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.430
Who shall we have?

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.380
Another fantastic
Christmas jumper, I think.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.047
Just there, yes.

00:14:12.047 --> 00:14:12.580
Come down.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.468
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:15.468 --> 00:14:15.968
Yeah.

00:14:19.356 --> 00:14:20.500
And what's your name?

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.100
Nam.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:21.600
Nam.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.725
Do you want to come and
have a go at milking, then?

00:14:23.725 --> 00:14:24.550
Yes.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.350
I think Felicity will help you.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.155
We've got a milking stool here.

00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:30.530
So you can either sit on the
stool, or you can lean down.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.780
And you gently squeeze
and pull, like that.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.930
OK.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.790
So this is what
our ancient farming

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.490
ancestors had to
learn to do, just

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.330
what Nam's doing right now.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.400
There's a bit of a
problem here because it

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.090
isn't so easy to drink milk.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.200
And there's a clue
to that in genetics.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.100
Yes, there is.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:52.540
So the main sugar that we find
in milk is called lactose.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.280
You see this lactose here.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.340
And that's actually quite
a hard sugar to digest.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.690
It's a very big sugar.

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.730
And in order to be
able to digest that,

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.230
it needs to be broken down.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.990
And that gets broken
down by an enzyme.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.050
And I need a volunteer to help
me demonstrate what's going on.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.640
So let's see.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.140
Yes.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.880
You at the back with
a beautiful jumper.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.370
You have the red stripe on it.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.215
Come on down.

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:18.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.680
Catherine.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.472
Lovely to meet you.

00:15:19.472 --> 00:15:22.010
So Catherine, you are not
going to be an enzyme,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.238
because we have enzymes
which break down

00:15:25.238 --> 00:15:26.280
these things that we eat.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.825
So you're going to
wear this, please.

00:15:27.825 --> 00:15:30.200
And if you could come around
here, what the enzyme does--

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.680
come over here.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.620
What the enzyme does is
it breaks the lactose

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:34.790
into smaller sugars.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.080
So you can do that
by turning this.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:38.580
Yeah.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.705
So that's the way it works.

00:15:39.705 --> 00:15:42.350
But stop for a second because
the enzyme doesn't just

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.590
come from nowhere.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.340
The enzyme is
produced by a gene.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.300
That's me.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.990
And the enzyme is only produced
when the gene is switched on.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.780
So when you're a baby,
this gene is switched on.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.805
And in this baby calf,
this gene is switched on.

00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:56.930
So the enzyme can go ahead.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:00.110
Yeah, keep-- so now the enzyme
is working, working, working.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.150
And it's breaking
down this lactose

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.360
into smaller, simpler
sugars that we can actually

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.740
digest without any problem.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.350
So this is what this
lovely little calf has.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.480
And it's what all
baby mammals have.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.310
But then at a certain
point, what happens

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.990
is the gene switches off,
and the enzyme switches off.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.728
Very good.

00:16:18.728 --> 00:16:20.270
And so this is what
normally happens.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.950
But is there
anybody in this room

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.320
who can drink milk and
it's not a problem?

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.010
Lots of you.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.130
Lots of you, and including
some adults, as well.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.140
But that's because,
in many humans,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.150
there's an adaptation
to dairy culture, which

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.440
means that the gene stays on,
and the enzyme keeps going,

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.890
and you're still able to break
down this lactose sugar well

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.140
into adulthood-- in fact,
for the rest of your life.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.840
And when we look at what parts
of the world this happened in,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.020
it happens in parts of the world
where we have dairy culture.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.130
It happened in dairy cultures
in Africa and in Europe.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.210
So thank you so much.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.377
I'll switch off the gene
now so you can have a rest.

00:16:55.377 --> 00:16:56.400
[MOO]

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.170
Thank you so much.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.280
You're a wonderful volunteer.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:58.760
Thank you.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.270
Thank you.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.216
Thank you, Nam.

00:17:00.216 --> 00:17:02.581
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:02.581 --> 00:17:05.419
Oh my goodness.

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:06.500
It's wonderful.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.119
Nam did an absolutely
brilliant job.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.515
Thank you very much, Nam.

00:17:09.515 --> 00:17:10.015
Well done.

00:17:10.015 --> 00:17:10.730
Thank you.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.194
I have never milked a cow.

00:17:15.194 --> 00:17:16.319
Have you ever milked a cow?

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.349
I don't think I have.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:17.640
Well done.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.089
Nam just did.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:18.450
That's impressive.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.140
Thank you.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.130
Thank you very much,
Jade and Hazel, as well.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.287
Thank you.

00:17:23.287 --> 00:17:26.209
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.150
So this adaptation
to drinking milk

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:36.000
that appeared in our
farming ancestors then

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.850
spread so that most
of us in Europe

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.250
can now drink fresh milk.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:43.320
And the way that
that gene spread

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.500
is through people moving
through migrations.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.730
And what we know is
that, throughout history,

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.710
there have been big
migrations of people,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.860
and people have
just kept moving.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.500
And that has spread
different characteristics

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.640
around the world.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.650
And that spreading
keeps on going.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.470
It's interesting that the ethnic
groups that we can spot today--

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.810
and we can sort of
say, one population

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.950
looks a bit different
from another population,

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.430
but it's just a snapshot
in the "here and now."

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.890
And those ethnic groupings
are different from what they

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.270
were a few thousand years ago.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.840
And they'll keep changing
because we humans keep moving,

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.640
and we keep mixing
ourselves around.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.240
So we've got an illustration
here of just some of the global

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.160
connectedness of everyone
in this theatre tonight.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.590
When you got your
tickets, we asked you

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.410
where your parents and your
grandparents came from.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.180
And we've mapped those
connections here.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.510
So the centre of it
all is, of course,

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.510
this lecture theatre in the
Royal Institution in London.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.600
This is just a snapshot of
where you are this evening.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.330
But here are all your family
connections around the world--

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.940
to North America,
to South America,

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.230
to West Africa, over here to
Southeast Asia and East Asia,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.060
and down to Australia, as well.

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.730
So what a wonderful image
of global connectedness.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:00.720
Thank you very much.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.350
We've looked at some
variation in humans

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.370
that we can explain
through adaptation

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.810
and that we can
experience ourselves.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.710
We can look at our
own skin colour.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.160
We can see differences
in skin colour around us.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
But there's another adaptation
or another gene variant

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.930
that we want to
introduce to you now,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.980
which is a bit more hidden.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.570
And we'll need some volunteers
to help us show it, as well.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:30.260
Yes.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.640
So this is something
that is very much hidden.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.160
So let's see--
we'll pick somebody.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:34.490
Yes.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.580
You.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.980
Very enthusiastic there.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.090
Yep, boy with the
lovely Christmas jumper.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.590
Yeah.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.757
How many do you want, Aoife?

00:19:39.757 --> 00:19:40.265
We need six.

00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:41.015
So you pick three.

00:19:41.015 --> 00:19:41.660
I'll get three.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.740
I've got two.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.240
Good.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.080
Yeah.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.410
You all get close together,
into a line, shoulder to--

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:47.960
yeah.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.377
What a lovely group
of volunteers.

00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:51.405
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:54.228
Alice, I'd like--

00:19:54.228 --> 00:19:56.270
Alice, I'd like you to
join in this one, as well.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.650
You can be our
seventh volunteer.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:58.230
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.392
I owe you one.

00:19:59.392 --> 00:20:01.350
So what I'm going to do
now is I'm going to ask

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.820
you to taste something, OK?

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.040
So you're going to
get a piece of paper.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.310
If you just stick
out your hand, you're

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.150
going to get a piece of paper.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.010
Just hold it in your
hand for a moment.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.767
And then I'm going to ask you
to just place it on your tongue.

00:20:10.767 --> 00:20:12.850
You're not to chew it, or
swallow it, or anything.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.487
There's going to be
a mix of flavours.

00:20:14.487 --> 00:20:16.320
So some of you are going
to taste something,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.540
and some of you are not
going to taste something.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.090
OK.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.403
Let's see.

00:20:24.403 --> 00:20:26.320
(EXCITED) There's a nasty
reaction over there.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:26.630
Oh my god.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.070
What do you think?

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.090
You can take it out
of your mouth again.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.460
That was disgusting.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.012
Yeah.

00:20:30.012 --> 00:20:31.720
So who else thought
it tasted disgusting?

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.650
[GROAN]

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:33.590
Did you get any taste?

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:34.040
Yeah.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:34.540
You got a taste?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:35.450
What did it taste like to you?

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.617
I don't know, like broccoli.

00:20:36.617 --> 00:20:37.810
Like broccoli, interesting.

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:38.530
What did you think?

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.270
I didn't taste anything.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.850
No taste.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.530
But you thought it
tasted horrible.

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.050
I thought it tasted like soap.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.840
It's like soap.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:45.700
So this is interesting
because we actually

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.150
have genetic variation in one
of our taste receptor genes.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.672
You all got the
same piece of paper.

00:20:50.672 --> 00:20:52.630
But some of you could
taste it, and some of you

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:53.650
couldn't taste it.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.020
And that's because we have
different versions of a gene

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.690
that allows us to taste
this bitter flavour or not.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.840
But you seem to think it was
particularly horrible, did you?

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.210
So I mean, maybe
there's something

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.650
I can show you here that
might cause you some dread.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:10.810
What do you think?

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.410
Do you like sprouts?

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:13.225
(TOGETHER) No.

00:21:13.225 --> 00:21:15.100
Because you can taste
the bitterness in them.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:15.970
But thank you very much.

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.845
Wonderful volunteers.

00:21:16.845 --> 00:21:18.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.620
Yeah.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:27.750
So we've seen, now, a few
examples of genetic variation.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.850
Geneticists, in
particular, are totally

00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:31.530
obsessed with variation.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.350
We want to understand how
the differences that we

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.440
see between us are related
to differences in our genes.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.490
This works quite differently
in different cases.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.115
So for example, for
height, the height

00:21:43.115 --> 00:21:44.490
that you will grow
to as an adult

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.130
is really strongly
determined by your genes.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.900
It's really a strong effect.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:50.880
Of course, what you eat
and how much you eat

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.318
is going to contribute to that.

00:21:52.318 --> 00:21:54.360
But if I wanted to guess
your height as an adult,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.320
I would look at your parents.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.040
And that would be a
fairly good guess.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.650
But there are
other things which,

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.690
even though there's
a genetic influence,

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.462
it's really not that strong.

00:22:02.462 --> 00:22:04.170
There's something else
comes in, as well.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.930
So can you please
raise your right hand

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.620
if you are right-handed?

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.120
OK.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.130
That's really a lot of people.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:15.180
Can you please raise your left
hand if you are left-handed?

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:15.780
There's a few.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.280
OK.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.290
So when did you decide
to be left-handed?

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:20.090
You never decided.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.810
It's a trick
question, of course.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.120
So it's a strange
one because, even

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.390
though it's only partly genetic,
you are also born that way.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.590
So in terms of whether you're
left-handed or right-handed,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:33.690
this is a really
good example of where

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.770
genes and chance come together
to make you what you are.

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:39.900
And we're going to
represent that here

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.620
with this kind of
obstacle course.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:43.980
So this obstacle
course we've got here

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.990
is representing the
process of development.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.337
So that's you
growing in the womb.

00:22:48.337 --> 00:22:50.170
And if we imagine you'll
get the start here,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.587
which is the start
of development.

00:22:51.587 --> 00:22:55.050
And at the end, you either end
up right-handed or left-handed.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.650
So if this one individual
went through this process

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.550
of development--

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.810
I have one individual--

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.630
So they might end up
left-handed or right-handed.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.130
Now, we can't tell
at the beginning.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.060
But let's see what happens.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.660
Let's see.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.688
And watch it go down.

00:23:09.688 --> 00:23:11.980
So we can actually predict
what side it will end up on.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.470
But this one ended
up on the left.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.630
So this individual ended
up, let's say, left-handed.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.510
But if we have somebody else
with exactly the same genetics,

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.880
they might turn out differently.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.680
So this person ended
up right-handed.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.630
We can do a few more.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.495
And we can do a few more.

00:23:27.495 --> 00:23:29.470
Aw, I'm going to be
tipping all these balls in,

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.428
we'll see what happens.

00:23:30.428 --> 00:23:32.670
[CLATTERING]

00:23:33.606 --> 00:23:34.990
Nice and easy.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.720
OK.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.060
So in this case, even
though everybody here

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.640
has the same genetics, it's
got the same obstacle course,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.940
a lot more turned out
right-handed than turned

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.870
out left-handed.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:48.410
So on average in the population,
90% of people are right-handed.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.080
And only 10% of people
are left-handed.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.390
And so the genetics
works a bit like this.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.150
So your genes set
up a probability.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.940
But they don't determine exactly
how you're going to end out.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.910
No, they don't.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.670
You know, we might
think about something

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.600
as normal or something
as not normal,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.130
but that's really
not the way it is.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.630
Yeah.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.020
You've got two outcomes here.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.020
One of them is more
probable than the other one.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.390
But you can't say that
being right-handed is normal

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:12.960
and being left-handed
is abnormal.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.460
No.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.280
But there's other things that
have similar genetics to this.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.980
And one of those is
sexual preference.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:21.740
So usually, men are
attracted to women,

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.090
and women are attracted to men.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.740
But sometimes it's not that way.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.110
And the genetics actually
is very, very similar.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.120
The percentage is very similar.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.030
And we have a similar situation
that the genes determine

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.580
the shape of this
obstacle course.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.990
And sometimes it'll go one way.

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.160
And sometimes it'll
go the other way.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.760
So your genes aren't
completely in control.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.660
There's a lot of room
for chance, as well.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.490
Yeah.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.130
And in fact, in
our own bodies, we

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.430
see the way that having the
same genome, for instance,

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.680
on both sides of
your body can produce

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.010
slightly different effects.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:53.510
Yes.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.170
And you can see an example of
that by looking in the mirror.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.270
And for this, I will
need another volunteer.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.450
And I'll need somebody who is
very good at staying still.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.135
Who can be very,
very, very still?

00:25:05.135 --> 00:25:07.010
So here's somebody who's
very nice and still.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.220
Yes.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.430
And with a beautiful jumper.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.930
Yes.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.094
You.

00:25:10.094 --> 00:25:12.002
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:12.002 --> 00:25:12.720
OK.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.387
So I'm going to ask
you to do something.

00:25:14.387 --> 00:25:15.845
Come around this
side of the table.

00:25:15.845 --> 00:25:16.720
So what's your name?

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.220
Cam.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.600
Cam.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.630
It's lovely to meet you.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.430
So we are going to ask
you to sit your head

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.320
in your hands like that, right?

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.730
I want you to keep your
head as straight as possible

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:27.230
and looking straight
at that camera.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.630
Now, we all have quite symmetric
faces, don't you think?

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.670
But there are little
asymmetries that we can't even

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.670
notice most of the time.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.280
And those asymmetries are
just that kind of chance

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.368
in development that we
just mentioned earlier.

00:25:38.368 --> 00:25:39.910
So if we look at
this picture of Cam,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.880
we can see she looks very
symmetric, like all of us do.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.340
But she probably has some
small little asymmetry.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.060
So if we just take the
left-hand side of Cam's face,

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.780
and flip it over, and make a
magic mirror image, and then

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.360
we move that over to the
left here of the picture.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.250
And we'll do the same
thing with the right.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.500
So we take the right-hand
side and flip it over.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.000
OK.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.500
So now keep looking
exactly straight.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.990
And so you can see
here, on the left,

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.685
we have the left-hand side
of Cam's face made symmetric

00:26:09.685 --> 00:26:11.810
and the right-hand side of
her face made symmetric.

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.910
And they look a bit
different, don't they?

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.910
So it almost looks like Cam
is her own identical twin

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.900
or something.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.968
But just look at me
without moving your head--

00:26:19.968 --> 00:26:21.010
without moving your head.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.135
And can you look at Alice
without moving your head?

00:26:23.135 --> 00:26:23.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:23.695 --> 00:26:24.195
OK.

00:26:24.195 --> 00:26:25.540
Look back at me.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.030
And look back at Alice.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:27.530
OK.

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.453
Thank you very much.

00:26:28.453 --> 00:26:29.370
You're wonderful, Cam.

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:32.274
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.960
Aoife, was an example of
how a genome can play out

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.940
slightly differently in
one side of your face

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:44.857
compared to the other.

00:26:44.857 --> 00:26:47.150
But sometimes we
get the same genome

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:49.230
in different individuals.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:50.390
--otherwise known as--

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.670
--(TOGETHER) identical twins.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.530
And we have some
twins who are here

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:56.750
this evening who have kindly
agreed in advance to do

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.285
some experiments with us.

00:26:58.285 --> 00:26:59.660
So if you could
please come down.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.480
We have Ronnie and Ritchie,
and Noah and Harris,

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.207
and Rosanna and Caitlin.

00:27:04.207 --> 00:27:07.189
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:14.144 --> 00:27:14.644
OK.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.420
OK.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.360
So which one of you is Ronnie,
and which one's Ritchie?

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.703
I'm Ronnie.

00:27:20.703 --> 00:27:21.250
He's Ritchie.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:21.750
OK.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.290
Thank you.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:24.000
So what we're going
to ask you to do

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.210
is to put your hand into
this bucket of ice water

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.760
and to keep it there just until
it feels uncomfortable, OK?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.720
So you're going
to take it out as

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.150
soon as it feels uncomfortable.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.687
And because we
want to compare you

00:27:33.687 --> 00:27:35.520
and because we don't
want you to know what's

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.080
happening with the
other twin, we're

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.820
going to ask you to put
on those ear defenders

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.560
so you can't hear
what's happening around.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.102
So I'm going to go
behind you and I'm

00:27:42.102 --> 00:27:44.100
going to start
these stopwatches.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.952
And you can see me
starting the stopwatch.

00:27:45.952 --> 00:27:47.910
And that's when you're
to put your hand in, OK?

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:49.000
So put the ear defenders on.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.833
And we'll get ready.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.140
OK, ready?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:53.640
Go.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.418
Well, Aoife, you time
the twins, seeing

00:28:00.418 --> 00:28:02.335
how long they can keep
their hands in the ice,

00:28:02.335 --> 00:28:07.300
I've got Noah and Harris here,
and Helen Earwaker, who's

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.980
a fingerprint researcher.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.130
And so Helen, you're going
to be looking at the twins'

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:14.463
fingerprints and seeing just
how similar and different

00:28:14.463 --> 00:28:15.130
they really are.

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.068
Yes, I am indeed.

00:28:16.068 --> 00:28:17.860
I'm going to take prints
from both of them.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.120
Should we start with
one of them, then?

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.630
Fantastic.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:20.730
Are you Noah or Harris?

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:21.320
I'm Noah.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:21.820
You're Noah.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.510
OK.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.150
OK.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.560
So we're going to take
Noah's right thumb.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.690
And we're going to
very carefully move

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:35.560
the thumb round all the way from
one end of the fingernail all

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.490
the way to the other--

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:37.640
To get lots of ink on it.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:42.250
--ink on all of the
ridges of Noah's thumb.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.090
And then we're going to
create a record of that thumb

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:53.356
by popping it down on the paper
and rolling all the way across.

00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:53.856
Ah.

00:28:53.856 --> 00:28:54.260
Look at that.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:54.770
That's a beautiful thumbprint.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.790
Excellent.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.480
And up.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.108
Perfect.

00:28:57.108 --> 00:28:59.150
Helen, I'll leave you to
do the same with Harris.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:28:59.650
Thank you.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.130
And I'll move over here
because we've got Omar Mahroo.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:04.700
He's an eye doctor.

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.205
And then we put another pair
of twins, Rosanna and Caitlin.

00:29:07.205 --> 00:29:08.120
Who's Rosanna?

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:08.670
I'm Rosanna.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:09.170
Hi, Rose.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.820
You must be Caitlin.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.370
And Omar is going to have
a look at your irises.

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:17.360
So Rosanna, if you'd
like to sit down there,

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.120
we're going to have a
look at the fine structure

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.527
of these twins' eyes.

00:29:21.527 --> 00:29:22.610
Are you comfortable, love?

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.068
And Omar, what are
you doing there?

00:29:24.068 --> 00:29:27.410
So this allows us to take a
detailed picture of the iris

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:29.268
of Rosanna's left eye.

00:29:29.268 --> 00:29:30.560
And what are you interested in?

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.250
Are you interested in the
colour or the structure?

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:32.540
No.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.837
Actually, the fine details
of the structure, which you

00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:36.420
can't normally see
with the naked eye.

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.090
But with a camera
like this, you can.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.600
Lovely.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.290
Oh, that's great.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:39.790
Oh.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:40.710
The ice has stopped.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:41.210
Yes.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.582
Well, actually, I didn't want
to let them go past two minutes.

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:46.040
And they both got
that far, so they

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.332
did the maximum amount of time.

00:29:47.332 --> 00:29:48.165
Wow, that's amazing.

00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:48.900
Oh my goodness.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:49.940
You're very strong.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.470
You can take your
ear defenders off.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:54.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.410
But I wonder if it--

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.243
was it really not
uncomfortable before then?

00:30:02.243 --> 00:30:03.827
Did you just keep
going, even though--

00:30:03.827 --> 00:30:04.380
Yeah.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:04.940
You did?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.570
Oh, you're so bad.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.070
Yeah.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.360
But they're both very
strong, obviously.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.790
And they're both the
same as each other.

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:13.960
Between twins, we see
this pain resistance

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.255
is quite similar between
twins, but very strong.

00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:17.880
And possibly very
competitive, as well.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.030
And possibly quite competitive.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:24.250
Now, Helen, what about Noah and
Harris and their thumbprints?

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:25.500
They're beautiful thumbprints.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.240
They are, indeed.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.700
We've managed some excellent
prints here from both of them.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.448
So if we start by
looking at Noah's print,

00:30:33.448 --> 00:30:35.490
then we're going to start
by looking at something

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:39.060
called first level detail, which
is the type of overall pattern

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.930
that we can see.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.450
So the question is, are
they broadly similar, then?

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.650
So we would expect to see
a level of similarity, each

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.490
of you, to some of the
genetic ways in which

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.050
those fingerprints are formed.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.420
But also, we'll expect
to see some differences

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.410
due to the exact conditions in
which that friction ridge skin,

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:58.000
those fingerprints are
formed within different areas

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.500
of the womb.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:30:59.000
OK.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.940
So what can you see?

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.160
So you can see here,
in Noah's print,

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.025
that we have lines coming
up and going round.

00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:05.900
Yeah, there's a loop.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.530
There's a loop, indeed.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:10.850
And we look at Harris's print,
and we can see, similarly,

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.290
a loop coming up and round.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:18.108
But if we look carefully, we
can also see another loop--

00:31:18.108 --> 00:31:18.900
That heads back up.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:19.950
Indeed.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:24.030
So Harris has something that
we would call a twinned loop.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:24.570
And then--

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.470
But Noah doesn't have that.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.970
No.

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.630
Noah has what we would an
ulnar loop coming round here.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:29.130
Yeah.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:30.270
Just a single loop.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:31.170
That's fascinating.

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.837
I mean, it's very
interesting, isn't it,

00:31:32.837 --> 00:31:34.680
that you've got
similar fingerprints,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.028
but you're both individuals.

00:31:36.028 --> 00:31:38.070
You've both got something
special, and different,

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.140
and unique about
your fingerprints.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:40.680
Brilliant.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.940
Thank you, Helen.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.135
How are you doing over here?

00:31:43.135 --> 00:31:43.635
Great.

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.057
Omar with Rosanna and Caitlin.

00:31:45.057 --> 00:31:46.140
We've got some very nice--

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.057
How's their eyes look?

00:31:47.057 --> 00:31:50.550
--very nice pictures of the iris
of Roseanne and Caitlin here.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.590
And here, you can see
superficially they

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:53.730
do look very similar--

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.680
similar colours.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.190
But if you look at
the fine detail,

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.900
you can see that Caitlin has a
couple of small depressions--

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:02.220
we call them crypts--

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.380
that Rosanna doesn't
have in the same place.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.602
And that's highlighted here.

00:32:05.602 --> 00:32:07.560
What's really interesting
is that when you look

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.977
at their irises
like that, I mean,

00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:11.830
they are strikingly
similar in terms of colour.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.330
Yes.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:12.970
Absolutely.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:13.650
Yeah.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:14.460
But it's this structure.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.500
It's the fine structure
that's actually different.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.000
Yes.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.280
And then another
difference is this ridge.

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.080
It's a raised area we
call the collarette.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.195
And I've just highlighted
them in both twins.

00:32:24.195 --> 00:32:26.070
And you can see the
shape's subtly different.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.500
And if you superimpose
them, again, they're

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.770
not identical at all.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.270
Yeah.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:30.960
They're quite different.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.752
Isn't that interesting,
that when we really

00:32:32.752 --> 00:32:36.440
get into this level of detail,
again, you are each unique.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.830
Thank you very much, twins.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.802
Thank you, Omar.

00:32:38.802 --> 00:32:39.510
Thank you, Helen.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.402
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:47.704 --> 00:32:51.960
So Ronnie and Ritchie
have stayed around

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.340
because, last week, they
did something else for us,

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.770
and that was this.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.390
So what they're doing
there is they're

00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:59.160
taking a sample from
inside their mouth,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.840
but it's not a sample
of their own DNA.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.040
It's a sample of things that
are living in and on all of us.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:08.400
We all have bacteria that
are growing on our skin

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.590
and inside our mouth
and our intestines.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:12.030
And Ronnie and
Ritchie very kindly

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.530
agreed to give us
samples so that we

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:14.670
could have a look at us.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.590
And here to talk
to us about that

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.510
is Arwyn from the
University of Aberystwyth.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:23.580
Hi.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.920
Arwyn Edwards.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:28.400
It's so lovely see you.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.480
Thank you for doing this.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.820
So you have here
something that has

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:33.540
grown from inside their mouths.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:34.040
Yeah.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.930
So we have the bacteria from
Ronnie in Ritchie's mouths

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.360
that have been plated
out on nutrient media.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.695
So this nice nutrient tallied
up is basically bacteria food.

00:33:42.695 --> 00:33:44.570
But you can see some
differences between you.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.350
Which one of you is Ronnie?

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.810
Him.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:46.310
OK.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.897
Ronnie, I need to give you give
bacteria back for a second.

00:33:48.897 --> 00:33:50.480
So you can see some
differences there.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.240
But it's all kind of little
spots of this and that.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.460
So it's a bit difficult to tell.

00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.150
And that's because only 1% of
bacteria will grow on a cup.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.730
So to really get in touch with
our microbiomes, what we have

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:03.710
to do is do DNA sequencing.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.220
So this is really a small
sample of what Ronnie and--

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:06.720
Yes.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:06.970
Yeah.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.360
--Ritchie are carrying
around, and all of us

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:08.960
are carrying around.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.159
Everyone's carrying around right
now, everybody in this room.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:11.659
Yeah.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:14.152
So how do you then sample
the rest of the diversity?

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:15.360
Well, that's a good question.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.920
So as well as collecting
those swabs, what happened

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.719
was their samples of
spit then had their DNA

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.790
in that sample extracted.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.100
And we amplified
bacterial genes in there

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.302
to do a sort of DNA
fingerprint of the microbes

00:34:27.302 --> 00:34:28.010
that are present.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.214
So you have something here.

00:34:29.214 --> 00:34:30.964
Ronnie and Ritchie,
come over here beside.

00:34:30.964 --> 00:34:31.760
We'll have a look.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.113
So now you're loading
the sample in--

00:34:34.113 --> 00:34:36.030
I'm just preparing for
a sample to just go in.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.185
OK.

00:34:36.185 --> 00:34:36.340
That's--

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.960
And this is the sample going in
here, this kind of milky liquid

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.460
here.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.610
OK.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.780
And how long does it take before
this sequencer starts actually

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.864
generating some sequence?

00:34:45.864 --> 00:34:46.739
It's already started.

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:47.614
It's already started?

00:34:47.614 --> 00:34:48.139
Wonderful.

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.889
That's incredible.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.040
So we've gone from the dark
green colours here with nothing

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.162
going through the machine.

00:34:53.162 --> 00:34:54.870
And now we've got the
light green colour.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:56.120
And you can see numbers
here flashing up

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.343
saying that it's sequencing.

00:34:57.343 --> 00:34:58.760
But this is going
to take a while.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.380
I don't think we can
wait for this to finish.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.890
No.

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:02.360
So here's one we made earlier.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.050
Yes.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.380
So it takes a-- it's very fast,
but it still takes a few hours.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:08.480
So we did the DNA
sequencing earlier.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.060
And we sequenced 2
million DNA molecules

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.550
from both of you put together.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.490
And from that, we have numbers
of the types of species

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:19.640
that we have there from
bacteria growing in your mouths.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.350
You're twins, obviously.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:24.140
So you have more in common
than you have apart.

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.530
So 116 species of bacteria
growing in your mouth

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.200
right now that you both have
and you're both sharing.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.140
But then, Ronnie, you've got 18
species that are unique to you.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:35.338
And your twin brother
doesn't have those species.

00:35:35.338 --> 00:35:37.130
And then Ritchie, you've
got slightly more.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:39.840
You've got 25 species
that are unique to you.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.660
So even though your
genomes are identical

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.920
and your daily habits
are very, very similar,

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.000
you have some bacteria
that make you unique.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.510
Yeah.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.682
And so these are totally
separate from the genome

00:35:49.682 --> 00:35:51.140
we've been talking
about until now.

00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.820
So it's not your genome.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.970
It's the genome of little
things living on your skin

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:56.770
and in your mouth.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.270
Yeah.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.930
So if somebody had a pet, would
that influence what's growing?

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.430
Yeah.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.200
So if you have a
pet dog at home,

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.690
you're likely to share
many, many bacterial species

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:06.740
between you and the dog.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.762
So next time you have
dogs in the audience

00:36:08.762 --> 00:36:10.970
there, give them a good pat
because you're picking up

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.080
friendly bacteria from them.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.788
So would somebody be
more like their twin

00:36:13.788 --> 00:36:14.810
or more like their pet?

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:15.882
That's a good question.

00:36:15.882 --> 00:36:17.840
It depends how much you
like your twin brother.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.110
OK.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.010
Well, thank you so much, Arwyn.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.510
And thank you so much,
Ronnie and Ritchie.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.200
You can keep those.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:22.742
And you've been
wonderful volunteers.

00:36:22.742 --> 00:36:23.804
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:23.804 --> 00:36:24.756
Thank you.

00:36:28.088 --> 00:36:29.860
Aoife, that was
incredible, I mean,

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:32.080
I think that it's
interesting to see

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.358
how many different
species of bacteria

00:36:34.358 --> 00:36:35.650
we've got living in our mouths.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:38.800
But also, the fact
that the sequencing

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.303
is so quick and so miniaturised
now, that amazing technology.

00:36:42.303 --> 00:36:42.970
It's incredible.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:43.960
Yeah.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.820
So I want to test
you a bit now--

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.570
Oh, yeah?

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.900
--because we've been talking
about various characteristics

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:52.810
that we can map on
to our genetics.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.390
But if you didn't know
what somebody looked like

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.420
and you didn't know who
somebody was, how much could you

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.390
tell about them if you
had their DNA sequence?

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.990
So now you're talking about
basically the Holy Grail

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.650
of genetics.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:09.430
Can you take a DNA sequence
and describe the person?

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.980
Well, it's quite hard
because we've already

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.790
talked about examples where you
might have particular genes.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.590
And it gives you a chance of
being one thing or another.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:21.258
But it doesn't totally
fix the outcome.

00:37:21.258 --> 00:37:23.800
And then there's another side
to it, as there's lots of stuff

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.967
that we just don't know yet.

00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:28.540
There's lots of examples
where we just don't know

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.260
how, exactly, the genes work.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:30.760
But--

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.590
So I've got somebody's
DNA results here.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.090
Yes, yes.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.830
So we have a mystery guest.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.740
And honestly, I don't know who
this guest is, nor does Alice.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.780
But I have been looking
at some of their DNA.

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.060
So this mystery guest
is going to come in.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.070
And don't say
anything that might

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.580
let us guess who it is because
we have no idea who this is.

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.300
And we're going to make
some predictions of some

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.980
of this person's traits just
based on the DNA sequence

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.480
analysis.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.715
So please come
in, mystery guest.

00:37:57.715 --> 00:37:59.964
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.910
OK.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:05.710
Mystery guest, you don't
have to say anything to me

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:07.585
because I don't even
want to hear your voice.

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:09.110
But thank you very
much for coming.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:14.140
So the mystery guest
over there has two bells.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.050
And they can use one of them for
"yes" and one of them for "no."

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.580
So the first thing
that I'm going

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.760
to talk about with
regard to this guest

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.620
is that this person
has two X chromosomes.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.940
These are the sex chromosomes.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.802
So usually when somebody
has to X chromosomes,

00:38:28.802 --> 00:38:29.635
then they're female.

00:38:29.635 --> 00:38:32.000
It's not 100%, but
it's most of the time.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.770
So I'm going to go for that
we have a female guest.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.490
Am I correct?

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.030
[RINGING]

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.530
Yes.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:37.720
OK.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:38.440
One right.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.010
OK.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.052
You're doing well, Aoife.

00:38:40.052 --> 00:38:41.890
Thank you.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:42.970
Now, let's see.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.150
So we also know that skin
colour is highly genetic.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:49.090
But we don't know all
the variants very well.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:52.720
So based on the
genetic variants,

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.090
I'm relatively confident
that this person

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.860
has skin on the darker scale,
so a brown to darker brown.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.170
Am I correct?

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:01.850
[RINGING]

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:02.350
OK.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:02.800
Good.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.040
Yes.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:03.540
OK.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.040
I wasn't certain about that one.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.790
Perhaps you might have
detached earlobes.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.692
So we have earlobes that can
be-- my earlobes are detached.

00:39:11.692 --> 00:39:12.400
And Alice's are--

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.150
Mine are attached.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.110
--attached.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.440
So do you have
detached earlobes, yes?

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.200
[RINGING]

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.030
Oh, OK.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:23.110
So we talked earlier about
lactose tolerance, as well.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:27.100
And so this person does
not carry the variant

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.620
that we normally see in
European individuals that

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:31.030
allows them drink milk.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:35.080
I'll go for that this person
is lactose intolerant.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:35.860
[RINGING]

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.460
OK.

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.390
There we go.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.090
And so some people--

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:42.230
you know the herb, coriander--
the green herb, coriander?

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.350
So for me, that
tastes really nice.

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.510
But for about 13% of
people, it tastes like soap.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:49.600
And this person
might be one of them.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.040
I'm not confident, but I will
say for soapy coriander, yes?

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:53.540
[HONK]

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.050
Oh.

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.550
OK.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.050
There we go.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:55.690
Interesting.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.090
So finally-- and
this one, I'm quite

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.300
confident that this person
has either dark brown or hazel

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:02.240
eyes.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.050
[RINGING]

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.550
OK.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.300
All right.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.700
Well, that's as much
as I'm going to do.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.200
But what was
interesting about this

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.700
is you know some
of these traits are

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.350
better predictors than others.

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:13.480
But it's never going to be 100%.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.640
So you might be right
sort of, you know,

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.590
7, 8, 9 times out of 10.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.450
But there are some
people that you're not

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.880
going to guess right by
knowing their genetics.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.480
OK.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.670
I think we just need
to end the suspense

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.045
and see who actually
is our mystery guest.

00:40:27.045 --> 00:40:28.420
Do you think we
should reveal it?

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.040
I think we should reveal
our mystery guest.

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.545
Let's see.

00:40:30.545 --> 00:40:32.358
[GASPS]

00:40:32.358 --> 00:40:33.350
Hello.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.334
Hi!

00:40:35.334 --> 00:40:36.326
How are you?

00:40:36.326 --> 00:40:39.798
One for you and one for you.

00:40:39.798 --> 00:40:41.782
Thank you so much for coming.

00:40:41.782 --> 00:40:44.758
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:44.758 --> 00:40:46.246
So it was a surprise.

00:40:46.246 --> 00:40:47.845
Were you impressed
that Aoife managed

00:40:47.845 --> 00:40:48.970
to guess so much about you?

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:49.470
Yeah.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.160
And I feel so bad
that I love coriander.

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:51.952
You love coriander?

00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:52.720
I love coriander.

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:55.270
But your genes say that you
should taste a soapy taste.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.920
That's not right, then.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.420
Tastes delicious to me.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:56.962
I don't know.

00:40:56.962 --> 00:40:58.430
So that one didn't work.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.930
Oh.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.650
That was amazing.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:01.675
Ruby, star baker,
thank you very much.

00:41:01.675 --> 00:41:02.175
Aw.

00:41:02.175 --> 00:41:02.925
Thank you so much.

00:41:02.925 --> 00:41:05.025
Thank you.

00:41:05.025 --> 00:41:07.875
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:12.740
So this is fascinating.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:16.040
We do seem to be able
to make some reasonably

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.820
good predictions about people
based on their genetics.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.810
But that was a bit of fun.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:24.110
It was a lot of fun,
and I got a cupcake.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.390
But there's a more
serious side to this, too,

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:32.445
because we can use genetics to
predict our risk of disease.

00:41:32.445 --> 00:41:34.070
I mean, you just
think really carefully

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.840
about how we do
that and whether we

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.940
want to know this information.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.550
So to help us think through
some of these issues,

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:45.230
I'd like you to welcome my
friend, bioethicist Professor

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.230
Heather Widdows.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.730
Heather.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.706
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:56.300
Now, Heather, first of
all, what is a bioethicist?

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:59.630
Well, my job is to think
not about what we can do,

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:01.020
but about what we should do.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:02.630
So I think about
the implications

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.390
for all the stuff you've heard.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:08.090
And now that we can predict
risk of some diseases--

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.810
some better than others--

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.510
what are the
advantages to knowing

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.020
that kind of information?

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:14.613
Well, some of it is
disease specific.

00:42:14.613 --> 00:42:16.280
So if there's a
treatment, for instance,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.080
then you need to know.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.850
But there are general
things that people

00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:21.470
think that maybe you
have a right to know,

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:22.345
that you should know.

00:42:22.345 --> 00:42:24.620
And that will help
you plan your future.

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.960
So that could be things
like lifestyle choices.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.210
So if you have a disposition,
say, to something

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.920
like a form of
cancer, then you might

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.050
want to plan your life
a bit differently.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.550
So when you're
thinking about things

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.285
like when you want
to have children,

00:42:36.285 --> 00:42:37.660
if you want to
have children, you

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.470
might want to have
children earlier.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.450
You might want to maybe
do your "bucket list."

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.957
You don't want to wait till
you're retired to go and climb

00:42:43.957 --> 00:42:44.540
Mount Everest.

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:44.930
Yeah.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.472
So it can kind of
help with planning.

00:42:46.472 --> 00:42:47.330
Right.

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:49.220
You could change your
lifestyle and hopefully

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:50.613
lessen your risk there.

00:42:50.613 --> 00:42:52.280
But what are the
negatives when it comes

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.290
to knowing your disease risk?

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.480
So just like some people
think you should know,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.820
other people feel very
strongly that other way.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.300
They think that you should have
an open future, that knowing is

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.950
going to make you
think that you're

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.320
ill when, in fact,
you're very well still.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.880
So even though
you're not ill, you

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.490
might start behaving
as if you are.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.990
And you kind of
wish your life away.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:12.710
So for very many
other people, they

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:16.790
think that, in fact, we
really have a duty or a right

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.500
not to know that's important.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.340
So we'd like to explore some
of these areas with you.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:25.410
And at your feet,
you've got voting cards.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.070
So when we ask you to vote,
what I'd like you to do

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:30.440
is hold up your answer
with the answer facing us.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.400
So we're going to talk
about a number of diseases

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.167
and see what you think,
see how you feel about it.

00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:38.000
Have a good think about
whether you'd really

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.090
want to know if you had a
higher risk of developing

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.410
such a disease.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.160
So should we have a think
about early-onset Alzheimer's

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:46.790
disease?

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.290
Yeah.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:49.790
So Alzheimer's is
one form of dementia.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:54.135
And usually, the tests will
only tell you susceptibility

00:43:54.135 --> 00:43:54.635
and risk.

00:43:54.635 --> 00:43:57.320
And it's more about a cluster
of genes in the environment.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.780
So this is something which
would cause memory loss,

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.660
eventually makes it difficult
for you to be independent

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.000
and to look after yourselves.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.260
At the moment, there's
no treatment for it.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.040
So would you like to know if you
had a higher risk of developing

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.340
early Alzheimer's?

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.210
I think there's a--

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.370
I think there's a majority
of yeses, actually.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.960
But there's quite
a lot of people

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.820
who wouldn't like to know.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.690
So let's think about
another disease.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:22.190
OK.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:25.890
So the next one we want to
think about is type 2 diabetes.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.580
So this is where your
body responds to sugar.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.710
It can affect your eyesight.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:32.810
And it can gradually
get more severe.

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:35.870
It is a disease where
you can manage it

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.790
very well by lifestyle changes.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:41.403
So obesity is a key
factor in the disease.

00:44:41.403 --> 00:44:43.820
So knowing means that you
really can change your lifestyle

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.780
to address it.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.260
So who would like to know if
they had a slightly higher risk

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.655
of developing type 2 diabetes?

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.655
That's really different.

00:44:52.655 --> 00:44:53.430
Even more.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.930
Yeah.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.653
So the vast, vast majority
of you are saying yes.

00:44:57.653 --> 00:45:00.320
It's important to remember, with
these kind of ethics questions,

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.737
there is no right
or wrong answer.

00:45:01.737 --> 00:45:03.420
It's what's right
and wrong for you.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.630
So let's think about
one final disease.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:07.490
And let's think about cancer.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.400
Now, there are lots of
different types of cancer.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.290
Some of them are treatable.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.060
Some of them are more
difficult to treat.

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:21.170
But if you could test for a
high risk of a particular cancer

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:24.230
where there was a treatment
option, what would

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:25.580
you feel about that?

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.490
Would you want to know if
you were going to develop

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:30.020
this particular type of cancer?

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.550
I think it is about 2/3.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:35.050
Yes.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.050
And about a third "no."

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.550
Yeah.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:38.260
I think that looks--

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.480
now, our roving
reporter, Aoife, is

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.930
going to come and ask you some
of your opinions about this

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.770
and why you voted--

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:45.520
Is there anybody--

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.300
--in various ways.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.770
Is there anybody who'd like
to tell me what they voted

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.240
and why they voted?

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.530
So I'll come around to you.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:51.120
Oh, sorry.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.430
I fall on the stairs, as well.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:55.680
And what way did you vote
on the Alzheimer's one?

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:56.900
I voted no.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.050
And why did you vote no?

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.500
I think you shouldn't
live knowing in fear.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.920
You should make
your own choices.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.360
Yeah.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.020
Very interesting.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.562
Anybody else who wants to tell
me about one of their answers?

00:46:07.562 --> 00:46:08.120
Yeah?

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.620
But which one?

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:11.500
I voted yes on Alzheimer's--

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.460
Yes?

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.220
--because I think it'd be
nice to warn your family--

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:15.730
OK.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.510
Very interesting.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:17.010
--and to share.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:17.510
Yeah.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:18.580
Yeah.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.200
Let's see if there's
somebody up here.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:20.930
You voted no?

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:21.430
OK.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:24.160
Do you want to tell us what
did you vote no to and why?

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.290
I voted no to the
first one because--

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:28.120
Alzheimer's.

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:31.450
Yes, because I didn't
want to know because then

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:34.150
it would make me feel scared.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.880
And then I won't enjoy my
life as much as I would have.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.010
I mean, it's very
sophisticated opinions

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:40.490
coming from our audience here.

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.115
So give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:46:42.115 --> 00:46:44.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.640
Thank you very much
for doing that with us.

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:51.568
There was some really, really
thoughtful answers there,

00:46:51.568 --> 00:46:52.360
I thought, Heather.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.350
Absolutely.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:54.870
Lots of the answers
you came up with

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.520
are exactly the answers
that ethicists talk about.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.060
Really?

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.210
One really interesting
thing, of course, about DNA

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:05.230
is that it connects
us with other people.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.740
So this is something you've
thought about long and hard,

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:10.780
Heather-- that, in fact, when
you have your DNA sequenced,

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:13.520
it's not just your genes
that you're looking at.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.200
Yeah.

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:14.920
Absolutely.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.340
The two key things that
make genetic information so

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.760
different are that it is
shared and it is identifying.

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.440
So it's shared with other
members of your family.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.800
And we don't really know
how to balance that.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.570
So if we think about
something like,

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:32.660
you know, testing for the
indicators for breast cancer--

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.710
if you are 15, and
you want to be tested,

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.200
and your mother is
35, 40, and doesn't

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:41.140
want to know, and you know
that there's kind of cancer

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.863
in the family, if you go,
and get tested, and turn out

00:47:43.863 --> 00:47:45.280
to be positive,
then you will have

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:48.540
information about your mother
that she does not want.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.310
And we need to think about
how we ethically manage that.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:53.470
It feels like we're
only just catching up

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.500
with the ethics of this
whole area of biology.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.080
It feels that we're not
really kind of grasping

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.130
how to deal with that
information quite yet.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.270
Yeah.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.450
No.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:02.642
I don't think we are at all.

00:48:02.642 --> 00:48:03.850
I think that's exactly right.

00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:06.160
You know, the science has
moved on quite dramatically.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.710
This is all about
unknowns in the future.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:10.480
Who will want your information?

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.910
Will it change what you
can do employment-wise?

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.628
Will insurers want it?

00:48:14.628 --> 00:48:16.420
And of course, there
is one particular area

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.510
when a genetic test
is carried out,

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:21.310
it's actually not
on your own DNA,

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:24.530
but very much on the DNA
of another individual.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:27.070
And that's when we test
babies in the womb, when

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.440
we do antenatal testing.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.080
And we're able to test for
more and more things now.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.930
But again, some really difficult
decision-making when parents

00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:36.830
are presented with results.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:37.460
Absolutely.

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:40.120
So you know, perhaps the
one that's most well known

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.650
is a test for Down syndrome.

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.480
That happens very routinely.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.780
So that means that nearly
every pregnant woman in the UK

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.660
will have that test.

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:49.443
And they will be
offered it routinely.

00:48:49.443 --> 00:48:50.860
And they may just
think, oh, well,

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.560
this is just part of getting
ready to have the baby.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.620
And what they may not realise
is that once that result comes

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.990
back, if that's a
positive result,

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:01.480
then the only thing to
do is either continue--

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:03.520
so the tests can
help to prepare--

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.388
or you can end the pregnancy.

00:49:05.388 --> 00:49:07.930
And that may be something that
they hadn't quite realised was

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:08.440
happening.

00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.630
So very difficult decisions.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.580
I want to introduce
you to somebody

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.910
who did have an antenatal
test for Down syndrome.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:16.830
and her daughter.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.285
So please, will you
welcome Donna and Frankie.

00:49:20.285 --> 00:49:23.135
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:26.460 --> 00:49:27.410
[BABY COOS]

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:28.880
Oh, she gave us a lovely wave.

00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.086
[BABY HUMMING]

00:49:30.086 --> 00:49:31.730
Are you excited to be here?

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:32.230
Yeah.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.660
So Donna, you had
an antenatal test.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.820
So you knew that
Frankie was going

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.980
to be born with Down syndrome.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.420
We had a blood test.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:43.690
And she came back as a high
chance of having Down syndrome.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:45.690
We didn't know
until she was born

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:46.840
that she had Down syndrome.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.220
But we knew that there
was a high chance of it.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:49.970
Yeah.

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:52.260
And did it help you prepare?

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:53.150
Yeah, definitely.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.150
I mean, I think I went through
my pregnancy, in my head,

00:49:56.150 --> 00:50:00.050
thinking, baby
has Down syndrome.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.270
It wasn't anything that
was negative for me.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.175
I was quite happy,
quite excited.

00:50:05.175 --> 00:50:07.170
I've had my first baby.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.230
It didn't matter
how she came out.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:13.660
She was Frankie, weren't you?

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:15.650
And she's different,
but she's lovely.

00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:16.720
Yeah.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.920
You know, no child's the same.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.250
She is so unique
in so many ways.

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.620
But I wouldn't change
a thing about her.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.450
She's perfect.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:25.970
Yeah.

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.050
And we're all unique.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.950
Exactly.

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:28.930
Thank you very much--

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:29.555
Thank you for--

00:50:29.555 --> 00:50:31.417
--Donna, Frankie, and Heather.

00:50:31.417 --> 00:50:34.279
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.030
So Aoife, we've been
looking at what we can

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.437
do with this new technology.

00:50:45.437 --> 00:50:46.270
You know, it is new.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.312
And it's getting faster,
and faster, and cheaper,

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:48.820
and cheaper.

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.270
And we can read DNA, and we
can make some predictions

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.920
about what we're going to be.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.180
But we can actually
change DNA now, as well.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:57.690
Yeah.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:00.280
And we have a really
wonderful example of this.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:02.020
So if you could please
welcome a leader

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.750
in this field of gene therapy,
from Great Ormond Street

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.490
Hospital, Professor
Bobby Gaspar.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:09.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.340
Thank you so much for coming on.

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.130
So you've been working in
the area of gene therapy--

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:20.640
so being able to change
genes to help patients--

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.070
for quite a number of years now.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:22.570
Yes.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.330
Well, I actually I started
right at the beginning,

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:26.372
when I was a junior doctor
at Great Ormond Street

00:51:26.372 --> 00:51:29.710
Hospital about 25 years ago.

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:34.860
And really, what we're trying
to do is, in some diseases,

00:51:34.860 --> 00:51:37.595
it comes about because a
gene is defective or missing.

00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:38.970
And what we want
to try and do is

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.880
put a working copy of the
gene back into those cells

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.980
so they now have
the correct gene.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:44.710
The gene works.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:47.760
It makes the right signals to
be able to correct that disease.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.770
So it's a very fundamental
way of correcting diseases.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:52.840
So you're really getting
to the root cause.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.912
And you helped the
first ever patient to be

00:51:55.912 --> 00:51:57.120
helped with the gene therapy.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.060
First worldwide.

00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:01.253
And he's the first
successfully-treated child

00:52:01.253 --> 00:52:01.920
by gene therapy.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:05.300
And our team at University
College and Great Ormond Street

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.380
helped treat him back in 2001.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.600
And he's here this evening
to come and show off

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.130
how strong and healthy he is.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:12.180
Please welcome Rhys.

00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.625
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.910
Hello, Rhys.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:20.930
I must say you are
looking very healthy.

00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:23.870
We have a picture of you
from about one-year-old,

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:24.903
I think, up there.

00:52:24.903 --> 00:52:26.320
What you can just
about see, there

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:28.740
is a plastic bubble around Rhys.

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.960
So you spent a lot of
time in that bubble.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.270
Well, when I was born, I had
to be put into this bubble

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.970
because I wasn't born
with an immune system.

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:40.300
And so any sort of bacteria
or viruses in the atmosphere

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.190
that I would inhale
or breathe in,

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:46.450
it would then harm
me because my system

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:48.550
wasn't very strong at all.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.860
And Professor Bobby
Gaspar was your doctor.

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:52.360
Yes.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:52.860
Yeah.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:54.130
So what did you do for Rhys?

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:57.430
Well, Rhys, as he says,
there was a single gene

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:00.010
that was missing in his bone
marrow, not working properly.

00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:01.390
He couldn't make immune cells.

00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.640
And so my colleague
and myself, we

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.090
were working on a new way
of treating this condition

00:53:07.090 --> 00:53:08.680
through gene therapy.

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.720
And that meant taking
Rhys's own cells.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.640
So he went to the
operating theatre.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.730
And we took out your
bone marrow stem cells.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:19.000
And in the lab, we put a
working copy of that gene--

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.250
that gene that was missing--

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.320
we put a working copy of that
back into his bone marrow cells

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.830
and then gave those gene
modified cells back to Rhys.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:30.320
And then over a few months, his
immune system starts to grow.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.240
And this was the first time we'd
seen it in any child in the UK.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.760
And then after
about six months, it

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.510
was growing and
working really well.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.660
So we were really, really
delighted how well it worked.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:44.270
And so Rhys, this has
totally changed your life.

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:45.100
Yeah.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.260
No, I don't think I'd
be alive, honestly.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:51.250
It's such a wonderful
example of how genetics

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.420
can transform medicine.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:53.870
And we have these new therapies.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:55.750
Well, now that we're
able to identify

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.210
all of these different
genes that cause diseases,

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:01.870
now we'll see genetic
treatments for eye diseases.

00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:05.010
Certain leukemias can be
treated by genetic therapies.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.760
And there'll be other
conditions, as well,

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.320
that will be treated
by gene therapy.

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.880
It's such a positive story.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.500
So thank you so
much, Rhys and Bobby,

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.012
for coming in and
telling us that.

00:54:13.012 --> 00:54:13.988
Thank you.

00:54:13.988 --> 00:54:14.488
Thank you.

00:54:14.488 --> 00:54:16.948
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:22.013
Aoife, Rhys's story,
it was just amazing.

00:54:22.013 --> 00:54:22.680
It's incredible.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:25.070
And this does feel like a
new frontier in medicine,

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.920
being able to fix faulty genes.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.710
And I wonder how
far we go with this

00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:34.190
because fixing disease seems
like a very positive thing

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.690
to do.

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:36.980
But you could make
other changes.

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.490
I mean, parents could be
choosing, I don't know,

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:42.680
eye colour, skin
colour of their babies.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:46.260
And that, I think, is a
very, very different issue.

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:46.760
Definitely.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.113
I mean, I have a
personal view on that,

00:54:49.113 --> 00:54:50.780
and that is that that
shouldn't be done.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.280
I just don't think it's a
suitable use of the technology.

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.310
And it's something
that should be avoided.

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:56.810
And this science
and this technology

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:58.040
is moving really fast.

00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.340
So all of you will have to think
about this really carefully

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.620
over the course of your lives.

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:05.840
Science is fantastic.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.270
It tells us so much
about the world around us

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:09.350
and about ourselves.

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.800
And it provides us with
amazing technological tools.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.840
But we have to work out how
we're going to use these tools.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.920
And that's not just a question
for scientists and ethicists.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.560
It's a question for everybody
because this science

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.800
and this technology
belongs to all of us.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.170
And just because
we can do something

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:28.760
doesn't mean that we should.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.730
But one thing that we do see in
all of this is that each of us

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.050
is a total one-off.

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:36.680
Even the twins were
a unique parcel

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.860
of talents, strengths,
weaknesses, foibles,

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:40.970
and charms.

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:44.550
We started out
wondering who we were,

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:49.190
what makes us unique,
what makes you "you."

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.350
And we found an answer to that.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:52.670
But it's your past.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:56.570
It's all your ancestors who have
passed down their genes to you.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:57.928
But it's also your own past.

00:55:57.928 --> 00:55:59.720
What happened to you
in the womb and what's

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.240
happened to you since
you've been born combined

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.560
with a lot of chance, as
well, makes each one of you

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.990
a unique individual.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:12.680
And there is no such
thing as a perfect human.

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.990
There is no normal human.

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:18.430
Humanity is all of us.

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:19.910
Everyone is different.

00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:23.840
And everyone has
something special to give.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:24.740
Thank you.

00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:27.790
[APPLAUSE]
