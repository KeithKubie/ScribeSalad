So who's a DREAMer?

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.073 align:start size:41% position:59% line:0%
Us two.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.073 align:start position:0% line:14%
You two.

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.312 size:88% position:44% line:0%
Because you're undocumented?

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:13.312 size:88% position:56% line:14%
Right.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:14.847
How old were you when you came?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.315 align:start size:75% position:25%
Five.

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.650 size:88% position:56%
Did you tell your mom, "Hey,
Mom, I want to go to the US

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.085 size:59% position:70%
and I'm going to go
without you." No?

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.520 line:85%
We didn't have a choice.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.520 align:start size:78% position:22%
You didn't have a choice?

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.654 line:85%
No.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:21.654 align:start size:9% position:91%
No?

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.790
I didn't find out
I was undocumented

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:28.395
until I wanted to enlist
in the military and I couldn't.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:35.902
And the option that the
recruiter gave me was like,

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.870
"Well, you can marry me,"

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:41.040
because some people want to
take advantage of the situation.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.208
But I don't want to do that.

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:43.943
I don't want to marry
because of that.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.012
And it's like,
is that my only option?

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.916
And I know that it's reality
to a lot of women like me

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.018
because we, in a way,
we don't have a voice

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.020
because we don't have
a security number.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:54.954
We can't vote.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.456
We can't do a lot of things.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.790 size:84% position:58%
She wants to go to college.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:00.193 align:start size:66% position:34%
She wants to help out
the American economy,

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:01.427 align:start size:72% position:28%
the American community.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.862 align:start size:59% position:41%
She's an American.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.263 size:88% position:56%
She wasn't born on this side
of the river,

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:05.698 align:start size:69% position:31%
but she's an American.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.034
Ross: Our president has dropped
any protections

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.603
that keep these kids
from being deported.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:11.971
But where would they go?

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.073
They've never lived
anywhere else.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:16.976
Even some of his supporters
think that's [Bleep].

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.411
They've got a right to be here.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:19.712 align:start size:44% position:56% line:0%
They do?

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.314 line:0%
It wasn't their choice
to come to the U.S.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.849 size:81% position:41% line:0%
Yeah.
They didn't break the law.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:23.916 line:85%
It was their parents' choice...

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:23.916 size:88% position:44%
Their parents broke the law.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:25.351
...that brought them here.

00:01:25.384 --> 00:01:28.855
As far as I'm concerned,
they're part of our society.
