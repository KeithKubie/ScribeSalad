00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.458
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.928 --> 00:00:07.073
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Thank you.

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:07.989
Thanks for being here.

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:09.220
I appreciate it.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.110
I know you're busy.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.290
I wrote "Bosstown"
a few years ago,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.050
pretty much as the Big Dig
was finished, completed.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.380
I lived through the Big
Dig in the South End,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.050
before it was the South
End that you probably know.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.430
And Boston's changed a lot.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.070
And the South End was
a very different place.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.410
Dorchester, Roxbury,
all these places

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.310
that are now these are
unrecognizable coveted areas,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.080
were once something
very different.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.110
And the Big Dig
really changed it.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.670
So there was
something that I just

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.270
felt I had to write because
I lived through those days

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.150
in the '80s, late
'80s, the '90s,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.080
working as a bike messenger and
as a mover, blue-collar work.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.269
That seems to have
kind of disappeared.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.090
Boston used to really
tolerate screw ups very well.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.350
And I was one of the prime
screw ups of the day.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.310
But you could survive in
Boston, during those times,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.840
being a screw up.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.240
And I wanted to get
that down on paper,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.410
just to prove that it existed.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.110
And that's the way it was.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.360
So I'm just going to read
from the opening of the book.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.550
The main character of the
book is a bike messenger,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.740
a job that I did.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.950
And the book actually has
a couple of voices in it;

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.610
the voice of his father,
who suffers from Alzheimer's

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.510
and used to deal poker
games, a roving poker game,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.390
almost like a
Nathan-Detroit-style poker

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.380
game that was sanctioned both
by the mob and by city hall.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.080
His father has Alzheimer's
and knows things about Boston.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.560
And as the streets
are being dug up,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.680
secrets come up and
out of his head,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.100
and also out of the streets,
along with the bodies.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.889
So it's told from--

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.410
my main character's
name is Zesty Meyers.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.310
There was a real Zesty
Meyers, actually,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.200
which I'll hopefully
tell you about later.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.850
The book is told in his voice.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.940
But then it also
changes voices into what

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.280
his father is thinking
or remembering

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.330
from the past in Boston.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.435
So I'm actually going to read
just the opening portion out

00:02:28.435 --> 00:02:30.220
of the book, the prologue.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.580
And it starts out,
"Everybody in the game

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.620
thinks they're a shark.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.040
This is how I see my
father, circa 1990.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.790
He sits in a high-backed chair,
a deck of Bicycle playing cards

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.450
nestled in the palm of his left
hand, his right hand hovering

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.930
over the deck like a
magician summoning spirits.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.820
He's wearing a
crisp white shirt,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.440
unbuttoned at the collar.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.800
The sleeves folded into
ruler-width rectangles that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.140
sit just above the elbows,
framing his forearms

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.870
and the coiled muscles
that shift like snakes

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.250
under his tan, brown skin.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.480
He is smiling, my
father, exposing

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.040
a yin yang of upper teeth,
separated horizontally

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.370
by a scraggly fault line,
where the bonding was attached

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.970
but had yet to discolor to
match the upper portion.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.340
His cheeks are
number 3 sandpaper,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.820
flecked with dull nickel
silver, only partially covering

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.820
a lightning-bolt scar
under his bottom lip.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.150
Smile lines run from
the corners of his mouth

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.630
into estuaries that reach
the edges of his eyes,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.090
pools of battery acid lit with
a galaxy of pinprick lights

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.650
surrounding the pupils.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.260
They are liar's eyes.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.110
Most of my earliest
memories are poker games,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.660
my father caressing
a deck of cards,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.260
the sound of chips hitting
felt, darkened windows, or drawn

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.480
shades in rooms,
dense with smoke

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.090
and men who, during
breaks in the action,

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.400
would practice
staring into mirrors,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400
trying to erase the light
from their own eyes.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.590
On nights when my father
couldn't find someone

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.080
to sit with me and
my brother, Zero,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.320
he would haul us to
these games, where

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.560
we would pass the time reading
whatever books and papers were

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.760
lying about.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.850
Or if the game was somewhere
with a kitchen or bar,

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.490
Zero and I would fix the
mean sandwiches and drinks

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.230
in exchange for tips.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.940
Most often though, we just
sat behind, always behind,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.140
our father and watch
the games unfold.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.120
Luck give way to
skill, friendly banter,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.800
wind down into pressurized
silence or muttered curses.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.840
It wasn't unusual
for Zero and me

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.150
to appear in school
directly from these marathon

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.650
games, our pockets bulging with
ones and fives, hair styled

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.460
with palm sweat, clothes
wrinkled and pungent

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.050
with cigar and cigarette smoke.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.870
It was not unusual
for me to wake

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.770
from a deep sleep in the
nurse's office, Zero laid out

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.400
beside me, his hand
squeezing imaginary cards,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.270
dreams of royal flushes
and quad aces dancing

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.660
behind sealed lids.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.520
The Z brothers,
they would call us,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.860
the narcoleptic
twins, though Zero

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.260
was nearly three years older.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.240
Whether this midday
catatonia brought

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.490
my father grief from the
school administration

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.700
is highly unlikely, since
those he played with were often

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.300
the school officials themselves,
or men otherwise hardwired

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.960
to the city's machinery;
politicians and their cronies,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.410
ward bosses and their street
corner protegees, cops,

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.690
robbers, bag men,
businessmen, and thieves,

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.520
who could tell the difference?

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.590
These were the men
who made things happen

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.420
and problems disappear.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.940
Dangerous men who
brokered in favors,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.880
cautiously-guarded secrets
that secured their positions

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.760
and livelihoods, a few
of which, remarkably

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.100
at odds with their
public personas, weighed

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.350
like liens on their conscience.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.230
Men who, I was to learn
later, had sometimes

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.930
found the weight of those
secrets too great to keep

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.950
and would look into my father's
black eyes, those liar's eyes,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.680
and find whatever
it was they sought;

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.820
forgiveness, understanding.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.580
In certain Central and
South American countries,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.790
places where the governments
rotate in and out of power,

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.100
seemingly through
a revolving door

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.440
directly connected
to hell, there

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.100
existed a cadre of men and
women who hire themselves out

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.770
as professional
hostages, stand-ins

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.400
for those taken from wealthy
families and held for ransom.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.470
Though their loved ones ad been
removed from immediate danger,

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.050
the families rarely failed to
pay the ransom demands in order

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.830
to preserve the honor of their
word, their family's good name.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.500
Whether the hostages are
mistreated or tortured, live

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.390
or die, they could care less.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.510
In their world,
reputation is everything.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.450
My father operated under
much of the same principle,

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.210
only minus the cold, hard cash.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.540
His word was bond because
generally, it was all we had.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.630
My father was the place
secrets went to die,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.760
never to see the light of day.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.970
At least, that's what
everybody thought.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.570
But then, along
came the Big Dig,

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.090
Boston's $20-billion
central artery project,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.820
slicing through the city's
divided neighborhoods,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.510
Charlestown, South Boston,
Chinatown, and East Boston,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.000
the South End, tearing
up the pavement,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.610
exposing the bodies everyone
had figured were buried forever.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.010
What my father knew, or
rather, what he remembered--

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.220
as Alzheimer's crept in
and rendered his past

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.770
a grab bag of
Etch-A-Sketch memories--

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.580
seemed to shift as often
as Boston's topography.

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.790
The city and its history
were turned inside out,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.650
one heaping shovel load
at a time, buildings

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.580
that had stood mute witness
to decades of fitful change

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.420
were reduced to rubble
overnight and carted off

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.060
by convoys of trucks
that shook the ground

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.370
like many earthquakes
as they barreled

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.320
towards the harbor docks.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.040
Two-way streets were choked
into one-way passages, cement

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.500
barriers eliminating turns.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.400
Exits and ramps were blocked
and turned around and rerouted

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.140
into makeshift outlets.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.590
Rotaries were halved, draining
traffic back to the streets

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.120
they had just escaped.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.830
Sidewalks vanished.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.510
Bridges led to nowhere.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.400
Streets disappeared completely.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.020
And as the Earth rumbled,
shifted, and coughed up

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.559
its secrets, from every
crack, hole, and crevice,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.770
the rats came out to play."

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.210
Thank you, that's
much appreciated.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.750
That's the serious opening.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.410
Zesty Meyers, the main
character, is quite a wise ass.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.880
So you don't get
it in that opening.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.411
But it comes out as he
barrels around through Boston.

00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:55.910
SPEAKER 1: You were
actually talking

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.118
about it like, just before,
about the role, about all

00:08:58.118 --> 00:09:00.680
the music in the book.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.810
And I know that
that's a huge part

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.830
of the book that also
wasn't really in the intro

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.770
that you just described.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.728
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Right.

00:09:06.728 --> 00:09:08.000
Absolutely.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.610
Boston used to be a huge music
town, a really great place

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:14.450
to see music.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.390
A lot of bands
came out in Boston

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.480
during those 1970s, 1980s.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.280
Clubs seemingly popped up
and burned down regularly,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.260
under mysterious circumstances.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.270
But Boston, really, it was
just a hotbed of rock and roll.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.790
And at some point, also,
the drinking age was 18.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.192
So people used to
be able to go--

00:09:36.192 --> 00:09:37.400
SPEAKER 1: Now we're talking.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.530
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Yeah,
you used to go younger.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.340
And fake IDs, they didn't
have any lamination

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.870
or any of that fancy code
that probably is required

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.790
to get into this building.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:53.780
So you know, I was
out at the age of 14,

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.780
15, getting into trouble
and going to see music.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.680
It was really a huge
part of this town.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:06.020
My main character gets into an
accident early on in the book.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.170
And it sparks music in his head.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.170
He can't turn it
off, essentially.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.680
Oliver Sacks actually wrote
a book called "Musicophilia,"

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.500
I believe it was, which is
hard to get out of my mouth.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:23.810
But sometimes, it's
a rare occurrence,

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:27.470
but people struck
with lightning, people

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:32.810
with massive strokes,
they develop an obsession

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.530
with music, either
to play an instrument

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.210
or they hear music
in their heads.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.350
So it's actually
a true occurrence.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.630
But it's very rare
and very obsessive.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.710
So I kind of took
the opportunity

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:52.570
to stick in as many Boston
bands as I could remember

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.200
who never made it, who
I loved and respected,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.640
but just never made it.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.500
Maybe one song, they
had Boston popularity.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.560
Which was probably
enough for them,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:12.150
to have just that lifestyle
and attention early on.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.140
But I'm sure they didn't
make a career of it.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:20.020
And any questions from you,
please, hit me up with it.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.145
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, all the
music references are cool.

00:11:22.145 --> 00:11:24.841
And I was like, frequently
googling some of them.

00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:26.715
Like you said, they
didn't make it, you know?

00:11:26.715 --> 00:11:27.440
So it's cool.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.440
This is sort of their lasting,
for a lot of them at least.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.490
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Yeah I
was always very jealous

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.610
of anyone who played
an instrument.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:38.600
I always wrote.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.410
But you know, who pays
attention to writers?

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.980
I only wrote to get girls.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.530
It's the truth.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.980
I'm ashamed and proud
at the same time.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.410
But it only had--

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.490
it only went so far.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.550
[LAUGHS]

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.160
SPEAKER 1: And then poker is
one of the other main themes,

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.810
besides music, in the book.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.919
So you have a good poker--

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.710
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: I do
have a poker history.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:10.350
So poker is a huge part of the
book with Zesty's father, Will

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:11.220
Meyers.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.600
So poker was the third way
I made money in Boston.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.970
There were always poker
games breaking out

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.220
at the moving company
that used to work at.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:25.330
And there were games often,
if you knew the right people.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.820
And the money wasn't so big.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.980
But it was another way to
make some money across town.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.450
Poker is huge.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.230
The cover of the book,
you'll see a spade

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.970
on the cover of the book.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.130
Poker is throughout the book.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.750
I love poker because
it's the one place where

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.230
you can sit down with
somebody, lie to their face,

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:53.520
and they don't hate you
because it's expected.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:59.610
It's just, it seems to be
the great equalizer of lies.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.110
Everybody knows what
everybody is doing.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.090
Everybody.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.530
And the beauty is,
everyone really

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.860
does think they're
a good poker player.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.750
No matter if they
lose money, it's

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.070
just a bad night or
bad luck or bad cards.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.670
It was really a pleasure
to fleece people based

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.940
on their over-inflated egos.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.210
Which I suffered for many
years, because you only

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:29.340
get good at poker through
being bad at poker

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.990
and willing to take the hits.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.680
So I took my hits.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.900
SPEAKER 1: Now, how long were
you a bike messenger for?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.630
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: So I was
a bike messenger through--

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.370
how many times did I get hit?

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:42.264
Or how many years?

00:13:42.264 --> 00:13:42.930
SPEAKER 1: Both.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.110
[LAUGHS]

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.340
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: So I was a
bike messenger for about five

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.970
or six years, on and off.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.540
My largest client,
for those of you

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:58.020
who remember the "Boston
Phoenix" newspaper,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.500
which before it was "The
Phoenix" was a real paper.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.160
So I used to be a courier
for the "Boston Phoenix"

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.550
newspaper, which was a
great thing, because it

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.710
gave me access to a lot of
different venues and shows.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.770
So for about five or six
years, I was a bike messenger

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.360
on and off.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.090
My second-biggest
client was a pot dealer.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:25.320
Which everybody was
always so happy to see me.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.670
It was really great to
be welcomed like that.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:30.700
It's a tough job.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.330
But I loved the freedom of it.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.630
I loved being out
in the streets,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.940
making my own schedule.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.300
It's a job that seemed
to die off and then

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.930
come back, with everybody
wanting everything now.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:50.730
You know, there's such a
currency in speed these days.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:54.360
Everyone wants it, you know,
in the order that they want it.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.360
So I think that the
messengers have actually

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.537
made a comeback in town.

00:14:59.537 --> 00:15:01.370
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I
wanted to ask about that.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.786
Because that's like, one of
my favorite parts of the book,

00:15:03.786 --> 00:15:06.360
was just the detail of like,
that job sounds really--

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.562
even compared to whatever you
know, blue-collar work, I mean,

00:15:09.562 --> 00:15:11.080
that job sounded insane.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.560
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: It
was an insane job.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.380
It's a job that paid off,
in the sense that you

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.350
get to meet a lot of people.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:23.290
You get to meet people
also, really, on the way up.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.310
I recall, actually, meeting--

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.030
for the most part,
you get the lobby,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.420
the people working the lobbies.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.140
You get the secretaries or
the personal assistants.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.950
And a year later, they're
in the front office.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.429
And two years later,
they've moved up the ladder.

00:15:40.429 --> 00:15:41.970
So it was interesting
to actually see

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.290
the rise within all the
different corporate structures.

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.210
That people can
begin in one place.

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.660
And if they stick
with something,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.160
they really can move up.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.584
So it was a great
job, in that sense.

00:15:57.584 --> 00:15:59.250
AUDIENCE: So the
question that I've been

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:01.260
thinking about pertains here.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.870
So bike messenger
and card sharp,

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.890
and how did you get
to work at Google?

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.390
SPEAKER 1: I was
wondering that too.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.270
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: So I never
got to work at Google.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:17.500
Actually, I'm a guest at Google,
and very happy to be here.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.640
I wish that was an
invitation to Google.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.140
But I actually teach in the
inner city, in New York,

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.860
I teach in Mount
Vernon, New York.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.270
So that was another thing,
just working with young people,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.850
getting to meet a lot of
young people in the South End.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.460
It started, I was one
of the co-founders

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:44.200
of the Little League in the
South End, the RBI League.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.800
We used to play in a park.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.600
We used to refer to
it as Crack Park,

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.620
Because that's what we'd be
cleaning up just to get kids

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.300
on the field.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.090
And now they play.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.580
I believe it's Jim Rice
Field in the South End.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.530
It's a beautiful park.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:07.089
It was really great to start
there and work my way up.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.180
I haven't worked my
way up to Google.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.965
So you can only get so far.

00:17:10.965 --> 00:17:14.109
SPEAKER 1: So I wanted to
ask about the characters too.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:16.940
I mean, one of the things
that stands out in the book,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.599
like, there are a
ton of characters.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.390
It's almost like, I
kind of thought of it

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.714
like "The Wire," or
something like that.

00:17:23.714 --> 00:17:25.380
A different setting,
but it's just like,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.980
there are so many characters.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.050
So in terms of
coming up with these,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.710
the parents in particular are
pretty complicated characters.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.940
So I don't know if you had any
thoughts on how you came up

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.160
with those characters, or
any other characters that

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.560
come to mind as like, the
people you want to talk about.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.500
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: I
really wanted to honor

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.640
a lot of the people
that were in my past.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.040
And I didn't ask permission.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.930
I used a lot of real
names in the book,

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.710
and just assigned
them a character.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.110
So it's not that I
made them anything

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.530
near to what they really are.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.180
But I just gave them
the names of characters.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.700
The parents as well, my
main character's Zesty's,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.630
mom was a radical
and a fugitive.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:21.120
So she was involved in South
American, Central American

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.350
politics, in the book, and
was part of a bank robbery

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.630
and disappeared into
the underground.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:34.320
So she was based on Katherine
Power, who had robbed a Brinks

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.000
truck, and a guard was killed.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.080
And was serving time for that.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.580
So a lot of political
history in the book.

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.880
But just a lot of the
people in the book,

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.310
I just wanted to kind of
give a nod and a shout

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.560
out to everybody who kind of
supported me and everybody,

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.200
basically, who I loved.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.790
I grew up a little
strange in Boston.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.600
I actually grew up in
communes in Boston,

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.120
during the late '70s.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.690
Or actually, a few
communes in Boston,

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.260
cooperative living,
the Boston Food Co-Op

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.300
was in Austin at the time.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.120
So depending on who
you ask, I either

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.460
had 14 parents at
one time, because it

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.870
was a house full of grown-ups.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.180
But of course, everyone
thinks that everybody else

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.590
is taking care of you.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.490
So you have no grownups
looking after you.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:38.500
So I really did run
wild during my youth.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.670
But I did, I wanted
just to shout people out

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.710
and to give people a nod.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.320
I didn't realize how many
characters were in the book

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.570
until St. Martin's Press--

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.910
the book's published
by St. Martin's--

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.460
and they were crazy enough
to give me a two-book deal.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.920
So the second part
of this, "Bosstown,"

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.900
will be out next year.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.400
SPEAKER 1: I believe "suckers"
was the word you used, right?

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.691
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Yeah, suckers.

00:20:03.691 --> 00:20:05.940
Those suckers gave
me a two-book deal.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.660
So high hopes.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.201
I think they were
hedging their bets.

00:20:08.201 --> 00:20:10.470
So I understood why they did it.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.270
Because you just never know.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:17.670
But when the editor
gave me back something

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.860
like a style sheet
of notes, there

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.920
were pages and
pages of characters.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.890
And I didn't
realize I had placed

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.730
so many people in the book.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:31.860
And everyone was ascribed
just a one-line description.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.352
And I really did not
realize that so many people

00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:36.060
were in the book.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.940
And people said, this
is a complex book.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:44.320
And at one point, I mean, I
patted myself on the back.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.100
But I also thought
that maybe I'd

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.760
overstepped the
bounds of characters.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.880
So there was a fair
amount of editing.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:58.740
I learned to not write
long for the second book.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.890
I was proud of myself.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.250
This was once a
500-page book, which

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.320
got weeded down to about 300.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:10.930
I forget, 340 pages, whatever
the maximum attention

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.870
span of today's reader is.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.310
I'm told it's
about 80,000 words.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.000
So between 80,000
to 100,000 words

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.420
is that sweet spot of the crime
novel, until you can follow it,

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.290
or somebody of that nature,
who can write a paperweight

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.949
of a book, that's what it is.

00:21:32.949 --> 00:21:35.490
SPEAKER 1: So I mean, I don't
know if you want to go into it.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.490
So you talked about that
the mom is based off of--

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.580
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ:
Katherine Power.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.705
SPEAKER 1: Katherine Power.

00:21:39.705 --> 00:21:41.310
And then the father,
was there any?

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.910
I mean, just totally fictional?

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:44.410
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Well, I
did a little sleight of hand

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.493
with the father, actually.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.100
I mean, I'm ashamed and proud
of it in the same breath,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.080
to say the main
character is, more

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.170
or less, the idealized
version of me,

00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:01.030
fast-talking and slick, and
carrying around lots of money,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:05.790
and always having something
to say to the prettiest girls,

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.560
working those front desks.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.720
But the sleight of hand with
the fathers, I have two kids.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.140
And you know, they've grown
up completely differently

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.160
than I have.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.780
I wanted to not only let
them know how things were.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:28.840
But I wanted to
have a memory of me,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.960
when the time
comes for me to go.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.160
So the father with the teeth,
the shattered front teeth,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.990
I lost my front teeth
in a basketball game.

00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:43.870
Unfortunately, it was
a Nerf basketball game,

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.370
and it was on Christmas Eve.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.750
I took an elbow.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.500
Try getting a dentist
on Christmas Eve.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.930
And so the teeth are mine.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.740
The scar, I got punched--

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.620
as my main character
often gets punched--

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.930
and my teeth knocked
through my lower lip.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.840
So a lot of the
description is actually,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.000
I've taken you know,
the poker playing.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.960
It's also me.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.680
But it's kind of the older.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.180
me.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.160
So they get the younger
version and the older version.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.590
So I don't know if that's overly
egotistical, if any writer has

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.710
ever given the full
range of their being

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.690
in separate characters.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.410
But that's really
what it's based on.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.410
SPEAKER 1: It's probably
pretty common, I guess.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:26.665
I don't know.

00:23:26.665 --> 00:23:28.831
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: I don't
know what other writers do.

00:23:28.831 --> 00:23:33.310
As a matter of fact,
I have a deadline.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.410
In case you're wondering
about the bags under my eyes,

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.330
it's not just the
lighting, which is great.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:45.280
But it's just, I'm under
deadline for the next book,

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:49.630
and it happens to be
the end of the year.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.434
So I'm down to a few weeks.

00:23:53.434 --> 00:23:54.850
And I've lost my
train of thought.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:55.919
What was your question?

00:23:55.919 --> 00:23:58.210
SPEAKER 1: Well, you were
talking about how you came up

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.080
with the characters.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.788
And it sounds like
were saying something.

00:24:00.788 --> 00:24:02.560
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Oh, I got it.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.350
So I think that was the
lead-in basically, to like,

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:11.260
the writing process
and creativity.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.830
People at Google,
I know, don't just

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.330
get hired, strictly that they
can do a straightforward job.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.700
I'm sure that
creativity is something

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.480
that they look for,
to be able to work

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.750
with a lot of different people
a lot of different ways,

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.770
under deadlines
and under pressure.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:36.630
My writing process
has been the same way.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.000
I actually think of
it as small miracles.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.890
Because I'm certainly not the
brightest person in the room,

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.620
especially when I visit Google.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:52.130
But there's a certain amount
of incubation of an idea

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:57.350
that you need chew it, you
think about it for a long time

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.590
before you actually sit
down and present it.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:05.120
So I incubated the first
book for a long time.

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.930
Probably, you know,
longer than I should have.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.864
It's very dishonest
to tell a woman you're

00:25:11.864 --> 00:25:14.030
trying to pick up in a bar
that you're a writer when

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.500
you haven't written anything.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.317
But sometimes you
just need to really--

00:25:18.317 --> 00:25:19.150
SPEAKER 1: Incubate.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.780
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Yeah, incubate.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.450
Is gestation the right word?

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.660
A gestation period, I think.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.040
So there's a certain
amount of it.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.780
So now, that book
took a long time

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.660
and then came out
in eight months

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.420
after being fired
from a teaching

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.170
job, which is another story
I'm not going to tell you.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.300
Totally uncalled-for firing.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.010
And now I'm under
deadline, although I've

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.670
had some amount of time to
think about the second book,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.970
to work under
deadline and to have,

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.800
almost, to be forced
to be creative,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.930
is a whole 'nother
ball game, I've found.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:07.160
And really, a lot of
napping is involved.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.700
I don't know if you have
napping pods here, but--

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.820
oh well, God bless.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:12.320
Nap

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.090
Napping pods are great.

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.920
We need them in the
school that I teach.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:20.300
And soundproof napping
pods would be perfect.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.320
But I get up every
morning very early,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.320
sit down, really,
without any idea

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:32.141
of what's going to come out
next, and pray for a miracle.

00:26:32.141 --> 00:26:33.140
And something comes out.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.160
It's not that it will stay
in the form that it is.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:41.510
But from one idea
is born another.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:43.610
And the pages stack up.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.330
I don't know if that's
a reproducible formula

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:48.770
for creativity.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.440
But I think everybody
is different.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.540
And it's working for me.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:57.980
And both books really
will have been done

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.320
in two very different ways.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.430
So who knows?

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.360
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.292
So I wanted to ask
too, the book--

00:27:06.292 --> 00:27:08.000
something that doesn't
really come across

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.875
in the intro, as you
mentioned in the intro--

00:27:09.875 --> 00:27:11.980
is more descriptive.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.660
The book is like,
very fast paced.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.920
It's kind of like,
cinematic in a way.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.460
It feels like, you know, it
could be a TV show, a movie.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.964
Are you imagining it as that?

00:27:23.964 --> 00:27:25.630
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Well,
I'm hurt that you

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:26.725
think the opening is slow.

00:27:26.725 --> 00:27:29.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.355
SPEAKER 1: Well, slower.

00:27:30.355 --> 00:27:31.355
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: But no.

00:27:31.355 --> 00:27:32.860
I mean, it's a bike messenger.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.440
And everything having to do
with being a bike messenger

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.540
is speed.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.810
So when I wrote the book, I
didn't consciously come out

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:43.780
to write a cinematic book.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.010
The movie rights and all
the riches that come with it

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.450
were the furthest
thing from my mind.

00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:54.820
But it really was
all about speed.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.140
So the whole story takes place
over only a couple of days.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:06.370
And I knew that speed was the
main formula for that book.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.130
So it does happen quickly.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.480
It does kind of unspool.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.700
I think there's also something
cinematic about talking about

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.410
Zesty's father, William,
who has Alzheimer's.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:21.650
I just think that our
memory is so fallible.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:25.215
That we think of things
and remember things.

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.590
I mean, we can't
predict what it is

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:31.890
that's important to
us in our memories.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.130
We think that we will remember
people and places and events.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.870
And it doesn't work out.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.140
We can't pick and
choose our memories.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.910
So I was always fascinated
with memory and story,

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:52.145
just like any family story seems
to change with the retelling.

00:28:52.145 --> 00:28:55.990
Anytime you get together with
somebody, with the same people

00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:00.350
over and over again, the story
morphs into something else.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:06.769
So I do think that memory, film,
that sort of thing unspools.

00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:07.810
SPEAKER 1: The music too.

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:09.920
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: The
music, with the soundtrack,

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.174
like, a daily soundtrack.

00:29:11.174 --> 00:29:13.090
As a matter of fact, I
mean, that's the thing.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.530
Everybody now provides
their own daily soundtrack.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.070
Everyone's always plugging
in to the headphones.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:24.730
And I almost wonder whether
it's too much, in a sense.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:32.640
We have our own internal
soundtracks, I think.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.980
More having to do with
thought than music.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.830
I wonder how much of
that we're cutting off

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.260
by constantly being plugged in.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.490
Although it's pleasurable.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:46.660
I certainly run faster when I'm
plugged in, when I go jogging.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.170
And But I tend to
be less creative

00:29:49.170 --> 00:29:51.810
if actually listening to music.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.490
My students, they claim
to work better with music

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.550
and to read better with
music in their ears.

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.650
But their writing certainly
doesn't reflect that.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.664
So I'm not sure I believe that.

00:30:05.664 --> 00:30:07.830
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about the writing process

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.830
that you were talking
about a little bit before.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.800
And as a two-part book, do you
find that since the first book

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:16.950
seems to be highly
autobiographical, did

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.100
the second book turn out to be
more autobiographical or less,

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.990
as were going through
your creative process?

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.990
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: That's
an interesting question.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:30.180
So I would say, the
second book, I mean,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.590
they did give me
a two-book deal.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.520
So I knew there was
a second book coming.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.990
So there were certain things
that I put in the book, almost

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.050
that I knew I would
write more extensively

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:47.250
on in book number two, that
would come to bear fruit.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.750
One of the questions
Jacob asked me,

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.150
how long was I a bike messenger?

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.700
And six or seven years.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.240
But you can only take such
a beating for so long.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.590
Like, not everyone is Tom Brady.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.940
So I knew that had to get out.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.130
Same with the moving business.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.480
I didn't want to be
a broken-down man.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.900
So I knew that I had to evolve
and get out of the business.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.210
And the character
thinks the same way.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:25.890
He starts out as a bike
messenger in the second book,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:30.000
but finds another career that
will bring him, basically,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.010
into crime.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.090
You know, the crime
business, which

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.850
is kind of like the
PI business of Boston.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:43.020
So as far as being creative,
setting yourself up, just

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.530
knowing when it's
time to step away,

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.070
I guess, and realize
when it's time

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:54.400
to move on to the next phase
of your life, it was the same.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.970
So I think creativity
sometimes can

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:03.490
be forced, if you know
that the clock is ticking.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.880
So I knew that the clock
was certainly ticking on me

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.200
in real life, which was
the autobiographical part.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.500
I think it was mirrored
by Zesty's move

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:17.520
away from being
a bike messenger.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.250
When I met my wife,
I hate to say it,

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:24.750
I met my wife at a gym at the
YMCA on Huntington Avenue.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.600
Which was a great
big gay hotspot.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.360
I met my wife in like, one
of the biggest gay hotspots

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.760
in Boston.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:38.240
So when I met my wife, she
used to run on the treadmill.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.090
Which I used to
say, my wife is one

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:44.730
of the stupidest women I
ever met, trying to run away

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.580
from me on a treadmill.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.960
But I just think that I
lost my point, because I'm

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.260
talking about my wife.

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.940
Oh, here's the point.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.180
I'm back with you.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.530
So some people are
forced to do things.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:04.950
So I wasn't married when
I got my wife pregnant.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:05.970
We weren't married.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:08.170
I had no plans on marrying her.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.720
And sometimes you
are just forced

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.290
into making these
decisions that spur

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.330
on the next chapter
of your life.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.190
It ended up being the
maturing factor for me.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:23.020
And it just it lights
a fire under you.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.720
So I think creativity comes.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:26.250
Sometimes it's forced.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:32.000
And sometimes, if you have
the luxury of time and space,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.087
then that works as well.

00:33:35.087 --> 00:33:36.420
I hope I answered your question.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:36.900
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.983
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: I know
you know way more about me

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:42.570
than you probably should
but thanks for the question.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:44.370
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.660
AUDIENCE: Since this book
seems to be a bit about pacing

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.010
and speed, as someone who rode
a bicycle around Boston a lot

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:54.595
in the '70s without a helmet.

00:33:54.595 --> 00:33:55.720
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Excellent.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.360
Yeah, me too.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:56.720
Cool.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.261
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:02.010
Well, I didn't know
what a bike lane was.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.370
Things have changed.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.870
I left for 30 years
and I came back.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.655
And the pace has
changed on bicycles.

00:34:09.655 --> 00:34:11.280
You know, now there's
hundreds of them.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.460
And they all go
at sort of a pace.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.780
Have you noticed that?

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:20.580
Is that part of
the book, the fact

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.710
that the pacing can change?

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.980
Not only in your life,
but clearly in bikes.

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.230
Also, when was the
first time that you

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.439
saw the word stylish and South
End in the same sentence?

00:34:32.439 --> 00:34:35.310
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ:
Hmm, that's good.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:38.070
Well, certainly, the
pace has picked up.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:41.820
I mean, the pace of everything
has picked up, really,

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.639
in all our lives, I think.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:50.100
So yeah, bike lanes really
confuses everybody, I think.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.270
I was never a gear head.

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.929
Like, I could hardly
fix a flat tire.

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:56.820
I just knew that
getting on a bike

00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:02.120
was the way to get around
this city, certainly.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.170
But I mean, when I
was in the South End,

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:10.500
I remember the Greyhound
bus used to be on St. James,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.940
if I'm not mistaken.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.940
It used to be the bus depot.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.580
And I remember that the
buses from New York where

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:21.150
my parents are from, Brighton
Beach, Brooklyn, they

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.410
would take the Greyhound bus.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:26.820
And it would come in
off of 93 and then

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.930
cut through the South End.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.810
And I remember coming
through the South End.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:37.090
And there the Orange line was
still up, and it was dark.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:38.720
And the streets were just--

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.450
the Pine Street Inn, it would go
right past the Pine Street Inn.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:44.400
Homeless people.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.390
Very dark.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.340
The sun never seemed
to shine in that area.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.830
There'd be a car burning
on the side of the road.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:51.830
I mean, this was Boston.

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:56.730
This was the Bronx in New
York-- in the 1970s too.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:01.350
So if you want to call it
a slow burn, certainly.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.380
So back then,
yeah, the South End

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:07.860
was not even on anybody's radar.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.640
JJ Foley's is a bar
that I would pass.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:18.030
And I believe they're still
in existence in the South End.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:20.820
Everything has
changed with Boston.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.810
It's amazing.

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.960
The borders are gone.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:27.300
And the way that the
neighborhoods were Balkanized,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.340
practically, you
know that they were

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:35.430
just such unique and
dangerous places to be.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:39.150
You needed to know where
you were at all times.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:44.700
And even within their own
ethnic kind of groupings.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.390
Like, the Southie
Irish would kick ass

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.410
on the Charlestown Irish if
they crossed the borders.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.960
And you could tell if
you've got the Southie dot

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.520
or not, that little
tattoo that they

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.530
would have between the
thumb and that little area.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.510
The city was dangerous.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:05.820
It was wonderfully dangerous.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.570
Because it was
exciting back then.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:14.710
You knew you were in a place
where you can literally

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:18.620
go a half a mile and see
something completely different,

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.410
see a whole different
way of life,

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.830
and a different kind
of neighborhood vibe.

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:29.020
So you probably
remember that you had

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.880
to know where you were going.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.230
You had to know where it
was that you should be.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:40.376
And it was good to travel
in numbers, sometimes.

00:37:40.376 --> 00:37:42.250
AUDIENCE: So I have
another question for you.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.820
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Yeah.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.320
AUDIENCE: There's
clearly a fair bit

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.490
of nostalgia in this book
for the Boston that was.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:52.720
And I arrived in Boston in 1990,
and have been bicycling here

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.710
for the last, well,
20-some years.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.050
And that's been marvelous
to watch the transformation

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:00.410
and the Big Dig, in particular.

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:04.360
It went from this absolute
chaos to something

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.800
that, honest to God, works.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.080
I mean, I can get to the
airport in 15 minutes, which

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.580
is fantastic.

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:16.510
So my question is, which Boston
would you rather live in?

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:19.597
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: That's a
really, really great question.

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:21.180
I think I'm going
to take the question

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.000
and say, which Boston
can I afford to live in?

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.470
So it is a heavy
dose of nostalgia

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.677
with the book, with the
music, with the city itself.

00:38:33.677 --> 00:38:34.510
I didn't realize it.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.580
But you know, when
reviews started coming in

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.700
from the book, they
all spoke about Boston

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.950
as being a character that,
"Abramowitz nailed Boston."

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:45.260
And I wasn't trying
to nail Boston.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.880
I was trying to be true
to how I viewed the city

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.020
and how I saw it back then.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.690
That's a really tough question.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:58.330
I live in New York now.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.170
And every time I
come back to Boston,

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:03.520
I want to stay in Boston.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.970
There are certain places
that feel like home.

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.500
But I don't know if
I fit in anymore.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.960
Because I can't give up
the past in some ways.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.990
Every street I go on,
it drives my kids crazy.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.210
I shouldn't be old enough
to say, this used to be,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.990
and I remember when.

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.460
But yet, I can't shut myself up.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.170
Because the city has
changed that much.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.540
The city is beautiful.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.270
This area used to
be kind of barren.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:40.180
You know, I mean, if I were
to dump a body in Boston,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.447
you know, Boston/Cambridge,
this might be--

00:39:42.447 --> 00:39:43.530
SPEAKER 1: Hypothetically.

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.113
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ:
Yeah, hypothetically.

00:39:45.113 --> 00:39:46.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:47.540
This used to be great.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.112
There was nobody here.

00:39:49.112 --> 00:39:49.820
There was nobody.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:54.640
This was just a pass through
to either get to Beacon Hill

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:56.320
and the Charles Street.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.350
There was nothing here.

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:01.990
There was Legal Seafood,
where I bartended, by the way.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:04.150
It was just kind
of a pass through.

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:07.570
So I'd love to come
back to Boston.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.260
I'd love to.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.920
I'd love "Bosstown"
to be a film.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.070
I mean, that's
certainly the goal.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:20.430
Unless you're about
to buy 10,000 books. .

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:24.480
That's the only way I can come
back to Boston and afford it.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:29.040
But yeah, I have a
great nostalgia for it.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:32.310
I'm going to be a
terrible old man.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:36.250
Because it's going
to be endless.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.420
That's a great question.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.820
I really appreciate
everybody coming out here.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.320
There's a great feeling
for an author when

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.740
people come by and
listen and just take

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.270
a little piece with you.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.467
So thank you.

00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:54.550
Thank you for coming here.

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.450
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:56.450
ADAM ABRAMOWITZ: Thanks.

00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:58.200
