mission behind google news is is really
the same thing that we're trying to do

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060
the same thing that we're trying to do
 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.330
the same thing that we're trying to do
with web search overall for the the

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340
with web search overall for the the
 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.130
with web search overall for the the
google mission statement of organizing

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140
google mission statement of organizing
 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.210
google mission statement of organizing
the world's information and make it

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220
the world's information and make it
 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.790
the world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful that's

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800
universally accessible and useful that's
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.060
universally accessible and useful that's
what we're trying to do for news as well

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070
what we're trying to do for news as well
 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.560
what we're trying to do for news as well
we're just trying to sort of apply that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570
we're just trying to sort of apply that
 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.359
we're just trying to sort of apply that
to every in every single different

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369
to every in every single different
 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.060

single source and ultimately down to
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.400
single source and ultimately down to
every single story so the the process of

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
every single story so the the process of
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.840
every single story so the the process of
putting together google news they i

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850
putting together google news they i
 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.160
putting together google news they i
think the easiest way to think about it

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170
think the easiest way to think about it
 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.350
think the easiest way to think about it
is in sort of three easy steps of how

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360
is in sort of three easy steps of how
 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.479
is in sort of three easy steps of how
you get to google news so first is the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
you get to google news so first is the
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.860
you get to google news so first is the
crawl process where we go off and

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870
crawl process where we go off and
 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.889
crawl process where we go off and
actually crawl the web looking for for

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899
actually crawl the web looking for for
 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.979
actually crawl the web looking for for
news information there are technically

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989
news information there are technically
 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.380
news information there are technically
it's the same process as web search does

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390
it's the same process as web search does
 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.990
it's the same process as web search does
there's a google bot or our crawler that

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000
there's a google bot or our crawler that
 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.450
there's a google bot or our crawler that
will go off an index information there

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460
will go off an index information there
 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.040
will go off an index information there
are two key differences though in the

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050
are two key differences though in the
 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.899
are two key differences though in the
crawling process between how news works

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909
crawling process between how news works
 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.300
crawling process between how news works
and how web search works one is that

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
and how web search works one is that
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.060
and how web search works one is that
Google News is a closed index versus an

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070
Google News is a closed index versus an
 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.800
Google News is a closed index versus an
open index for web search and what that

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810
open index for web search and what that
 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.669
open index for web search and what that
means is for for web search if you put

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679
means is for for web search if you put
 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.099
means is for for web search if you put
up a personal blog you you start a

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109
up a personal blog you you start a
 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:20.859
up a personal blog you you start a
website tomorrow at some point web

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869
website tomorrow at some point web
 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.029

search is going to go and pick up that

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039
search is going to go and pick up that
 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.309
search is going to go and pick up that
information and index it google news is

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319
information and index it google news is
 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.559
information and index it google news is
focused just on news sites so it's a

00:01:26.559 --> 00:01:26.569
focused just on news sites so it's a
 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:29.289
focused just on news sites so it's a
it's a smaller set of sites so it's

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299
it's a smaller set of sites so it's
 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.120
it's a smaller set of sites so it's
we're really just looking for for news

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130
we're really just looking for for news
 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.419
we're really just looking for for news
sites so it's it's it's a smaller set of

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429
sites so it's it's it's a smaller set of
 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.789
sites so it's it's it's a smaller set of
sources in our index and the second is

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799
sources in our index and the second is
 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.679
sources in our index and the second is
the speed with which will crawl it so so

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689
the speed with which will crawl it so so
 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.870
the speed with which will crawl it so so
web search has you know hundreds and

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
web search has you know hundreds and
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.029
web search has you know hundreds and
millions of different URLs that they're

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039
millions of different URLs that they're
 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.289
millions of different URLs that they're
trying to crawl and for for google news

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299
trying to crawl and for for google news
 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.639
trying to crawl and for for google news
you know we we have a smaller set of

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649
you know we we have a smaller set of
 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:49.809
you know we we have a smaller set of
that but it's also the speed with which

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819
that but it's also the speed with which
 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.339
that but it's also the speed with which
we crawl it has to be much much faster

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349
we crawl it has to be much much faster
 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.589
we crawl it has to be much much faster
so web search they'll have a wide

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599
so web search they'll have a wide
 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.529
so web search they'll have a wide
variety of crawl times because if it's a

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539
variety of crawl times because if it's a
 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.330
variety of crawl times because if it's a
personal blog maybe you updated once a

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340
personal blog maybe you updated once a
 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.039
personal blog maybe you updated once a
month or so you don't need to crawl it

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049
month or so you don't need to crawl it
 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.319
month or so you don't need to crawl it
every single second for news since we're

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329
every single second for news since we're
 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.029
every single second for news since we're
crawling these new sites that speed just

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039
crawling these new sites that speed just
 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.039
crawling these new sites that speed just
has to be it's a matter of minutes it

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049
has to be it's a matter of minutes it
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.539
has to be it's a matter of minutes it
really has to be as close to real time

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549
really has to be as close to real time
 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.850
really has to be as close to real time
as possible so that's one key difference

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860
as possible so that's one key difference
 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.100
as possible so that's one key difference
instead of the crawl part of it the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
instead of the crawl part of it the
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.630
instead of the crawl part of it the
second part of this whole clustering

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
second part of this whole clustering
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.820
second part of this whole clustering
which is again one of the the key

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830
which is again one of the the key
 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.830
which is again one of the the key
innovations that Krishna applied to news

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
innovations that Krishna applied to news
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.630
innovations that Krishna applied to news
which is taking all these different

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640
which is taking all these different
 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.030
which is taking all these different
sources and trying to cluster them into

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
sources and trying to cluster them into
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.820
sources and trying to cluster them into
similar

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
similar
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.550
similar
types of storyline so it can be trying

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
types of storyline so it can be trying
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.440
types of storyline so it can be trying
to understand obviously same languages

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
to understand obviously same languages
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.140
to understand obviously same languages
same editions same topics and those same

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150
same editions same topics and those same
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.510
same editions same topics and those same
story clusters together and then the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
story clusters together and then the
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.430
story clusters together and then the
ranking part of it is is completely

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440
ranking part of it is is completely
 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.840
ranking part of it is is completely
different from from web search and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
different from from web search and
 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.400
different from from web search and
you'll hear things when people talk

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
you'll hear things when people talk
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.720
you'll hear things when people talk
about Google web search don't hear about

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730
about Google web search don't hear about
 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.210
about Google web search don't hear about
page rank and inbound links and out bad

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
page rank and inbound links and out bad
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.390
page rank and inbound links and out bad
links and it's really a very different

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
links and it's really a very different
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.380

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
process that we're trying to do for
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.450
process that we're trying to do for
Google News so some of the things we're

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460
Google News so some of the things we're
 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.220
Google News so some of the things we're
looking at is is obviously timeliness

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
looking at is is obviously timeliness
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.490
looking at is is obviously timeliness
that matters for a new site location is

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
that matters for a new site location is
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.320
that matters for a new site location is
at a local source reporting on a local

else we're going to take a look at as

else we're going to take a look at as
well as the nature of the source at well

well as the nature of the source at well

well as the nature of the source at well
so it's not just you know it's not a

so it's not just you know it's not a
 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.240
so it's not just you know it's not a

human coming in and saying well this is
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.620
human coming in and saying well this is
a good source or a bad source but rather

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630
a good source or a bad source but rather
 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.120
a good source or a bad source but rather
looking at a number of different signals

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130
looking at a number of different signals
 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.520
