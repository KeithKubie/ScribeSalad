00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
&gt;&gt; Brad Neuberg mini--I don't--Brad's actually
a relatively new newcomer to SVG. You'd been

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.800
doing SVG for a year and a half, two years,
but I think a lot of us already know his name

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.570
because of the work that he's done with SVG
web and advocacy within Google and he's just--he's

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.380
very--he's another passionate person about,
about the open web. He started a mailing lists

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.469
called the--well, I guess a project, the Open
Web Project and he's really helping move SVG

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:42.480
and other open web technologies forward. So,
I just want to thank Brad for helping set

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:54.660
up this conference at Google and I want to
welcome him to the stage to do his key note.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.070
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: So, sorry for the technical difficulties,
I'm giving this about an hour earlier than

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:21.080
expected. Any--bring this guy up from sleep.
So while we wait, I know we've got people

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.080
from all over the world here, people have
communicated--have traveled from all over.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:36.740
So who here is coming from Europe? Wow. Wow.
So who is here from the States? And who's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.229
right here from California? Nice. And some
other places, just yell out that you might

00:01:44.229 --> 00:02:05.810
be from. Australia. Nice. Canada. North Carolina.
Okay. Yeah, we have some folks from Japan.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:15.840
Yeah? Welcome. Where are you from in Japan?
Where in Japan? Tokyo. Nice. And how many

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.010
of you--is this your first SVG Open? Yeah,
right. I don't believe this guy here. And

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:35.330
who has been to every single SVG Open that's
ever happened? Yeah. The organizer.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.910
&gt;&gt; So for those of you who didn't see that--I
think the lone hand that raised up, that was

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.550
Andreas Neumann who started this conference
series in 2002 and who has been a huge SVG

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.230
advocate. So I would--everybody, a round of
applause for Andreas Neumann. .

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.040
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Okay, looks like weÃ­ve got
slides. So, hi, thanks everyone for being

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.650
here. My name is Brad Neuberg. I'm with Google.
Today, I'm going to be talking about a variety

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.610
of things. I'm going to talk about how we
used SVG at Google, why we're excited about

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.379
it, and some of the work that we've been doing
with Internet Explorer to enable SVG. So starting,

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.629
I just want to say, this is a really exciting
time, in some ways, I'm relatively new to

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.890
the SVG community and it feels like there's
a real renaissance happening. I'll touch more

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.330
on that, but this year and next year, we're
seeing everything from all of the browsers,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:43.659
of Firefox, Safari Chrome, Opera, all having
SVG implementations. We're seeing real authoring

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:48.870
tools like Inkscape; Adobe Illustrator has
good import and export. We're seeing real

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.569
adoption and interest and this is kind of
writing a general wave, the last year and

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.250
a half we're really seeing HTML 5 take off,
CSS3, Web Fonts, so it's really an exciting

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.950
time. And before I kind of get into the bulk
of some of the steps, I want to talk about--I

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.989
want to really acknowledge, I think SVG has
a really special history. I've been to a lot

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.730
of computer communities and this one; I'm
just really blown away by the kind of level

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.020
of passion and the level of commitment. And
I want to briefly kind of call out to some

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.680
of the folks who I think really worked in
the 2005-2006 time period or kind of talk

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.000
about some of the work our group is doing
and how we arrived at SVG. But I look back

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.220
at the folks working in 2005-2006 and I think
these are the folks that were really doing

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.580
this out of a labor of love, really helped
move things forward to that next step which

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.710
is why we're here at the sort of beginning
of this renaissance. So, I want to kind of

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.830
briefly call out some of their names. I know
I'm going to miss some people. Like, I said

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.580
this is a great community. There are a lot
of folks doing lots of cool stuff. So, I briefly

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.000
want to call out--some of the folks--well,
I already did too many but Jon Cruz, obviously,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.960
him and the team of Inkscape. If you havenÃ­t
checked out Inkscape, it's a pretty amazing

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.430
piece of open source software. Of course,
everyone involved with the Firefox, SVG implementation,

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:17.660
I think they really came out with a really
strong work, one of the first folks to really

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:26.000
bring this in the browsers. Everyone involved
in WebKit, in Opera, bringing those implementations

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.350
to light. And then no community is complete
without the evangelist, the people writing

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.020
books, the people writing articles. I've gotten
here some of the stories about organizing

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.060
this conference year after year. It's a volunteer
created conference of--I've watched them in

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.080
action. It's pretty amazing all over the world
putting this together. So, I'm just sort of--I

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.919
want to call out some of the names of folks
who I've really seen--really being evangelists.

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.970
And, you know, working the nights, working
the weekends because they believe in this

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.600
technology. So, I just want to kind of give
them a shout out, of course, and more, I know

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:10.139
I miss people. So, if I did, please give yourself
a pat on the back. So I want to share a personal

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:18.979
story. In 2004, early 2005, I was a dynamic
HTML hacker. I was a JavaScript guy, and this

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:25.389
was before the fancy name AJAX. It was not
an easy time to a be a JavaScript person or

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.630
a DHTML person. WeÃ­ve got Alex over here
and I think he can call it the great dark

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.080
ages of DHTML as some of us call it. And the
reason I bring it up, I think there's a lot

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.280
of parallels with SVG. I remember 2004, going
to the bookstore, looking for books on DHTML

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.530
and they were all out of print. I remember
I was at the startup company at that time

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.630
and we had a web based aggregator for fees,
and I remember saying, "Hey, why don't we

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.470
use DHTML and this XTMLHP request thing. We
didn't have a shorter name for that, yet.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.610
You had to say the full thing. Let's make
something more interactive and people laughed

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.699
at me. And they say, "Hey, DHTML, that's dead.
That's buggy. That's not enough places." And

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:10.910
then, of course, we all know history, 2005
rolls around. Sites like Flicker, Google maps

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:16.080
helps legitimize DHTML and gives it a nice
new name AJAX and the rest is history. Suddenly

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.819
everyone woke up and said, "Hey, wow. This
stuff is all over the place." We can get real

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:28.780
work done. And the interesting thing about
DHTML and AJAX is that it really was invented

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:35.050
by Microsoft in 1997 with Outlook Web Access.
And it took about eight years for folks to

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.039
kind of wake up and realize, "Hey, I can use
this stuff. I can do real work. I can get

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:47.349
interesting things done." And so a renaissance
really happened with DHTML and the same thing

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:53.690
is happening with SVG. I like to kind of paraphrase
Gandhi--I know it's a little overused, but

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.030
I think it's overused because there's truth
to it. I'm kind of paraphrasing Gandhi, the

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:04.930
famous thing: first, they ignore you, and
then they hype the heck out of you. Then they

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:11.949
leave you for dead and then suddenly you're
getting real work done. Okay. DHTML went through

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:17.440
the same thing. If for some reason, web technologies
have to go through this worse than everything

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.639
else, JavaScript went through the same thing.
JavaScript was a shunned language. CSS went

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:26.860
through the same thing. You know, in 2001
talking about CSS, you know, you had to wear

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:35.769
one of those asbestos suits. So, I want to,
you know, now, that I've kind of shared that,

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:41.860
that really I think the parallels are very
strong with DHTML. I want to just briefly

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.810
talk about why is Google excited. Why are
we so excited about SVG? Well, I don't think

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:54.000
it's been a secret that we're excited about
the web; we're excited about HTML 5. And generally,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.850
when we use the term HTML 5, it's kind of
determining the end of the term AJAX for better

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:02.990
or worse that--like a larger term. It's not
just the spec. And it's becoming a bit of

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:08.980
a place holder for all these great web technology
that can really advance things forward. The

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:17.250
formal HTML 5 spec, things like Geolocation,
Web Fonts, SVGs, CSS3, faster JavaScript,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:23.830
we're rally bullish on HTML 5 and this whole
family of technologies because we see it solving

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:31.320
real problems. One of the most exciting formal
aspects of HTML 5, the spec, is that it now

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:39.100
allows you to drop SVG right into a normal
HTML page. SVG just becomes more tags that

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:44.330
you can add to HTML, but now everything doesn't
have to be a box, and everything doesn't have

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.240
to be a Div [PH] or a table. Now, you have
circles and rectangles. It's kind of a straightforward

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.690
idea and we should have had it a long time
ago. But now that we are going to have it

00:09:51.690 --> 00:10:00.920
and that's really exciting. You know, I think--we're
a search company. I know sometimes we do things

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.640
that we're not--you know, we're doing things
outside of search but we like things that

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.829
are human readable, that are text friendly
because they're searchable and SVG is very

00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:15.440
searchable. Especially, you know, someone
once asked me, "Why would I want to search

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.290
a vector image?" If it's an illustration of
a tiger, you don't want to search that. If

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.820
it's a medical diagram, if it's electoral
results for the last election we just went

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.820
through, these are interesting things we want
in search results. And what makes SVG so cool

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:34.440
is it's not just images, but hyperlinks can
be inside and point inside of them. That stuff

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:42.810
that can be used for Pagerink for signals,
that's interesting. There's a market demand

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.920
for SVG and vector graphics on the web. I
want to share this story a little bit later

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:54.010
for why the group I'm on chose vector graphics
and SVG, in particularly the first one. But

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:59.410
folks want to be able to do drawing on the
web. They want SVG in canvass. I'll talk about

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:07.529
both of those in a bit. There's a clear market
demand, and so, developers want this. Another

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:12.290
reason Google is so excited and bullish about
SVG is it integrates; it works with the rest

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:18.029
of the web stack. It integrates with CSS and
HTML and JavaScript. You donÃ­t have to

00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:22.399
learn a whole new set of technologies, you
learn this--you use the skills you already

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:27.370
know. So that's really exciting, that level
of integration, I think that we're going to

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.870
start seeing more and more interesting things
because it's not just trapped within a little

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:40.730
box. It's really a part of the browser. One
of the other reasons is SVG is a View Source

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.649
Technology. So View Source technologies doesn't
mean that you have the right to, you know,

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:50.370
look at everyone's source code. But it does
mean that it makes it much easier to learn

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:56.190
from what other people are doing. I have found
this so much in the last year and a half.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:00.029
I'll see a cool demo from Doug or from Rick
Masters, or a lot of the folks here in this

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:02.779
community and I'll say, "How the heck did
they do that?" I just go to View Source. I

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:06.589
learn from what they're doing. That's really
powerful, and that really underguards the

00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:11.610
web itself. And then if it's open source,
it's easy, you cut and paste. You like that

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:16.950
gradient, grab the definition. If it's an
open source font and the definition is right

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.829
in the file, cut and paste that. That's really
cool. And finally, we're excited about SVG

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:29.500
because it's easy to import and export. That
means you don't get trapped into any specific

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.930
tool. And it's also very server-friendly.
You can throw up a PHP Script, a Google App

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:43.670
Engine site that emits SVG as easily as you
do HTML. It's much harder to omit binary objects,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.709
but you can use any standard templating language
to spit out a little bit of SVG, especially

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:57.519
with HTML5 because you can mix it in line.
So now that you know a little bit about why

00:12:57.519 --> 00:13:05.070
we're excited about SVG, let's look at, you
know, where we're putting our sort of--our

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.459
commitment to it. How are we actually using
SVG? I'm just going to show you a few of the

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:14.190
places. One of them is, I donÃ­t know who
here is--so, in Google Docs, you can actually

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.610
drop illustrations in and you have kind of
a lightweight diagramming and drawing tool,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:23.230
which is great if you're trying to explain
something. Had anyone gotten the chance to

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:30.500
play with this, awesome. This uses SVG. It
uses SVG on every web browser. It has to use

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.889
VML and IE, but we use SVG on all the other
browsers. Here's an example drawing. My drawing

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:41.180
skills are pretty lousy, so I had to find
someone else to give me a good drawing. My

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:46.690
original one was like a happy face and someone
was like, "That does not look very good."

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:52.660
So last night, I'm like, "Who has a picture?"
Another place we use is something called the

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.889
Google Visualization API. This is a really
cool API that you can give a data from many

00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:04.839
different kinds of data sources. JASON, XML,
on the URL, a Google spreadsheet, and it will

00:14:04.839 --> 00:14:09.860
give you different kinds of visualizations.
Well, this is a perfect used case for SVG.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:24.110
And some of the visualizations do use SVG.
Let me show you some of these.
This right--this right here is actually--it's

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:28.670
called the gauge. It's a visualization alternating
into a gauge. You give it the right E values,

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:33.600
and you're actually looking at a Google spreadsheet
that has what is known as a gadget. And that

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:40.350
gadget has the visualization in it. Turtles
[PH] all the way down. And these gauges are

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:43.889
actually SVGs. So as we change the size, it
still stays beautiful. That's the scaleable

00:14:43.889 --> 00:14:49.860
aspect. And it's actually, the gauges are
keeping track of memory in CPUs. So that's

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:59.550
one of them. Here's another nice one, a simple
pie chart, click in and get the breakdown.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.790
The cool thing about the Google Visualization
API, it's very easy to use. You can even just

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:09.850
give it a URL and it will return back the
results of what you're looking at. So it's

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:18.420
very straightforward to use. One of the final
places we use SVG is we have, you know, like

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:24.040
most companies--we've got an extensive set
of JavaScript libraries. And one of them has

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:30.399
a cross-browser drawing abstraction that uses
SVG on every browser. Again, it does use VML

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:35.449
and IE, and that gives you a standard way
to do drawing. And a lot of our products use

00:15:35.449 --> 00:15:43.139
that as a consistent API. So these are some
of the places that we use SVG internally.

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:48.959
I want to share a little bit about the group
that I'm on and sort of get into some of the

00:15:48.959 --> 00:15:54.860
work we've been doing. I'm on a group called
Open Web Advocacy. Our motto is help web technologies

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.550
get better faster, and depending if we're
on a good mood or not. Sometimes it's; help

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.850
web technologies get better faster. Sometimes
it's; help web technologies suck less better

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:11.600
faster, depending if we're happy or not. But
our job is to really get out there and educate,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:18.449
evangelize. A lot of us have a JavaScript
background, so we create JavaScript toolkits

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:22.660
that help bring along other browsers so we
can have more parity because it's hard for

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.899
developers to use a new technology if it's
not everywhere, so helping the chicken and

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:32.970
egg problem. So we wear a lot of different
hats. And about--we are--our group started

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.449
about a year ago. And when we kicked off,
we were like, "What should we focus on first?"

00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:42.930
each of us sort of attacked different problem
sets. And on my side, I said, "What do developers

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:48.130
want?" So, I went to something called the
OpenAjax Alliance's Browser Wish List. It's

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:56.990
a very cool survey that was done a while back.
Actually, another one is coming up. And this

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:02.820
asked a tremendous number of developers, "What
do you want?" If you could grab the browser

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.900
makers by the lapels and say, "Here's what
I want." What would that be? And what do you

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:15.039
think the number one request by far that everything
else above--across the domain requests, other

00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:19.390
various kinds of things. What do you think
the number one request was? I donÃ­t know.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.699
What do you--Doug, what do you think it was?

00:17:21.699 --> 00:17:22.640
&gt;&gt; VML?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:29.580
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: The VML? So the number one request
was we want web vector graphics. Specifically,

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:36.980
we want SVG and the canvas tag on every browser.
That was the number one request. So that made

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:43.410
our job easy. We said, "Here's the number
one request. Let's take a look at that." My

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:48.530
background again is in JavaScript. Like I
said, I generally end up getting browsers

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:54.720
to do things they weren't really designed
to do. And so, I said, "We already have some

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.039
JavaScript help for the canvas tag on IE that
Erik Arvidson, Emil Eklund and other folks

00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:03.870
at Google had worked on. I said, "What can
we do with SVG? How can we help SVG? So sort

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:10.960
of--if I had only known what it would take.
Sort of delved down into that in terms of

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:18.940
how can we help bring along IE on this front.
Because I want to get into--we've seen amazing

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.580
progress. And one of the things I want to
share too, a year ago too, I said, "Where

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:26.669
is SVG?" I've always been a fan of it. I said,
"Where does it come from?" And last year,

00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:30.470
I was blown away when I looked back at the
state of the community. I was like, "Wow,

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.640
there are implementations everywhere." We've
got Authoring Tools. We've got this excited

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.600
community and real stuff happening. Wikipedia
which we'll talk about and Brion is also here

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.160
for the conference. He's doing an amazing
work with SVG, the sixth largest site on the

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:53.010
web. I was blown away at how much had happened.
So I want to--and I said, what can help us

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:58.210
get to that next step. What's the next sort
of progression to help things go forward?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.970
Before getting into that, I do want to say,
I don't want to beat up Mark [INDISTINCT].

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:07.580
I really respect that they came to the conference
this year. I really respect that they're here

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.090
having a dialogue, sending real people. I
think we should give them a round of applause.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:19.809
I think that's really cool. I hope that's
not embarrassing. I'm embarrassing them. I'm

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:23.510
embarrassing them. I know for many JavaScript
hackers, we've learned DHTML on IE. I know

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:31.210
I did. So I think it's really cool to have
you here at the event this year. At the same

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:35.370
time, one of the things that is blocking SVG
from going to that next step is we've got

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.740
this awesome implementations but we donÃ­t
have them on IE yet. And that is hurting developers

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:47.350
who are bursting at the seams to deploy stuff
with this. So finding some kind of realistic

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:52.460
way to help address that issue was one of
the things our team wanted to look at. And

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.020
one of the--the other point is a little subtle.
The fact that SVG doesn't work in the 99.9%

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:03.559
of DHMTL that's out there. This is not an
appropriate time to get into XHTML versus

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:09.450
HTML, but I'd like to say when you go in and
you're getting a PhD thesis, your research

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:14.409
adviser says, "Choose one research topic."
If you show up and you got two or three novel

00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:19.820
things, they'll say, "Go back to the drawing
board." Chaining SVG to XHTML is two research

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:24.380
topics at the minimum. It's saying, they both
have to succeed or they both unfortunately

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.080
fail. We were saying can we uncouple this,
allow SVG to be used in normal HTML and let

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:36.309
them sort of, you know, fight for their own
merits in that sense. So that was one of the

00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:40.890
other primary things that developers sometimes
wanted to just drop a few tags. They want

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.169
to square with rounded rectangles to make
a button that doesnÃ­t need some crazy way

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:50.950
to get rounded rectangles that you can just
use a little SVG. So we saw that as the second

00:20:50.950 --> 00:21:00.419
blocker. So our solution for both was a JavaScript
library. Before I kind of take you into that

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:06.730
and show you some demos, I want to say that
we're not the only ones doing this. There

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:12.919
are a lot of really amazing toolkits in the
community, they're all speaking at this conference.

00:21:12.919 --> 00:21:17.850
I'm going to run through them really quick.
All of them are taking different approaches

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:22.480
to give you a consistent way to draw SVG on
all browsers including Internet Explorer.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.570
And itÃ­s a real testament to the fact that
there's real demand for this and people are

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.110
actually, you know, I call it, you know, "Vote
with your sweat." It's kind of a crazy term,

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:36.940
but if you believe in something, shift code
and people are, so people think this is important.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:43.039
Obviously, the Raphael Library doing really
amazing work. And theyÃ­re speaking today,

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:50.020
this morning in this room, make sure to catch
that. DojoX, doing some very cool work, they

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:54.000
have a different pluggable back-in, so you
can have different kinds of renderers and

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.370
it integrates with the rest of the Dojo infrastructure,
so you get Data Abstraction. You can do some

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:05.840
really cool stuff, again, 12 o'clock today
in this room. And then the Apple SDK, Segay

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.039
Linskey [PH] is doing some very interesting
work in terms of a consistent development

00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:13.990
environment. Again, that's also being talked
about in this room today. So I encourage you

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:22.190
to check out the work they're doing. So, let's
jump in to what we're involved in. So the

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:28.919
name of the library is the SVG Web Library.
And what makes this unique is there's nothing

00:22:28.919 --> 00:22:37.100
extra to download. We, you can either say
use or abuse. We use facilities that are already

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:42.919
present on about 97% percent of the web browsers
out there. So there's nothing for the user

00:22:42.919 --> 00:22:51.090
to download. And we give the illusion of native
SVG support for both static and dynamic SVG

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:57.850
images. And itÃ­s as easy as dropping a
JavaScript file into your page so that users

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:04.450
donÃ­t have to download new software, it
just works. So before this toolkit, you have

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:11.600
roughly about 30% coverage for SVG, that's
essentially adding up the other browsers.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.970
Once you've got the toolkit, you essentially
have close to 100% of the installed web base,

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:26.360
probably closer to 95%, but we'll round up
5%, truth in advertising. That's cool because

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.240
that means that as a developer, you donÃ­t
face the chicken and egg problem, you can

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:39.200
just start using the technology you're interested
in and get stuff done. Now, I want to mention--I've

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.169
done a fair bit of open source, and this has
been a really exciting project. We've got

00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:49.210
more people outside of Google working on this
than inside. We've got Rick Masters who's

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:56.960
actually here, one of the lead developers.
He'll be actually coming up a little bit later

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.789
in the presentation to show us some cool demos.
We've got James Hight, who does not--he's

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:08.940
a giant Z. I couldnÃ­t get a picture of
him in time. And we've just got a whole host

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:14.730
of folks in the community just actively putting
this through its paces. I want to mention

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:20.919
that we've made a lot of progress with SVG
web. It is an Alpha. This is an Early Access.

00:24:20.919 --> 00:24:24.460
As we continue working with folks as they
put it to its paces, and Sam is using it on

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:28.700
his blogs. Shelly Powers is using it for some
cool stuff. We'll talk about some of the work

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:33.070
we're doing with Wikipedia around using this.
We're going to be like open source. We'll

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:39.250
announce data when it's, you know, actually
3.0 because that's the open source way. So

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:55.220
let me show you some demos. [PAUSE] So this
is Firefox and this is native SVG. These images

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:02.779
are from Flicker, weÃ­re seeing, we can
do stuff with the mouse with them. You could

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:17.720
imagine building a more larger App with photo
pickers and so on.
I should mention that the library works on

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:26.760
I6, 7, and 8, so we've got complete coverage.
This is I8, if we jump over to IE, we see

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:41.539
the exact same demo running with the same
fidelity in IE.
And this is not just SVG, there's JavaScript

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:45.429
that lives in this, the JavaScript thinks
that there's really native support in the

00:25:45.429 --> 00:25:51.789
browser. Let's see another sample. I really
like this one. Shelly Powers put this together

00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:55.450
a few weeks ago. I like it because it's one
of those "gets-real-done" kinds of things.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:26:02.840
So Shelly, she's got a blog and she wants
to put an image in the background. And she

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.179
wants it to scale based on the size of the
browser, straightforward, right? If you use

00:26:07.179 --> 00:26:11.750
a bitmap image, it will get ugly based on
how it is, it will get distorted. She'd loved

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.789
to use SVG in the background, well, now she
can. This--in the background is from the Open

00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:23.299
Clipart Library. As we change the size of
the browser, we get that nice scaling quality

00:26:23.299 --> 00:26:32.400
of SVG. Of course, that's SVG web in the background
doing that. Michael Noitz [PH]--at the end

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.950
of this I'll put up--when he's talking, he's
doing some really cool work with mapping,

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:43.419
things like that. This is a sample that he
helped port, I think someone wrote the original

00:26:43.419 --> 00:26:49.279
one. What I like about it is it shows a couple
of different things. It actually shows demographics.

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:56.679
It shows the population of Germany at different
times. And SVG is really good at this. It's

00:26:56.679 --> 00:27:03.740
rich data, you slice and dice. This is directly
integrated into the HTML. The SVG is in normal

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:10.799
HTML. And we see the HTML updating as we do
it. What makes this really cool is some people

00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:14.640
are like, "You know, why don't you just use
an image? Well, on the fly, we can change

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:21.360
the language. And we are changing it to Russian
inside of the SVG. Here, we are changing it

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:30.190
to French. And that's cool. And that depends
on the SVG, again it's just text, so it's

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.549
easy to change the language. It's easy to
make this intelligent, and that's a cool thing.

00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:40.020
I know, Brion is excited about these kinds
of thing. He'll mention some cool things that

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:50.159
they're doing. You know, SVG and maps go together
like peanut butter and jelly. It's one of

00:27:50.159 --> 00:27:58.860
those classic uses of SVG. Michael Noitz [PH]
will talk about more about this in his talk.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:04.539
He's been creating an interactive overview
of the election results for the German election

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:09.350
that I believe happened last week. It happened
fairly recently, I see all the folks whoa

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:17.559
re from that area nodding, getting that right.
We see Germany. We can zoom in and out. We

00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:21.690
can pan around. We can slice and dice the
data. Again, this is another good example

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:26.770
of--SVG is on the left doing what it does
well. HTML on the right directly embedded

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:37.080
in the page. This is in Safari. And I'll mention--I'm
going to talk a little bit later and more

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.899
in the technical talk in the afternoon, but
SVG web also helps the native browsers actually

00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:46.000
by letting you drop SVG in the normal HTML.
It doesnÃ­t just help IE, it also helps

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.700
you put in the normal HTML. And actually patches
over a couple of bugs too. So it helps the

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:56.250
native stuff too. So these are also using
SVG web. And then here we are in IE, we can

00:28:56.250 --> 00:29:08.350
still zoom in., we can still slice and dice.
And now this developer can deploy his work

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:14.549
and know it's going to reach folks. I like
this one. I'm a horrible space geek, don't

00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:20.919
get me started. I'll talk your ear off. Luther
Hoffman put this together. It uses the Google

00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:25.960
Maps API to figure out your latitude and longitude,
and then it generates--we're turning off the

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.399
lights like we're outside. It generates a
star map. These are the stars that we would

00:29:29.399 --> 00:29:38.970
see right above us based on where we are,
and that is generated with SVG. Again, real

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:44.049
work, getting real stuff done, and this is
running on IE but you almost don't even notice.

00:29:44.049 --> 00:29:47.679
It just works. The user doesnÃ­t really
care what the technology is, it just works

00:29:47.679 --> 00:30:02.130
now. So here's a couple of demos.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:10.669
I spoke a little bit about how JavaScript
is tricked. One of the cool things about the

00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:16.450
toolkit is JavaScript that runs in the page
thinks that there's native SVG support. So

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:23.970
you get things like get on it by ID, creating
an element. And so, one of the slight nuances

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:29.760
when working with SVG is you have to kind
of give the name space. So you create an element.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.299
And we actually--we plugged this global variable
"svgns" into the page, because almost everyone

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:41.690
defines that anyway. So that can make it easier
for people to just start using this. Things

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:49.230
like style work. So you can grab your circle
from the page. Again, treat it like you do

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:55.980
HTML, ".style.fill" just works. We support
a huge amount of the "DOM". This--I'm just

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.880
giving you some small representative samples.
You'd be bored if I went through, you know,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:08.360
first child, last child, child node. So this
is a few of the--of the methods and, of course,

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.990
event listeners, and including when you're
on IE, when you're dealing with SVG, you can

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:18.330
use "addEventListener". So the end-result
of this is things just work for the programmer.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:24.380
And I--I'm not going to go super deep into
how this is achieved. I don't know if you

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:31.230
know this picture. This is a famous illustration
from the Apollo-Soyuz "Peace in Space." I

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:38.570
think 1976, the peace between the superpowers.
Under the covers in SVG web, I like to say

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:41.789
"Do you want the blue pill or the red pill?"
I don't remember which is which. The blue

00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:46.760
pill is that it just works, you feel like
you got SVG, you have to do some slight finagling

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:54.179
to accommodate SVG web, but it's pretty minor.
The red pill is--we use Flash to do the rendering

00:31:54.179 --> 00:32:00.820
not--you know, we do it for purely pragmatic
reasons. I'd like to say I'm a pragmatic person

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:05.480
following ideological goals. We do it because
it's going to be installed where we need it

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.429
on the IE instances. And then we use a technology
called Microsoft Behaviors, which are very

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:14.649
cool. I've long been a fan of them. They've
been around for a long time. They essentially

00:32:14.649 --> 00:32:20.110
allow you to extend the layout engine of IE
and do some very nifty stuff. And if you're

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.240
into such things, pull me aside. We've installed
some pretty long standing issues with Microsoft

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.669
behaviors to make them much more robust. So
kind of got some--if you're in to JavaScript

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:33.610
hacking, there are some fun--some fun solutions
we've found. But the end-result is that these

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:40.159
two things come together and you get the illusion
of native SVG, including like ".style" for

00:32:40.159 --> 00:32:43.240
example, which looks like magic headers and
setters. And I'll touch a little bit more

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:50.700
on this in the tech talk in the afternoon.
I want to briefly talk about performance.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:59.710
SVG web is--it's not a get-out-of-jail free
card for IE. We--it would be great to have

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:08.049
SVG in IE9. The--the library will always be
slower than native support, by definition

00:33:08.049 --> 00:33:12.539
as a JavaScript library. And we've made some
amazing progress where we can power some really

00:33:12.539 --> 00:33:16.059
cool things, but we'll always hit an upper
ceiling. We're just a JavaScript toolkit.

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:21.789
So we can help carry the ball for a little
bit, but the native implementations will always

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:26.779
be vastly faster. And this is only going to
enable users to interact with SVG content,

00:33:26.779 --> 00:33:35.039
but it will not match the performance of a
native implementation. So--let me show you

00:33:35.039 --> 00:33:45.620
some more demos. [PAUSE] Oh, you just saw
the more demos. I did those in the wrong order.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:52.350
And I also wanted to point out Michael Noitz
[PH], who is our--the demographic one and

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.990
the map example. He's going to be going deeper
into the work he's doing. He's been a great

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:04.360
member of the community, tomorrow in the other
room, Maxwell Tech Talk. I want to just briefly

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.520
touch on how a developer works with this.
And if you're interested in this, come to

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:12.540
the Tech Talk. I'm going to be essentially
taking you through all the steps to get going

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:18.230
with SVG web. But you've got two ways to embed
into the page. You can use the object tag,

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:23.470
which will also work on IE. We have that working
on IE. And you just say, "This is SVG." And

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:29.310
then you set data equal to "Here's what I
actually want to show." Or you can directly

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.929
embed into the page. Now, we do something
that's interesting. Let me--let me take you

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:41.109
through this page. This is an HTML5 page.
That's the HTML5 doc type at the top. HTML5

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:45.599
gives you two ways to embed XML-like data.
The first one is you actually can put it into

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:52.190
a script tag and set to mime-type. The second
one is SVG becomes a native tag. You just

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:58.240
say "SVG" and you drop it in. We currently
support the first one for a variety of reasons

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:02.900
in terms of reliability. And that's what you're
seeing here. We will eventually like to support

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:07.560
the second version, but there are some tricky
engineering issues. But the nice thing about

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:14.130
this version is you can drop pure unadulterated
SVG right into a normal HTML page. And so

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.900
right here, we see that right there. You see
a rectangle. I'm sure everyone here knows.

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.880
You've seen this kind of things, setting where
it is, setting its fill. You know what I love?

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:27.500
I didn't put it in this. But if I put "rx"
and "ry", that rounds the corners. And I like

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.690
to say "rounded rectangles, I love." In 2009,
we're still waiting for rounded rectangles.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:41.740
Well, there you go. You got some rounded rectangles
there, didn't have to break a sweat. So I'd

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:46.140
like to invite up Brion Vibber, who is doing
some really cool work at Wikipedia. I'm going

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.079
to show a demo of some of the stuff we've
been doing with him after he comes up. But

00:35:50.079 --> 00:35:54.099
Brion is the CTO of Wikimedia. It is a real
pleasure to have him here. It's a really big

00:35:54.099 --> 00:35:57.849
booster of SVG.

00:35:57.849 --> 00:36:05.380
&gt;&gt; VIBBER: Hi there, everybody. So you probably
heard of Wikipedia before. It's, you know,

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:11.190
people do use it on the Internet. It's a pretty
cool site, as I hope you all think. If you

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:19.579
don't, then--well, that's very sad. But anyway,
we basically do three main things at Wikipedia

00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:27.160
and our other sites of Wikimedia foundation,
which is, first, to build educational and

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:33.050
reference materials on the web. Second, to
make those freely available under open-content

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:40.339
licenses, and third, to build them collaboratively
on that wacky Internet, which is really the

00:36:40.339 --> 00:36:45.740
most important part where SVG comes into play.
We've been using SVG very heavily on Wikipedia

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:52.720
and Wikimedia comments for the last few years,
because it gives us a standard format for

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:58.240
graphics, which can be edited by multiple
people over time with no, you know, lousiness

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:04.690
or having to start over or having to find
a, you know, very expensive tool such as Adobe

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:10.240
Illustrator. There are free offering tools
that are cross-platformed for SVG. And that

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:18.820
has enabled people to create all kinds of
maps, graphics, icons, diagrams, charts, a

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.910
huge portion of the graphics that you see
on Wikipedia are on the back-end built with

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:28.930
SVG. But, traditionally, most of that action
for us has been on the desktop side, because

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:34.910
the browser support just wasn't quite there.
In the last couple of years, we've seen SVG

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:40.180
support come pretty well up to snuff on every
browser except IE. And so, I'm keeping my

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:44.770
fingers crossed for IE9. But we've had, you
know, kind of a big gap where something like

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:51.990
two-thirds, 70% of our viewers just would
not be able to use native SVG in a browser,

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:56.950
which has meant that we haven't been able
to do anything dynamic. We basically have

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:03.630
static images that sit there in your browser.
You know, we actually restorize them in order

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:10.570
to make them most widely available. But there
are so many amazing things that SVG promises

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:15.250
when you actually put it right in the browser.
You can create interactive tools, such as

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:21.000
the maps that Brad was showing earlier, which
would be hugely valuable for a site like Wikipedia,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.980
building an interactive tool where you can
really explore, you know, the data that exists.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:33.460
Being able to, you know, switch in multiple
versions, different data sets. You can create

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:41.079
a far more compelling educational experience
than, you know, any static image you can create.

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:47.260
Plus, of course, our other goal is that we're
building things on the Internet interactively

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:53.829
collaboratively with multiple people. And
any time that we require people to download

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:58.970
a program to their computer, that is a barrier.
Even if it's available for every operating

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:03.930
system, it is a barrier to entry and it makes
it harder to use. If we can put it in the

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:10.290
browser, bam, suddenly, it's a billion times
easier. We can do, you know, native editing,

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:15.030
you know, where you're moving things around
right there in your browser. We can enable

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:21.280
localization, and support of multiple languages
has always been one of our, you know, most

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:27.890
important things. Wikipedia is available in
200 something languages a lot. I always forget

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:35.000
the number, because it's just too big. But,
you know, being able to create a chart once

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.680
and then fill in all those localized strings,
all those localized names make that available

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:46.619
natively for every language, wow. I mean we
really, really want to do that, but we've

00:39:46.619 --> 00:39:51.270
never been able to do it because, you know,
it's just not going to be available for 70%

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:57.280
of our users. With SVG web, suddenly that
gap is actually going to be filled. And until

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.440
we have a real native support in IE, we have
something that's almost as good. And that's

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.790
going to enable us to really make the SVG
experience as it were insanely better. So

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.630
I'm really happy about that.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:22.200
&gt;&gt; NEUBERG: Thank you so much, Brion. It's
cool. It's really, really fun to be working

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.040
with Wikipedia, itÃ­s like, Ã¬Oh, Mark
from Wikipedia,Ã® itÃ­s like; I'm a Wiki

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:32.710
geek, so itÃ­s like the Mecca of Wikis.
I want to show you some of the work weÃ­ve

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:37.359
been doing with Wikipedia. One of the things
most people don't know is that they had this

00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:43.099
amazing resource called the Wikipedia Comments.
Every image, video, SVG file, ends up on the

00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:47.349
comments there, itÃ­s free called, sure,
they're creative comments licensed, and you

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:52.530
can work with them. I want to show you a prototype
that weÃ­ve been building with them. That

00:40:52.530 --> 00:41:00.490
allows you to not just sort of see the SVG
image on the comments. Here we are, seeing

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:07.319
the Wikimedia Comments logo, but you can actually
begin to interact with it, and take advantage

00:41:07.319 --> 00:41:22.069
of the scaleable nature. So, we can pan around,
zoom in and out. We get Google map style controls

00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:38.400
and the cool thing is we come over to IE and
there we go. So, youÃ­ll be seeing more

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.250
of this, you know, we were work in the QA
and move this forward but expect to see this

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.890
at some point in the Wikimedia comments, itÃ­s
a prototype right now. And itÃ­s just a

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:52.790
real honor; itÃ­s very exciting to be working
with you guys. And there are--Brion himself

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:57.200
is speaking this Sunday, in this room, if
you want to go deeper into the work theyÃ­re

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:04.060
doing. And theyÃ­re always looking for volunteers,
doing all sorts of very cool work around this,

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:09.680
definitely see his talk. And I want to invite
one more person up on stage, Rick Masters

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:16.380
is one of the leads of SVG web, he literally,
he saved my butt on this project. The stuff

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.359
that he's done is amazing, I remember, you
know, we had originally, we were just going

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:26.010
to hit, much of SVG 1.1 and there were a lot
of things we couldnÃ­t hit. I remember I

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:30.790
woke up one Monday morning and it was like,
Ã¬Oh, hey, I did SVG fonts over the weekend.Ã®

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:34.760
You know, and then IÃ­ll show up, Ã¬Oh,
hey, I just checked in a partial Smile implementation.Ã®

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:39.390
So, all sorts of cool stuff and I--heÃ­s
actually the senior architect at F5 networks

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:46.599
and I want to invite him up on stage to show
us some quick demos of--some other cool SVG

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:48.000
web stuff.
[PAUSE]

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.820
Okay. Let me plug-in this now, okay.
