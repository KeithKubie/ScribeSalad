00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:02.784
- [Voiceover] In 1492,
Christopher Columbus

00:00:02.784 --> 00:00:05.462
sailed the ocean blue and
he discovered America,

00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:08.343
discovered the world was, in fact, round,

00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:11.499
and he's a hero and
that's why we get the day

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.088
off from work and school

00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:16.112
and get to celebrate him every October.

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:19.019
So, you've probably heard
this story maybe once or twice

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.430
but you've probably also
seen competing visions

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.052
of Christopher Columbus and his legacy.

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.432
Some that aren't so favorable.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:31.778
In this video series, I will
clear up misconceptions.

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:35.861
For example, Christopher
Columbus did not discover America

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:39.344
and he didn't actually discover
that the world was round.

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:43.767
People already knew that in
about 600 A.D. with Aristotle,

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.731
but hopefully with these
facts and explanations

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:49.961
of the implications of Christopher
Columbus and his voyage

00:00:49.961 --> 00:00:53.009
that you, as the viewer
and budding historian,

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.023
can decide for yourself if you think

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:58.070
that Christopher Columbus was a hero,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.273
so we're gonna change
this into a question.

00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:05.646
Christopher Columbus's voyage
started way before 1492

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:08.612
when he started petitioning
different European governments

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:10.992
for funding for his trip.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:15.137
So, Christopher Columbus was
actually an Italian navigator

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:19.607
and he asked the Portuguese
and then he asked the Spanish

00:01:19.607 --> 00:01:23.359
and then, when King Ferdinand
and Queen Isabella of Spain

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.577
wouldn't give him the money originally,

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:27.204
he even threatened to go to France

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:29.313
and ask for money from them,

00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:31.972
but eventually he ended
up doing the voyage

00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:33.138
under the Spanish crown

00:01:33.138 --> 00:01:37.305
and he got together a crew of
about 150 men in three ships.

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:40.348
You probably know the names of those.

00:01:40.348 --> 00:01:44.534
They were the Nina,
Pinta, and Santa Maria.

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:45.544
There they are.

00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:46.546
They don't look very high tech,

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:49.348
but they did have a lot of
help from new technology

00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:51.153
in Europe making these brand new ships

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:53.514
and they were a little bit nicer

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.420
than they look in these
drawings (chuckles).

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.518
Christopher Columbus set out for

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:00.741
the first voyage ever across the Atlantic.

00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.185
So, why was he going across the Atlantic?

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:05.339
This has to do with a lot of motivations

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:07.289
that you can read more about in the

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.741
Khan Academy article,
Motivations for Conquest,

00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:13.160
but I'll give you a general overview here.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.070
The little acronym that
I like to go with is

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.820
God, Gold, and Glory.

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:21.778
So, these were some of Christopher

00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:23.777
Columbus's main motivations

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:26.777
and I would say it was
mostly about gold and glory.

00:02:26.777 --> 00:02:29.069
Christopher Columbus
aimed to find a new route

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.695
to the West Indies.

00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:33.479
So, the West Indies were
somewhere, you know, over here,

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.182
really, if you're looking at this map

00:02:35.182 --> 00:02:38.031
and Europeans had to travel by land

00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:40.401
all the way down through the Middle East

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:41.910
to the West Indies over here.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.466
Along that route, there
were many middlemen

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:47.175
that imposed taxes and
it was just a really,

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:49.019
really hard route to navigate

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.945
so Christopher Columbus
wanted to find a way

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:55.362
that he could go west to get to the east.

00:02:57.187 --> 00:02:59.221
Christopher Columbus knew
the world was round, right.

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:01.518
He wanted to go like that,

00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:03.385
but he was the first person
to prove that it was.

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:06.779
Columbus and his men set out in 1492

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.415
and they have enough food
and water to last them a year

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:12.448
so this was an unprecedented voyage.

00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:14.780
Everyone was really excited

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.247
and curious about what they would find

00:03:16.247 --> 00:03:19.254
and it ended up taking them five weeks

00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:20.757
so it was a five week voyage

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.176
and it certainly wasn't pretty.

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:26.916
There were many times where
the ship men lost morale

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.209
and Columbus himself had doubts

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.944
so he even made this promise
to the people on the ship.

00:03:32.944 --> 00:03:34.405
He said, "The first person to see land

00:03:34.405 --> 00:03:36.238
will get a silk coat,"

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.205
and so this was a way
that he increased morale

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:41.175
when things were looking really rough,

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:42.723
but he was a very impressive navigator

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:46.214
and used the stars and
lots of really impressive

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:50.363
scientific measurement
to arrive in the Bahamas.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.069
The Bahamas are part of an island group

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.733
called the West Indies and why are

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:54.792
they called the West Indies?

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.230
Because Christopher Columbus thought

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.222
that he had arrived in the Indies

00:03:58.222 --> 00:04:01.229
which are an island
group in Southeast Asia.

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.155
So, geographers then
named the West Indies west

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:07.081
as to distinguish them from the island

00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:09.273
that Christopher Columbus
thought that he had,

00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:10.369
in fact, arrived on.

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:11.876
I know, kind of funny to think about now

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.473
because they are just so far away,

00:04:14.473 --> 00:04:16.044
but Christopher Columbus was determined

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:19.405
that he had, in fact,
arrived in the East Indies

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:22.217
so that's where the
name Indians came from.

00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:24.252
The native people were not related to

00:04:24.252 --> 00:04:27.398
or descendents from Indians in any way.

00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:29.313
Christopher Columbus was just determined

00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:31.544
that China was just a
little bit north of them

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:34.758
and that they had successfully
found this new trade route.

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:37.962
To give you a sense of where
Christopher Columbus ended up,

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:39.692
you can check out this map.

00:04:39.692 --> 00:04:43.818
So, he came from Spain and first
landed here in the Bahamas.

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:46.298
So he named it San Salvador,

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:48.794
that was the first place that they stopped

00:04:48.794 --> 00:04:52.961
and in San Salvador, they
encountered the Taíno people

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:58.181
so the Taínos were, historically,
a very friendly people.

00:04:58.181 --> 00:05:01.252
They were very welcoming to
Christopher Columbus and his men

00:05:01.252 --> 00:05:03.626
and Christopher Columbus
actually wrote this all down

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:06.858
in his journal, so a lot of
the records that historians

00:05:06.858 --> 00:05:09.257
reference and argue a fair amount about

00:05:09.257 --> 00:05:12.078
come from both Columbus's journal

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.598
and his probanzas de merito.

00:05:14.598 --> 00:05:17.848
These were literally
proof of merit in English

00:05:17.848 --> 00:05:20.002
and so Christopher
Columbus had to write back

00:05:20.002 --> 00:05:23.334
to the Spanish crown to make
sure that he was actually

00:05:23.334 --> 00:05:25.772
making progress on his mission,

00:05:25.772 --> 00:05:28.297
that he was, in fact,
finding a new trade route

00:05:28.297 --> 00:05:32.620
and increasing capital
for the Spanish crown

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.027
or else they would stop funding him

00:05:34.027 --> 00:05:35.710
so there's a lot written about his voyage

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.677
between his journal and between
these official documents

00:05:38.677 --> 00:05:40.527
and within those documents,

00:05:40.527 --> 00:05:43.332
you can see that Christopher Columbus

00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:45.080
and his people had intentions

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.859
of conquering and
colonizing the Taíno people.

00:05:48.859 --> 00:05:52.467
Christopher Columbus writes,
"They were very well built

00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:54.646
with very handsome bodies
and very good faces.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.125
They do not carry arms or know them.

00:05:57.125 --> 00:05:58.750
They should be good servants."

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.024
Later on, he writes about the Taíno people

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.708
who were historically jewelry traders

00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:07.202
and helped them a lot with
finding different resources

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:09.617
and gold and silver.

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:14.337
He writes, "I could conquer
the whole of them with 50 men."

00:06:14.337 --> 00:06:16.369
These sorts of quotes
from Columbus's journal

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:19.859
provide evidence to
historians that Columbus's

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:22.152
violence against the Taíno people

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:24.633
was premeditated and planned.

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:26.951
So, this photo down here
depicts the Taíno people

00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:28.868
welcoming the Spaniards

00:06:33.443 --> 00:06:34.697
and this image depicts

00:06:34.697 --> 00:06:36.276
the traditional Taíno culture.

00:06:36.276 --> 00:06:37.907
You can see the jewelry,

00:06:37.907 --> 00:06:40.229
which Christopher Columbus
writes extensively about,

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.456
lots of gold jewelry, he
found it very beautiful.

00:06:43.456 --> 00:06:45.345
He was met by these friendly people,

00:06:45.345 --> 00:06:48.153
but he did have intentions
of colonizing them

00:06:48.153 --> 00:06:52.320
and turning them into servants
and slaves which he then did.

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:55.020
So when he returned to Spain,

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.353
25 Taínos got on the ship with him back,

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:02.416
but only seven survived and
so this began the practice

00:07:02.416 --> 00:07:05.341
of forcing the Taínos into servitude

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:09.016
which would increase over
the next 10 to 15 years

00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:10.893
during which Christopher
Columbus would come back

00:07:10.893 --> 00:07:13.753
and forth to the Caribbean.

00:07:13.753 --> 00:07:17.243
Ultimately Christopher
Columbus made four voyages,

00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:20.434
so the first one was in 1492, up here,

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:23.279
but then there were three more voyages

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:25.392
over the next couple years

00:07:25.392 --> 00:07:27.911
and over the course of
these three voyages,

00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:32.078
the Taíno people were decimated
by violence and disease.

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:36.197
So, between the forced servitude

00:07:36.197 --> 00:07:40.465
and the mutilation that the
colonizers would practice,

00:07:40.465 --> 00:07:44.815
they would actually cut off
the Taínos limbs or hands

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:46.690
if they refused to do work for them,

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.244
disease really was what killed

00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:52.230
the most Native Americans at the time.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.811
On the ships, the colonizers
would bring with them,

00:07:54.811 --> 00:07:57.249
yes, weapons, but most notably microbes

00:07:57.249 --> 00:08:02.230
that the Taíno people were not
accustomed to fighting off.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.929
When they would come into
contact with these new diseases,

00:08:04.929 --> 00:08:09.297
the Native Americans
were killed in the masses

00:08:09.297 --> 00:08:11.657
so over the course of
Christopher Columbus's

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.828
colonization of the Caribbean,
he ended up going to,

00:08:13.828 --> 00:08:18.298
I'll scroll up and show you
a little bit more on the map,

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:19.949
he ended up going to San Salvador,

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:21.774
that was the first stop,

00:08:21.774 --> 00:08:24.353
then to Cuba and then to Española,

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.992
which is the modern day
Dominican Republic and Haiti

00:08:26.992 --> 00:08:29.920
and here, in all these places,
Christopher Columbus's men

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.821
set up different colonies and slowly,

00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:35.690
as Christopher Columbus kind of went back

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.733
and forth to Spain,

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:40.021
the colonies rebelled against him.

00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:44.369
By his third voyage, Columbus
ultimately gets removed

00:08:44.369 --> 00:08:46.621
completely from this colonization project

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:48.893
because he proved such an awful leader

00:08:48.893 --> 00:08:53.308
and he really had violent
tendencies toward the Taíno people

00:08:53.308 --> 00:08:55.499
so in the next video I'll
talk a little bit more

00:08:55.499 --> 00:08:59.055
about the implications of the
contact with the new world

00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:01.162
and about how Christopher
Columbus has become

00:09:01.162 --> 00:09:03.972
such a controversial
figure in American memory

00:09:03.972 --> 00:09:05.804
and American celebration.
