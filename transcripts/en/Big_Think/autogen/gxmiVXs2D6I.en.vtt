with imaging now we can see the
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.230
with imaging now we can see the
accumulation of certain toxic proteins

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
accumulation of certain toxic proteins
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.080
accumulation of certain toxic proteins
in people's brains there's general

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
in people's brains there's general
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380
in people's brains there's general
consensus that there are a number of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
consensus that there are a number of
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439
consensus that there are a number of
these that are implicated in the disease

synuclein and others right I would say
those are the three primary culprits now

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720
those are the three primary culprits now
 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.880
those are the three primary culprits now
there are people that argue that it's

there are people that argue that it's
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.680
there are people that argue that it's
all microbiome based and there are

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
all microbiome based and there are
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.790
all microbiome based and there are
people that argue that it's a hundred

a conclusive way I that's one of the
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.350
a conclusive way I that's one of the
main reasons why I focus on this

main reasons why I focus on this
 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.600
main reasons why I focus on this
ecosystem and this and this village that

it takes to solve these problems I don't
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.579
it takes to solve these problems I don't
think this is a silver bullet disease I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
think this is a silver bullet disease I
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.020
think this is a silver bullet disease I
think this is a this is a finding out

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
think this is a this is a finding out
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.440
think this is a this is a finding out
and unveiling and uncovering the the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
and unveiling and uncovering the the
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.140
and unveiling and uncovering the the
different pieces that define it and and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
different pieces that define it and and
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510
different pieces that define it and and
you know just very very recently we

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
you know just very very recently we
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310
you know just very very recently we
could an image for a maeda or beta

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
could an image for a maeda or beta
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530
could an image for a maeda or beta
amyloid so there was no way to know that

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
amyloid so there was no way to know that
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.140
amyloid so there was no way to know that
very recently we couldn't there are new

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
very recently we couldn't there are new
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.969
very recently we couldn't there are new
serum based biomarkers that are coming

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
serum based biomarkers that are coming
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130
serum based biomarkers that are coming
along to measure tau levels and that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
along to measure tau levels and that
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.110
along to measure tau levels and that
that are really really interesting um

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120
that are really really interesting um
 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.600
that are really really interesting um
all of this gives us insight into the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610
all of this gives us insight into the
 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039
all of this gives us insight into the
accumulation and the timing of the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
accumulation and the timing of the
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.149
accumulation and the timing of the
accumulation of these toxic proteins so

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159
accumulation of these toxic proteins so
 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.760
accumulation of these toxic proteins so
so I don't know you know the the one to

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
so I don't know you know the the one to
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130
so I don't know you know the the one to
three biological assessment this is the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
three biological assessment this is the
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.219
three biological assessment this is the
analogy that I always use imagine you go

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
analogy that I always use imagine you go
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.039
analogy that I always use imagine you go
into a sports bar there's a low guide

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
into a sports bar there's a low guide
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.530
into a sports bar there's a low guide
with glasses and he walks up to the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
with glasses and he walks up to the
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.359
with glasses and he walks up to the
biggest guy in that place and the guys

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
biggest guy in that place and the guys
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.890
biggest guy in that place and the guys
just all steroid it up and he's got

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900
just all steroid it up and he's got
 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.270
just all steroid it up and he's got
veins popping out of his neck and he

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
veins popping out of his neck and he
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.770
veins popping out of his neck and he
walks up to the guy and he doesn't know

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
walks up to the guy and he doesn't know
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.350
walks up to the guy and he doesn't know
him he just pokes him right in the chest

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360
him he just pokes him right in the chest
 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.429
him he just pokes him right in the chest
there's going to be a cascade of events

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
there's going to be a cascade of events
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010
there's going to be a cascade of events
caused by that poke maybe he'll get his

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
caused by that poke maybe he'll get his
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.330
caused by that poke maybe he'll get his
jaw broken maybe you'll have some ribs

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
jaw broken maybe you'll have some ribs
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.770
jaw broken maybe you'll have some ribs
cracked maybe he'll be thrown out of a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
cracked maybe he'll be thrown out of a
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.300
cracked maybe he'll be thrown out of a
window maybe the cops will come maybe

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
window maybe the cops will come maybe
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.529
window maybe the cops will come maybe
they'll have to write up a police report

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
they'll have to write up a police report
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.510
they'll have to write up a police report
maybe they'll have to go to to a court

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
maybe they'll have to go to to a court
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.339
maybe they'll have to go to to a court
case after that all these things could

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349
case after that all these things could
 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.400
case after that all these things could
happen now depending on where you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410
happen now depending on where you
 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.000
happen now depending on where you
that fight what started it you would

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010
that fight what started it you would
 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.060
that fight what started it you would
have no idea and all of your assessments

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070
have no idea and all of your assessments
 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.770
have no idea and all of your assessments
all your assumptions would be wrong if

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
all your assumptions would be wrong if
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.800
all your assumptions would be wrong if
you didn't see that guy unprovoked poke

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810
you didn't see that guy unprovoked poke
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.620
you didn't see that guy unprovoked poke
that person in the chest so where is the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630
that person in the chest so where is the
 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.050
that person in the chest so where is the
poke with Alzheimer's there's a lot of

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060
poke with Alzheimer's there's a lot of
 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.330
poke with Alzheimer's there's a lot of
debate around that but where that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340
debate around that but where that
 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.790
debate around that but where that
cascade of events occurs there's

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800
cascade of events occurs there's
 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.050
cascade of events occurs there's
becoming more clarity around that so I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
becoming more clarity around that so I
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.090
becoming more clarity around that so I
hope that's helpful if you look at it

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100
hope that's helpful if you look at it
 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.990
hope that's helpful if you look at it
from a disease progression state these

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000
from a disease progression state these
 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.970
from a disease progression state these
toxic proteins are building up in your

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
toxic proteins are building up in your
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.150
toxic proteins are building up in your
brain 10 15 20 years before you have any

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160
brain 10 15 20 years before you have any
 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.480
brain 10 15 20 years before you have any
symptoms so this is something that is is

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490
symptoms so this is something that is is
 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.950
symptoms so this is something that is is
laying there in a lot of us and just

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960
laying there in a lot of us and just
 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.430
laying there in a lot of us and just
waiting for its chance to jump up and so

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
waiting for its chance to jump up and so
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.070
waiting for its chance to jump up and so
so knowing that and having seen that in

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080
so knowing that and having seen that in
 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.650
so knowing that and having seen that in
in lots and lots of people the general

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660
in lots and lots of people the general
 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.720
in lots and lots of people the general
the general thought is that you have the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
the general thought is that you have the
 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.090
the general thought is that you have the
beta amyloid levels rising thereafter

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100
beta amyloid levels rising thereafter
 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.000
beta amyloid levels rising thereafter
you have the Tau levels rising

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010
you have the Tau levels rising
 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.130
you have the Tau levels rising
thereafter and and in consequence and in

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140
thereafter and and in consequence and in
 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.660
thereafter and and in consequence and in
concert with the tau level rising

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670
concert with the tau level rising
 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.120
concert with the tau level rising
there's some correlation with with the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130
there's some correlation with with the
 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.940
there's some correlation with with the
actual cognitive impairment now that

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950
actual cognitive impairment now that
 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.150
actual cognitive impairment now that
doesn't mean that that's the biology of

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
doesn't mean that that's the biology of
 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.590
doesn't mean that that's the biology of
Alzheimer's conclusively that means that

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600
Alzheimer's conclusively that means that
 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.270
Alzheimer's conclusively that means that
this is an evolving story and this ties

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280
this is an evolving story and this ties
 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.100
this is an evolving story and this ties
back into this village and ecosystem the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110
back into this village and ecosystem the
 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.270
back into this village and ecosystem the
reason I'm so excited is because we

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280
reason I'm so excited is because we
 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.260
reason I'm so excited is because we
actually have answers to some of these

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270
actually have answers to some of these
 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.150
actually have answers to some of these
questions now so at least we know that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160
questions now so at least we know that
 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.370
questions now so at least we know that
these are you know toxic or misfolded or

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380
these are you know toxic or misfolded or
 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.729
these are you know toxic or misfolded or
or in some way non non not advantageous
