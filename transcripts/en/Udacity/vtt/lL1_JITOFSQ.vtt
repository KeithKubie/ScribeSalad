Critics of Spearman's theory of single intelligence didn't think that it did

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:09.750
justice to the complexity of intelligence. Although the domains that were

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.325
tested were moderately to highly correlated with each other, critics didn't

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:18.433
think that these domains accurately showed all of intelligence. In other words,

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.880
they questioned the validity of this theory.
