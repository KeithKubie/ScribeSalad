00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.360
Now the only problem with this code is that

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.910
pointer events may be delivering multiple pointers with different

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.970
pointer ID's at the same time. For example, if

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.310
I'm using two fingers on my touch interface, you can

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.770
tell it's getting a little bit confused about where

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.170
to draw. So to fix this, I actually differentiate

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.860
by pointer ID and I keep an array of

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.550
points for each pointer ID. And then I use that

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.020
to mask where I'm adding points to. And this version you

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.640
can tell works much better with multiple pointers at the same time.
