00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.560
So how can we tell if a game
is actually engaging?

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.200
Well, we can usually look
at how popular the game is

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.670
by finding out if the game is downloaded
a lot and if the reviews are good.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.680
For example, here we can see
game apps in Amazon Appstore.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.920
And we can see the number of reviews and
the star rating from one to five stars.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.190
And this gives us a good idea
of how engaging our game is.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.970
If the game has a rating close to
five stars, it's probably pretty fun.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.410
And if it's lower, then maybe there's
something the users don't like about it.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.270
We can also look at how long and
how often players use our game, and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.060
measure engagement.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.760
Here are some terms we
used to measure it.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.310
Session count, session length,
and retention.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.110
Session count is the number
of times an app is launched.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.690
So any time a player opens the app,
whether that's once a week or

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.290
ten times a day,
the session count goes up.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.210
And if we look at the average session
counts for a player over a day.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.690
We can get a pretty good idea
of how addicting our game is.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.840
But some games are designed for
longer sessions instead of multiple

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.240
short sessions, so
the session length is also important.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.325
Session length is the amount of
time that the app is in use for

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.295
a particular session.

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:23.745
So whether that's a few minutes or
going on and on to a length of hours.

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:28.495
And again for this to be a useful metric
we would usually look at the average,

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:33.275
the average person length across users
to see how long a typical user plays

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:34.940
once they open the app.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.140
And we also look at retention.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
Which is a measure of how many
users continue to play your game

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.270
as time goes on.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.308
Usually game retention is measured a day
after your game is first launched and

00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:51.680
downloaded, a week after, and
the month after just to see

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.530
how many of your original
players you keep over time.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.370
Say you want to measure retention
over week for the game Fruit Ninja.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.490
That means you want to see how many
people who start at the beginning

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.420
of the week are still around
at the end of the week.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.770
During the week some of these early
users will leave Fruit Ninja.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.330
And new ones will join.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.410
But we don't want to take
into account the new ones.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.790
We just want to see who started
at the beginning of the week and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.300
stayed throughout the whole week.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.720
To calculate this, you need to look
at the users at the end of the week

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.550
minus any of the newcomers who
joined in the middle of the week,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.189
all divided by the number of users that
started at the beginning of the week.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.990
Then multiply all this by
100 to get a percentage and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.000
this is going to be your retention for
the week.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.390
So let's look at some numbers for
Fruit Ninja.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.970
Let's say we had 400 people download
the game at the start of the week and

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.780
there's 700 total by
the end of the week.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.150
That looks pretty good.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.670
But we also know that 500
of these people are new.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.720
They joined in the middle
of the week and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.180
they are part of our 400
original starting players.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.930
So let's calculate the retention.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.230
First we have 700 from
the end of the week,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.040
minus the 500 new players
that joined mid-week.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.730
So we are only accounting for our
original 400 to see who stuck around.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.000
All divided by our 400 original players.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.960
Then times 100 to get a percentage.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.240
This is going to be 200 over 400 or
half times 100%

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.970
which is going to give us 50% retention
over this week, which is pretty good.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.800
Ideally we'd want 100% retention,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.410
which means everyone who downloads your
game keeps playing it and never quits.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.380
But no game has perfect retention and

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.160
even really great games have around 50%
retention after just the first day.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.380
That means that half the players leave
during the first 24 hours of playing.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.610
This seems like a lot of people leaving,
but it's considered pretty good or

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.090
a tension especially for a game that as
good at getting new players over time.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.890
It won't matter that a lot
of older ones leave.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.820
Lots of developers use a 40,
20, ten rule as a guideline for

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.220
good retention over a day a week and
a month.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.232
So after a game is downloaded by a bunch
of people we have 100% of people.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.470
Forty percent of those users
stick around after the first day.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.690
Twenty percent of those stay for
a week and only ten percent stay for

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.150
a whole month and even longer usually.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.450
If you have retention at these
time points a day, a week or

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.150
a month that's higher that's great.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.260
If it's any lower that's
considered bad retention
