MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everybody,
and everybody local and on

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.970
live stream.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.800
I want to welcome Kara
Richardson Whitely here.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.750
Her work as a plus
size adventurer

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.160
has been featured
in "New York Times,"

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.500
"Self," "Backpacker,"
"Weight Watchers," "Redbook,"

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.584
and also on Oprah's "Life Class"
and "Good Morning America."

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:25.750
We are very happy that she
was able to take time out

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.500
of her schedule to
come visit us at Google

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.860
and share her story with us.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.485
Thank you.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:31.640
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: Great.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.140
Thanks.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.206
So, hi, everybody.

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:40.940
I just want to get the
lay of the land here.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.140
How many of you have
climbed Kilimanjaro?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.157
Anybody?

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:46.240
OK, so nobody in the room.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.470
Does anybody here want
to climb Kilimanjaro?

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.786
OK, one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:53.160
Does anybody want
to be convinced

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250
not to climb Kilimanjaro?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.920
OK.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.740
Three or four.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.640
OK, got it.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.660
So I'll talk to you a
little bit about my story.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.020
I speak all over the country
about my journey up mountains

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.400
and sometimes up the scale, too.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.440
So I'll share a
little bit of both.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.256
And since there are
people in the room who

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:18.090
have the interest of
climbing Kilimanjaro,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.310
if you-- still at the end
of the presentation-- still

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.900
have that interest,
I'll go over some tips.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.991
And you can also contact
me afterwards also

00:01:25.991 --> 00:01:27.490
if you have any
follow up questions.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.820
So my journey up
Kilimanjaro began when

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.150
I was more than 360 pounds.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.094
And at that time, I could
barely hike a staircase.

00:01:41.094 --> 00:01:43.570
I couldn't even walk
around the block

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.280
without being completely out
of breath, totally uninterested

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.750
in continuing.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.520
And I started to
think to myself--

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.590
because I was about to
turn 30 years old-- that I

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.870
wasn't living life anymore.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.490
And you might think to
yourself, maybe you'll

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.810
meet somebody who's
really heavy or somebody

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.560
who struggles with weight,
and you just don't get it.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.036
Like, why did they
get so big so fast,

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:14.160
or why can they
never get it right?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.800
It's just food, right?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.630
It's not heroin or
it's not alcohol.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.750
But for me my
struggle with weight

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.900
started when I was nine years
old and my parents divorced.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.130
And my father pretty
much up and left my life.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.810
And then when I was 12,
I was sexually assaulted.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.640
So it started with these
really big, traumatic things.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.990
That's when I started
to use food for comfort.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.360
And it started with
these huge things.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.290
But then little by little,
I used food for everything.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.980
And I really, truly
sugarcoated my life

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.360
where I wasn't feeling happy.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.630
I wasn't feeling sad.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.760
I was just feeling
pretty comfortably numb.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.900
Because even when,
you know, my parents

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.680
were on the brink of
divorce, I literally

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.200
would hide in the pantry to
just drown out their screamings

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.020
by chewing food.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.870
And when I was in the midst
of being sexually assaulted,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.960
the only thing I could
think of to make it stop

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.839
and to get out of
the situation was

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:19.880
to get up and go to the
kitchen and offer the guy

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.870
something to eat.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.170
And it threw him for such a
loop that it kind of ended

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.030
right there at that moment.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.590
So in many ways food saved me.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.330
But as I was approaching my 30th
birthday-- because at the time

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.920
I thought that was getting
pretty old-- I'm now 40.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.130
I started to think, well
I'm not getting any younger,

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.670
and I have so many things that
I want to do with my life.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.330
And I knew that I really
wanted to be a hiker

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.010
girl, because even though
I wasn't active at all

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.250
and I wasn't exercising
and I wasn't really

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.550
a member of a gym or
anything like that,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.250
my life would light up.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.340
My mind would just come
into that dream phase

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.070
any time I would get one of
those adventure travel catalogs

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.670
in the mail.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.128
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:09.570
Those glossy pictures of
the Alps and Machu Picchu

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.840
and Kilimanjaro.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.047
But at that time,
I used to do what

00:04:14.047 --> 00:04:16.130
a lot of people who struggle
with their weight do.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.959
I'd say to myself,
well I'm going

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.740
to do that when I lose weight.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.710
And I would say to myself,
I'll go to the doctors

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.600
when I lose weight.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.730
I'll buy that dress or
I'll buy something fancy

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.060
to wear when I lose weight.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.490
So as I approached
this birthday,

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.250
I realized that it was time to
just get moving no matter what.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.560
And I decided that I
would just start to hike.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.310
I would start to
just be a hiker girl.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.820
And even though I'm not a
Patagonia model, of course,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.650
I could start with things
like a water bottle.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.010
I could carry a water bottle.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.350
I could take flat hikes,
because I live in New Jersey

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.640
and there's lots of those.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.490
And the more I hiked
the more I enjoyed it.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.140
My husband-- he's
actually a marathoner.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.440
He's done seven so far.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.910
So he would hike with me.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.890
And he would just
go up on the trail

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.570
and he would be far,
far ahead of me.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.350
And then he'd tap his leg
like he was calling a dog.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.930
Instead of yelling at him,
I would muster my energy

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.110
to go faster and hike harder.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.290
And suddenly I was the one who
was picking the harder trails.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.750
I was the one who was picking
more strenuous things to do.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.820
And so as I got moving
with this journey,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.000
I started to think
I need a goal.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.990
Right?

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.550
And so I picked this
particular mountain as a goal.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.606
Does anybody happen
to know where it is?

00:05:39.606 --> 00:05:40.320
No?

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.050
It's called Camel's Hump, and
it's Vermont second highest

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.900
peak, because it looks
like the back of a camel.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.280
And so anyway I chose this
mountain in particular

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.590
because when I was in college
at the University of Vermont,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.640
that's when my weight went
over the 300-pound mark.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.090
And obviously I wasn't doing
any hiking at the time.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.410
The only walking that
I did was to the bars,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.360
because they had
$0.25 draft night,

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360
and that seemed to make
a lot of financial sense

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.720
to me, and to class.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.780
And so even though
I grew up in Vermont

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.029
and I did hike Camel's Hump
during a 4th grade field trip,

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.320
because that's what they do
on field trips in Vermont--

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.730
they hike mountains.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.940
When I was in college,
my friend said, hey,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.450
it's a beautiful day--
a lot like it is today--

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:26.580
great sunshine.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.720
It's June.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.620
Let's go hike Camel's Hump

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.270
So I thought, hey, OK, sure.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.530
I'll go along with you.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.490
And 20 minutes into
this five-hour hike,

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.630
I was just completely
sucking wind.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.980
I mean, absolutely out of
shape, unable to continue.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.300
I had that feeling that many
marathoners do at mile 20

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.712
where you have lead leg, and
you can't move another inch.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.420
And so I told them
everything, like oh, I

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.500
haven't been feeling well.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.708
And I think my stomach hurts.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.450
I must have eaten
something funny.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.750
But the truth of the matter is
that I wasn't moving at all.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.380
Instead of having it been one
of those Oprah aha moments--

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.480
that moment where
everything changes-- I

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.820
went to the bottom of
the mountain that day.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.170
And I ate the two things
that were in my backpack--

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.950
a half pound bag of M&amp;Ms and a
half liter bottle of Diet Coke,

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.410
because-- I mentioned
I'm not so good at math--

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.350
so I thought they
equaled each other out.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.160
But for years and
years I lived that way,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.340
and I decided that if
I was going to hike

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.050
and I was going
to be a hiker girl

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.090
and I was going to move more, I
needed to conquer Camel's Hump.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.280
And so I hiked and I hiked.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.770
And on the eve of
my 31st birthday,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.750
I conquered Camel's Hump.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.660
And the funny
story about that is

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.600
that I trained and I trained.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.110
I trained on one of
those moving staircases--

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.380
the staircase that never ends.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.910
You have one of
those at your gym.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.510
That was like my best friend
while training for this.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.370
And I thought about
it every day--

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.660
how I'm going to go to
the top of Camel's Hump.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.800
And I decided I was going
to do a sunrise hike,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.630
because I thought that sounded
glorious and amazing and like

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.450
one of those once-in-a-lifetime
kind of hikes.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.160
So I get up to the
top of the mountain.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.270
I'm hiking by myself.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.770
And I'm, like, geez I don't
have anybody to take my picture.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.180
And so suddenly this
woman and her daughter

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.890
start walking up with a dog.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.840
I'm, like, oh, this is
such an incredible hike.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.680
How long have you been
training for this?

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.062
They're, like, we do
this every morning

00:08:26.062 --> 00:08:27.963
from the base of the mountain.

00:08:27.963 --> 00:08:31.580
So I was joining a
different kind of lifestyle.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.340
Even though it was
exciting and new for me,

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.868
this is something that
other people did every day.

00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:38.909
And so I was really kind
of joining the club when

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.440
it came to hiking.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.300
Once I conquered Camel's
Hump, well then the sky's

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.630
the limit, right?

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.010
Then I went down to the
bottom of the Grand Canyon

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.550
and thankfully back up again.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.930
Because that is 10
miles of brutal--

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.040
has anybody done the
Grand Canyon here?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.660
Yeah.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.230
It's rough.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.970
I mean, you really
have to time your rest,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.390
how much food you're eating,
how much water you can bring.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.350
It's a real endurance test.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:11.070
And then we took on Vermont's
highest peak, which is Mt.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.580
Mansfield, which to this
day is the hardest mountain

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.930
that I ever hiked,
because well, the truth

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.530
is that we ended up hiking down
the wrong side of the mountain.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.905
So thank goodness the Vermont
Brewers Fest was the same day.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.180
So as I was doing
all this hiking--

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.170
all this amazing hiking--
taking care of my body,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.560
this great thing happened.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.560
I started to lose a lot
of weight, so much weight

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.790
that I had lost
almost 100 pounds.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.160
And this very strange thing
started happening to me.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.950
Whenever I'd go-- especially
to the bathroom at work-- women

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.640
would follow me in there and
say, so what are you doing?

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.110
Why are you losing
all this weight?

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.630
Did you get the surgery?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.894
Are you on Weight Watchers?

00:09:57.894 --> 00:09:59.560
Are you doing South
Beach-- because that

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.905
was really hot at the time.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.972
They'd be really interested.

00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:06.180
And how long did it take you?

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.055
And what did you eat?

00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:08.880
And what are you
eating for breakfast?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.381
Tomorrow?

00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:11.130
And what are you going
to have for dinner?

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.380
And can I join you for lunch?

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.470
And people would turn
and look every time

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.120
I got something to eat.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.800
And that's all they cared about.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.550
And these people who never once
gave an inkling about anything

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.270
in my life wanted
to know everything

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.810
that was going in my mouth.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.360
And for someone
who had used food

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.710
for so long to kind of
cover emotions and kind

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.090
of cover myself, it was
incredibly intimidating.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.400
So I decided that I wanted
to have another big goal.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.710
But I also wanted to deflect
this attention I was getting.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:45.600
So I started to set my
sights on Kilimanjaro.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.370
Kilimanjaro is the
highest mountain

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.780
that you can hike to the
top of-- in other words,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.300
no ice axes, no ropes,
no supplemental oxygen.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.060
Have you seen "Into Thin Air?"

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:56.560
Right?

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.833
It's not that.

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:02.940
It's a long drudgery
kind of journey

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.400
where you're 5 and 1/2
days up the mountain,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.070
1 and 1/2 days down.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.940
But you can do it
on your own two feet

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.720
if you train really well.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.250
So I figured that's going
to be the huge goal that I'm

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.930
going to focus on.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:19.670
And because it's such an
iconic mountain-- I mean, even

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.420
in this room, there's five
people who really actually

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.220
do want to do this.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.010
You can really do it to raise
money for almost any charity.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.200
And so I thought since
I'm going to be doing it

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.930
in Africa that I
would do something

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.880
that would give back to Africa.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.920
And so I did a
little Google search,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.509
and I looked up
Kilimanjaro climbs,

00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:43.300
AIDS orphans-- because
that's what I really

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.390
wanted to raise money for.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.250
And lo and behold, I
found Global Alliance

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.712
for Africa, which is a
Chicago-based charity.

00:11:50.712 --> 00:11:52.420
And the thing that
they do to raise money

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.680
for their organization
is Kilimanjaro hikes.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.570
And so I signed up right away.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.040
And then any time
that those women

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.440
who asked me about my weight
asked me what I was doing,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.740
I'm, like, well I'm
training for Kilimanjaro.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.000
And here is how you can
donate to AIDS orphans.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.550
And I raised $12,000, so talk
about deflecting attention

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.000
there.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.877
So to train for
Kilimanjaro, there's

00:12:19.877 --> 00:12:21.210
a couple things you should know.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.760
One is that it is 19,343 feet.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.440
That's really high.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.080
It's in Tanzania, Africa.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.860
The keys to success are
to go [SPEAKING SWAHILI].

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.469
Does anybody know
Swahili in the room?

00:12:32.469 --> 00:12:33.510
AUDIENCE: Slowly, slowly?

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:33.960
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: Yes.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.740
Slowly, slowly.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.690
That's right.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.120
That's the key to success.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.340
And so if I was going to
sign up for a mountain,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.920
and they said, go as slow as
you possibly can, I'm, like,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.120
yes this is my kind of mountain.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.900
The other keys are drink a lot
of water-- up to five liters

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.750
a day.

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.220
That's a lot.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.840
And the other thing is
have a positive attitude.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.310
In fact, the only way that you
can tell if somebody is not

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.310
going to make it to the
top-- for those of you

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.310
who actually do want to hike
the mountain-- if you're

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.770
in your pre-climb
briefing, and somebody

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.490
is complaining about
how they hate camping

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.010
and they hate the
outdoors, they're

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:14.130
pretty much the goner by
day two-- just so you know.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.750
But otherwise you don't
know who's going to make it

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.010
and who's not.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.310
Martha Stewart
made it to the top.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.820
Ann Curry, the newscaster
for NBC, didn't.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.760
Martina Navratilova didn't.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.400
So you just don't know
by looking at someone

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.530
whether or not they're
going to be able to do it.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.950
So I like those odds.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.510
To train I focused
on three things--

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.520
strength, stamina, and spirit.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.499
Strength is pretty obvious.

00:13:45.499 --> 00:13:47.040
You're doing a lot
of hiking, but you

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.490
want to also strengthen
your quads and your back,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.600
because you're holding
a backpack for so long.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.850
You want to strengthen the
muscles around your knees

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.480
so they support your body
and all the joints that

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.460
need to get you there.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.820
Stamina.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.010
Look, I live in New Jersey.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.510
There were some
mountains I actually

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.640
had to hike twice to get
up to the level of being

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.080
able to climb Kilimanjaro.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.410
But spirit I think was one
of the most important things

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.310
where I took yoga classes.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.860
One-- because they do
a lot of breath work.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.210
And I thought it was going
to be really important for me

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.540
to feel like I was in
control of my breath.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.130
My breath wasn't going
to be in control of me.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.180
And so even though there were
breath exercises that I did,

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.890
it started to really
kind of get me

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.600
in the rhythm of really
being conscious of air in,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.970
air out, and conserving
air where I could.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.470
But what I really
loved about yoga

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.910
as part of the training--
yes flexibility, strength,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.450
all that stuff is great.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.740
But every time I went down
into savasana-- you know,

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:46.823
the part where it looks
like everybody is sleeping

00:14:46.823 --> 00:14:50.540
and they did nothing for
like a 45-minute class-- that

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.220
was when I started
to imagine myself

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.550
at the top of the mountain
before I got there.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.600
Because I had to believe that
I could do this goal before I

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.100
did it.

00:15:02.496 --> 00:15:05.920
So you can do a lot of
routes up Kilimanjaro.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.780
I in my three climbs have
climbed the Rongai route

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.420
each time.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.490
It's the route on the
Kenya side of the mountain.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.550
It's a little more remote.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.400
Maybe when we camped we saw
two or three other groups,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.570
and that's it.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.030
On the way down the mountain,
we went the Coca Cola route,

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.070
which is much more--
there's much more traffic.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.000
And so you really did
see a lot more people.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.560
A lot of people look
at this middle photo

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.750
and they say, oh, how wonderful.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.994
They are just starting
their-- it's OK.

00:15:37.994 --> 00:15:39.410
A lot of people
look at this photo

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.595
and they say, oh, how cute.

00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:42.720
They're just starting their
journey up Kilimanjaro.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.830
And I have to explain
to them, no, no, no.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.200
That's four days in.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.080
And you still have to
do-- summit night is

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.810
from here up to the top
and then halfway down

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:55.890
the mountain in one day.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.810
It's 15 hours of hiking.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.750
And things like altitude--
headaches are a real concern.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.330
This is Lisa, who actually
did make it to the top,

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.920
but it was 50-50 whether
or not she was actually

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.925
going to continue or
not at that point.

00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:15.530
So hiking Kilimanjaro
is an amazing thing.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.460
You dream about it for months.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.290
You prepare.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.070
You visit REI more times
than you probably have

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.732
in your entire life, right?

00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:24.690
You spend more money on
gear-- probably as much

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.390
as you paid for
your plane tickets.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:30.040
But then comes summit night.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.550
And when you're
at summit night--

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.550
and I mentioned that
you're camping kind of high

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.290
up on that slope
that I just pointed

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.780
to-- when you start
your summit attempt,

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.500
it is 15 hours of hiking.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.933
So why not start at midnight?

00:16:43.933 --> 00:16:45.700
Right?

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.540
Get it started and
get it over with.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.000
When you open your
tent door, you

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.730
are so high up that there
are stars above you.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.510
There are stars beside you.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.145
There are stars below you.

00:16:58.145 --> 00:17:00.470
When you are so
proud of yourself

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:03.190
that you've put on every
possible layer of gear--

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.130
everything.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.130
You look like that kid
in "A Christmas Story."

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:09.652
I can't put my arms down.

00:17:09.652 --> 00:17:11.900
And you've managed to
tie your shoe laces

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.180
at about 15,000 or
16,000 feet-- that

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.960
alone is, like, you're
so proud of yourself

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.579
that you can't even imagine.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.760
So then you walk out your tent
door, and you join your group.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.160
You try to stomach a
little bit of breakfast.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.460
And then you start walking in
this formation with your guide.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.600
And they're singing you Swahili
love songs and lullabies

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.820
as you're walking in
this beautiful formation.

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.670
Lockstep-- everybody's
in this together.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:45.520
And that's really wonderful--
for the first hour,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.500
maybe the second.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.540
But by the third
hour, you're thinking,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.740
I think this guide is lost.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.285
Because unlike in
states where there's

00:17:56.285 --> 00:18:00.210
these big trailblazes where
you know exactly where you're

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.030
going, there's I'm going
to follow the red dot

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.680
trail all the way
up the mountain.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.490
There isn't that on Kilimanjaro.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.280
There's just these gravelly
trails of scree near the top

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.190
where you take one step up,
and you slide halfway back.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.390
And you take another step up,
and you slide halfway back.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:21.820
And it is so
incredibly frustrating.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:27.440
So then you're really
irritated at this point.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.590
And by hour four, you've
pretty much got your I

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.840
quit speech down.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.940
Like, listen.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.900
I really want a fresh
shower and a cold beer

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.170
or a cold water that
comes from a bottle

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.670
not from whatever water source
you got this stuff from.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.810
You guys are like sisters
or brothers to me.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.120
You've lent me toilet paper.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.940
I feel like we're family,
but I'm going to leave now.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.370
I'm going down the
mountain the way I came.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.360
So right when you feel like you
just cannot take this journey

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.580
anymore, that's when
the sun comes up.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.710
So on Kilimanjaro--
especially on summit night--

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.200
it is truly darkest before dawn.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.950
That's when you really have to
dig in and just keep pushing

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.276
forward when you feel like you
just can't-- unless, of course,

00:19:15.276 --> 00:19:17.150
you're suffering from
something really, like,

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.040
altitude sickness.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:23.790
But usually your mind gives
out before your body does.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.340
And if you're
climbing Kilimanjaro,

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.300
usually you stop at Gilman's
Point where you can have tea.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.930
A lot of times the porters and
guides have tea for you there.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.310
And you're so high at
this point that you

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:39.610
watch the sunrise over Africa,
and the horizon is curved.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.170
And when I first noticed
this, I thought maybe

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.720
I was tripping because
of the lack of oxygen.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.870
But a lot of other people
confirm that the horizon does

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:50.610
look completely
curved, because you

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.620
are so high up in the world.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.300
But maybe they had
lack of oxygen, too.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.190
So from there you can go
on to Uhuru peak, which is

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.690
the true summit of Kilimanjaro.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.370
And the first time I did
it, I hiked with my husband.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:09.150
And for the record, he's only
done one of my three climbs.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.320
So with all my training, I
kept thinking about the way

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.850
up, the way up, the way up.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.660
But what goes up must come down.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.700
Right?

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.030
And so it can be kind of fun.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.890
I mean, you're doing
this scree running.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.170
So now that scree that
was so devastating to you

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.040
on summit night-- so difficult
to manage-- is kind of fun,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.550
because now you're doing this
almost like a vertical run

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.910
down a beach.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.880
Does that make sense?

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.380
So you're trying
to have fun with it

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.254
where you're just kind
of running and running

00:20:40.254 --> 00:20:40.800
and running.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:42.750
And it really
actually helps rinse

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.820
out the lactic acid that's
kind of built out in your body.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.960
But you just try to
enjoy the journey

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.280
down even though your legs
kind of feel like jello for all

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.580
that you've put it through.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.440
So as we're doing this,
as we're making our way

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.650
down the mountain that first
time, all we could think about

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.240
was getting to a
hotel-- shelter,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.980
anything over our
heads, a warm meal

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.176
at a table on a
plate-- something

00:21:09.176 --> 00:21:10.300
that we could really enjoy.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.620
And, of course, a shower.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.840
Our leader at the time,
she said to us, hey, guys.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.100
Don't forget to look up
every once in a while.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.055
And so on this
particular trip where

00:21:22.055 --> 00:21:23.680
we were at that moment
on the mountain,

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.480
I looked up in
the horizon, and I

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.910
saw a mountain that looked
a lot like Camel's Hump.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:32.160
And I thought to myself,
gosh, if I had never

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.280
done Camel's Hump-- if I had
never made that my giant goal--

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.310
I could never be here.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.360
And so it really does make a
difference, those small steps,

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.130
those interim goals.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.710
So even if it's like a
five K for you-- something

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.410
you've never done before-- you
never know where that may lead.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.990
And it might just
lead to the five K,

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.260
and that alone is a
huge accomplishment.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.920
And Camel's Hump at the time
was a huge accomplishment,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.310
but that interim goal led
me to the roof of Africa.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.020
So in the end, I
did lose 120 pounds.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:10.600
And the women were very excited
about that who would follow me

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.890
to the bathroom.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.260
And after I came back from
Kilimanjaro, the next thing

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.520
they wanted to know, so
what's your next adventure?

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.000
What are you doing?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.110
Are you going to do Everest?

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.560
Are you going to
do Machu Picchu?

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.937
Are you going to do-- if
"Wild" were out at the time,

00:22:25.937 --> 00:22:27.520
they would have been,
like, oh my god.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.060
You totally got to do the
Pacific Coast Trail, right?

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:33.440
But I had a whole other
adventure in mind.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.010
It required another language
and a lot of new gear

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.960
and that was to have a baby.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.790
So like a lot of women who
struggle with their weight,

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.560
I put on a ton of it back
on when I was pregnant.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.810
In fact, I put on 70 pounds
during my nine months

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.270
of pregnancy.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:23:00.020
And I went from someone that
had been to the roof of Africa

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:03.400
to someone who could barely
hike across my living

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.740
room, because I had
sciatica so bad, which

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.590
is like this lightning
bolt down your leg.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:10.000
And it was embarrassing.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.350
It was embarrassing
that I had done so much.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.530
In one year I lost
all this weight,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.700
and then in months I put
half of it back on again.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.310
And so now those women wouldn't
even look me in the eye

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:22.209
anymore.

00:23:22.209 --> 00:23:24.000
They wouldn't hold the
door for me anymore.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.720
Nobody really wanted to talk
about weight anymore with me.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.670
And so I was really
feeling stuck and isolated,

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.270
and I started to do those things
that I did when I struggled

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.550
with my weight before.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.282
I'd bow out of events, because
I felt like, oh, I'm too fat.

00:23:38.282 --> 00:23:39.740
I don't want to go
to that reunion.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.990
I don't want to go that party.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.880
I haven't seen this
person in a long time.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.510
I wouldn't be in family photos.

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.640
In fact, there's almost
no pictures of me

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.410
when I was pregnant.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.100
And I think it's
because I didn't

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.710
want people to take my picture.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:55.310
I was embarrassed of
how I felt about myself.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.370
And I was really stuck.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.760
And I started to think
about what was it

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.400
about that first
Kilimanjaro climb?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:08.380
How come I was able to really
rise above and just go do it?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.530
And I thought to
myself, well, it

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.610
was because I was
working for a cause that

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.816
was bigger than myself.

00:24:14.816 --> 00:24:17.040
Whenever I didn't
want to work out,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.120
I thought about I'm climbing
this mountain for AIDS orphans

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.750
in Africa.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.570
I'm raising the money for them.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.890
Who am I to not eat well?

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.330
Who am I to not train today?

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.360
They're depending on me.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.710
And even though if I didn't
make the top of the mountain,

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.069
I still would have--
the donations still

00:24:37.069 --> 00:24:38.360
would have gone to the charity.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.240
But I felt like I had a
responsibility to do my best.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.140
And so in my
post-pregnancy mind,

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.730
I thought, well I've
got a great plan.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.900
I'm going to do
something called the Save

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.630
the World workout,
where I'm going

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.420
to do a different
event for charity

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.350
every month of the year.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:03.100
And that way I would force
myself to get out and be

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.510
a part of an event where they
are raising money for charity,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:10.270
where I have to sign
up for it, show up.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.140
And it really did
a great job of just

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.390
at least getting
me moving again,

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:18.540
because that's something
I wasn't doing at all.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.540
So even though
some of the events

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.630
burned more calories than
others-- like the flying pig

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.800
marathon-- I actually walked
the whole marathon course.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.000
But the penguin
plunge in Vermont--

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.750
which is jumping in Lake
Champlain in Burlington,

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.160
Vermont in February,
where they actually

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.800
have to cut out a minivan
sized chunk of ice,

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:47.650
and you jump in the water--
that was more about me

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.550
kind of getting out of
my shell again than it

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.840
was about burning calories.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:53.910
And I'm a little embarrassed
about the profanity

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.120
I used in front of the
former mayor of Vermont,

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.070
not Bernie Sanders,
but Peter Clavelle.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.980
But I think he might have
matched it a little bit,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.880
but I'm not saying he did.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.290
So anyway it was this
great year of just kind

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.590
of getting out, raising
money, doing fun things

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:12.990
that I enjoyed again.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:15.180
And I thought, OK, the
best thing that I can do

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.870
is to end the year with
a Kilimanjaro climb.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.240
And that will
finally get me back

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.580
in that space, that
same place where

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:25.740
I was successful with weight.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.370
I mean, because you know, you
see all the advertisements

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:31.640
for weight loss products, weight
loss surgery, weight loss this,

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.690
weight loss pills, weight
loss-- all these programs

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:35.460
that you can do.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.060
People really want to
be in that place again.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.680
And I desperately wanted
to hang on to something.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.520
And I thought Kilimanjaro is
going to be the key to that.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.342
And so I thought if I just
ended with a Kilimanjaro hike,

00:26:48.342 --> 00:26:50.590
I was going to be
able to do that.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:55.020
So I did all the
events, but the problem

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.080
was I convinced
myself that I was just

00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.780
really good in altitude.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.350
And it's just a slow
hike to the top.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.000
It's all you have to do to get
to the top of this mountain.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.720
Unfortunately, it isn't.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.570
If you're planning on
climbing Kilimanjaro,

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.010
you want to give yourself
four months of training

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.770
in that direction,
and that's it.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.630
You want to make sure you
have time to prepare your body

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.430
and your mind for this.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.290
But the most important
thing that I did not conquer

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:28.260
was my challenge with food.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:34.220
Because I didn't put 70
pounds back on because

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.430
I was just eating
extra ice cream.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.530
I was doing the same
things that got me

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:41.950
into trouble the first time.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.690
I was binging, and my
real red flag with food

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:51.700
is when I can't
admit what I ate.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:54.120
In fact, my real
trouble point with food

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.830
is when I'm hiding
what I've done.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.470
So for those of you who
don't struggle with food,

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:00.730
I'll just lay it out for you.

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.430
This is what it looks like.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:05.490
I'm the mom in our family,
so I do the grocery shopping.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:06.160
Right?

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.900
I come home with some ice cream
for my kids-- for my daughter

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.150
at the time and my husband.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.960
And we have dessert.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.030
We have a nice healthy portion
of ice cream, and that's that.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:20.870
Everybody's happy.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:21.540
We go to bed.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:23.970
The next day while
I'm working from home,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.650
I think after lunch I
could use some ice cream

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.460
or sometimes after breakfast.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.170
I could use some ice cream.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:31.060
I have a little bit.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.670
I want to be done with it.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:36.260
Then I return to the
fridge or the freezer

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.790
a few minutes later,
maybe an hour later.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.020
I want a little bit more
and then a little bit more.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.310
And suddenly I'm eating
the entire container

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.060
with a spoon with the
freezer still open.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.860
And suddenly I'm,
like, oh my gosh.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.630
This thing is almost gone.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:55.590
Now how am I, a professional
mom, a professional writer,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:59.527
a good mom, successful
in lots of other things?

00:28:59.527 --> 00:29:00.610
I mean, I've raised money.

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.150
I'm a good person.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.980
How is it that I can be
conquered by a cupcake?

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.550
And so then I do what I think
is the most logical thing.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.910
I go back and I have to buy
another thing of ice cream

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.970
to hide the fact that
I didn't eat the ice

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.439
cream in the first place.

00:29:16.439 --> 00:29:18.480
And this is when I'm really
in trouble with food.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.510
And this is where I was on the
eve of this second Kilimanjaro

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.300
climb.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.210
I hadn't dealt with how
I was feeling with food.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.060
In fact the hardest thing that
I had to write about in "Gorge"

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:37.542
was the scene right
before the second climb.

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:41.140
Because I had purchased
some candy in the Amsterdam

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.535
airport for my daughter
and my niece and nephew who

00:29:44.535 --> 00:29:46.420
were coming to
visit for Christmas,

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.800
and I ate it all--
every single bit of it

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.660
on the eve of a
Kilimanjaro climb.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.800
So spoiler alert.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.822
I didn't make it up
the mountain that time.

00:29:58.822 --> 00:30:02.490
In fact, it was a
pretty devastating fail.

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.990
And after that point, if I
was in the red flag territory

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:10.380
before, I was seriously,
seriously in trouble with food.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.600
I did that kind of
thing with ice cream

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.114
like almost every single day.

00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:18.980
So I didn't want to hike again.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.170
I didn't want to hear
about Kilimanjaro again.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.100
I didn't want anything
to do with mountains

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:29.610
until a friend of mine
said, hey, remember

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.250
that trip up Kilimanjaro?

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.130
Ever since you talked
about it with me,

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.510
I've always wanted to go.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.420
And I'd like to do it to
train for an Iron Man,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.740
so my friend would also
like to come with me.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:46.870
And together we will raise
$1 per foot of the mountain

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.250
for the charity that you love.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.870
So $19,343 was on the
line for Kilimanjaro

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.420
if you come with us.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.860
And then I had my
husband's cousin, who

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:02.310
is on the cover of "Gorge"
with me, say to me, you know,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.790
I'm in a rut.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.800
I really need to get out of it.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.310
Her mom died of cancer,
and then her father

00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:13.275
was murdered on the
roadside in Moab, Utah--

00:31:13.275 --> 00:31:15.080
all within a couple
years of each other.

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:19.470
And she was eating and she
was shopping to kind of get

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:20.750
through those feelings.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.500
And so she was putting
on a ton of weight.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.540
She's, like, I just need
something to keep me going.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.100
So I'll climb
Kilimanjaro, and I'll

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.340
raise $5000 for Global Alliance
for Africa if you come with me.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.690
Talk about backwards
peer pressure, right?

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.640
So now I knew if
I climbed that I

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.870
could raise an additional $5,000
for Global Alliance for Africa.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:45.060
So now we're talking about
$30,000 for this organization

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:46.670
that I really loved.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.240
I mean, that's more
than enough money

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.900
to actually build a library
in one of the slums in Kenya

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.860
or anything like that.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.276
I mean, there's
so much that could

00:31:54.276 --> 00:31:57.107
be done with that amount
of money for the programs

00:31:57.107 --> 00:31:57.690
that they use.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.850
So I thought, OK, I'll do it.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:05.430
However if I do it-- and this
is the story that's in "Gorge"--

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:09.360
that I would need
to do the work.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.070
I would have to do
the training again--

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:17.080
that kind of four to six months
of really, really training.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.350
However, the most important
thing that I needed to do

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.050
was to love myself where
I was and go from there.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.970
Because initially I started
to do that thinking, like, OK.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.270
I'm going to lose 20 pounds this
month and 10 pounds every month

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.730
until the hike.

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:33.750
And that'll be perfect.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:34.830
I thought, no.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:36.800
If I set myself
up like that, it's

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.100
going to be a complete failure.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.740
What I needed to do was to find
a trainer who would train me

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.880
as I was that I could be
able to climb the mountain

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.410
at the weight I was at.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.910
I did things like I signed up
for a half marathon in Vermont

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.500
called the Mad
marathon, which is

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.250
the most mountainous
marathon-- half

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.480
marathon-- I've ever walked.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.660
It's incredible.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.420
And my husband did that
with me to help me train.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.280
But more importantly,
I needed to understand

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:09.400
what is it about food
that has so captured me?

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.630
How come I eat?

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.830
How come I have this
pattern of existing

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.307
that is so dangerous to myself?

00:33:16.307 --> 00:33:18.140
So if I was going to
climb the mountain, not

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.450
only was I going to do
it upon my own strength

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.620
and my own body,
I was also going

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:27.590
to do the work to understand
the journey that I had been on.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.920
And this, of course,
was no walk in the park.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:31.980
I climbed the mountain
as if I was carrying

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.110
another person on my back.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.710
I did the hiking as
if I was doing that.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:41.790
So I did things like I trained
in Telluride with my husband's

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.100
cousin, Stacy.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.330
And you know, PSA-- it's a lot
easier to ski down a mountain

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.040
trail than to hike up it.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.190
Because that was some serious
hiking up some serious trails.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.290
But it was so gorgeous
when I got to the top,

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.770
and I was doing actually
altitude training because those

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:02.924
are like 12,000 feet--
14,000 feet-- peaks

00:34:02.924 --> 00:34:03.757
that we were hiking.

00:34:07.332 --> 00:34:11.260
So when I got to
the mountain, when

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.889
I got to there the third
time, I was feeling

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:15.420
pretty great about myself.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.550
I was feeling like I was ready.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:25.110
In fact, so much so that by
the second day, two of the four

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:27.969
people who were with us--
four including myself--

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:31.219
were feeling sick,
feeling tired, feeling

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:34.040
like they had made a mistake,
like they didn't really

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.560
want to come up Kilimanjaro.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.210
And how could I have said
yes to this crazy idea?

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.320
Anyway, I started to feel
like, yeah, I feel good.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.389
Even after that second
day on the Rongai route,

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:51.810
which is 10 hours of hiking--
10 hours of just drudgery.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:56.590
It's not a huge incline,
but it is a long slog.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.480
The porters and
guides actually asked

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:02.152
me, hey, do you need me to
carry your backpack two or three

00:35:02.152 --> 00:35:03.860
times, because they
were already carrying

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.702
backpacks of my fellow hikers.

00:35:06.702 --> 00:35:07.410
I'm like, no, no.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.860
I feel good.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:15.260
And so that night when I went
to sleep, I was thinking, OK,

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:16.044
it's so cold.

00:35:16.044 --> 00:35:17.460
It was actually
so cold that night

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.540
that our water bottles
froze in our tents.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.670
So if you go camping a lot,
you know that kind of night.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.269
All you want to do is put your
sleeping cap on, put yourself

00:35:25.269 --> 00:35:27.435
in your sleeping bag, go
to sleep so you can wake up

00:35:27.435 --> 00:35:29.460
for when the sun rises,
and it could possibly

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.995
be a few degrees warmer
when you wake up.

00:35:32.995 --> 00:35:37.010
So as I was going
to sleep, I started

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.470
to hear rumblings in Swahili
in the tent next to me.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:42.890
That's where the porters
and guides were hanging out.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.790
And I don't know
a lot of Swahili,

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.140
but I do know a couple things.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.900
The most important
thing that I know

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.060
is what they call me in Swahili.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.410
My nickname on the mountain
for all three climbs

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:54.490
was Mama [SWAHILI].

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.680
Which means big woman--
which didn't bother me.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.020
That's the way they
differentiate me

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:00.940
from the other people.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.590
They know who they're
talking about.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:07.226
But then I started
to hear laughter.

00:36:07.226 --> 00:36:09.784
And it wasn't like
Mama [SWAHILI]

00:36:09.784 --> 00:36:11.450
had told this really
funny joke, and I'm

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:13.140
going to tell you what it is.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.722
I knew at that moment that
they were making fun of me.

00:36:16.722 --> 00:36:18.680
And so these are the
people that we were paying

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.900
to help us up the mountain.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.500
And I started to feel
for the first time

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.700
like I'm not going
to do this anymore.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:25.355
I've done this.

00:36:25.355 --> 00:36:26.938
This is my third
time up the mountain.

00:36:26.938 --> 00:36:28.100
I know my way back.

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.100
I'll just get a ride to
the hotel, and I'm out.

00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:34.799
Because I started
to think to myself,

00:36:34.799 --> 00:36:35.840
I'm not going to do this.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.381
If the people that we're paying
to support us up the mountain

00:36:38.381 --> 00:36:39.920
don't think I'm
going to make it,

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.350
how could I possibly make it?

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:44.520
So I finally lulled
myself to sleep.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.270
I remembered things like when
I was doing spinning classes,

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.840
and they did these
mantras, and I totally

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.730
tried to get myself into the
mode where I was, like, OK

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:54.710
I believe in me.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.220
I'm going to ignore
what they said.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:59.390
But here's the thing
about Kilimanjaro.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:02.610
You can't push off things.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.610
If it's raining, you
put on a rain jacket

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.950
or you will get soaked.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.345
If you're hungry, you
need to eat something

00:37:09.345 --> 00:37:12.837
or you're going to be-- you're
not going to have enough energy

00:37:12.837 --> 00:37:13.920
to do what you need to do.

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:15.510
If you're thirsty,
well then you're

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:20.420
far beyond being dehydrated, and
you need to be drinking, right?

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.210
The same thing
goes with emotions.

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:23.710
It's a really great
mountain to kind

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.126
of toil through
something that you

00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:28.300
need to figure out, because all
you have time to do is think.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.910
But you have to do
something with that emotion.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:34.480
And for me, as someone
who's been struggling

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.990
with their weight since
she was nine years old,

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.560
I know when people
are making fun of me.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.400
And I couldn't just
put it off anymore.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.550
And I'll just do a
quick reading about what

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.300
happened after that point.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.850
So the next morning
I was still feeling

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:55.690
upset about how they felt--
what they said about me.

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:58.010
However far I walked,
however much I

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.720
tried to think of other things,
the humiliation of last night

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.560
was there, and it was raw.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.820
I was overcompensating by
being perky-- a cheerleader--

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.500
even if I would have
never made it on a team,

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.310
let alone be on
top of a pyramid.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:14.090
But being perky and positive
was how I usually dealt

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.990
with everything in public.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.190
I needed to confront
Kennedy but in such a way

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.490
that he would continue guiding
me up the mountain safely.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:24.250
So when it came time for
a water and pee break

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:28.690
amid an outcropping of
rocks, I approached our guide

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:32.240
with what I always do when
I am upset or nervous.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.910
I smiled.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:36.260
I didn't want him to know
that his mocking words made

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.280
me want to turn
back, so there I was

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.110
swallowing my true
feelings, trying to be nice.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.630
After all his job
was not an easy one.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.650
He was already carrying
Tracy's backpack to help her,

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:49.050
but my cheeks burned.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.570
I always live with the feeling
that I couldn't or shouldn't

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:57.110
speak up in the face of bullies
or my abuser or even my father.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:01.070
I was used to swallowing my
words like 22 rifle shells.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:03.520
So when it came time
to say my words,

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.780
I nearly choked on
the first syllable.

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.560
I want to talk to
you about something,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.380
I said, interrupting a Swahili
conversation he was having

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.570
with our assistant guide.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.752
Last night I heard you.

00:39:13.752 --> 00:39:15.190
You were talking about me.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.470
What were you saying?

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.140
Sorry, Kennedy said.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.370
I was pretty sure he
was pretending he didn't

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.060
know what I was talking about.

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.239
I heard you last night.

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:26.030
I heard you making the
trails I do when I'm

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:27.680
going up and down the trail.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.270
I heard you making fun of me.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:32.550
I was talking with some
porters who wanted to know,

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.970
are you sure she's
going to make it?

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.330
I was answering them.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.580
They don't believe you're
going to make it to the top,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.740
Kennedy said.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.960
He looked
embarrassed-- maybe not

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.776
because of what he said
but for getting caught.

00:39:44.776 --> 00:39:46.390
From his tone the
night before, I

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:49.220
couldn't help but think that he
was one of the people betting

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.930
against my success.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:54.540
I knew his laughter, and I
believed he was laughing at me.

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.916
They don't believe it, I asked.

00:39:56.916 --> 00:39:59.450
Yeah, Kennedy
answered, looking away.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.900
Did you make any
money bets, I asked.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.680
You should, I said.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.880
Bet on me.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.372
Bet on me.

00:40:07.372 --> 00:40:09.840
So that's the only
time in my life

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.820
probably that I've
been able to come back

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.070
with something to
say to somebody

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:15.430
who's making fun of me.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:19.550
In middle school it was
just an embarrassment.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.300
I would just hear
people making fun of me,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.220
and I would just run away.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.011
And then I'd think
about it two days later.

00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:26.985
And the only thing
that I can think of,

00:40:26.985 --> 00:40:29.830
of why I was able to say
something with such power

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:35.010
and conviction and strength
was because Kilimanjaro allowed

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.890
me to feel strong,
and so I can ask

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.296
for what I need for in life.

00:40:40.296 --> 00:40:42.770
I can do things
that I want to do,

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.950
because I was finally
standing up for myself.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.560
So my wish for you is
that whatever it is you

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:52.420
want to accomplish--
if after this talk

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.930
you want nothing to do with
Kilimanjaro-- whatever it is,

00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.120
whatever goal you have
is that you continue

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.190
to bet on yourself.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:02.780
Because it will always pay
off for you in the end.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:05.720
So thanks, and I'll take
any questions that you have.

00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:15.190
AUDIENCE: I'm planning a
Kilimanjaro hike in June.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.570
So first one.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.570
I normally hike around the
Bay Area, so what do you think

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.390
will be most surprising
or shocking to me?

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.144
Or what should I do
extra to prepare?

00:41:24.144 --> 00:41:25.310
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: OK.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:28.090
So the most
surprising or shocking

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.984
is when you're shopping
for hand wipes,

00:41:29.984 --> 00:41:31.400
multiply the amount
that you think

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.940
you need by about four or five.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.610
The training that you
do is pretty obvious.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.370
You want to hike up mountains.

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.510
You want to build strength.

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:43.370
You want to build endurance.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.295
But the hardest part
is the mental part--

00:41:47.295 --> 00:41:51.752
going past what you think you
could possibly do on your own.

00:41:51.752 --> 00:41:52.490
That's hard.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.100
But then also
enduring that when you

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.050
feel kind of yucky
about yourself

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.260
because you haven't showered.

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.660
I mean, they give you--
at least the tour group

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:02.690
that I went with-- gave you
water to wash up and stuff.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.760
But you just feel so
grimy by the end of it.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.410
And that can be kind of tough
to endure-- the physical.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.640
You know, usually if
you hike around home,

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.890
you do a great day hike.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.190
Then you go home or you go
to a hotel and you shower.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.640
Backpacking is not like
that where you actually

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.000
have to be where you
are and continue being

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.920
in that mode for several days.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:31.910
So really prepare not only the
physicality of the mountain

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.310
but the emotional part, too.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:37.380
AUDIENCE: I want to
know what inspired

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.330
you to write about this book.

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.019
Is it the first
book that you write?

00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:42.810
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY:
I did write a book

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.184
that I self-published called
"Fat Woman on the Mountain,"

00:42:45.184 --> 00:42:47.076
and that was about
my first climb.

00:42:47.076 --> 00:42:51.690
And I self-published
that because I

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.237
was 90% done on my computer.

00:42:53.237 --> 00:42:55.320
And I thought, well, I
might as well just share it

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.850
with the world.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.040
But this is my first
book with a publisher.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.530
And I've been lucky
enough to work

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.930
with Seal Press, which
is actually based nearby

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.370
in Berkeley.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.520
They're a publisher
for women by women.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.740
But as I was working
to get the proposal

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.519
ready-- because a nonfiction
book you write a proposal.

00:43:13.519 --> 00:43:15.560
You don't have to write
the whole thing at first.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.060
But you have to
write a good portion

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.000
and know where
the book is going.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.160
My agent, Kim Perrell,
had mentioned that she

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.460
was looking at the proposal.

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:30.940
And I was really focusing
on the mountain climb.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.400
I'm a fat person, and I'm
climbing this mountain.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.510
Isn't that great?

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.500
It was an adventure story.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:41.390
And she and I had what was a
very difficult call for her

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.690
to make and say that
this is a great story.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.050
Of course it's important
for you to tell the story.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:52.180
But I need you to be more open
with your struggles with food,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.240
because that is
equally as important

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.510
as this physical struggle
to hike a mountain.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.370
And she assured me-- then
writers like Cheryl Strayed,

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.860
who's my teacher--
she wrote "Wild"--

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:07.650
that it didn't matter what I
put on the table about my issues

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.160
with food.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.710
Because 2/3 of the United
States struggles with weight

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.820
in some way, shape, or form.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:15.960
And so it didn't matter
how open or embarrassing

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.190
I thought a story would
be-- that there would

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:19.910
be a lot of people
nodding their head

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.510
or understanding someone
else's behavior because of it.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:25.700
And so that's what
I decided to do.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.280
And with that advice, I
actually changed the title.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.280
I had originally called
it "Big, Fat Mountain,"

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.690
which I still think was
kind of a good title.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.940
But as I was writing the last
scene, which is in a gorge,

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.490
I thought, oh my gosh.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:42.680
It has to be "Gorge."

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.000
Because it means so
many things-- to eat

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.900
too much in the low point
between mountains and also

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.530
slang for gorgeous.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.670
But that's a third meaning.

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:55.750
It was mostly those two
meanings, of course.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.190
So anyway the paradigm
of sometimes you

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.940
get some feedback, and even
though it's difficult to take,

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.660
it really was important
for me to hear that

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.240
and really write to that point.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.500
And once she did that, I felt
like the floodgates opened.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.835
I could share anything.

00:45:10.835 --> 00:45:12.670
In "Fat Woman on
the Mountain," I

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.670
shared about being
sexually assaulted

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:18.410
and my father not being a
real big part of my life.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:22.010
But in "Gorge," I really
kind of let it all out,

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.730
which was really
important for me to do.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.400
AUDIENCE: Are you planning to
climb again, by any chance?

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.983
KARA RICHARDSON
WHITELY: Well, I think

00:45:28.983 --> 00:45:31.830
it's safe to say it's time to
move on to other mountains.

00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.990
You know, Kilimanjaro
three times-- I mean,

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:38.770
maybe Oprah could ask me to
climb it, but that's about it.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:42.751
But I would love to
hike Machu Picchu.

00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:44.500
I mentioned I studied
with Cheryl Strayed.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.749
I did that in the French
Alps, so I do a lot of hiking

00:45:46.749 --> 00:45:48.110
when I was there.

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.130
But the most important thing
for me at this point in my life

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:53.650
is that hiking comes
naturally to me.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.230
So it's not something that
I put a barrier up because

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.180
of my size.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.380
Or have I lost 10 pounds?

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.560
Have I gained 10 pounds?

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.640
You know, wherever I'm at
the scale that I love it,

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.140
in fact, so much so that I'm
an American Hiking Society

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:10.836
ambassador to share that the
outdoors are for everybody.

00:46:10.836 --> 00:46:14.900
But you know, my victories
today aren't huge mountains.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:19.970
They are things like before
I left on these two talks--

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:22.930
I did a talk at
Purdue-- I made sure

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.720
that I had my seeds ordered
for my community garden plot.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.620
So I had healthy things
for my family to eat.

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:32.800
There are things like
going to family swim,

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.630
because putting a bathing
suit on for me can

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:37.181
be as intimidating as Everest.

00:46:37.181 --> 00:46:37.680
OK?

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:39.330
Let's just be honest here.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.590
You know, so that I actually
am leading an active life,

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:47.140
no matter where I am on the
scale, for myself, for my kids,

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.614
for my future.

00:46:48.614 --> 00:46:50.780
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
wipes and I saw the poles

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:52.980
and I've read the blogs.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.899
Is there any kind of
equipment that you needed

00:46:54.899 --> 00:46:56.690
that you didn't think
you would have needed

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.280
or that you didn't read about?

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.950
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: Well,
if you go with a reputable tour

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.340
company, they will
give you a supply list.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.320
So you can feel pretty
comfortable about that.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.850
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:09.600
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY:
The people at REI

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.700
won't steer you wrong usually.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.980
I would say that the most
important thing for you

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.300
to put money into is into
your socks and boots.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:17.886
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:17.886 --> 00:47:21.222
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: I am
not a fancy bag kind of person,

00:47:21.222 --> 00:47:23.430
even though there's a
Bloomingdale's in the next town

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:24.580
over, I never go there.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:28.570
But if I go to REI, I drop
$300 on a pair of boots,

00:47:28.570 --> 00:47:31.310
but it's so worth it.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:33.720
I bought a pair of
Asolos that actually I

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:38.340
took up Kilimanjaro three
times and all the training

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.420
in between.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.950
And the only reason I
gave them away at the end

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:44.721
was because our guide
was wearing Skechers.

00:47:44.721 --> 00:47:45.262
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:46.678
KARA RICHARDSON
WHITELY: You know?

00:47:46.678 --> 00:47:48.835
And so you want to make
sure-- as a side note--

00:47:48.835 --> 00:47:50.460
if you do decide to
climb the mountain,

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.060
you want to make sure that
your guide company really takes

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:58.840
care of their porters, because
it's considered a good job.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:00.960
However, you want to
make sure that they

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.730
have good footwear, that they
have enough to stay warm.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:07.830
Because you'll see how much
you pack, and it'll depend--

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.750
there's guidelines about
how many pounds it can be.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.150
But then you see these porters
are carrying up all your stuff.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.160
And then theirs is a
tiny little backpack.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.660
So think about that,
for sure, when you go.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.630
But hiking poles-- it's good
to start training with them,

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:26.430
even though you don't
think you need them.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.640
Because it does take a
lot out of your shoulders

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.950
to kind of move with them.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:35.440
So you don't want to be
feeling like that is something

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.870
new for you on the mountain.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:39.740
You really don't want anything
to feel really totally

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:42.570
new for you-- any of your
gear-- except for maybe

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:46.760
gaiters, because those go on
the outside of your pants.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.010
AUDIENCE: One last follow up.

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:48.280
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: Sure.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.160
AUDIENCE: I read somewhere
that you wanted your shoes

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.030
to have a little bit of
space, so when you come down,

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.300
your toe doesn't seem crammed.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.160
But that seems kind of odd
in the sense that going up,

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.312
you don't really want
loose boots, either.

00:48:58.312 --> 00:48:59.520
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: Huh.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.690
AUDIENCE: Was that an
issue when you came down?

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.310
Did you feel like your
toes were getting smashed?

00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:05.060
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY:
Well, yes and no.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:08.730
I mean, it's an
interesting question.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:12.300
You want to feel that with
your outfitter, whoever's

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.670
selling you your boots, and
look more online about that.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.301
I mean, because I've
had-- my third climb--

00:49:18.301 --> 00:49:19.800
by the time I got
down the mountain,

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.380
I had this horrible blister,
which I won't describe.

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:25.180
Because it's probably
like adult content.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.310
You don't want to
hear about that.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:28.450
On my toe.

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.810
But I think it's because my
laces weren't tight enough.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:31.910
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:33.535
KARA RICHARDSON
WHITELY: I was probably

00:49:33.535 --> 00:49:35.725
too tired to just go down
and tie them tightly.

00:49:35.725 --> 00:49:38.150
You want to make sure all
those things are taken care of.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:40.608
Another thing is you want to
make sure your toes are really

00:49:40.608 --> 00:49:42.410
well clipped and your toenails.

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:46.630
Because if you have too long
toe nails, that will also--

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.980
you'll lose a lot of
toenails because of that.

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.402
So lots of tips.

00:49:50.402 --> 00:49:51.110
Lots of footwear.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:52.446
Ask lots of questions.

00:49:52.446 --> 00:49:54.320
I mean, the people who
work at outdoor stores

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.410
often do it because they love
gear, and they love hiking.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.410
And so if they don't
know, then someone else--

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.000
I'm sure someone on their
staff has done a similar hike.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:03.590
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:04.895
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY: Yeah.

00:50:04.895 --> 00:50:05.330
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:05.930
Thank you.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.060
KARA RICHARDSON WHITELY:
Thank you so much.
