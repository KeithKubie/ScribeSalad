00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.950
All right, so with that, there are lots
of other examples that I could come up

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.770
with and we could talk about.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.394
But I think that, I think I've
sort of made the point here.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:08.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really neat.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.560
I mean, again, it feels,
not to be dissing on my homie,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.430
King Solomon, but-
&gt;&gt; Namesake.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.935
&gt;&gt; Namesake.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:18.636
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Isn't that what homie means?

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:22.080
&gt;&gt; In some, in Yiddish, yes.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.410
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, fine.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.600
So, but again, if B is rich enough,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.159
B is just buying the baby and not even
paying A appropriately for the baby.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.930
&gt;&gt; Well, if B is rich enough,
B probably just bought a baby.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but bought the baby for
the, [LAUGH] for

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.660
what, for the value, for
B's own value of the baby.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.074
&gt;&gt; So, it has to be the case that V real
is greater than V fake for all of this.

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:47.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.660
&gt;&gt; But let's just say it is.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.540
And if it's not, then we'll
come up with some other design.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.345
And actually, by the way,
there are mechanisms for

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:57.234
solving this where it may be the case
that fake's greater than real, but

00:00:57.234 --> 00:01:00.358
you sort of limit the possible
values that each might get,

00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:03.500
you kind of think there's
like a distribution of them.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.780
And there are clever things that you
can do to sort of make this work.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.390
But well beyond the scope of this single
slide, which we've done all of this on

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.900
one slide, so it's well beyond-
&gt;&gt; All of this and a little more.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's just no
more room on the slide, so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.586
I can't talk about it anymore.

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:21.000
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.910
I think speaking of game theory and
true values, we have a problem.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.780
&gt;&gt; All right, what's the problem?

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.330
&gt;&gt; The problem we have is that we've now
come to the part of the lesson where we

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.210
have to say what have we learned, and
one of us drives and the other talks.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.730
&gt;&gt; Great.
&gt;&gt; But

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.240
we both did things in this lesson.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.660
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to say that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.120
we kept switching turns in
order to make parity work.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.850
You should do the what have we learned.
