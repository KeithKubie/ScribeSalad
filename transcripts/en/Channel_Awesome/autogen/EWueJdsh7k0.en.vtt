00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.749
it's one of those things where this was
kind of a thing for a while like in

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759
kind of a thing for a while like in
 

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.480
kind of a thing for a while like in
maybe alone the 80s but especially in

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:24.490
maybe alone the 80s but especially in
 

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.480
maybe alone the 80s but especially in
the 90s where sequels were really just

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:27.490
the 90s where sequels were really just
 

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.100
the 90s where sequels were really just
supposed to be a repeat of the first one

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.110
supposed to be a repeat of the first one
 

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.659
supposed to be a repeat of the first one
you know maybe they did before then too

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:30.669
you know maybe they did before then too
 

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:32.370
you know maybe they did before then too
but especially like in those two decade

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:32.380
but especially like in those two decade
 

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.519
but especially like in those two decade

it was just expected and there was no
 

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:37.949
it was just expected and there was no
reason why there is no reason to do that

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:37.959
reason why there is no reason to do that
 

00:08:37.959 --> 00:08:39.569
reason why there is no reason to do that
except we have a formula let's do it

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:39.579
except we have a formula let's do it
 

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:41.940

kids to kids especially don't versus a
 

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.520
kids to kids especially don't versus a
movie that literally the kids are just

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:45.530

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.600
doesn't make sense
this could work if the idea of the movie

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:55.610
this could work if the idea of the movie
 

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.760
this could work if the idea of the movie
was they want to get further away from

just going the exact opposite and
 

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.550
just going the exact opposite and
therefore no reason some you know cut

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560
therefore no reason some you know cut
 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.090
therefore no reason some you know cut
off hands so that's the weird thing they

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.100
off hands so that's the weird thing they
 

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.700
off hands so that's the weird thing they
did everything in this movie to
