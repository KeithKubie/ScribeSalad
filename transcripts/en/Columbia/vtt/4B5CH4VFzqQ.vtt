00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.590
President Halonen: It is great honor for

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.840
me to address the World Leaders

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.110
Forum here at the Columbia University.
So a few words before I start. Of course

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.480
it's always a pleasure to visit the U.S.A.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.090
but during the last two weeks our

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.079
 thoughts have been with you because of
serious damages caused by the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.070
Hurricane Katrina. Even we have thought

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.140
of you quite much. On behalf of

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.870
 myself and of the people of Finland I
would like once again to express my

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.420
condolences to the loss of the human lives.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.300
Finland is also participating already

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.269
 in the rescue effort by providing logistic
experts and other assistance. So, ladies

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.710
and gentlemen, the world is one. The United

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.089
Nations has proved its importance

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.840
 over the past six decades with the major
event summit or I just heard today that

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.400
the latest compromise which is going on

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.330
they say that it is high level (inaudible)

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.369
 general assembly.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.720
This is one of the compromises now. But

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.950
if I say the major event summit so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.520
never mind. It's the same summit anyway.
So we are about to start the new

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.130
chapter in the history of the U.N. The

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.500
(inaudible) of this was created at 2000

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.560
 millennium summit and I still remember
the very special atmosphere of the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.170
summit. As the president of this general

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.180
assembly and this meeting I listened

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.430
 very carefully the speakers and what was
said and promised and their body

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.189
language and I really had sincerely the

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.590
feeling that that was something. The

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.039
 United Nations Millennium Declaration
is a truly fundamental and far-reaching

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.399
political commitment for peace, security

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.160
and development. The Millennium

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.160
 Declaration and the Millennium Development
Goals were approved unanimously.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.670
The MDGs, as we call these goals, are

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.440
ambitious and rightly so. The primary

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.440
 aim is to radically reduce poverty. The
U.N. conference in Monterey in 2002

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.080
continue the work and agreed on means

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.720
for financing development. In the same

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.660
 year United Nations Summit in Johannesburg
focused on sustainable

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.430
development and combined the first time

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.630
very visibly the social dimension and

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.320
 ecological issues. So we have the nature
and we have the man. And now I say

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.840
very seriously that there is no need to

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.410
change these political commitments or

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.620
 lower the ambition. To a great extent,
agreement has also been reached on the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.730
means to be used in order to achieve the

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.480
goals.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.620
And, like Mr. Stiglitz has mentioned,

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.890
so as a part of this work and to see means

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 for (inaudible) globalization the ILO,
International Labor Organization, appointed

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.920
in 2002 a world commission on the social

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.290
dimension in globalization. So the ILO

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.290
 financed it but it was an independent
world commission. So, dear friends, many

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.470
good things have happened. But the timetable

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.700
for attaining the MDGs, the goals

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.640
is in many respects lagging behind the
expectation set at the Millennium Summit

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.350
in 2000. And yet it is simply a question

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.050
of transforming political commitment into

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.350
 action and implementation. In theory very
simply (inaudible). We have the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.560
(inaudible) as I mentioned. We have the

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.420
knowledge and we have the resources.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.850
The goals need to become a natural part

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.600
of the implementation of so-called

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.040
 domestic policy objectives and of the
national democratic responsibility. This is

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.810
a

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.189
 challenge. But at the same time of course
we have to see the international

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.520
dimension of the situation, and that's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.129
why globalization is so important.

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:46.699
 Globalization is a mega trend that has
a decisive impact on development and

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.759
people's lives all over the world. And

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:55.740
people feel that the possibility to govern

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.740
 their everyday lives is waiting. The World
Commission had really 24 members

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.800
who represented I believe we said a broad

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.039
variety of views. I have said

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.749
 sometimes that from Davos to Porto Allegro.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:21.150
Three of the members were Americans and

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.599
their views and expertise influenced

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.530
 also strongly to our work. I am already
sure that you were aware that Professor

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.099
Joseph Stiglitz was one of the American

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.439
members. The other two were

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:43.439
 (inaudible) who was the former US Secretary
of Labor (inaudible) and a

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.159
businesswoman and the third one was John

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.539
S. Sweeney, a famous trade

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:57.539
 unionist and the president of the AFL/CIO,
so really a quite different kind of

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.280
opinions already from the USA. Somebody

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.779
has said that this World Commission

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:15.669
 was originally a group of not-like-minded
people, they were just chosen because

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:17.849
they have different kind of opinions.

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:23.389
 But nevertheless this commission reached

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.560
a consensus on its final report

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:32.439
 (inaudible) globalization creating opportunities
for all. So which kind of the report

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.949
it was then? The message of the World

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.599
Commission is critical, really critical but

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:43.990
 yet positive. Globalization continues
to have an enormous potential for improving

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.259
people's quality of life. But at present

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.840
that potential is not fully used. Not enough

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.610
 people are benefiting, too many are suffering
or entirely excluded from

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.770
globalization and it's then unfair. Therefore,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.120
globalization can and should be

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.330
 reformed. The success of the World Commission
report reinforces, I think, the

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.900
fact that we must never fall into the

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.430
trap of one truth.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.960
We cannot think that we just have the

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.110
only truth. Globalization has a very

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.689
 different meaning to people depending
on their personal experiences. People

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:33.710
live their everyday lives as part of a

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.870
local community and a nation even in the

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:43.229
 time of globalization. Fair globalization
means more focus on people and on their

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:50.229
needs. Nation states are still the main

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.770
actors in globalization. The quality of

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.629
 global governance depends to a great extent
on their actions. The way in which

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:00.729
states pursue their own business has an

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.559
impact on whether people benefit from

00:08:03.559 --> 00:08:08.240
 globalization or whether they are spared
from its negative effects. A strong

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.870
democratic state that respects human rights

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.229
and the rule of law and applies good

00:08:14.229 --> 00:08:19.360
 governance and social justice creates
a solid foundation for the actions of

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.370
individual citizens.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.330
Non-governmental organizations and civic

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.319
movements are needed to support all

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:34.000
 this, and they must be able to play fully
their role, be free in that way. In addition

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.190
the business, those who normally are proponents

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.930
of globalization, also should

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:49.020
 hold social responsibility in globalization.
(Inaudible) the nation states we need

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.630
regional cooperation such as the European

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.410
Union and other cooperation

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:02.410
 organizations now already in Asia, in
Latin America, even in Africa, and then of

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.120
course we need the global cooperation.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.470
The commitment of nation states to

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.990
 multilaterals, general values and shared
goals, their awareness of the impact of

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.620
cross-border activities and their commitment

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.210
to solidarity are essential for the

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.400
 quality of global governance.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.900
I believe that efficient implementation

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.300
of the Millennium Development Goals will

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:35.440
 help the developing countries join in
globalization and vice versa. More efficient

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.720
governance and a (inaudible) of globalization

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.230
will turn into a means to attain the

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:50.230
 Millennium Development Goals, MDGs. So
the audience, each country has its

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.920
own history and no model can be transferred

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.370
directly to another country. I think

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.830
 that you have heard it many times in this
building. However, the basic

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.350
components of development are the same,

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.170
the very same in the North and in the

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:19.070
 South, in both developing countries and
more developed countries. And we have

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.630
also agreed in the U.N. of these components.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:27.080
But how does all of this what I am now

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.380
preaching works in practice? So allow me

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:38.690
 to present one example, and not making
the others guilty I take my own country.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.510
Within half a century, Finland has developed

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:46.120
from a poor and remote country to a

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.140
 prosperous and stable society. And those
of you who don't remember what

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.400
Finland is, it's the far-most corner of

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:01.010
Europe, a neighbor to Sweden, Norway and

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:05.790
 Russia. We were 600 years under the Swedish
king and 100 years under the

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.060
Russian Czar. After that when we became

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:14.340
independent, not quite a century ago,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.180
 so we have had since that one civil war,
two other wars and the climate is still the

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.390
same. So that's it.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.920
But what we have done then? Our Nordic

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.730
welfare state model is based upon

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.580
 social justice and equality. We have made
investments in healthcare, education

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.740
and equality. Finland and the other Nordic

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.710
countries often come out on the top in

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.600
 the international comparisons, whether
these concern competitiveness, the

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.200
stability of the public economics, education,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.340
the equality between women and

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:59.790
 men, efforts to reduce poverty, absence
of corruption, or the level of sustainable

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.390
development. Also this university has

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:06.020
made some studies in these comparisons.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:12.190
 So I think that I can say that this kind
of Nordic welfare model has proven to be

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:18.440
just and competitive. Then let's go to

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.440
the regional part. A membership in the

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.130
European Union means economic and political
security for Finland.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.230
Mutual cooperation helps the individual

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.760
member state succeed. The European

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:35.730
 Union strives to promote growth, employment
and competitiveness in a socially

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.200
fair and sustainable manner. These objectives

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.810
are set down in the so-called

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:48.320
 Lisbon Strategy. This strategy is one
model, just one model for ambitious

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.180
regional cooperation that can promote

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.160
better governance of globalization. So

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.990
 anything negative on that? Yes, unfortunately,
the Union and the member states

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.980
have not implemented the strategy effectively

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.660
or on schedule in all respects. And

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:13.070
 that's why we have also difficulty still
in employment. But this is a challenge and

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:16.250
our task to accomplish. But I am very

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.590
happy and proud to tell that it is possible
to

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.310
try to see the schedule and to see how

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.970
it works, but it is really through action
and

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.360
implementation.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.250
So, ladies and gentleman, the World Commission

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:31.820
focused on how the

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.680
consequences of globalization can be taken
into account in policy-making.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.910
Usually discussions on globalization (inaudible)

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.840
only economic factors like

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.630
 growth, inflation, interest rates, economic
deregulation or market access,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.590
important issues of course. But employment

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.310
is the key means in eradication of

00:13:54.310 --> 00:14:01.310
 poverty. Therefore, also employment should
be made into a global goal. I think

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.830
it's not too much to ask to have a decent

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.410
job which brings a livelihood for yourself

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:15.410
 and your family, a decent job. However,
far too many people just dream about it.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:21.890
If the employment impacts of economic

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.480
policy assistance would be systemically

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.940
 assessed, that alone might bring improvement
in this situation.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.360
We also need to do more for the equality

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.120
between women and men. We cannot

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.010
 make a real success in reducing poverty
unless the position of women is

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:45.180
improved. They are the majority of the

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:52.180
goal, not minority. It follows therefore that

00:14:53.280 --> 00:15:00.280
 mainstreaming equality in all activities
is crucial and urgent goal, and you can be

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.060
sure that I will repeat this also in the

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.250
U.N. (Inaudible) and (inaudible) global

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.000
 policies are crucial for controlling the
negative effects of globalization.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.250
International organizations must be willing

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.340
for cooperation and welcome each

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.590
 other's particular strengths. I have in
mind, for example, the need to improve the

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:24.940
coherence between trade regulations and

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.290
the development agenda.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:31.040
Very often what we had just done with

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.540
the development agenda will be spoiled or

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:43.540
 made very difficult with trade agenda.
So for a year now we have been gathering

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.680
feedback on the World Commission Report

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.040
and I have been favorably surprised

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:56.630
 by the amount of interest in the report
and people's willingness to discuss its

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.340
recommendations. I believe that our report

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.370
is becoming part of the process of

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.170
 turning globalization into a fair process
that creates opportunities for all. I think

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.370
that Mr. Stiglitz and I do remember that

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.570
we all were wondering in the commission

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:22.570
 that one thing is to make a good report,
but even more important thing is to make

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.250
report to be a part of the process, because

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.610
the world is full of reports, good

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.470
 papers.

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.260
But the process, action, the implementation

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.880
is what we need. But people can

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.270
 help in that. So what is now with this
paper? The African Union has assumed

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.980
the recommendations of the World Commission

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.220
as a part of their globalization

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.990
 work. The social dimension of globalization
is also high up on the European

00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:00.950
Union's agenda. Last December, the United

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.430
Nations General Assembly

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.689
 unanimously approved a resolution whereby
the report of the World Commission

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:11.350
was approved as one of the basic documents

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:13.860
for this U.N. major event or

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:20.559
 whatever was the name today. In addition,
the topic has come up to both the

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:27.249
World Bank and the OECD. So that was very

00:17:27.249 --> 00:17:29.929
good. But as I said, a report is a

00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:30.509
 report.

00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:33.850
We must concentrate on creating means

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.190
and processes to reform globalization

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:41.620
 and influence its direction. Finland and
Tanzania have together with friendly

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.350
governments initiated the Helsinki Process.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:46.840
Last week a conference took place

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:51.499
 in Helsinki as a culmination event of
the Helsinki Process. The key measures of

00:17:51.499 --> 00:17:55.480
the conference was the need for the multi-state

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.360
cooperation in finding lasting

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.669
 solutions to global problems. The ultimate
aim of the Helsinki Process is to make

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:05.100
multi-state cooperation a permanent feature

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:12.100
of global governance. So we old

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:19.330
 fellows in that way, President of Tanzania,
Mr. Benjamin Mkapa and I, we were

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:22.299
co-chairing this commission as it was

00:18:22.299 --> 00:18:24.909
our discussion. We participated in the

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:30.639
 conference and were very happy to see
the one consequence of the process so

00:18:30.639 --> 00:18:32.440
far.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.090
For the future all interested parties

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.519
are welcome to join the Helsinki Process and

00:18:37.519 --> 00:18:41.639
 already now there are several countries
which are trying to make the Helsinki

00:18:41.639 --> 00:18:46.980
Consensus as well known as one other consensus.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.059
So ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:50.059 --> 00:18:55.269
 this year the United Nations is the focus
of celebration but it is also the subject

00:18:55.269 --> 00:18:55.690
of

00:18:55.690 --> 00:19:00.580
 the critical assessment. The world has
changed and the security threats are

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.580
different. Nevertheless, the United Nations

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.990
Charter represents the values that

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:13.990
 will enable us to preserve security and
stable conditions in the future world as

00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:18.909
well as balance development. All countries,

00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:22.970
both great big ones and the small

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.960
 and poor ones, they are needed in the
international cooperation that will ensure

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.799
development security and human rights.

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:34.679
And when I am now here in Columbia University

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:37.620
I want to say very strongly that

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.460
 this international cooperation particularly
needs the participation of the United

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.460
States of America. You its political and

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:49.870
economic power, you its many

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:56.870
 resources, so I hope you will be among
those people who will make this wish of

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.559
mine true. I have high expectations for

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:04.870
the U.N. major event. It is a unique

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.649
 opportunity to give a new vitality to
the United Nations and the implementation

00:20:09.649 --> 00:20:10.639
of

00:20:10.639 --> 00:20:15.710
 the Millennium Development Goals. I still
hope that we will be able this week to

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.740
reinforce people's belief in the future

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.230
and that we will be prepared to openly

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.779
 acknowledge existing problems, including
the lack of the political will or the unfair

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:30.309
distribution of the resources. Multilateral

00:20:30.309 --> 00:20:32.249
work is needed in order to strengthen

00:20:32.249 --> 00:20:33.929
 fair processes of development.

00:20:33.929 --> 00:20:39.279
 Finally, I would like to highlight one

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:42.999
important recommendation in the World

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:48.809
 Commission of the Globalization Report
in particular, for the benefit of you this

00:20:48.809 --> 00:20:53.309
audience. Policy actions need to be grounded

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:56.470
in better analysis of trends in

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.070
 globalization and its impact on people
and communities. Better and more

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.490
gender-sensitive monitoring, research,

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.440
policy reviews and systematic reporting

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:12.710
 are all necessary to mobilize public opinion
and ensure better governance of

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.330
globalization. The World Commission encourages

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.129
all institutions and networks to

00:21:18.129 --> 00:21:23.470
 collaborate and invest in broad-based
research on the social dimension of

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.129
globalization. Networks of national, regional

00:21:27.129 --> 00:21:29.749
and international institutions can

00:21:29.749 --> 00:21:34.679
 build the capacity needed to address different
aspects of globalization in a

00:21:34.679 --> 00:21:36.249
coherent way.

00:21:36.249 --> 00:21:39.919
In conclusion, I would like to encourage

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:43.230
you to continue open and critical

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:47.799
 research, teaching and instruction in
your various expert areas and departments.

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:51.190
I encourage you to share your information

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.100
with the entire international

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.330
 community. Many of the leading academic
institutions of the world are located

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.029
here in New York, including your Columbia

00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:04.789
University. You are in the position of

00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:08.419
 a great privilege in the worldwide academic
community, and this brings with the

00:22:08.419 --> 00:22:15.419
greatest responsibility. I trust in you.

00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:17.280
Many thanks for your attention.
