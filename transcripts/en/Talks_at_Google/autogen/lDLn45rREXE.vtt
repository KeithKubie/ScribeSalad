EILEEN NAUGHTON: --all
have a quick message for us

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.570
in the form of a video.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:54.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.730
We're not going
to run the video?

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.300
OK.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.710
We're going to
introduce the cast.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.925
So I'd first like to welcome
the wise and wonderful Oprah

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:06.425
Winfrey.

00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:08.126
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.020
Oprah.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:19.520
Oprah--

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.055
[CHEERING] --you have some fans.

00:16:24.055 --> 00:16:25.660
OPRAH WINFREY:
Wise and wonderful.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.160
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Wise and wonderful.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.300
[CHEERING]

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.810
Oprah's humanity and sage
advice have touched us deeply.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.690
And by us, I mean human kind.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:38.200
Oprah is a media icon, an
Oscar-nominated actress,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.670
producer, philanthropist.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.280
She's also-- one of my
favorite things about you,

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.220
Oprah-- is you're the founder
of the Oprah Winfrey Leadership

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.060
Academy for Girls in
South Africa, which

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.550
provides educational
and leadership

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:54.400
opportunities for
academically gifted girls

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.230
from disadvantaged backgrounds.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.030
Thank you for that.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.029
OPRAH WINFREY: Big supporter
of Girls, Inc. too.

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:01.270
[CHEERS]

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.295
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Oprah
is a fairy godmother,

00:17:03.295 --> 00:17:07.630
and she plays Mrs. Which
in "A Wrinkle in Time".

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:08.500
Welcome, Oprah.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:13.839
And next, we have Ava,
Ava Duvernay, a filmmaker,

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.230
producer, and screenwriter who
directed "A Wrinkle in Time".

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.640
[CHEERING]

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.400
You can sit if you'd like.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.668
And the 2014

00:17:23.668 --> 00:17:27.260
[CHEERING]

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.840
Oscar-nominated
film, "Selma", which

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.360
chronicles Dr.
Martin Luther King's

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.820
Jr.'s leadership in the
struggle for voting rights.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.630
Ava has the rare distinction
of being an Academy Award

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.230
and Golden Globe-nominated
director of both documentary

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:43.010
and feature films.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.780
Welcome, Ava.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.930
[CHEERING]

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.340
Next, we have Storm Reid.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:48.230
Storm is here.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.470
[CHEERING]

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.940
Storm began acting--

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.000
There's Storm.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.560
Storm began acting when
she was three years old.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.570
She's 14 right now,
so she's growing

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.860
up right before her eyes.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.450
Storm plays the lead role of Meg
Murry in "A Wrinkle in Time".

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:12.200
And among other
roles, Storm appeared

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.560
in the Academy Award-winning
film, "Twelve Years a Slave".

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.070
And we have Gugu Mbatha-raw,
an English actress

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.310
known for many roles in
British TV and film, including

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.930
a recurring role in the
"Doctor Who" TV series,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.295
and Plumette in
"Beauty and the Beast".

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.750
More than half the roles
that Gugu has appeared in

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.425
were directed by women, which
is, in itself, quite notable.

00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:41.760
And in "Wrinkle in Time", she
plays Meg's mother, wonderful,

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.380
wonderful Meg's mother.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.930
So why don't we sit
down, ladies, and start?

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.680
I was able to see "A
Wrinkle in Time" this week.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.930
And it's a magical
visually enchanting movie

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.400
about a young girl who travels
across a time-space dimension

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.360
to save her father, a
physicist, from dark forces

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.620
in the universe.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.480
Now what really struck
me, in the movie,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.880
was how central women are
to the entire storyline.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.950
Meg Murry is not a
damsel in distress.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:14.560
She is a young woman on a
mission to find her father.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:18.260
She was aided in her
quest by kind boys and men

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.960
and by mystical,
magical, powerful women.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.000
So congratulations, ladies,
on a great achievement.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.500
Ava--

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.060
--now I understand that you
weren't expecting and might

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.030
have been surprised to
receive a call from Disney

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.380
to direct this film.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.320
And you hadn't read
Madeleine L'Engle's novel

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.860
before being offered
this project.

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.200
What was it about the
script and the project

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.559
that really appealed to you?

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:46.600
AVA DUVERNAY: Well, thank
you all for being here.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.018
Really, really happy to see you.

00:19:49.018 --> 00:19:53.310
And one thing I want to say
about the women in the book

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.500
and in our film is that
Gugu Mbatha-Raw does not

00:19:58.500 --> 00:19:59.940
play just her mother.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:02.160
She's an astrophysicist.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.250
She's Dr. Kate Murry, which
is really important because we

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.770
want to make sure that we know
that girls can participate

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.780
in STEM.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.030
That's important in medicine,
education, math, science,

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:13.150
all that good stuff.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.240
So we want to make
sure we point that out.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.530
Don't ask her to do any math
problems here on the stage,

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:21.050
but she does them in the movie.

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.730
But, yeah, it was really cool
to get a call from Disney.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.830
Because sometimes in
Hollywood, Hollywood

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.500
likes you to ask
for permission, just

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.140
like a lot of people in life
want girls and women to ask

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.410
for permission to do things.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:39.320
They want us to
sometimes pinch ourselves

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:45.370
and sometimes to prove that
you're worth doing something.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.340
And so we find that in
a lot of places in life.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.340
But now and then, you get
a beautiful experience

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.310
when people welcome you in,
and they love you just the way

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.810
you are.

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:54.810
And that's what happened
to me at Disney.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.510
They called me, and they
said, we love your work,

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.730
we love your voice, and
we want you to just come

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.039
in and be who you are.

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:02.580
And those are the
kind of experiences

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.520
you want to embrace.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.880
Those are the kind of people
you want to align yourself with,

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.470
and those are the
kind of people that we

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.720
were able to make "A Wrinkle
in Time" with at Disney.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.511
EILEEN NAUGHTON: That's
a remarkable story.

00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:14.697
You did not pick up a camera
to direct until you were 33.

00:21:14.697 --> 00:21:15.905
AVA DUVERNAY: Now that's old.

00:21:15.905 --> 00:21:18.005
Well, all of the
kids know that's old.

00:21:18.005 --> 00:21:19.796
EILEEN NAUGHTON: It's
very young, actually.

00:21:19.796 --> 00:21:22.320
AVA DUVERNAY: It's
older for directors

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.250
because most directors start
20, 21, in their early 20s.

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.890
So to start in your
30s, it's unusual.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.390
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
So advice would you

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.580
give women, and
particularly young girls,

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.280
about following their
dreams, their tropisms

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.840
and having courage?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.520
AVA DUVERNAY: It's
really just, what

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.910
you're doing now does not
have to be what you always do.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.250
Who you are right now is not
who you're always going to be.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.760
And just know that
there are steps to take.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.400
There are other paths
to follow, to explore.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.500
But don't feel
stuck in one place.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.700
Embrace where you are now.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.250
Learn what you can from it,
but also stay open to the fact

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.290
that there are other
things that you can do.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.200
A lot of people talk
about me and my journey

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.400
in terms of race and gender, but
part of my story is also age.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.370
Because in the industry that I'm
in, I got a start quite late.

00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.680
And it's just proof that
nothing is impossible.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.605
It really isn't.

00:22:14.605 --> 00:22:16.230
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Nothing is impossible,

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:17.590
ladies and gentlemen.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.090
OK.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.150
Oprah, the character
you play, Mrs. Which,

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.770
is the wisest woman
in the universe.

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:27.900
And as Eva said, in casting
you, she picked the wisest woman

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.771
in real life.

00:22:30.771 --> 00:22:31.270
And--

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.486
--when you see the movie,
it's phantasmagorical,

00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:38.610
and there are times where--

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.364
[CHEERING]

00:22:42.364 --> 00:22:43.530
AVA DUVERNAY: You scared me.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.696
OPRAH WINFREY: Sorry, y'all.

00:22:44.696 --> 00:22:47.090
AVA DUVERNAY: I was
like, what's happening.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.050
I'm sorry.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.410
EILEEN NAUGHTON: We'll get
to you in a moment, Reese.

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:50.360
OPRAH WINFREY: Mrs.
Whatsit just popped in.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.360
AVA DUVERNAY: It's Reese
Witherspoon, everybody.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.522
[CHEERING]

00:22:54.522 --> 00:22:56.230
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Hello,
Mrs. Whatsit just

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.300
came from the United
Nations, where

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.550
she was representing women
for International Women's Day.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.095
So thank you, Reese,
for being here.

00:23:04.095 --> 00:23:06.370
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Thank you, thank you.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:06.830
I love seeing all
these Girls Inc. girls.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.246
EILEEN NAUGHTON: We were just
in the middle of her talking

00:23:09.246 --> 00:23:13.660
about the remarkable character,
Mrs. Which, that Oprah plays,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.990
and this larger-than-life
figure who

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:22.060
guides Meg through the
universe and gives her courage.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.911
Tell me what it is about this
role that appealed to you

00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:26.994
because it seemed natural.

00:23:26.994 --> 00:23:29.240
OPRAH WINFREY: I have to
say, well, first of all,

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.140
let me just say that one of
the reasons this role happened

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:35.290
to me is because I am a
friend of Ava DuVernay's.

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.700
I do not use that term lightly
because over the years,

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.240
I have chosen my
friends carefully.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.140
And I have had a
best friend, Gayle,

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.580
who's been my best friend
since we were 21 and 22.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.695
I actively sought
another friend.

00:23:53.695 --> 00:23:56.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.880
Because Gayle is busy a lot.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.170
And I actively sought
another friend.

00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:06.460
So someone had shown
me a DVD of Ava's work

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.190
for another movie called
"The Middle of Nowhere".

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.220
And I liked the movie, and
then I went and looked up--

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.140
Googled her.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.060
I Googled her.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.895
Hello, Google, I Googled her.

00:24:17.895 --> 00:24:21.080
[CHEERING]

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:27.230
And there I saw this
essence of someone

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.470
who I wanted to be my friend.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.670
First of all, she was
a girl with glasses.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.380
She looked like me,
and I thought, gee

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.380
I want to be her friend.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.550
So I actively sought
to create an event

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.240
so that she could
come to my house

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.730
so that she would be my friend.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.040
So that worked.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.720
And then, I, as a
friend, when you

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.450
have a friend that you
love and you care about,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.222
you want to do everything you
can to support your friends.

00:24:56.222 --> 00:24:57.680
That's the kind of
friend you want.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.970
You want a friend that
wants for you, as much

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.460
as you want something,
they want it even more.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.590
So I wanted to support my
friend in doing this film.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.391
So I said, I'm going to
come to New Zealand, girl.

00:25:13.391 --> 00:25:16.320
And I'm going watch you
work and say, action.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.640
And I just want to be there
when you tell all those people

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.204
action and cut.

00:25:22.204 --> 00:25:24.620
And I kept saying it, oh, I'm
coming to New Zealand, girl.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.703
I'm coming to New Zealand.

00:25:25.703 --> 00:25:28.340
And she said, if you're
really going to do that, would

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.140
you consider reading this part.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.190
And I said, yeah,
girl, I'll do that.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.320
So that's actually
how it happened.

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.240
Because I was seeking
her as a friend,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.970
I saw something in her
essence that has turned out

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.740
to be even more profound.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.290
So then I read
this role, and it's

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.840
like everything I could
imagine for myself.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.050
So I had a wonderful
mother, friend, teacher,

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:55.931
mentor named Maya Angelou.

00:25:55.931 --> 00:25:56.930
Do you know who that is?

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.520
So I read her book when
I was about your age,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.260
and then I ended up
becoming her daughter.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.100
And so she was my spiritual
guide, mentor, teacher.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:14.840
And I modeled this character,
Mrs. Which, from Maya Angelou

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.370
and from the Wizard of
Oz, Glinda the Good Witch.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.840
So when Glinda the
Good Witch says,

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.340
you've always had
the power, I think

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.881
that's one of the
greatest teachings.

00:26:23.881 --> 00:26:26.960
So to be able to have
Maya Angelou and Glinda

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.410
the Good Witch and then a
bit of my own self in there.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.960
Because in the very
beginning, when

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.750
Mrs. Which first shows up at
the beginning of the film,

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.910
and she says to Meg,
all you have to do

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:45.980
is find the right frequency
and have faith in who you are,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.740
that is my true philosophy
for how you live your life.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.170
And if I had any advice to give
to you all today, that is it.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.270
It starts at the
beginning of the movie.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.900
All you have to do is
find the right frequency.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.060
Because everybody has their own
frequency that is just yours.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.220
And when you can
ride that frequency,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:11.990
find the flow that is for
you and have faith in that,

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.069
unimaginable things
become possible for you.

00:27:14.069 --> 00:27:15.360
So that's why I love the movie.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.162
For that message and
for my friend, Ava.

00:27:17.162 --> 00:27:18.620
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Beautiful message.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.650
And it's a beautiful lesson
for us here today, and I think,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.670
Reese, welcome, you have found
your right frequency lately.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.660
It's remarkable.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.760
You all know Reese
Witherspoon, actress, director,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.090
entrepreneur.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.900
She has her own production
company, Hello Sunshine,

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.294
which really is your frequency.

00:27:37.294 --> 00:27:38.960
REESE WITHERSPOON:
That is my frequency.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.680
EILEEN NAUGHTON: But you've also
become really actively involved

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.210
in a number of women's
advocacy organizations,

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:47.360
so for that, we thank you.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.920
I understand you read this book
when you were a young girl.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.700
And how did you feel that
Ava's film enhances the story

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.690
and makes it more
relevant to the world

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.815
that we're living today
and experiencing today?

00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:01.190
REESE WITHERSPOON:
Well, the book

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.020
was written quite a while ago.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.900
I think Ava did an
extraordinary job.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.670
I read this book when I
was 12, and I loved it.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.230
And I think primarily because
I loved science fiction,

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.771
and I hadn't read
a lot of books that

00:28:11.771 --> 00:28:13.890
had a girl at the center of it.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.800
So I thought I was
Meg Murry and I

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.670
was going to travel through the
universe and do amazing things.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.210
And I loved all of
that, and then I

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.460
read every book in the series.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.720
So I was just
completely obsessed.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.650
And so when Ava called me to
be in it, I was so excited.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.250
I didn't know who
I would play either

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:35.600
because the misseses are all
billions and billions of years

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.700
old.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.680
My son said, what does she
want you to play, an old lady?

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.510
But she, of course, had
this beautiful vision

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:52.790
of making them timeless and
celestial and intergalactic.

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:56.600
And they have these qualities
that are the qualities

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.930
that you'd want to have three
incredible women guide you

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.530
through the universe,
wisdom, a sense of fun,

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.060
and a sense of past.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.100
And I just think
it was beautiful,

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.515
the way she imagined it.

00:29:08.515 --> 00:29:09.890
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
And you have one

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:11.900
of the most beautiful
transformations

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:17.650
from a somewhat human form into
this mystical flying creature.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.930
It was one of the most
exciting scenes in the movie.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.080
Can we talk a little bit
about the special effects

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.780
and the challenge
in creating a movie

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.350
like that, that so heavily
relies on technology, really,

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:32.930
to produce these effects?

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.460
AVA DUVERNAY: Yeah,
no, I think it

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.160
was a beautiful team
that worked on the film

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.640
and the special effects with me.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.550
Our visual effects
supervisor, Rich McBride,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.200
also a great woman
over at Disney

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.850
who heads up special
effects there,

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.460
Mimi Steele, another
woman Tamara Kent.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.760
So a lot of women on
our visual effects team.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.010
But I think the actress
that was most impacted

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:56.630
by the visual effects was Storm
Reid because Storm Reid, as Meg

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.680
Murry, gets to fly.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.054
And that's one of
the reasons why

00:29:59.054 --> 00:30:01.220
I wanted to make this
movie, to see a girl fly,

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.310
hop planets, save the
world from the darkness,

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:05.980
and do all these amazing things.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.290
But Storm actually, you
know, put her in a harness,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.137
hiked her up in the air, and
she had to fly through the air.

00:30:12.137 --> 00:30:13.220
It looked like it was fun.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.755
STORM REID: It was fun.

00:30:14.755 --> 00:30:16.380
EILEEN NAUGHTON: And
it was believable.

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.130
You did it believably.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:18.046
STORM REID: Thank you.

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:20.840
I had some challenges, and
it was a learning curve

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.980
with the stunts and the special
effects and green screen

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.190
all working together.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.030
It was a challenge, but Miss
Ava was right there in my corner

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.870
and helping me and showing me
previs, which is basically,

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.840
the animation of what's
going to be in the film.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.980
So she helped a lot.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.430
And it was still
hard because you

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.680
have to imagine the
unimaginable, which

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.460
is really hard.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.750
But it came together.

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:46.356
AVA DUVERNAY: So
there was one scene--

00:30:46.356 --> 00:30:48.034
STORM REID: No,
don't rat me out.

00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:48.950
AVA DUVERNAY: I'm not.

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:49.834
I'm not.

00:30:49.834 --> 00:30:52.250
She did a really good job, and
you'll see it in the movie.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:55.880
But there was one scene
where I said, OK, Storm,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.360
here in this place, you're
standing here in a field.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.120
A tree is going to pop up
fully grown from the ground.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.010
And she's like, OK.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.020
And I said, so can
you imagine that?

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.050
But she's an actress so she
goes through her feelings.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.920
So she's never experienced
a tree popping up

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.180
from the ground, fully grown.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.060
So she was like, so it's
going to just pop up

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.360
like pop up from the ground
or on top of the ground.

00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.550
I said, no, from the ground,
Storm, from the ground.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.680
So it took an--

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.930
STORM REID: It took some time.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.310
AVA DUVERNAY: --intellectual
approach to it.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.200
But those are the kinds
of fantastic spaces

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.500
that she found herself in.

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.800
And she was 13 years
old when she did it.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.570
So when you watch
the movie, imagine

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:38.690
this 13-year-old
actress, brilliant girl,

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:40.800
doing all of these
amazing things.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.685
She's the real
warrior of our movie.

00:31:42.685 --> 00:31:42.990
STORM REID: Thank you.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.280
AVA DUVERNAY: Truly.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.696
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
I love it, Storm.

00:31:44.696 --> 00:31:46.142
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:46.142 --> 00:31:49.430
Storm, Meg is a
beloved character

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:55.370
and a brave and determined
girl, a physics whiz.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.900
You've mentioned that you really
saw yourself in that character.

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.240
What was it about Meg?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.470
STORM REID: Yes.

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.900
Well, when I was reading
"A Wrinkle in Time"

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.020
in the sixth grade,
I didn't see myself

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.780
as being Meg because she
wasn't written that way.

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:14.240
And I'm a very visual
person so if I'm

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.180
reading something and something
is written a way, then

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:17.990
that's how it is.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.390
And I could love it, and I did.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.550
But once I got the script and
Miss Ava sent it over to me,

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:25.450
I felt like it just all clicked.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.560
And it made sense,
and it made sense

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.650
for a girl at the
center of the universe

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.020
to be African-American
to represent

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.375
African-American girls
and just girls in general.

00:32:35.375 --> 00:32:37.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:41.180
Yes, and just represent
girls in general.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.750
And then, going into Meg,
I feel like everybody

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.000
can find a little piece
of Meg in themselves.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.770
And I feel like Meg is very
determined and strong-willed,

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:53.160
and I feel like
I'm the same way.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.610
So I feel like personally, we
kind of are on the same level.

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.770
And I feel like as girls and
as just teenagers growing up

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:02.720
in this dark world,
we're just trying

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.420
to grow up and find ourselves
and surround ourselves

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.070
by good people.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.230
And sometimes, we have
challenges and mistakes

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.716
and faults on top of that.

00:33:10.716 --> 00:33:12.340
So that's what we're
all going through.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.610
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Well,
we're just human, Storm.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:14.450
We love it.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.575
OPRAH WINFREY: I think it's
important to note, too,

00:33:16.575 --> 00:33:19.460
that Ava fought to get this Meg.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.930
She fought to get Storm.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.178
Will you tell that story?

00:33:22.178 --> 00:33:22.886
AVA DUVERNAY: Oh.

00:33:22.886 --> 00:33:24.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.534
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Oprah is
channeling her inner Oprah

00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:27.515
right now.

00:33:27.515 --> 00:33:29.390
AVA DUVERNAY: Well,
there were a lot of girls

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.223
all over the world who
auditioned to be Meg.

00:33:31.223 --> 00:33:34.730
And you're looking for
that special girl who

00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:38.580
encompasses everything that
this beautiful character has

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.540
symbolized for so many decades,
since the book was published

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.490
in 1963.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.201
And so you're looking
for the one girl.

00:33:46.201 --> 00:33:48.200
And so out of the hundreds
of girls that we saw,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.420
Storm Reid was the one
who was meant to be Meg.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:56.450
And I think it really speaks
to, everyone has their place.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:00.450
Everyone has somewhere or some
place that they're meant to be,

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.990
someone in the world
that you're meant

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.110
to be connected with in
your family, something

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.480
that you're supposed
to be in your classroom

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.690
or in your life,
if you're an adult.

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:16.079
And once you align with
that place, it just clicks.

00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:17.120
And that's what happened.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:19.310
Storm was not just
in the right place

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.179
at the right time,
her whole life,

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:24.139
she was moving towards
being in that audition room

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:26.330
and being ready to be Meg.

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.260
All of the little steps that
brought her to be in the place,

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.800
in the time, in the
space to fulfill

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.920
and be something important to
someone else, and that was me.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.350
And so whether you're an
actress and it's your time

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.870
to be in a movie,
which is a rare thing,

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.570
or whether it's your
opportunity to be someone

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:46.850
important to someone
in your life,

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.449
you have to cultivate
yourself each and every day.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.790
So that when the
opportunity comes

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.949
to really stand up
and step up and be

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:58.100
someone important to someone,
that you're ready to do that.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.010
And Storm did that.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.730
So when it was her
time and I met her,

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.170
she was ready to be
someone important to me

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:06.780
and to be someone who
carries this whole movie.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:12.170
So I think her journey
can speak to anyone,

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.620
in terms of prepare every day in
your life to be a great person

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.540
so that when the moment
of greatness arises,

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:18.638
you're ready for it.

00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:19.763
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Beautiful.

00:35:19.763 --> 00:35:21.695
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:21.695 --> 00:35:27.190
Now, Gugu, you play Dr.
Kate Murry, Meg's mother

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:29.410
and a scientist and
an equal partner

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.830
to your wild scientist
physicist husband.

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:34.000
What did that feel like?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.250
And rumor is that you
got to hang out at NASA.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.104
Is that true?

00:35:37.104 --> 00:35:38.020
GUGU MBATHA-RAW: Yeah.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.190
Well, it was a
real honor for me.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:44.531
I think getting to work with
Ava, who I've admired for such

00:35:44.531 --> 00:35:46.780
a long time, getting to play
a scientist, as you said,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.020
in the book, she's often
described as Mrs. Murry.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.050
And the idea that we have
Dr. Kate, that she's not just

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:58.480
defined by her marriage, that
is an equal partner to Dr. Alex

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.150
Murry, played by Chris Pine.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.030
And for me, it was really
fascinating to kind of cling

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.000
onto this idea that he's
been away for four years.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.800
What this marriage
and this family

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.950
is based on is
obviously love, but also

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:14.020
this intellectual
meeting of minds,

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.324
that she's really found her
partner in life who is--

00:36:18.324 --> 00:36:19.990
we sort of talked
about them like a sort

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.730
of power couple of science.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:23.740
You know, that they
would do these TED Talks,

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.050
that they were
sort of like this--

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.660
I don't know, that their
connection was intellectual

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.330
and not just love and family.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.980
And that's what
really kept her going

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.140
and kept her trying
to figure out

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.370
where he was in that long time.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.730
So yes, we did get
to go and visit

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:43.060
JPL in Pasadena,
which was fascinating.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.570
Getting to meet
real-- have you been?

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.530
So I saw heads go, yes.

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:49.270
Getting to meet real
scientists, people

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.690
who are really planning missions
to Mars, it was so interesting.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:58.660
We also met this wonderful
doctor, Dr. Stephon Alexander,

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:01.690
who wrote this book called,
"The Jazz of Physics",

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.000
and he sort of
correlated the link

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.460
between the work
of John Coltrane

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:10.130
the saxophonist and
science and physics.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.580
And I mean, it was
mind blowing to me,

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.310
and I can't pretend that I
have retained all of it now.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.910
AVA DUVERNAY: We'll give
you a pop quiz on equations.

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:19.550
GUGU MBATHA-RAW:
But it was great.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.240
And the fact that Ava had him
as the consultant on the movie,

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.617
to be able to introduce us
to that world of science,

00:37:24.617 --> 00:37:25.450
is really inspiring.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:26.380
EILEEN NAUGHTON: What
a rich experience

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:28.150
for you all and for us all.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.790
You know, Time Magazine notes,
in its review of the movie,

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.340
that the book and
movie is about what

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:37.180
it means to be a source of light
in a world in which darkness

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.010
seems only to proliferate.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:43.510
Oprah, you have a beautiful
line in the movie about darkness

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.650
being stronger than light.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:46.400
Can you talk to us a
little bit about that

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.980
because several of
you have already

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.540
mentioned darkness in
the world, and this

00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:51.760
is such an inspiring film.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.468
OPRAH WINFREY: What
I think is incredible

00:37:53.468 --> 00:37:56.650
is that when Madeleine
L'Engle wrote it in 1962,

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.350
she was talking about
the Cold War and all

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:06.400
of the experiences of
that day and Civil Rights

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:12.370
Movement and everything
that people were facing.

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:13.900
And what I know is
that you're never

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.207
going to run out of
darkness, as you're not

00:38:16.207 --> 00:38:17.290
going to run out of light.

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:19.660
Because this is
the planet Earth,

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:24.610
and we are the planet of yin
and yang, of darkness and light,

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:25.690
of opposites.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.960
And so the darkness,
which Mrs. Which says

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.160
is spreading so fast
these days, the only thing

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.650
faster than light
is the darkness.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.980
And so you need
warriors of the light

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.921
to help banish the darkness.

00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:44.170
If you think about it, if
we turned all the lights off

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:48.550
in this room, and you were
only holding a small candle,

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.380
that candle would
light up the darkness.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:52.390
It would help to
banish the darkness.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:55.210
It only takes a little
bit of your light

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:56.470
to banish the darkness.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:00.040
It takes a lot of darkness
to overcome the light.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.510
But just a little
flicker from you.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.340
And so, wherever there is
confusion, wherever there's

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.160
jealousy, as Mrs. Which
talks about and is

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:12.880
able to show everyone in the
movie what that darkness looks

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.130
like, where it shows
up in your life,

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:18.010
just a little bit
of your light helps

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.500
to dissipate and destroy that.

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.810
So I think it's
about these times,

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.110
and all times are about
you reaching for the light

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:27.460
inside yourself.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.070
And that's the real
work of your life,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.490
is to figure out who
you are and how do

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:38.540
you become more of who you are.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.330
Not what your
friends are, not even

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.180
what your mother and your father
and everybody wants you to be.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.190
But this journey,
particularly at this stage

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:48.820
in your development,
is about, who am I,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:51.610
and how do I become
more of that.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.860
And how do I bring
more of my light.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.982
First to yourself,
because you've got

00:39:55.982 --> 00:39:57.190
to give it to yourself first.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:00.700
You can't give to yourself
what you don't have.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.440
So you fill yourself up.

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.340
And I used to be so
afraid of people saying,

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.631
oh, she's so full of herself,
she's so full of herself.

00:40:06.631 --> 00:40:09.320
And now, I work on--

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.450
you've heard that before?

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:12.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.320
Forget those people.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.910
Those people are
not your friends.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:19.990
What you want to work on
is filling yourself up

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:24.000
with as much light, as much
kindness, as much goodness,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.050
as much preparation.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.300
Because that's
what luck is, being

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.814
prepared so when the moment
of opportunity shows up--

00:40:29.814 --> 00:40:31.230
a lot of people
will look at Storm

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.120
and say, oh, she's so lucky.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.100
She's lucky because
she was prepared.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.445
Luck is just preparation meeting
that moment of opportunity.

00:40:38.445 --> 00:40:41.140
If she wasn't prepared,
she wouldn't be here.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.480
So your job is to fill
yourself with as much light.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.760
Light comes from
all that is good,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.270
all that is grace, all that
is kindness, and then offer

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.770
that to the world.

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:54.729
That will be your
gift to the world.

00:40:54.729 --> 00:40:56.062
So that's why I love this movie.

00:40:56.062 --> 00:40:56.400
That's the message.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.733
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Well thank you.

00:40:57.733 --> 00:40:59.243
And this movie gives us all--

00:40:59.243 --> 00:41:01.207
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:01.207 --> 00:41:05.540
--hope, and thank you all for
being warriors for the light

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.355
and for goodness.

00:41:06.355 --> 00:41:07.940
And now, I think we have--

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.870
since we are live
streaming on YouTube,

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.200
we have a few questions
for all of you

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.000
from our global audience.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.410
So we're going to go to them.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.660
AVA DUVERNAY: Global audience?

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.580
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Yes,
it's a worldwide--

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.246
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:41:19.246 --> 00:41:35.804

00:41:35.804 --> 00:41:36.455
[END PLAYBACK]

00:41:36.455 --> 00:41:36.980
AVA DUVERNAY: Yes.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.670
Well, thank you.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.760
Great question from Spain.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.475
The soundtrack of the
movie is beautiful.

00:41:43.475 --> 00:41:46.400
The first artist that
I put on the soundtrack

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.720
was Storm Reid's
favorite artist,

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.450
just because I wanted
to make her happy,

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:53.442
but also because
she's a great artist.

00:41:53.442 --> 00:41:54.275
Her name is Kehlani.

00:41:54.275 --> 00:41:55.972
I don't know if you
all know Kehlani,

00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:58.461
but she's on the piece.

00:41:58.461 --> 00:41:59.960
And then one of my
favorite artists,

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:02.340
because I want to
make myself happy too,

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.980
Sade is on the album.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.140
So incredible.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.010
Sia is on the album Chloe
and Halle are on the album.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:13.160
Demi Lovato and DJ
Khaled are on the album.

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.950
So it's a really, really
great mix of voices.

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.350
And you put the music
with the images,

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.547
and it just uplifts you
as you watch the film.

00:42:20.547 --> 00:42:22.130
EILEEN NAUGHTON:
Wonderful, beautiful.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.930
We have a question,
next, from France.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.226
OPRAH WINFREY: Bonjour.

00:42:27.226 --> 00:42:28.225
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Brazil?

00:42:28.225 --> 00:42:29.594
Oh, it's Brazil, not France.

00:42:29.594 --> 00:42:30.260

00:42:43.389 --> 00:42:45.180
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Look
how beautiful she is.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.013
OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah.

EILEEN NAUGHTON: Aw, beijos.

00:43:00.386 --> 00:43:02.219
AVA DUVERNAY: It's a
good one for you, Gugu.

00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:05.100
GUGU MBATHA-RAW: Yeah, I mean,
for me, probably growing up,

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.310
I was relatively confident,
but I was an only child.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.893
So I didn't have many people to
play with and stuff like that.

00:43:09.893 --> 00:43:12.320
So for me, actually,
acting gave me confidence.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.050
I think being able to find
something that I loved.

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:16.760
I loved dancing initially.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.910
When I was about four or
five, I went to dance class,

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.240
and I just loved feeling free,
expressing myself with my body.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.420
It sort of helped me get
rid of my inhibitions.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.600
And it was so much fun.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.780
I think that's so much
play to be had in acting.

00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.640
So I think it's
finding what you love

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.630
and just sticking with that.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.560
And I, obviously, was lucky
enough to make my hobby my job.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:42.516
But, yeah, it gave me a lot of
confidence, acting and dancing.

00:43:42.516 --> 00:43:43.640
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Beautiful.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.650
Well, we could talk
for another hour,

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.610
but I'm afraid you all have
to get on flights to London

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.800
so you can open the
movie there tomorrow.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.520
I want to thank all of
our guests for being here.

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:58.370
Disney's "A Wrinkle in Time"
is in theaters tomorrow,

00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.050
March 9th.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:43:59.850
Go see it.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.170
OPRAH WINFREY: March
9th, March 9th.

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.170
EILEEN NAUGHTON: Before
we let you go, however--

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:04.850
OPRAH WINFREY:
The whole weekend.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:06.683
EILEEN NAUGHTON: --because
it's so exciting,

00:44:06.683 --> 00:44:09.320
we would like to invite all
of the girls from Girls Inc.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.112
onto the stage to--

00:44:10.112 --> 00:44:11.444
OPRAH WINFREY: What did you say?

00:44:11.444 --> 00:44:14.200
EILEEN NAUGHTON: --take a
quick picture with the cast.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.400

right, everybody,

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.550
at the count of three, go yay.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:42.400
