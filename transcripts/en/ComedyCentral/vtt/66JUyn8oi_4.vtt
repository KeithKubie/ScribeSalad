TONIGHT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A
STATISTIC THAT'S COME UP.

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.073 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S VERY WORRISOME. ACCORDING
TO ONE POLL,

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:10.209 align:start position:0% line:91%
 58% OF AMERICANS NOW THINK
THERE'S A

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.477 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAR ON POLICE.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.847 line:91%
NOW LOOK I'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT
I SAW WERE ABUSES BY THE POLICE

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.649 size:75% position:38% line:85%
DEPARTMENT ON THIS SHOW.

00:00:16.682 --> 00:00:18.684 line:85%
I'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:21.320 align:start position:0% line:91%
I HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MY
FAMILY SO THIS IS VERY

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:22.021 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONCERNING TO ME.

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:23.222 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT THEN I SAW THIS.

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:31.097 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; 2015 IS TO BE ONE OF THE
LOWEST TOTALS OF OFFICERS GUNNED

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.368 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOWN IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN THE
LAST 25 YEARS.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELL YES.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
I GUESS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE
REAL TRUTH IS 2015 IS SHAPING TO

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.509 align:start position:0% line:91%
BE ONE OF THE SAFEST YEARS FOR
POLICE EVER.

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:47.547 line:91%
AND NOT MANY THIS DYING IN LOWER
NUMBERS BUT THEY'RE ALSO BEING

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.481 align:start position:0% line:85%
ATTACKED LESS.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.284 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELL WAIT A MINUTE, THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:55.021 line:91%
SO OVERALL, ATTACK ON POLICE ARE
WAY DOWN YET THE PERCEPTIONS OF

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:59.959 line:91%
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF THE
ATTACKS ON POLICE ARE WAY UP.

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:03.629 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, YOU MAY BE WONDERING HOW
THAT HAPPENS.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.098 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE ANSWER?

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.998 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:32.191 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT CARD IS WHAT, THE KING OF
DIAMONDS, RIGHT.

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:35.228 align:start position:0% line:91%
I JUST LIFT UP MY HAND AND NOW
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:40.166 line:91%
NOW NORMALLY YOU'D BE A LITTLE
SUSPICIOUS BUT NOT IF THERE'S

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.001 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOTHING TO SEE.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:44.837 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY?

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.705 align:start position:0% line:91%

I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU BUT I'M
GOING TO TELL YOU GUYS.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.581 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:02:00.520 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M MAGIC.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.991 line:91%
FOX ON THE OTHER HAND DOESN'T
USE MAGIC, THEY JUST USE GOOD

OLD FASHION TRICKERATION.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.697 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW DOES FOX TURN SOMETHING THAT
ISN'T INTO SOMETHING THAT IS.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU LIKE THAT?

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:16.769 align:start position:0% line:85%
VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:17.603 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY. HERE'S HOW THEY DO IT.
FIRST, STATE YOUR [BLEEP]

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:22.675 align:start position:0% line:91%

SIEGE.

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.949 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I'VE NEVER SEEN IT LIKE THIS.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:33.886 line:91%

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.300 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE NOT CREEPED OUT, THEY'RE
SCARED AND THEY'RE SCARED

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.969 line:85%
BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARING THEM, FOX

00:02:50.002 --> 00:02:50.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY. AND THEN YOU TAKE YOUR
[BLEEP] NARRATIVE

BACK.

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.731 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  FOX IS GOING ALL IN
ON THIS.

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:24.303 line:91%
I HAVEN'T SEEN FOX THIS EXCITED
SINCE THE INVENTION OF BLONDE

00:03:24.336 --> 00:03:27.306 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S VERY EXCITING, VERY
EXCITING.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.906 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.242 size:78% position:39% line:85%
BUT NOW HERE'S THE THING.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:32.645 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE AUDIENCE IS HOOKED.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:36.582 line:91%

THE NEXT THING IS THEY BRING OUT

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:53.432 align:start size:91% position:9% line:91%
AN EXPERT TO SUPPORT IT, A
FOX-PERT IF YOU WILL.

ENTER THE SHERIFF FROM EARLIER.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.606 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S COMPLETE LACK OF
ACCOUNTABILITY. YOU CAN GO TO

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.910 align:start position:0% line:91%
A HOME AT 2 OR 3 IN THE MORNING

I TELL YOU I'LL GIVE YOU THE
BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:51.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN YOU SAY A SEGMENT IS
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR ON COPS

00:04:51.056 --> 00:04:53.192 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M SURE YOU MEAN THE SOFA BAG
IN MURDER TOWN RIGHT.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:55.227 line:85%
&gt;&gt; THEY HATE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.730 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS BLACK LIVES MATTER
MOVEMENT HAS 

00:04:57.763 --> 00:05:02.735 line:85%
PERPETUATED THE BALANCE WE SEE

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.486 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD.

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:24.223 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW THAT FOX HAS ESTABLISHED
THAT THE FAKE WAR ON COPS IS THE

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.859 align:start position:0% line:91%
FAULT OF BLACK LIVES MATTER THAT
NOW IS A REALITY.

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:34.200 line:91%
WE DON'T QUESTION IT. FOR THEIR

00:05:53.085 --> 00:05:56.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
NUMBER ONE YOU SHOULD NEVER
NEVER IMPLY ANY KIND OF VIOLENCE

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:57.990 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOULD BE DONE TO COPS.

00:05:58.023 --> 00:06:01.794 align:start position:0% line:91%

OTHERWISE PEACEFUL
MOVEMENT. FOX, WHAT WAS YOUR

TAKE AWAY FROM THAT ONE MOMENT
THAT YOU KEEP PLAYING OVER

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:40.433 line:91%
NOW ... I'M NOT A SPOKESPERSON
FOR BLACK LIVES MATTER BUT I'M

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:44.270 line:91%

UNARMED BLACK PEOPLE.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.245 line:91%
I MEAN THE FACT THAT WE EVEN
NEED THAT MOVEMENT IS INSANE.

00:06:53.278 --> 00:06:56.682 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE FACT YOU'RE TRYING TO
PRESTO-CHANGE IT TO A WAR ON

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:57.883 align:start position:0% line:91%
COPS IS EVEN MORE INSANE. AND

TRICK IS DONE AND REALITY SEEMS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
