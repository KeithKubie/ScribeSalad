that the earth is 6,000 years old that's
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.600
that the earth is 6,000 years old that's
completely wrong that's obviously wrong

completely wrong that's obviously wrong
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.260
completely wrong that's obviously wrong
and the way we know it is wrong was a

study people found layers of rocks
 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.059
study people found layers of rocks
figured out where the layer

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
figured out where the layer
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.929
figured out where the layer
came from people found radioactive

and so on and these this led us to an
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.800
and so on and these this led us to an
understanding of the age of the earth so
