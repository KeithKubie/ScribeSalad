and respect those rules I came up here

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:30.980
and respect those rules I came up here
 

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.669
and respect those rules I came up here
with three examples but actually if we

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679
with three examples but actually if we
 

00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:36.760
with three examples but actually if we
looked for them we can find more

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:36.770
looked for them we can find more
 

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.490

so those three titles respect all the
 

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.240
so those three titles respect all the
rules it can can potentially become true

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:43.250
