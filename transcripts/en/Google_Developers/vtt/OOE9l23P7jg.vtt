00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:31.780
MALE SPEAKER: We're here in
Austin, Texas, where teams

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.830
have gathered from all over the
world to test their skills

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.680
of conquering a custom-built
obstacle course using nothing

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.770
but a LEGO Mindstorms
kit and an Android

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.020
powered phone or tablet.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.910
Live from the Google Developers'
House at South by

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.040
Southwest, this is the
Google Developers

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.795
LEGO Mindstorms Rumble.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.322
TYLER HANSON: Let's get
ready to rumble!

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.200
Are there enough geeks
in the house?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.834
Give it up for the geeks
who have been playing

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.140
with LEGOs all day.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.622
All right.

00:01:07.622 --> 00:01:09.290
Do I have all of our teams?

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.790
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
live on the interweb.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.360
I don't know who's
watching this.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.260
Hi, people.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.390
So what we've got going on here
is that these guys have

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.190
all been building furiously
since-- well, some team was

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.330
here at 10:00 in the morning--

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.530
making all these LEGO bots and
putting all that stuff.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.310
We have an obstacle course that
these guys are going to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.171
go through, a round robin.

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.330
Now, the rules.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.120
You guys want to know
what the rules are?

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.540
They're very simple.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.140
Rule number one, you don't
tell anybody that you did

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.560
this, since it's secret.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.540
Right over here where I'm
standing, this is the starting

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.730
line, imaginary starting line.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.930
There's a couple ladies here who
are going to drop flags,

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.790
and it's a very imaginary
course.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.810
So the first rule right here,
you see this black tape?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.930
This line on this side you
cannot have your bot on the

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.690
other side of it.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.140
Does that make sense?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.055
You're not allowed
to have your bot.

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:07.210
You can do whatever you can and
can figure any way to sit,

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.610
this is your box and
this is your box.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.220
Now the driver.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.630
Each team gets one driver.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.090
You can't do any more.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.390
I guess four people could
handle a tablet at once,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.740
probably not.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.250
You can have your pit
crew on your sides.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.100
Now one driver, one driver, pit
crew The challenge is that

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.330
you've got to get from here
all the way over to there.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.730
Now, you have to get all the way
into the box in order for

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.330
you to be equal.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.830
Now, if they're hanging
over at all, then

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.310
that's not a win, right?

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.100
Now, what if you got these big
guys that are going to stick

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.532
out no matter what?

00:02:52.532 --> 00:02:54.480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.530
TYLER HANSON: What about
in there, though?

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.970
They got to park it?

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.360
They got to park it sideways.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.250
So get your parallel parking
mind inside.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.070
Now, the other rule, I'm
just going to keep

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.770
moving through here.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:14.300
The other rule is that if your
bot flips over, i.e.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.410
A turtle, you have
to start over.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.470
OK, now your teammate
can help you pass

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.890
your bot back to here.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.390
Or it gets stuck.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.970
OK, so stuck or flipped over,
quicksand or turtle.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.380
We can come up with
other euphemisms.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.770
Now, what else are we missing?

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.560
So that's basically it.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.660
That's pretty much it.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.500
Now OK, does everybody know
what you're going

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.790
to be judged on?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.480
First and foremost, we're going
to be judging on style.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.030
Now I have an expert secret
panel of judges who I'm going

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.450
to reveal to you, who are going
to take notes and look

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.210
at all of this wonderful flair
that these guys have taken on

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.830
to give a little study.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.020
And then I'm also going to go
through and actually talk to

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.480
each team and get
your guys' name.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.680
Now, do I have all of our
teams in here now?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.160
Has everybody had a drink?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.920
Ah, there we go.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.170
Very nice.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.900
You can see by its design
that it was late.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.540
We have 13 bots total.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.514
Are we missing one then?

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:29.764
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.475
TYLER HANSON: It's
OK, he tried.

00:04:42.007 --> 00:04:46.120
Now we also have Trevor Jones.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.580
Hi, Trevor.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.020
TREVOR JOHNS: Hi, Tyler.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.110
TYLER HANSON: Trevor's coming
from the magical world of--

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.800
what state are you in?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.330
TREVOR JOHNS: I'm pretty sure
I'm in Texas still.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.270
TYLER HANSON: What state
of mind are you in?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.450
TREVOR JOHNS: A very
different one.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.940
So I'm coming to do you live
from our broadcast studio here

in the corner of the
Google South by

Southwest Developer House.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.520
So yes, these teams have been
battling blood, sweat, and

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.440
tears to and bring us
their bots today.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.280
They've been here since 10:00 AM
in the morning hacking both

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.150
on their Mindstorm kits and
their Android tablets.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.490
It's looking like it's going to
be an exciting competition

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.190
and lots of fun.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.150

people's South By experience,

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.810
absolutely amazing.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.870
Trevor is going to be giving us
technical analysis from the

amazing wonders of Studios One,
Two, Three, and Four.

a lab studio, we have a

ground zero studio,
amongst others.

We're going to start
with you, then.

David, what is the name
of your team?

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.110
DAVID: We're with Ology, and our
robot is Eye of the Tiger.

It's an ode to Stallone.

Very, very unique city
in America, right?

a very thick accent.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.740
MALE SPEAKER: This is Team I Fix
It, we're streaming live

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.790
on youstream.com/ifixit straight

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.450
TYLER HANSON: Wow.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.050
How many people are
watching that?

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.530
MALE SPEAKER: One!

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.010
And testing.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.543
Oh, there it is, he's
got one signal.

00:08:58.543 --> 00:09:00.770
TYLER HANSON: I Fix It,
that's you guys.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.050
OK, judges take note.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.660
Is this you?

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.230
This is you.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:08.300
You are awesome.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.130

MALE SPEAKER: New Jersey.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.470
TYLER HANSON: That makes
a lot of sense.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.350
I love Jersey.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.102
What part, Trenton?

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:29.260
Who am I missing?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:29.890
Way over there.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.210
Who's this?

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:31.640
That's you.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.310
Step right in over here.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.013

00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:38.980
TYLER HANSON: Hi, John.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.360
CAMERON: We are from Santa
Barbara, California.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.970
TYLER HANSON: Whoo,
Santa Barbara.

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.933
I hear Oprah hangs out there.

00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:45.700
CAMERON: She lives there.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.250
TYLER HANSON: It's awesome.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.320
OK, what's the name of
your guys' team?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.040
CAMERON: Pelagonians.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.480
TYLER HANSON: Pelagonians.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.020
You guys are definitely
from the beach.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.860
CAMERON: Yes.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.060
TYLER HANSON: The flare--

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.830
CAMERON: This is WALL-E--

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:57.200
TYLER HANSON: This is WALL-E--

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.200
CAMERON: --bringing his
offering to EVE.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.050
TYLER HANSON: Bringing his
offering to-- where's EVE?

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.772
Is she here?

00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:05.130
CAMERON: You know what,
our [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.812
through.

00:10:07.812 --> 00:10:09.550
She'll be here later.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.710
TYLER HANSON: All right,
WALL-E, all the

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.770
way from Santa Barbara.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.060
Unbelievable.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.610
Where are you at?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.718
Who's here?

00:10:14.718 --> 00:10:15.216
MALE SPEAKER: Us.

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:18.210
TYLER HANSON: Us.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:18.830
Hello, us.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.400
How are you?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.150
MALE SPEAKER: Very
good, thank you.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.130
How are you?

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.750
TYLER HANSON: And you guys are
coming from a long way.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.620
Are you guys from New
Jersey as well?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:24.710
MALE SPEAKER: We're not.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.280
We're from London, England.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.400
TYLER HANSON: I've
heard of London.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.540
Is that like--

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.070
it's a country?

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:32.860
Right.

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.640
What is the name of this guy?

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.466
MALE SPEAKER: He's called
Ralph by Southwest.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:42.210
TYLER HANSON: Ralph by
Southwest. Fair enough.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:46.260
And I see you did a great job
of doing another branding.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.495
Is this kind of like the Street
View or different?

00:10:50.495 --> 00:10:51.180
Fair enough.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.100
What have we got here?

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.350
Whoa, whoa.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.460
Come on over here,
stand right up.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.150
What is your name?

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.860
ROB Z: I'm Rob Z, and my team
is Team Zed, or Team Z.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.575
TYLER HANSON: Team Z, Team
Zed, and you look fierce.

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:09.970
ROB Z: I'm trying
to be fierce.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.065
I'm leaning on fierce, I
understand it's a fierce

00:11:12.065 --> 00:11:12.300
competition.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.550
TYLER HANSON: There's a
fierce slash style.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.850
So you can notice all this
technical stuff.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:20.760
This is very nice, the decor,
the flames, it'll definitely

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.810
fly fast.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:22.550
ROB Z: Thank you.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.140
TYLER HANSON: Nice one, Rob.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.900
My friend, how are you?

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.260
My friend, how are you?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:26.990
JAMAL: I'm fine, how are you.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.500
TYLER HANSON: Not too bad.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.550
Where are you coming from?

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:29.990
JAMAL: I'm coming from
San Antonio.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.530
All the way from San Antonio.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.590
And you've been here
a long time.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.370
What is the name of your bot?

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:36.380
JAMAL: Cute Droid.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.920
TYLER HANSON: Cute Droid.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.330
What is your name?

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.340
JAMAL: [? Sinu Jamal. ?]

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.421
[?

00:11:40.421 --> 00:11:42.120
TYLER HANSON: Sinu Jamal. ?]

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.010
Jamal, thank you so
much for playing.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.880
He's been here forever
too, man.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.810
You have a very technical bot.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.570
And these blow up things?

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:52.860
Supposedly, maybe.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.110
We'll see what happens.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.700
Hey, we're almost there.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:01.040
OK, where are we?

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:01.600
Who's left?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.850
Who hasn't talked
about theirs?

00:12:06.556 --> 00:12:07.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good question.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.350
TYLER HANSON: Good question.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.570
Who's here?

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.160
CHRIS: Team GB.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.640
TYLER HANSON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.070
GB.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:13.330
CHRIS: Team GB.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.996
TYLER HANSON: Team GB, we
haven't done you, right?

00:12:15.996 --> 00:12:16.444
Hello.

00:12:16.444 --> 00:12:17.340
CHRIS: Hello.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.440
I'm Chris, and this was called
WALL-E until they named theirs

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.950
WALL-E.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.080
TYLER HANSON: Those bastards.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.700
Wait, are you guys
both English?

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.496
Is this random that the
English guys decided?

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:32.510
You know, there's a joke
somewhere there in England.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.550
If I was English, I would
be able to make fun.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:38.051
But you could be EVE.

00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:39.230
CHRIS: I don't know.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:41.810
TYLER HANSON: You don't
have to be.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:42.500
It's OK.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.510
Maybe you guys could talk?

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:47.830
No, no, it's OK.

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.753
Somebody's going to have to
remind me all these names.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:54.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good question,
Scott and David.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.240
TYLER HANSON: Good question,
Scott and David?

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.010
No, they came in.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:58.920
Where's Scott?

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.380
Where's David?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.780
Oh, did they bail on us?

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.410
Come on.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:08.920
Scott and David, paging
Scott and David.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.250
How much time have we killed?

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.970
Trevor, you've had to look.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.230
What do you think
of this madness?

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.640
TREVOR JOHNS: I think
it's quite the

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.160
selection of robots there.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.260
I've got to say, my personal
favorite is the one with the

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.300
phone on it, even though it's
not an Android phone, I do

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:27.400
love that they're streaming
YouTube.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.425
That's pretty cool.

00:13:29.425 --> 00:13:32.720
TYLER HANSON: We're talking
about this one.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.685
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, that's
the one right there.

00:13:35.685 --> 00:13:37.385
TYLER HANSON: That feels
pretty good, right?

00:13:37.385 --> 00:13:38.340
You see all that motion?

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.260
TREVOR JOHNS: We saw that one
there that posted online to

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.060
Twitter, right?

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:43.810
TYLER HANSON: There
was another one

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:44.390
that's doing Twitter?

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.705
Who's doing Twitter?

00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:46.800
Oh, you didn't tell me
about your Twitter.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.050
Where's your Twitter feed?

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.530
MALE SPEAKER: Well, we didn't
quite get it done.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.565
TYLER HANSON: Oh, that's OK, but
it was a good intention.

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:53.660
TREVOR JOHNS: OK, they tried.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.960
TYLER HANSON: Ah, the
free bar won I see.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.870
All right, so now, my judges.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.540
No, secret panel of
judges, exit.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.550
We're going to give an
award for style, for

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.210
all your nice flair.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.348
Do we need to have a pow wow?

00:14:17.348 --> 00:14:18.598
MALE SPEAKER: Right now?

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.010
TYLER HANSON: Before
they get wrangled.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.320
OK, I'm going to
kill some time.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:28.950
You guys pow wow.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.300
All right?

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.340
Do you guys need
another drink?

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:35.160
FEMALE SPEAKER: So they're going
to pick three finalists.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:35.970
TYLER HANSON: OK
this is right.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.540
So check it out.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.240
We're going to pick three
finalists for the flair, and

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.045
then we're going to do
a crowd-sourced win.

00:14:44.045 --> 00:14:45.230
Does that makes sense?

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.640
So these guys will decide who
the top three are, then I'll

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:52.400
let you, the audience,
and internet land.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.650
Are you stealing LEGOs?

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.455
You can only win once.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.070
FEMALE SPEAKER: Don't forget
about these down here.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.320
TYLER HANSON: No, we
did those guys.

00:15:09.482 --> 00:15:11.470
We're good.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.564
OK, so what we need
to do now--

00:15:14.564 --> 00:15:16.840
all right, listen to me.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.960
Who wants to race?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.920
We've seen the show, this
is like the auto show.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.470
Now who wants to race?

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.570
Not at all.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.800
We have to still
get this done?

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.340
Well, we pick the three.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.180
They're still thinking.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.380
What I'm thinking now is that we
can start putting them over

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:37.990
here on the tables, and then we
can start getting for our

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.060
actual race.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:45.333
By the way, my name is Tyler
Hanson, and I like LEGOs.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.400
Ah, so these guys have been
going like mad building all

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.900
these little robots, and the
amount of brain matter--

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.080
Trevor, how much brain matter
do you think we've used up

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.230
today inside the Developer
House?

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.170
TREVOR JOHNS: Honestly, I think
we've only actually used

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.740
a little bit, just because
there's so much here already.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.790
We have an incredibly talented
group of developers.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.120
Everybody here has been
doing an amazing job.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.830
So many, so many
great designs.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:21.850
So I think there's actually
been an incredibly large

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.080
amount of effort that's been put
into this, but there's so

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.860
many smart minds here too.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.310
TYLER HANSON: The caloric brain
matter that's been used

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.740
up at South By is
unbelievable.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:35.550
This is a very interactive
panel, as you can see.

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.930
Now what fascinates me is
all the people who are

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.830
watching us do this.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:43.110
Now, if you're in internet land
and you're watching, why

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.980
are we doing this?

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.530
We're trying to explain that.

00:16:51.616 --> 00:16:52.740
You guys have an idea?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.300
You got your three?

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.950
OK, now can we just pocket that
thre come back to that at

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.855
the end, and then we'll do
a crowd-sourced win?

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.072
Or now?

00:17:03.072 --> 00:17:05.059
Well, we don't really
have all the crowd.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.190
Let's do it at the end.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.430
So you guys go ahead and get me
those names written down.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.680
You got the names?

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.950
Ladies and gentlemen, in case
you were wondering, we're

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.000
making all of this
up right now.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.589
This is real, this is now.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:25.720
This is not yesterday.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.094
There was no spreadsheet
for this.

00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:31.999
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:33.394
TYLER HANSON: Which team?

00:17:33.394 --> 00:17:33.860
MALE SPEAKER: Curious
creatures.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.360
TYLER HANSON: Curious
creatures.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.704
Is that a go cam?

00:17:38.704 --> 00:17:40.472
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:40.472 --> 00:17:40.920
TYLER HANSON: Not bad.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.446
Does that thing skydive?

00:17:42.446 --> 00:17:44.780
MALE SPEAKER: It can.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.320
TYLER HANSON: OK, this one?

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.316
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:48.566
TYLER HANSON: Whose is this?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.130
FEMALE SPEAKER: Nantesters.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.460
TYLER HANSON: Nansters, all
the way from France.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.190
Nice job.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:55.660
The French have a
lot of style.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.580
I don't know if you
guys knew that.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.010
MALE SPEAKER: And WALL-E.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.370
TYLER HANSON: And WALL-E, there
goes my awesomeness.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.440
This WALL-E The Santa
Barbara WALL-E.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:03.790
MALE SPEAKER: Pelagonians.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.040
TYLER HANSON: Pelagonians,
Pelagonians.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.560
And who's the first?

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.470
Who are we going
to start with?

00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:15.340
Where's my board?

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.815
Ah, let me explain this.

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:30.906
OK, since it's a race, we
have to have a bracket.

00:18:30.906 --> 00:18:32.200
Look at this officialness.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.660
Now there wasn't a spreadsheet,
but there was a

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.220
DIY made bracket board.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:39.640
We're going to start
right up here.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.430
So Curious Creatures,
you guys are good.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.350
You're going to stay
right there.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:44.830
And do I have Rubix?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.810
Rubix is gone.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.150
Done.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.060
So what we do?

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.310
We fill in?

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.290
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.540
Aha.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.155
Now we move them up to here.

00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:13.430
Got it?

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.710
Geek Droid.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.960
Curious Creatures.

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:28.546
You know, this is where
it gets technical.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:35.980
Do me a favor, now, for on
that side here, if we can

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:39.310
let's go ahead and set our
little happy droids on that

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:41.660
table right over there.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.930
Let me cross the stream.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.940
Excuse me, sorry, excuse
me, sorry.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:54.750
Let's get all the alcohol
out of here.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:09.920
All right, clear the runway.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:18.820
I don't know what's
more absurd.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.600
MALE SPEAKER: We're going to
talk about how they were built

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.827
and stuff earlier today, OK?

00:20:22.827 --> 00:20:24.783
So [INAUDIBLE] you're going
to see it here.

00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:32.235
I want you to start by saying,
you know, earlier today, these

00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:34.930
guys were building stuff, and
let's take a look at the

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.180
things [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.280
TREVOR JOHNS: So earlier in the
day, these teams have been

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.275
gathered at 10:00 AM to go and
put these bots together.

00:20:47.275 --> 00:20:51.540
We gave each of them a LEGO
Mindstorms development kit, as

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.000
well an Android tablet, and told
them to basically come up

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.840
with the most creative
design they could.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.550
So they started out just putting
together the sample

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.030
tutorial bot, the most basic
design, and they had no chance

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.850
of winning the competition if
they just stuck to the most

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.160
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.510
design, because our course is
filled with tons of obstacles.

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.360
And they might be small, but
these bots are small, too.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.480
So it was their job to come up
with creative ways to go and

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.440
make sure they could overcome
all of these.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.000
So whether or not it was levers
that pushed them over

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.530
it, unique wheel designs.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:28.130
We also told them to go and
come up with creative

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.220
mechanical and software
solutions.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.670
So they've been trying to go
and come up with the most

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.060
innovative ways to go and clear
this course as fast as

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:40.870
possible, as innovatively as
possible, and with the most

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:42.120
style and finesse.

00:21:46.195 --> 00:21:49.866
TYLER HANSON: Style,
innovation, speed.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.290
That's what we're
all about here,

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.875
in case you're wondering.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.020
Now, do I have a flag girl?

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.300
Or a tissue?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.170
TREVOR JOHNS: So I should also
point out the hardware

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.810
platform these folks
have been using to

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.560
remote control the robots.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.870
So each team's been given an
Android tablet which has a

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.680
Bluetooth connection to the
LEGO Mindstorms NXT brick.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.470
Each team can then use whatever
control software they

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.270
want to use.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.290
We gave them a sample program.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.690
But from there, it was up to
them how they wanted to go and

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.130
modify the UI, modify the
algorithms that control the

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.480
robot, what their strategy
was for going

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.730
and controlling these.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.480
Each tablet, most of them are
using a touch screen where

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.090
they can go and either
individually operate each

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:56.500
motor, or just give forward,
backward, left, right

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.060
controls, and tell the
robots where to go.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.030
From there, they'd have to
modify it if they added extra

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.860
controls, some of them modified
it to go and use

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.390
sound, add all these
options to the UI.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.530
All of the software is open
source, so they just

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.300
downloaded it, opened it up,
modified it using the Android

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.180
SDK, and basically just went
and customized it to their

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.110
hearts' content.

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.610
So really, it was up to each
team's creativity to figure

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.070
out where they went
with all of this.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.280
And they had a lot of options, a
lot of directions they could

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.580
go in, both using the power of
LEGO Mindstorms and the power

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.570
of the Android SDK to go and
remote control all of this.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.640
Thank you so much, Trevor,
for explaining

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.590
exactly what we're doing.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.960
Now, do we have somebody
who's got the time?

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.690
Hey, and it's illegal to control
somebody else's droid,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.340
so stop doing that.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.387
Don't even think about it.

00:23:46.387 --> 00:23:49.730
Not allowed.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:50.980
Do I have a timekeeper?

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.560
We're good.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.610
I we missing?

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.250
Where are we at?

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:06.380
How do we feel about this live
performance, internet land?

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.560
All you wacky people out there
in internet world who don't

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.350
have anything better to
do than watch kids--

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.600
I mean grown-ups--

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.220
race LEGOs.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.270
TYLER HANSON: What's that?

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.990
Ah, thank NewTek, who's
doing all of this.

00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.980
You guys are amazing.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.170
So we have some awesome people
who are doing the live stream

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:26.750
and helping out with
all of this.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.160
NewTek, is it newtek.com,
is that right?

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:35.050
Out of San Antonio, and they
have this whole live streaming

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.030
TV studio in a box.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:38.970
It's unbelievable.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.516
I haven't seen anything
like this.

00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:43.831
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:43.831 --> 00:24:46.581
TYLER HANSON: Oh my
god, it's there.

00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:48.150
That's freaking-- no, no, no,
don't cross the streams!

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.940
TREVOR JOHNS: Not to mention,
they built this awesome studio

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.235
for me over here.

00:24:54.235 --> 00:24:55.450
TYLER HANSON: Trevor,
did you feel that?

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.360
TREVOR JOHNS: I did, I did.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.760
You know, you ought
to be careful.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.650
You can't get that too close.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.420
Who's know what will happen?

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.710
TYLER HANSON: That was like a
reverse deja vu, or something.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.240
Is that a vuja de,
from France?

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.830
Very similar.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.610
All right, enough silly.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:09.870
Now, race, race, race.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.550
OK, ladies and gentlemen.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:15.870
Where' s my timekeeper here?

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.820
Oh yeah, we've got
to get technical.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.420
He has to put his drink down.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.570
Where's my flag lady?

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.290
Drop it and pick it up.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.736
OK, watch her.

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:28.660
On your marks--

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:29.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: No!

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:31.020
TYLER HANSON: That
was a test run.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:32.690
I'll do the on your marks.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:35.460
On your marks, get set,
and go, and then

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.310
drop, and then drive.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.696
OK, you guys got it?

00:25:38.696 --> 00:25:39.946
Very simple.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.275
On your marks, get set, go.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.430
We have [INAUDIBLE]
giving out.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:52.362
[INAUDIBLE] is looking good,
technical challenging, over

00:25:52.362 --> 00:25:53.820
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.792
Whoa.

00:25:54.792 --> 00:25:57.720
The droid [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.553
Oh, full monty, coming
all the way through.

00:26:00.553 --> 00:26:01.803
Stuck here.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.940
OK, you're not stuck yet.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.570
Until you're stuck, then
you can switch.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.380
That's good.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.340
OK, mentally put your
mind into it.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.630
Very nice technical driving.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.800
Unbelievable, going through.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.320
OK, Team Go Pro Camera
is having a hard

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.720
time finding its way.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.168
Geek Dad navigating
the keyboard.

00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:28.992
All right, give me five.

00:26:28.992 --> 00:26:30.820
I've got five here on this guy.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:32.030
OK, look.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:32.700
Watch his--

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.130
OK, wait for it.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.380
No.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.330
We would like to thank
our sponsor.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.580
OK, there we go.

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.620
OK, very nice, very technical.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.590
That was a swirlydoo,
that's a LEGO term.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.430
You're looking good, OK.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.380
Very nice, OK, you have
to come over.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:03.630
It's very hard to watch both.

00:27:07.199 --> 00:27:11.095
Oh, what's our time?

00:27:11.095 --> 00:27:12.080
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.780
TYLER HANSON: One
minute, 19.9.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.610
Geek Dad.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:20.860
Nice win.

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:30.622
Trevor, what did you think of
Geek Dad, that technical-- did

00:27:30.622 --> 00:27:32.660
you see where they did
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.490
around the corner?

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.650
TREVOR JOHNS: Yes, so this was
an excellent example of how

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.200
even if you've got a good
design, driving skill is just

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.380
as important.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.590
That being said, their design
certainly helped them as well.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:45.240
They had a back-heavy robot
that allowed them to clear

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.770
right over those obstacles.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.815
They didn't need to rely on any
mechanical action, they

00:27:48.815 --> 00:27:51.280
just pushed right through it,
which gave them a speed

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.710
advantage as well.

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:55.250
I think both robots had a great
chance there, but in the

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.046
end, it just came down to
superior driving skills.

00:27:59.046 --> 00:28:01.320
TYLER HANSON: You know, with a
name like Geek Dad, it's kind

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:01.780
of hard to compete.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.730
Where's Geek Mom?

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.980
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right here.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.840
TYLER HANSON: Yeah, nice
job, Geek Mom.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.200
I'm very proud of you.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.190
MALE SPEAKER: Trevor.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:11.380
TYLER HANSON: If I had parents,
I might want you guys

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.890
as parents.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:15.800
OK, Allogy?

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.085
Allegore?

00:28:17.085 --> 00:28:18.335
Allogy?

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.037
Frame store, you guys
take lane one.

00:28:28.037 --> 00:28:30.482
And then who are we missing?

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.560
MALE SPEAKER: It's on YouTube
forward slash developers.

00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:43.631
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:54.890
TYLER HANSON: Allegory?

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:55.790
Allogy?

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.040
A-L-L-O-G-Y?

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.600
Max?

00:29:09.319 --> 00:29:10.990
TREVOR JOHNS: So we're also
pulling the video feed off of

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.570
the Go Pro on that
last robots.

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:15.760
We're going to see if we
get that to you live.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.610
We'll have to see if we can read
it, but we're sending a

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.780
team over there right now to go
and try to extract the data

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.000
off the robot, and we'll let
you know how that goes.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.390
TYLER HANSON: Which
teams was it?

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.496
Max and--

00:29:29.496 --> 00:29:31.308
FEMALE SPEAKER: These are the
names of the people from their

00:29:31.308 --> 00:29:33.160
teams.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.410
TYLER HANSON: That
was a big one.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.270
David?

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:38.750
Chris?

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:40.440
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.280
Max?

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.080
Anybody?

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.770
Where did they go?

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.020
They go to the bar?

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.420
MALE SPEAKER: Frame store.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.290
TYLER HANSON: You
guys get it by?

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:04.670
Yes, you [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:06.815
OK, we're going to swap.

00:30:06.815 --> 00:30:07.170
We'll move you forward.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.270
This is how it works.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.410
If you get drunk at the bar
and you're not racing, you

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.330
lose, just so you know.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.140
I just made that rule up, too.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.554
OK, we're going to go with
Nantes, Nantes from Nantes.

00:30:20.554 --> 00:30:21.450
FEMALE SPEAKER: Pelagonians.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.386
TYLER HANSON: And Pelagonians.

00:30:23.386 --> 00:30:24.636
Pelagonians?

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.648
Yeah, you're good.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:35.820
That's totally fine,
that's legit.

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:41.520
And Pelagonians.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.355
How's the instant replay
coming along?

00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:48.430
Have you seen a slow
motion cross into

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.960
the finish line yet?

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.920
TREVOR JOHNS: I haven't
seen it yet, no.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.920
TYLER HANSON: OK, you
tell me when you do.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.080
OK so now, you can see
who we got coming up.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.740
We got all the way from Nantes,
France, which is an

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:01.290
amazing, creative, unbelievably
artistic town in

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.680
France, for all you people
who don't know.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.400
And just wait until you see
how it moves, he tells me.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:15.490
And then all the way from
Santa Barbara, we have--

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.970
what did you call yourselves?

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:17.790
MALE SPEAKER: Pelagonians.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.010
TYLER HANSON: Pelagonians,
how could I forget?

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.440
It's like a Patagonian,
but a Pelagonian.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.480
What's the opposite?

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.890
You guys made it up
on the fly, I like

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:25.536
that, really creative.

00:31:25.536 --> 00:31:28.050
All right, we have
a flag dropper.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:30.310
You always have to have a pretty
lady to drop the flag.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.850
And we have a start?

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:35.120
OK, give me your thumbs
up when you're ready.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.390
You guys feeling good?

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:41.057
Wait until you see
how it moves.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.320
OK, silence on the set.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.225
Pay attention everybody, this
is really serious business.

00:31:51.225 --> 00:31:54.810
On your marks, get set, ride!

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.010
Oh yeah, that's good.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.050
The Santa Barbara guys--

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:09.170
TREVOR JOHNS: Looks like a
little bit of technical

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.905
difficulty there at
the starting gate.

00:32:10.905 --> 00:32:12.390
TYLER HANSON: Yeah, Trevor,
can you see

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.590
what they're doing?

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:14.440
TREVOR JOHNS: I can
see it from here.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.170
I've got a monitor, I've
got nice display here.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:18.660
TYLER HANSON: Show them--

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:19.800
what is that?

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.950
Trevor, what exactly are
they trying to do?

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.560
TREVOR JOHNS: So they're trying
to go and use those

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.820
extra large wheels with the arms
on them to try and clear

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.760
right over any obstacles
in the path.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.470
Now the problem, though, is that
they're just not getting

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:34.850
the traction needed to go and
pull the robot forward.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.100
So they're making a little
bit of headway.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.770
Now, there should be motors that
are used to go and push

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.290
that robot forward, and I'm
not sure what's happening

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.950
here, so maybe they're having
some technical difficulties.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:45.830
But [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.405
should be trying to push them
forward, so I'm not sure

00:32:47.405 --> 00:32:48.510
what's happening there.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.370
TYLER HANSON: Over here in Santa
Barbara, in Pelagonia's

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:55.800
land, we have a free-wheeling,
unbelievable technical skills.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.660
It must be the head
and the leaf.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.900
Is that the California
state flower?

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.040
OK, I was just making sure.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.330
This is a PG-13 show.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.450
Man, this machine is rolling.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.820
Unbelievable.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.290
Nantes, with all its artistic
creativity, this is why

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:13.770
socialism doesn't work.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:17.080
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.050
Unbelievable technical
[INAUDIBLE].

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.110
So close!

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.166
Almost there.

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:23.018
You can get EVE!

00:33:23.018 --> 00:33:25.800
You can do it!

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.470
Oh, take a droid out.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.370
TREVOR JOHNS: Now you do get
some bonus points, at least as

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.705
far as style's concerned,
for extra destruction.

00:33:35.705 --> 00:33:37.464
TYLER HANSON: Absolutely.

00:33:37.464 --> 00:33:40.120
You're getting technical advance
from other people.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.462
OK, unfortunately, you can't
really see, probably.

00:33:43.462 --> 00:33:44.700
You're doing good.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.950
Nantes, how are we looking?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.335
The suspense is killing me.

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.990
Oh!

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.170
You're close.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.090
TREVOR JOHNS: So the problem
is, [INAUDIBLE] wheels just

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.900
aren't able to clear [INAUDIBLE]
obstacle.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.820
TYLER HANSON: You know, it
was that great flair

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.530
that they put on there.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:16.139
You see how they put that
Terminator wheel thing on?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.389
That's killing them.

trying to come in.

it's unbelievable.

Almost. You know, Nantes could
still win, because these guys

without those

it's a tragic situation here.

OK, this is a single race.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.130
I want everybody to cheer in
their mind right now for this

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.880
little robot.

a little bit of

AI, don't they, Trevor?

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.660
There's a little bit of AI in
there, and a little bit of a

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:00.240
mental relay system
that I think that

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.310
people can link up on.

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.730
So if you guys give this a
little hope in your mind.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.420
Now, you don't have to scream
and yell because

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.690
they are deaf still.

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.680
LEGO's working on that,
their new 3.0

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.070
version of this Mindstorm.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.990
I don't know what's more
ridiculous, me talking about

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:23.854
what this LEGO's doing or you
in internet land watching.

00:37:23.854 --> 00:37:25.770
MALE SPEAKER: You've got to
go around this blue brick.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.002
TYLER HANSON: It's
the blue brick.

00:37:27.002 --> 00:37:29.274
It's always the blue brick.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.490
OK, there you go.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:37.760
TREVOR JOHNS: So this is
precisely what that second

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.130
robot was designed to go and
overcome with those long arms,

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:42.060
just push it right
over those walls.

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.650
But again, it was
just too heavy.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:46.770
It wasn't able to go and propel
itself and push it

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:47.530
across the field.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.390
And if you just can't
move, you're not

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.356
going to make any progress.

00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:54.610
So even though this first robot
is having a little more

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:58.400
trouble getting over those
obstacles, it still has enough

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.170
speed and enough agility to go
and launch itself over it.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.840
So it might not be the most
elegant solution, but they are

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.270
making progress in the race.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:08.830
TYLER HANSON: Now they still
have to get this last part,

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:09.910
which they weren't able to do.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.480
So I don't know, Trevor.

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.208
I have faith, but--

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:17.032
oh, no.

00:38:17.032 --> 00:38:18.020
You're good.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.270
You can still do this.

TYLER HANSON: I don't know,
this could work.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.911
This could work.

00:39:53.911 --> 00:39:55.342
So close.

00:39:55.342 --> 00:39:57.730
There isn't a lot of punch.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.135
How many horsepowers
are in this thing?

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.190
TREVOR JOHNS: So we did
give each team three

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.530
motors to work with.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.720
So in this case, they're just
using two to go and drive

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.580
those wheels forward and back.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.330
If they'd used that third motor
to go and try and build

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:14.490
some sort of arm to go and vault
themself over their last

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.080
obstacle, they might have
had a little bit

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.160
more success here.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.070
They still might make it, but
it's going to be a matter of

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.650
driving skill and not
technical ability.

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:23.458

does come down to the

have enough.

how they won.

launch it for me.

have the video

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:43.560
from the Go Pro now.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.385
So we're watching the video from
the last race, with the

00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:49.300
robot in the back, and you can
see it slowly trying to make

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.390
its way back up to the front.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:52.490
But just getting--

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.910
actually, we've changed
video again here.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.660
But you can see how they were
able to almost make it.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.580
They got blocked by that first
robot right out of the gate,

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.940
which put them at a
disadvantage, and they just

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:05.300
weren't able to get enough speed
to go and clear that

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.216
first obstacle.

00:42:07.216 --> 00:42:09.540
Now, it would have been
interesting to see if they had

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.960
used the pulleys in the front,
the treads in the front, to

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.030
try and actually pull themselves
up the ramp, and

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.230
you can see them trying to do
it right there, but just not

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.250
getting the traction they need
to actually get over that

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:22.080
second obstacle, and that's
really where they got slowed

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.656
down too much and couldn't
win the race.

00:42:25.656 --> 00:42:27.552

right, Trevor.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.370
great job on the flair.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.185
OK, what are we missing?

00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:15.235
What do you need?

00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:17.400
Trevor, what do you think
of these guys?

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.490
TREVOR JOHNS: Well, like I said
earlier, I really love

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.500
the camera on there that's
giving us live streaming from

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:23.310
that one robot.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:26.010
But as far as technical ability,
I think either one of

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.000
them could actually
make the race.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.080
They're both pretty evenly
matched as far as I can tell.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:32.730
Can we get a close-up
on those bots?

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.710
So the one on the left there, we
can see they have two large

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:36.980
wheels, a couple small
wheels in the back.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:40.990
So the big thing for them is
trying to avoid tipping over

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.550
whenever they go over any
of those obstacles.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:43.530
TYLER HANSON: A little
top heavy, yes.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.270
TREVOR JOHNS: But I don't really
see anything to go and

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:48.440
keep their balance when they go
over them on the back, so

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.250
it'll be interesting to
see whether or not

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:51.250
they flip or not.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:52.528
MALE SPEAKER: I Fix It
[INAUDIBLE] custom control

00:44:52.528 --> 00:44:52.954
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:52.954 --> 00:44:54.870
TYLER HANSON: Now, the track
system is very interesting.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.990
You guys went old school with
the military tank, it's almost

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.860
like a [? Sherman. ?]

00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.710
TREVOR JOHNS: Those treads are
going to be really good at

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.460
getting over the obstacles if
they can get enough clearance

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.450
to get the obstacles
underneath them.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.840
TYLER HANSON: Absolutely, it's
all about the chassis.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.700
TREVOR JOHNS: So the really
interesting thing to see there

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.700
is whether or not they'll even
be able to get enough momentum

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.200
to get up and over.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.486
Once they get part of the way
up, they should be clear the

00:45:12.486 --> 00:45:13.980
rest of the way.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.560
And in their case, too, they are
pretty top heavy, so it'll

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.720
be interesting to see whether
or not they can keep their

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.120
stability throughout the entire
race as well, too.

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.650
So I think we've got two really
good robots here.

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:25.990
Both stand a really
good chance.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.410
I think that the extra weight
from that phone is going to

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.740
slow the treads down.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.790
You're also going to see those
treads are a bit slower, too.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.880
Usually when you have a wheel,
you can get a little bit more

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.660
momentum there.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.450
And on top of that, you have
a little bit more room for

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.720
creativity as far as the drive
train's concerned.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.300
TYLER HANSON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.011
let's do this.

00:45:46.011 --> 00:45:50.255
All right, stopwatch,
pretty girl.

00:45:50.255 --> 00:45:52.980
Ladies and gentlemen, are
you guys ready for this?

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:59.916
Start your batteries, on your
marks, pick one, pick two, go!

00:45:59.916 --> 00:46:01.830
And they're coming
out of the gate.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.520
Ah, with the tank move, look
at that moveability.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.245
OK, Team Z, having tough problem
getting out of the

00:46:07.245 --> 00:46:07.970
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.870
Tank Man, coming all
the way through.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:13.120
I fix anything, slowly.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.260
Look at the patience
carrying through.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.243
OK, you've got to navigate
this little wall.

00:46:17.243 --> 00:46:22.510
Over the death field
of mouse, mouses--

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:23.760
oh, mice.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.265
Whoa, going for the triple
whammy, that's an old World

00:46:31.265 --> 00:46:33.930
War II trick.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:35.140
Looking heavy.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.820
Team Z, still trying to
get out of the gate.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.370
Looking tough.

00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.270
TREVOR JOHNS: So you'll notice
how even though the first

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.430
robot there is tough, they're
using that arm in the back to

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.750
keep themselves from
tipping over.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.230
But on the front, they have the
same problem, and they've

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:50.520
got another wheel to go and keep
them steady there, too.

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.230
Now they're going to lose a
little bit of control when

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.030
those treads come
off the ground.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.360
But once they drive forward, it
gives the robot a chance to

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.150
right itself and get that
stability back.

00:47:00.898 --> 00:47:04.300
Now you'll also notice how those
treads are making the

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.130
robot go a little bit slower,
but the team's using it to an

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:08.850
advantage in this case.

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:11.340
They're using it to make sure
they have more control.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.290
The second robot is definitely
faster, but it's running into

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:15.760
the walls, which
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.790
TYLER HANSON: Unbelievable
balance.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.210
I think the phone on top is
actually given a great

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.240
counterbalance, it's like
a tightrope walker.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.285
Back over here, we have
Team Z, who's

00:47:24.285 --> 00:47:25.340
having a tough problem.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:29.420
He's still trying to get over
the death cords of mice.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.810
Slowly but surely,
I fix anything.

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.570
You've got a straight shot
there, it looks good.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:41.160
Once you're past the pink
one, it's home free.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.102
Unbelievable technical
abilities.

00:47:44.102 --> 00:47:46.950
All right.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:50.480
Technical skill, live streaming
abilities, and a

00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.630
great pointing technique.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:53.090
I don't know if you guys
see the pointing.

00:47:57.736 --> 00:48:00.050
[INAUDIBLE] in record time.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.040
MALE SPEAKER: One minute 50.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.756
TYLER HANSON: One minute, 50
seconds, I Fix It, with the

00:48:03.756 --> 00:48:06.500
tank and the [? iStream. ?]

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:10.960
Team Z?

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.450
You're still-- you know?

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:15.237
But it looks good doing it.

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.370
Trevor, it went to
them, the tank.

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:27.460
OK, let's move them along.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.150
TREVOR JOHNS: This was
definitely a case of slow and

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.220
steady winning the race here.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.600
TREVOR JOHNS: Even though the
second bot there was a lot

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.140
faster, the first one had just
a little bit more control,

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.390
which gave it the edge.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:44.240
TYLER HANSON: All right,
good questions.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.500
Coming up next, on
bat Who we got?

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:49.260
We got both of you?

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.130
You guys C?

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:57.320
We have good questions and
Punching Muffins and the

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.400
Unlimited Sandwiches.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:48:59.270
Wait, so--

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.120
TREVOR JOHNS: So actually, we
have Kyle from I Fix It here

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.700
in the studio, who's going to
go ahead and give us a quick

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:05.520
rundown of what they did with
some custom control software

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.625
to make all this work.

00:49:06.625 --> 00:49:07.000
So Kyle?

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.100
KYLE: So we took one of the
off the shelf, open source

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.830
Android apps, and modified it
to make the control more

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:12.850
consistent.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:15.200
Because the initial apps
are just too jittery.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.670
There's one based on
accelerometer, and it's not

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.060
consistent enough.

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:22.080
So we were able to download
the SDK and get it going.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.140
Started about one o'clock, and
by six o'clock, we had a

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:26.930
custom app.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.280
So if you're interested in I Fix
It, we have instructions

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.980
on how to fix any Android
device, including these guys.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.420
Ifixit.com.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.485
TYLER HANSON: Ifixit.com, coming
in with the big win.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:51.550
OK, all you people out there
in magic internet land.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:52.600
How about you people
in the bar?

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.490
You guys having a good time
watching the big screen TV?

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.740
You sound like a rowdy bunch.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.490
Unbelievable.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:04.910
In case you're wondering, you're
watching grown adults

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.320
play with LEGOs, and this is
South by Southwest, the most

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.120
innovative, creative
spot on the planet.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.130
And who doesn't love LEGOs?

00:50:15.130 --> 00:50:16.355
MALE SPEAKER: My team!

00:50:16.355 --> 00:50:18.370
TYLER HANSON: You guys,
how are you looking?

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:19.020
Which one's which?

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.390
OK, Good Idea?

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.200
Good Question, that's
a good question.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.230
Punching Muffins, the Unlimited
Sandwiches.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:32.890
I can't do it enough here.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:35.380
OK, Trev, what do you think
about these guys, real quick?

00:50:38.677 --> 00:50:41.790
Side panel analysis.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:45.410
TREVOR JOHNS: Hey,
sorry about that.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:49.750
Yes, so we've got two robots
here who both have a similar

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.310
strategy, neither of which has
very much in the way of front

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:53.770
obstacle avoidance.

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:55.610
So the one in the front does
have that wheel, which is

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:57.090
going to go ahead and
make sure that it

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.620
doesn't fall forward.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.490
It gives it a little bit
of a counterbalance.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.900
The other one just
has a flat plane.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.710
But in both cases, neither of
them look like they really

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:05.720
have much of a way
to go and push

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.400
themselves over obstacles.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.240
So it's going to be just
pure speed here.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:10.520
How fast can they go
ahead and launch

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:12.702
themselves over all of that?

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.025
TYLER HANSON: Excellent.

00:51:14.025 --> 00:51:18.975
Ladies and gentlemen, are you
ready for another race?

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:19.950
From the bar.

00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:20.970
I need to hear you
from the bar.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.862
Are you guys still
drinking with me?

00:51:23.862 --> 00:51:25.112
Unbelievable.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.030
Do I have my clock?

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.970
Watch.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.380
He's here.

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.920
Pretty lady?

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.640
You guys ready for this?

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.690
OK, uno, dos, tres!

00:51:41.666 --> 00:51:44.650
Coming out of the back,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:46.560
Unbelievable [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.860
Good Question, looking tough.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.540
You are awesome.

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.430
OK, looks for the ride.

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:53.250
Oh, sneaks in behind.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:54.590
Oh, look at [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.280
Sandwich.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.310
That's good, [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.422
Yeah go ahead, start
them over.

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:09.320
Punching Muffins and Unlimited
Sandwiches is doing amazingly.

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.350
Right around the corner, looking
at the wall of death.

00:52:12.350 --> 00:52:16.460
This is the green monster,
coming from behind is a very

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.140
good question.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:20.160
Oh, unbalancing.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.160
Yes, no.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.420
You've got to spin around.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.835
OK, technically, we call
this a bottleneck.

00:52:27.835 --> 00:52:29.630
This is when the bots
are making love.

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:30.880
They like each other.

00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:34.580
Oh, that's called
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.740
I'm going to say this is the
female, that's the male.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:40.590
OK, coming around the corner.

00:52:40.590 --> 00:52:43.780
Yes, looking good.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.290
OK, you got-- yes, all right.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.330
Power bleep through
it, he says.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.780
Trevor, what do you think about
this capability on the

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.030
green wall?

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.350
Oh, here we come.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.210
Oh, man.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.220
I don't know what to say.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:08.530
TREVOR JOHNS: So in this case,
that robot is probably a

00:53:08.530 --> 00:53:09.650
little bit too back heavy.

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:12.020
It's not able to get enough
traction on those front wheels

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:13.920
to go and get itself
up that ramp.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.890
Now it might have some more
success if it actually tried

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.490
to get up it backwards, but
I'm not sure if that robot

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.460
will have enough control
to actually do that.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.042
So it'll be interesting to see
what their strategy is to try

00:53:22.042 --> 00:53:23.622
and get over this ramp.

00:53:23.622 --> 00:53:26.300
TYLER HANSON: Yeah, I think
their strategy is praying.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:28.600
They got a lot of pointing,
they've got a

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:30.010
little technical there?

00:53:30.010 --> 00:53:35.390
OK, They went for the lean,
slim machine, but it looks

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:37.430
like you've really got
to have weight here.

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:39.650
TREVOR JOHNS: I also hear a
lot of clicking over here,

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:41.650
which means that they're
actually trying to put too

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.690
much torque on those motors.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.410
These motors, they're only
good for a little bit of

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.690
thrust, and if you want to do
more, you actually have to go

00:53:48.690 --> 00:53:53.540
and use a gear box, essentially,
to go and try and

00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:54.710
get a little bit more
power out of those.

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:56.350
You're trading speed
for power.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:00.010
Right now, they're trying all
for speed, and when you do

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:03.160
that, you just don't get enough
power to go and push

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.730
you up these inclines,
especially if

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:05.280
your robot's heavy.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.500
TYLER HANSON: I think
they call it oomph.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:10.424
Yeah, you just can't
get the oomph.

00:54:10.424 --> 00:54:11.674
Oh!

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.130
The suspense is killing me!

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:21.855
Smart comment, coming up next.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:26.800
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd
like to thank our

00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.050
sponsors, the bar.

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.280
Oh, now they're mating.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.310
What happens if neither one
can get over the wall?

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:56.060
I'll let them leave it there.

00:55:01.956 --> 00:55:03.810
Absolutely not.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.210
The crowdsourced rules.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:06.660
All right, you know
there's rules in

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.970
this thing for a reason.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.710
I don't want to have a
violent altercation.

00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.120
Yeah that's right, back
where you started.

00:55:17.172 --> 00:55:20.590
Do we have a time limit?

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:25.000
10 minutes is our time limit.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.180
If you can't get over here in
five minutes, we're going to

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.430
have to put you in--

00:55:37.231 --> 00:55:39.550
All right, you've got one
minute to get past this.

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:41.720
If you guys work together, you
might be able to do it.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:42.970
Teamwork!

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:49.270
TREVOR JOHNS: Now their best
bet to get over this ramp

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:52.060
would have been just draw speed,
try and take a direct

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.110
shot right at that ramp and try
and get enough momentum to

00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:55.320
push themselves over it.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.780
But because of the pile of mice
right in front of it,

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.750
there really is no direct
approach to that ramp.

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:01.590
They're going to have to steer
around it, and they're going

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:02.890
to lose their speed and they're
going to lose their

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.050
power because of that.

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:07.220
TYLER HANSON: Yeah this hill, it
must be like in ant terms,

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.900
this is like a 5,000
foot incline.

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:22.940
30 seconds.

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:29.760
30 seconds if the two of you
can't get past this line,

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.390
whoever's the farthest wins.

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:42.680
Nine, eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, one.

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.690
It's still a win.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:49.830
Unbelievable.

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:52.050
All right, Punching Muffins and
the Unbelievable Sandwich.

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:55.820
Unbelievable Sandwich.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.410
That was not amazing.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:10.250
Trevor?

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:10.530
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah.

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:12.240
TYLER HANSON: I don't have
much to say, do you?

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.760
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, I think they
both had a chance if they

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.950
just could have gotten a little
bit more momentum or a

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.860
little bit more power,
either one.

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.480
And both robots were lacking
in both of those.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.050
If that pile of mice wasn't
there, or they had just

00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:28.100
designed their drive train a
little bit differently so they

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:29.400
could get that little bit
of oomph to go and get

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:30.600
them over that ramp.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.290
It was close.

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:32.540
They both had a good chance.

00:57:37.804 --> 00:57:38.280
TYLER HANSON: Awesome.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:41.870
So now that's you guys,
that's Buckeye?

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:47.430
OK, Buckeye LEGO
bot and Team--

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:49.380
oh, Great Britain.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.170
I get it!

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:53.420
All right, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.150
MALE SPEAKER: Follow us on
Twitter, BuckeyeLegoBot.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.340
TYLER HANSON: BuckeyeLegoBot.

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:03.770
Come on, let's try and get
these guys one million

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:06.434
followers now.

00:58:06.434 --> 00:58:10.000
You know what the street value
of that Twitter feed would be?

00:58:13.530 --> 00:58:16.510
Get into technical position,
pit crews.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:18.930
OK, Trevor, you want to
give a quick-- we got

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:20.180
another track in.

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:27.920
Trevor, have a look.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.180
TREVOR JOHNS: So I just I got
a picture of this bot here.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.960
Could you zoom in a little bit,
though, so I can see what

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.310
they're doing here?

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.120
OK, so actually, this is a
really interesting design.

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.120
I actually don't know what
to think of this.

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.850
It looks like they built some
sort of forklift on the front

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:44.430
that's going to go and try and
push them over the obstacles.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:46.000
It'll be interesting to
see how this works.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.950
It's definitely a
unique design.

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:49.410
I really don't know what
to make of this one.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.100
It'll be interesting to
see it in the field.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:57.280
TYLER HANSON: All right.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.640
All the way from Great Britain,
we are replacing a

00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.944
battery pack, technical
difficulties.

00:59:02.944 --> 00:59:04.090
Pit crew?

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.800
TREVOR JOHNS: All right, and as
for the second robot here.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.220
First off, I love how they're
going and being creative about

00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.215
actually getting it to
fit in the box there.

00:59:11.215 --> 00:59:13.170
It's definitely a
longer robot.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:15.170
Now they've got that scoop on
the front, which is going to

00:59:15.170 --> 00:59:18.410
go and try and push them
over the obstacles.

00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:20.532
It doesn't look like it's
mechanical, so they're going

00:59:20.532 --> 00:59:22.330
to need to rely on speed
there to go and try to

00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:23.460
push them over it.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:25.380
Now, they do have that wheel in
the back that you've se a

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.270
few times already, and that's
going to go and give them that

00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:29.300
extra bit of stability.

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.950
So even though they're going
to go and intentionally try

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:34.207
and capsize the robot, it'll
hold them steady, allow them

00:59:34.207 --> 00:59:36.620
to drive over it, and right
themselves back when they've

00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.060
gotten to the other side.

00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:40.100
So I think this design is
actually pretty solid.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.350
It'll be interesting to see
whether or not to the extra

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.680
length is going to give them
enough clearance to navigate

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.860
the course.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:47.460
I think they might have a little
bit of trouble when

00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:49.580
they get to the end, trying
to navigate those last few

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:52.490
obstacles, just because of the
extra size, but I think this

00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:56.030
robot stands an excellent
chance.

00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:57.280
TYLER HANSON: I concur.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.400
How close are we
on our battery?

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.010
Chris?

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.930
How close are we on the
battery change?

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.552
OK, we're good.

01:00:09.552 --> 01:00:13.080
Coming all the way from
across the pond.

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.845
Come on, give it up.

01:00:13.845 --> 01:00:17.240
This is tough work.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.670
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
you ready to do

01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:22.001
this again?

01:00:22.001 --> 01:00:23.251
Unbelievable!

01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:26.120
Clock?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.830
Ready.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.190
Beautiful lady?

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.890
Winner.

01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:33.350
OK, you guys good?

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:34.526
GB?

01:00:34.526 --> 01:00:36.720
OK, you checking your text?

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.970
It's OK.

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:45.631
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

01:00:45.631 --> 01:00:47.092
And they're off!

01:00:47.092 --> 01:00:49.040
Coming out!

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.120
Tank with its superpowers
is looking tough.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:53.760
We had a mating.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.010
This is cross-pollinating.

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:01.450
They are sharing data.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.320
Oh, Team GB, looking tough,
falling on the other side.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.910
Now, we're seeing a lot
of problems here.

01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.830
The wall of death!

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:10.620
Oooh, almost!

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.870
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:16.270
Oh, and the tank just doesn't
have enough weight.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:18.380
You've going to have to
do a shimmy-shammy.

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.880
I don't know what you call
that in England, but in

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:21.130
America we call it the
shimmy-shammy.

01:01:24.255 --> 01:01:25.970
OK, through the mines.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.810
Coming out of the [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:45.920
You're still good, man,
you can cruise

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.190
right in upside down.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:54.140
I don't care how you win.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.449
Nobody said the British
were good looking.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.770
The flippy floppy.

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.635
So Trevor, it seems that the
bots that are very condensed

01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:11.120
and don't have a lot of whoopee
outside, do the best.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.442
TREVOR JOHNS: Yeah, the smaller
bots definitely seem

01:02:12.442 --> 01:02:14.975
to have bit of an advantage in
this course, just because the

01:02:14.975 --> 01:02:16.225
clearance between everything
is so small.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.950
Again, you also see how good
the design treads are.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:22.215
TYLER HANSON: One minute!

01:02:22.215 --> 01:02:24.570
TREVOR JOHNS: Even though the
bot was pretty much out, it

01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:26.780
was able to get that last little
bit of control there

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:29.390
from those threads and keep
moving even though it

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:32.610
shouldn't have. And that first
bot, even though it looked

01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.820
like it had a great chance to
go and win because of the

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.000
design to go and launch itself
over the obstacles, it gave it

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.370
a little bit more instability,
where the smaller bot just was

01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:44.840
able to go and keep moving.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:48.880
I also loved how they made use
of those three sticks in the

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.550
back, the extra poles.

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.200
So there were a few times when
it looked like the bot was

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.830
almost ready to go and flip
backwards, it kept itself

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:57.710
righted, and that was a very
simple design that proved to

01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:58.960
be very effective.

01:03:01.930 --> 01:03:04.630
TYLER HANSON: I totally
concur, Trevor.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:09.102
Team GB, all the way from
Great Britain, nice job.

01:03:09.102 --> 01:03:12.030
Buckeyes, better
luck next time.

01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.560
OK, now we're missing.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.870
Do we have an Allegy?

01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:17.450
Allegory?

01:03:17.450 --> 01:03:18.400
Team?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.080
Are we missing a team?

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:23.680
We're forfeiting you,
moving you forward.

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:31.010
OK, Geek Droid?

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:35.190
Where's my Geek Dad at?

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:36.000
Geek Droid?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.600
Geek Dad?

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.690
Geek Mom?

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.510
Where did they go?

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:41.510
What are they doing?

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.900
Messing with the
flux capacitor?

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.010
[INAUDIBLE].

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:48.270
There we go, look at
this, very nice.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.300
Yeah, you're back on.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.780
Add a team.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.480
I just want you to know,
I have equal

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.490
support for both of you.

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:05.700
I care, I really do.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.910
And the sooner that we can
get done with this.

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:11.580
Trevor, tell me what you see.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:14.210
So now we have two
winners here.

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:19.590
One was a technical forfeit
winner, but it all counts.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:20.580
A win's a win.

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.800
We have another team from
England, and we have Geek Dad

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.860
again, of course.

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.765
First up, we haven't seen the--
we have another track.

01:04:26.765 --> 01:04:28.033
Trevor, let them have it.

01:04:28.033 --> 01:04:29.260
TREVOR JOHNS: All right, let's
take a look at those robots

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:30.230
there, see what we've got.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:33.820
Have we got a camera that
we can zoom in here?

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:34.560
All right.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.070
So that first robot,
very simple design.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:39.520
I love the sunglasses.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.290
Again, you see the combination
of treads with the wheel for a

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.700
little bit of stability, in
this case in the front.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.190
So it'll be interesting to see
whether or not they'll

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.060
actually be able to go and again
push themselves over

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.700
those obstacles.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.940
Now, I think that wheel might
actually be on a motor there,

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.620
so they're actually going to be
able to lift it up and give

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.770
themselves a little
bit of a hop.

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:58.260
So in the case that the treads
aren't enough, it might push

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.270
them into position.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.210
So that could be a winning
design right there.

01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:05.260
All right, let's take a look
at the other robot.

01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:08.190
All right, looks like another
larger design here.

01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:12.120
Now, they do seem to have an
actuator arm in front.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.640
And so again, they could
use that to go and push

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.340
themselves.

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:18.780
But I think in this case, the
bigger wheels are going to

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.800
give them enough on its own.

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.300
Now you will notice this team
put a second set of smaller

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.060
wheels inside, with the hopes
that if the larger wheels lose

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.550
contact, those smaller wheels
might keep them on the ground

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:32.780
and keep them moving.

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:35.450
So it'll be interesting to see
how well that works compared

01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:37.880
to the other design, which is
going to more actively try and

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.130
push themself into position.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.640
TYLER HANSON: Thank
you, Trevor.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.040
Now, you've got to
reboot twice?

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:53.950
OK, we're doing a little
reboot, technical

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.080
difficulties.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:03.910
I would like to thank our
sponsors, the bar, Google,

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:05.925
LEGO, Droid.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.810
Really, we're brought to you
by Google Developers.

01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:14.530
And so all those wacky things
that come to you are coming

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:15.720
from the minds of this.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.600
This is how they learn.

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.850
This is technically actually
what Google's campus looks

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.620
like day in and day out.

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.240
You've heard stories, right?

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.720
OK, how are we looking?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.060
Does anybody have
the boot sign?

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.201
What is the song?

01:06:34.201 --> 01:06:47.130
[HUMS JEOPARDY THEME]

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:49.830
Well, all you people out there
in internet land, we'd like to

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.080
thank you for watching us.

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.940
I hope you have another thing
programmed for afterwards,

01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:01.380
maybe a Netflix movie, maybe
I don't even know.

01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:11.540
We have technical
difficulties.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:12.230
I love the close-up cam.

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:15.870
Can we get a slow motion
replay of that?

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.380
We're loaded.

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.630
OK.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.570
We have a watch, we have
a flag, we have

01:07:25.570 --> 01:07:26.820
races, we're ready.

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:31.675
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, catch
a tiger by the toe!

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:36.600
And they're off!

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.030
Coming out, Geek Dad looking
tough, coming

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:42.710
into a pile of mice.

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.480
Hopefully he doesn't get wrapped
up in the [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.180
TREVOR JOHNS: A lot of teams,
they have this decision right

01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.630
off the bat whether or not
they're going to try and drive

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:51.900
around that pile of mice
or go right over it.

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:54.000
And it's definitely one of the
more challenging obstacles in

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.880
the course, just because of
that mass of cables there.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:59.990
But on the other hand, you
do lose some speed by

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.850
going around it.

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.290
So in this case, going over it
was definitely the right

01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:04.520
approach for this team.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:07.070
And the other one,
they had treads.

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.180
They probably could
have gone over it.

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.210
So I'm curious to know why that
team decided that driving

01:08:10.210 --> 01:08:12.290
around was the better
option there.

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:13.550
TYLER HANSON: They're
looking good.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:15.000
They do have the weight.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.840
But now look here.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:18.590
Geek Dad, now he already
[INAUDIBLE] the first one, and

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:21.330
he does have the fastest course
already, so he knows

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.189
this track really well.

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:26.620
Unbelievable, this is the
closest race we've ever had.

01:08:26.620 --> 01:08:29.979
Ladies and gentlemen, this could
come down to the wire.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.830
TREVOR JOHNS: So it looks like
the wheel on that second robot

01:08:31.830 --> 01:08:33.630
there occasionally
gets in the way.

01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:35.380
It would probably be nice to see
if they can modify their

01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:37.234
control software to give them a
little bit more flexibility,

01:08:37.234 --> 01:08:39.270
so they can decide whether
or not it's up or down.

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:41.590
Whereas right now, it looks
like it's just on a cycle.

01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:45.490
When they hit the button, it'll
cycle, give the robot a

01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:48.855
bit of a hop, and keep going.

01:08:48.855 --> 01:08:49.910
TYLER HANSON: Whoa!

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.039
Technicality, anybody?

01:08:51.039 --> 01:08:53.170
I think we're OK.

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:56.470
Geek Dad, you won.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:57.970
Geek Dad again, round two.

01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:58.979
What's the time on that?

01:08:58.979 --> 01:09:00.710
1:15.

01:09:00.710 --> 01:09:03.720
Didn't beat your first round,
but you had the two fastest

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.970
qualifying times.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:09.545
The track system.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.510
Trevor, you want
to talk about--

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:13.050
this is the first track
system that we

01:09:13.050 --> 01:09:14.180
didn't see win, actually.

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.600
TREVOR JOHNS: Like I said, I
think the robot with treads

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.899
had a pretty good chance, but
that wheel got in the way just

01:09:19.899 --> 01:09:21.420
a couple times.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.410
Also, their treads weren't
quite as powerful as they

01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:24.189
could have been.

01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:25.649
This is another case where it
would have been nice to see

01:09:25.649 --> 01:09:29.050
them use a gearbox to try and
get a little bit more power.

01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:30.279
I mean, they've already
lost a bit of speed

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.439
by going with treads.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.010
They probably could have lost a
little bit more in exchange

01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:37.450
for more clearing ability
on those obstacles.

01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:39.600
Again, both great designs.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.359
We've see both designs succeed
in this course.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:46.399
But in this case, that little
extra bit of speed combined

01:09:46.399 --> 01:09:48.700
with just a great physical
design to go and clear those

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.590
obstacles seemed to be a
winning combination.

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.681
TYLER HANSON: Oh my God.

01:09:55.681 --> 01:09:58.470
Well, I've got to give
it up for you guys.

01:09:58.470 --> 01:10:04.528
You did a hell of a race,
and it was a great time.

01:10:04.528 --> 01:10:07.070
Geek Dad, all the
way to the top.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.490
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
our next [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:09.490 --> 01:10:12.180
Pelagonians?

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.920
Pelagonians, which
is different than

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.870
Patagonia, and I Fix It.

01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:19.100
Where are you guys at?

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:19.600
MALE SPEAKER: Here.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.850
TYLER HANSON: Yeah,
you're here.

01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.350
TYLER HANSON: All right, where's
my Patagonians at?

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:40.880
All the way from
Santa Barbara.

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:43.550
Colson and Beau, what's up?

01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:45.970
Colson and Beau, this is
to say hello to you.

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:47.730
So hi, guys.

01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:50.640
I know you're watching
in Santa Barbara.

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.900
I just got paid to do that.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.681
That was a paid endorsement.

01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:55.160
All right.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.845
We have two other winners here
now, bonafide winners.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.932
I Fix It coming in strong,
all the way.

01:11:03.932 --> 01:11:06.090
Are you guys still streaming?

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:06.830
You're from SLO?

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.180
And from Santa Barbara?

01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:15.380
Oh my God, this is like
a real rivalry.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.630
This is like bona fide rivals.

01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.110
Oh my God.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.210
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
just had an amazing California

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.710
convergence.

01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.190
These people are actually
real rivals.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:32.610
We have a Santa Barbara team
and a San Louis Obispo, aka

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:35.730
SLO, coming in.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:38.160
Trevor, so we've see both
of these win now.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:43.510
What do you think about the
state flower and WALL-E here?

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:44.930
TREVOR JOHNS: They're both
powerful designs.

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:47.450
We've seen them both
perform stunningly

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:48.920
throughout the last round.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.730
So I'm honestly not sure
which is going to win.

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:55.910
Now, I do think those treads
combined with the extra

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:57.920
weight, which actually gives it
a little bit more ability

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:01.110
to go and pop over those
obstacles for the robot on the

01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:03.520
left there might actually be an
advantage, but it could go

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.640
either way.

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.830
I have no idea which way this
race is going to go.

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:08.080
It's going to be exciting.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.880
TYLER HANSON: All right ladies
and gentlemen, are we ready?

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.345
People, are you still with us?

01:12:17.345 --> 01:12:18.340
Drivers?

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:21.930
Start your engines.

01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:24.680
We now have a pretty fly guy.

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.390
Watch.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:27.568
On your marks, get set, drive!

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:32.940
And they're coming
out the gate.

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:34.530
It's looking tough.

01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:37.290
Now of course, Pelagonian had
a tough problem here with

01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:38.520
their tough thing.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.480
He's going to start
over right away.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:40.740
Good move.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.670
I Fix It, coming through.

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:45.550
Looking tough.

01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:49.600
[INAUDIBLE] streaming all the
way from Austin, Texas.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.220
We have another track system.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.470
Looking tough.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.330
Technical skills are
unbelievable here.

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:03.010
I don't know if you can notice
how diverse they are moving.

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.250
This is unbelievable.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:06.840
Now with the weight, as we've
seen, we've seen a lot of

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.090
tracking not being able
to work here.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.860
But because of the phone,
it weighs a lot,

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.990
so it actually helps.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:12.690
These guys are actually
now helping more.

01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:19.020
Pelagonians are coming
on inside.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.270
OK, it's still uncertain.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.980
Oh man, guys.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.230
You should have swapped out.

01:13:32.468 --> 01:13:33.956
Oh no.

01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:35.206
Santa Barbara.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.970
I don't know what
happened here.

01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:42.110
You guys made it over
the course.

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:43.360
Have you been drinking?

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:47.285
Has the robot been drinking?

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:54.110
Pelagonians, coming
in [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:56.135
It's a very technical
challenging course, obviously.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.340
We might have had a low battery

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:01.610
here with fuel warnings.

01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:03.200
I don't know if they can do
a pit stop and swap out.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.030
Start them over.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:16.650
OK, so you got a ramp
over here, he says.

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:17.900
Pit crew?

01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:24.920
For those of you who are still
paying attention to this,

01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.955
without the phone, I don't think
you have enough weight.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.555
But I lied.

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:34.370
There we go, tank.

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.280
OK, you've done this before,
Santa Barbara.

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.530
You know how to do this.

01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:43.450
OK, watch your hands now,
watch your hands.

01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:45.293
Even playing field, OK?

01:14:45.293 --> 01:14:48.040
And remember this way is
opposite in TV land.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.260
All right, you're
looking good.

01:14:52.815 --> 01:14:56.200
OK, very technical aspect.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.880
I Fix It coming on around.

01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:02.707
Navigating, this is where
it gets easy, but

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.394
you've got a tough one!

01:15:04.394 --> 01:15:05.840
Here comes [INAUDIBLE]!

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.322
Oh my god!

01:15:06.322 --> 01:15:08.250
What could happen?

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:08.720
Beat down.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:10.370
All right, you've got
it, you've got it!

01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:11.300
You know how to do this.

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.720
You've got to get to
that gate before.

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.200
Oh my god, they're sweating.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.108
The concentration
unbelievable.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:26.130
Such a close race,
unbelievable.

01:15:26.130 --> 01:15:26.856
That's the closest
race we've had.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:27.553
TREVOR JOHNS: I think either
of them easily

01:15:27.553 --> 01:15:28.910
could have won there.

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:30.820
So I've got Stephen
[? Canvan ?]

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:32.600
with me here from LEGO.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.150
This is the second year we've
been doing this, the first

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:36.390
year we've been live
streaming it.

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:39.170
So Stephen, tell me a little bit
about what it's like to be

01:15:39.170 --> 01:15:40.540
back here, the atmosphere.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.630
What do you think
of this event?

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:41.950
STEPHEN CANVAN: Right.

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:46.340
Well Trevor, last year, it was
cool and awesome, but this

01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:50.560
time, we are really
lifting the bar.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:53.060
This is the best event
at South By, really.

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:57.080
That's what we said last year,
but this time, it's even true.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.590
TREVOR JOHNS: [INAUDIBLE]
true.

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:00.710
There's a lot of excitement
in the air.

01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:01.390
I think I agree.

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.480
This is by far the best event.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.235
TYLER HANSON: I'm sweating.

01:16:06.235 --> 01:16:10.050
Punching Muffins and Team GB.

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:12.260
Where's my Great Britain
boys at?

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.912
Founding fathers?

01:16:13.912 --> 01:16:16.530
Oh boy, they clearly
have been drinking.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.830
They're going to break out into
soccer songs here soon.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.580
All right, how are
we looking, guys?

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:24.915
Pick your course,
pick your lane.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.620
OK, again, we have two different
styles, one with a

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.250
track system and one
with the wheels.

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:38.690
Now, Punching Muffins didn't
navigate fairly well,

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:39.290
and you fixed it.

01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:44.760
And Team GB, coming in with
the old Sherman Tank.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.556
Are you guys ready?

01:16:46.556 --> 01:16:47.806
We're going to keep this
thing rolling.

01:16:50.805 --> 01:16:53.800
Thumbs up?

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.520
Ready to go?

01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:55.580
Start your engines.

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:59.850
On your marks, get set, ride!

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:02.472
TREVOR JOHNS: So two very, very
simple designs here, both

01:17:02.472 --> 01:17:05.750
of them proven, both of them
much simpler than what we saw

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.080
in the last round.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.670
So I think in this case, we're
going to see very similar

01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:11.200
performance here from
both of them.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.540
Really, though, it's going
to come down to

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:14.230
treads versus wheels.

01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.680
My money's on treads, just
because of its ability to go

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.170
and clear obstacles so well.

01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:22.000
The really interesting thing
will be to see whoever wins

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.220
this round pitted up against
the winners of next round.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.310
So we'll see a very simple
design against a much more

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:30.380
elaborate design, and see
who comes out of this.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:33.510
But in this case, really it's
just treads versus wheels and

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.450
see how that goes.

01:17:36.450 --> 01:17:37.570
TYLER HANSON: All right,
[INAUDIBLE]

01:17:37.570 --> 01:17:40.694
powering through.

01:17:40.694 --> 01:17:42.780
I agree Trevor, whoever's going
to win this one is going

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:44.230
to go into the top qualifier.

01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:45.480
GB's coming out of the gate.

01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:51.620
Oh, does the same trick again!

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.620
Unbelievable!

01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:55.960
I don't know what they call it
in Britain but in America, I

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.990
can't say that on TV.

01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:59.400
TREVOR JOHNS: Exact same
obstacle that flipped them

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:01.470
over last time.

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:03.140
Unless that other bot's able
to clear in the next few

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.210
minutes, or the next few
moments, rather, I think we're

01:18:06.210 --> 01:18:07.880
going to see another victory
for the treads.

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:12.020
TYLER HANSON: Yeah, the way that
they're going to navigate

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:17.630
this and come in in style,
clearly, Team Great Britain is

01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:20.625
just too much for
the Americans.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.840
Yes, you can do it.

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.090
Unbelievable!

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:34.000
For the Queen!

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.970
For the Queen.

01:18:36.970 --> 01:18:40.710
One minute 30, unbelievable
time, boys.

01:18:40.710 --> 01:18:42.730
Technical skills knocking
them out.

01:18:48.286 --> 01:18:51.800
I Fix It and Geek Dad.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.800
Yeah, you are.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:56.350
I Fix It and Geek Dad, we are
down to the final three teams

01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:57.600
for this competition.

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.820
I was just told that we now
have one million people

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.250
watching this on YouTube.

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.210
Unbelievable.

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:08.880
MALE SPEAKER: Only
one million?

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.130
TYLER HANSON: Only
one million.

01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:20.210
We got batteries, we
got batteries.

01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.650
Go, step into the pit stop.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.986
MALE SPEAKER: John,
how are you?

01:19:26.986 --> 01:19:28.236
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:38.970
TYLER HANSON: Absolutely.

01:19:38.970 --> 01:19:44.480
Back at the studio, we are
rebuilding the whole studio

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.254
and thinking about
some things.

01:19:46.254 --> 01:19:48.860
Ladies and gentlemen, for those
of you who are still

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:53.310
with us, I just want to say I'm
really proud that you are

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:54.730
still with us.

01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:57.500
It takes a lot of stamina
to watch people--

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.280
let me rephrase that.

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:04.594
Grown adults watch grown
adults play with LEGOs.

01:20:04.594 --> 01:20:07.100
You know, I don't know what you
guys wanted to be when I

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:12.980
grew up, but never did I think
that it would be a LEGO

01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.230
telecaster.

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:21.960
I would like to thank our
sponsors, beer and alcohol.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:27.180
But really, none of this could
happen without the great

01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:32.376
wonders of the Danish minds
of LEGO and Google.

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:39.300
In case you're wondering,
YouTube is part of Google,

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:41.240
thus we have such great
placement on

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.491
the page right now.

01:20:43.491 --> 01:20:45.470
Back in the day, I used to
have to pay for that.

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:14.280
Ladies and gentlemen, for those
of you who are just

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.410
getting here, this really
is a LEGO race.

01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:21.580
This is all happening
right now.

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.226
This isn't a figment of
your imagination.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.610
These are all individual,
unique snowflakes.

01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:31.700
How's that battery
change coming?

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.950
TREVOR JOHNS: So we are using
rechargeable battery packs,

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:50.350
and we have a supply of them
for all the racers.

01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:52.710
So in theory, these changes
should be pretty quick.

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:56.720
But the problem is, when you
go build your robot around

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.110
these control bricks, and the
battery's located underneath

01:21:59.110 --> 01:22:00.280
the control brick.

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:03.760
So by the time your robot is
finished, you might not have

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.510
access to the battery pack
anymore, and that's what we're

01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:06.710
seeing right here.

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:09.130
So they'll definitely get it in
a moment, but they do have

01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:11.350
to partially take their robot
apart just to get to the

01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:14.260
bottom of that control pack
and swap that battery out.

01:22:14.260 --> 01:22:17.630
So I'm sure they'll be back in
action in just a moment here.

01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:30.980
TYLER HANSON: All right, I Fix
It, how are we looking?

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.014
What do we got?

01:22:33.014 --> 01:22:34.425
You feel solid?

01:22:34.425 --> 01:22:37.760
OK, they're back!

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:41.300
So for those of you who
just showed up,

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:42.420
this is how we roll.

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.150
OK, we got a sign, we
got meters, we got

01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:47.330
lights, we got radar?

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:50.415
OK, on your marks.

01:22:50.415 --> 01:22:51.710
Geek Dad, you ready?

01:22:51.710 --> 01:22:53.470
OK.

01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.820
I Fix It, pay attention.

01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:54.900
Ready?

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:58.900
On your mark, get set, ride!

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.110
And they're coming
out of the gate!

01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:01.870
Geek Dad, always fresh out of
the gate, never having a

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:04.700
problem with that.

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.820
I Fix It, falling down.

01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:10.390
Geek Dad, navigating
everything.

01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:11.640
Unbelievable.

01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:18.200
You guys can't see, but Geek
Mom is furiously giving the

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.080
oomph to Geek Dad.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:23.562
Unbelievable, coming
over the course.

01:23:23.562 --> 01:23:26.940
You know, they have just figured
out this whole thing.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:31.018
I mean, they are like the
Michael Jordan of LEGOs.

01:23:31.018 --> 01:23:34.200
He blew out a droid,
that's two points.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:40.560
You got this, it's Geek Dad.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:46.630
One minute 27.

01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:50.696
27 seconds.

01:23:50.696 --> 01:23:52.220
He can't count.

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.020
37.

01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:56.030
You have now broken all
of your own records.

01:24:00.084 --> 01:24:01.488
OK, stay there.

01:24:01.488 --> 01:24:04.150
Let's pass the holy--

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:07.630
final round, ladies
and gentlemen!

01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:12.050
The moment I have been
waiting for.

01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:14.570
GB, you got it?

01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:16.660
Holy Grail, coming in, watch
yourself, watch yourself.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:22.360
A super prize there,
very nice bot.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:25.350
You know, Trevor, I just picked
up Geek Dad's bot, and

01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:27.648
you can really feel
the girth of it.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.990
I'll give you a moment
to check your stuff.

01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:38.310
Pump your tires,
check your oil.

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:40.444
Is your RAM OK?

01:24:40.444 --> 01:24:41.694
Battery power?

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:53.640
You want to get out of here?

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.160
OK, this is it.

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.850
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
spent 12 hours trying to get

01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:01.100
to this place.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:04.000
So it comes down to these two.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.910
All the way across the
pond, Team GB, aka

01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:09.140
the Green Bay Packers.

01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:12.500
Sorry, Great Britain,
just for a joke.

01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:17.525
And all the way from
the internet, Geek

01:25:17.525 --> 01:25:18.970
Dad and Geek Mom.

01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:21.860
Are you guys ready?

01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.880
OK, this is it, folks, you're
not going to get to watch

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.760
another race after this, except
for the loser round.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:32.923
On your marks, get set, Droid!

01:25:36.626 --> 01:25:39.110
[HUMMING RACING TUNE]

01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:41.580
All right, the Sherman Tank
against the Green Goblin!

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:45.810
Geek Dad, navigating the way,
steady but always on!

01:25:45.810 --> 01:25:47.780
Geek Dad, over the
mountain, going

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.030
through the green mountain.

01:25:51.490 --> 01:25:53.832
GB's taking [INAUDIBLE] tough
one, slowly but surely!

01:25:53.832 --> 01:25:55.100
Geek Dad, battling it
out, [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:00.660
The pressure is on, he's
looking tough.

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:03.470
GB, back to his own, the
full monty, he does the

01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.645
[INAUDIBLE].

01:26:04.645 --> 01:26:06.800
Oh, but it doesn't matter,
you've got to get over this.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.630
Come on, Geek Dad, we know
you can do this.

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.952
You've done it a
million times.

01:26:10.952 --> 01:26:13.650
You've done it three if
you've done it twice.

01:26:13.650 --> 01:26:16.510
Here it comes, but he still
has to navigate through.

01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:17.760
You've done this check--

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:28.440
Geek Dad, you got it.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:28.870
There we go.

01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:34.385
All right, presses on, get out
of the way, plowing through.

01:26:34.385 --> 01:26:34.680
USA!

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.780
Unbelievable.

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:37.300
Geek Dad, coming from behind.

01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.220
Can you believe the suspense?

01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.760
Oh, there we go.

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.400
Geek Dad, you [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.688
Take your time, be patient.

01:26:47.688 --> 01:26:50.128
No!

01:26:50.128 --> 01:26:51.378
Unbelievable!

01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:04.040
All the way from the
pond, it's still

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:05.290
trying to move around.

01:27:23.865 --> 01:27:24.880
Nantesters.

01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.990
OK, so post-analysis,
cut to Trevor.

01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:29.020
Holy cow, I had no idea that
Great Britain would

01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:30.520
pull that one out?

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.426
TREVOR JOHNS: Wow.

01:27:31.426 --> 01:27:33.680
You know, very, very different
design philosophies

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.290
from both of robots.

01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:40.120
You had Geek Dad and Geek Mom,
which built a very large,

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.250
heavy robot with
a lot of speed.

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.005
And on top of that,
they combined

01:27:45.005 --> 01:27:46.460
it with great traction.

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:48.640
They will clear right over that
first obstacle, over the

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:51.210
mice, and make a straight
line across.

01:27:51.210 --> 01:27:53.600
If they hadn't gotten stuck, I
think they had a great chance

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.560
of winning.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:57.210
On the other hand, the other
robot just kept going.

01:27:57.210 --> 01:27:58.240
You could not stop it.

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.115
You flip that robot, it
was on its side, and

01:28:00.115 --> 01:28:01.220
it just kept driving.

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.120
So really just a testament
to the

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.652
perseverance of that design.

01:28:04.652 --> 01:28:07.140
I think either of these guys
could have won, it was just

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.460
bad luck that Geek Dad and Geek
Mom got stuck on that

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.610
second obstacle there
on the ramp.

01:28:12.610 --> 01:28:15.400
All right, back to you, Tyler.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.780
TYLER HANSON: Unbelievable.

01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:19.790
I am completely blown away by
what has happened here.

01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:22.420
We are now onto our way where
we're going to give away our

01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:23.670
actual style award.

01:28:25.945 --> 01:28:29.280
Ladies and gentlemen,
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:30.530
Where's my Pelagonians?

01:28:36.242 --> 01:28:37.492
Nice job.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.160
We still have two more awards
to give away, OK?

01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:51.310
All right, everybody here can
help me out here, because what

01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:55.675
we're going to do is give a show
of hands, show of hands

01:28:55.675 --> 01:28:58.450
for actually who's going to win
this little style award.

01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:00.798
Now who am I missing?

01:29:00.798 --> 01:29:02.770
I got Nantes.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.220
Where's my other guys?

01:29:07.370 --> 01:29:08.620
Where's Curious Creatures?

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:13.790
Curious Creatures?

01:29:22.410 --> 01:29:24.070
And then we're missing
one more.

01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:27.040
Pelagonians, where's
my Santa Barbara?

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.200
Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara?

01:29:32.684 --> 01:29:35.325
Ah, that's WALL-E.
He's hiding.

01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:46.480
Santa Barbara, where
are you at?

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.070
Yes, WALL-E, come on in.

01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:48.350
OK, there we go.

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:51.730
You guys could still
win for style.

01:29:51.730 --> 01:29:54.546
All right, put it
down Nice there.

01:29:54.546 --> 01:29:57.360
Very proper.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:00.040
Look at this beautiful
collection of industrial

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:02.310
design and manufacturing
in America.

01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:05.911
Who says we don't make anything
anymore in America?

01:30:05.911 --> 01:30:08.500
Proof.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:09.750
We're going to only take one.

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:15.150
OK, hold tight.

01:30:15.150 --> 01:30:17.410
I want you guys to vote with
your minds, though, OK?

01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:24.450
That's a good shout out.

01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:25.700
OK, I'm going to start here.

01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:31.930
OK you are my voting board,
everybody here.

01:30:31.930 --> 01:30:33.990
If you're drinking and not
paying attention to me, I want

01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:35.130
you to go into the bar, OK?

01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:36.780
I'll throw you out of here.

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.480
This is serious business.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.920
For style, you guys
are going to rate.

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.170
I'm going to call out, and I
want you just to raise your

01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:45.690
hand, I'm going to
take a show.

01:30:45.690 --> 01:30:47.266
For WALL-E--

01:30:47.266 --> 01:30:50.710
no whoo-ees, no whoo-whoos.

01:30:50.710 --> 01:30:53.720
OK, a few handfuls not bad.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:57.240
For Team Curious Creatures,
what do we got?

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:01.620
Anybody else?

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.490
Anybody else?

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:04.186
No?

01:31:04.186 --> 01:31:07.600
OK, for this guy?

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:08.360
Unbelievable.

01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:13.350
I'm going to give it all the
way to France, Nantes.

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:16.470
And you guys were here the
first, so thanks for coming

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:17.720
and playing.

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.650
You win.

01:31:19.650 --> 01:31:20.900
Winning style.

01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:27.630
For those of you who don't know,
they couldn't make it

01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:28.870
out of the starting gate.

01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:31.640
So style does not equal
functionality.

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.250
Oh man, but it looks good.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.485
OK, go ahead and
pull this guy.

01:31:57.485 --> 01:32:01.980
Santa Barbara, I'm
so proud of you.

01:32:01.980 --> 01:32:04.140
Go ahead and take
your bot back.

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.570
You've got to take it.

01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:08.320
There you go.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:10.270
Nantes, go ahead and take it.

01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:11.850
Clear the runway.

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:16.100
Ladies and gentlemen, not only
was this one stylish, but it

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:19.570
also gets the award for being
the most technically advanced

01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:20.820
in the LEGO competition.

01:32:26.310 --> 01:32:30.810
Technically, it didn't really
work, so I don't think they

01:32:30.810 --> 01:32:32.060
should get anything technical.

01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:42.330
Now, we have one more
race to do.

01:32:42.330 --> 01:32:46.230
We have these two guys, who
are the [INAUDIBLE].

01:32:46.230 --> 01:32:50.980
So we're going to come down to
the number two winner, which

01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.894
I'm going to put a lot
of money on Geek Dad.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.710
OK, in case you were wondering,
we're still going.

01:33:21.710 --> 01:33:22.830
This is it.

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:25.350
This is the final is that I'm
going to announce for the rest

01:33:25.350 --> 01:33:30.410
of my life for LEGOs
this year.

01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:33.360
OK, you guys looking good?

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.650
This is just a straight
fight to the finish.

01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:37.352
First man across, that's
all he gets.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:43.540
And go!

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:47.490
Coming out of the gate,
Buckeyes, looking tough,

01:33:47.490 --> 01:33:48.600
holding strong.

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:51.530
Geek Dad, going over
the mountain.

01:33:51.530 --> 01:33:52.590
That's just an illusion.

01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:53.840
[INAUDIBLE].

01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:56.660
OK, we'll start over.

01:33:56.660 --> 01:34:00.440
It's all right, drag it out.

01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:02.050
This is called beating
a dead horse.

01:34:06.370 --> 01:34:10.770
I would like to thank all of
you for being so patient.

01:34:10.770 --> 01:34:15.590
I would like to thank all of
you for playing with little

01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:16.840
LEGOs when you were children.

01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:20.540
I'm getting very--

01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:24.860
that's unbelievable.

01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:25.720
Geek Dad's coming on, though.

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.970
Look out!

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:35.000
That's called a do over.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:36.920
You still have time, you
still have time.

01:34:41.890 --> 01:34:44.380
You drive like you're
from Ohio.

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.640
Did we lose the Droid?

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.900
Come on, Geek Dad.

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:54.792
There we go.

01:34:54.792 --> 01:34:55.920
You're home free.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.530
The Droid died.

01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:58.780
There we are, you're
back on it.

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.030
You still have time.

01:35:11.010 --> 01:35:13.750
The suspense is killing me.

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.600
This is unbelievable.

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.600
Never in the history of LEGO bot
racing have we had a race

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.390
quite like this.

01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:25.300
Geek Dad, I think you've got to
parallel park that thing.

01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:27.820
Come on, get in there.

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:29.970
Yeah!

01:35:29.970 --> 01:35:31.220
That's a victory lap.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.940
Ladies and gentlemen, I am so
proud of all of you for

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:40.600
watching grown adults watch
grown adults play with LEGOs

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:44.300
at South by Southwest. We're
coming to do all they way from

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:47.880
the Google Developer House here
in Googlelandia at the

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.390
Google Village.

01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:50.950
I'd like to thank LEGO.

01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:51.900
Thanks, LEGO.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:52.860
I'd like to thank Google.

01:35:52.860 --> 01:35:54.390
Thanks, Google.

01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:56.760
I'd like to thank all of you
for drinking and watching

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.940
people play with LEGOs.

01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:02.080
Do I need anything else?

01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:02.980
Oh, NewTek!

01:36:02.980 --> 01:36:04.450
NewTek, for doing all
this streaming.

01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:05.860
Thank you guys for making
me look good.

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:08.130
My name is Tyler Hanson, I don't
care if you care about

01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:10.200
that, but that's what I do.

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.100
Give it up for everybody.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:11.890
You're done!

01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:15.306
It's over!

01:36:15.306 --> 01:36:28.510
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:31.390
MALE SPEAKER: We're here in
Austin, Texas, where teams

01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:33.490
have gathered from all over the
world to test their skills

01:36:33.490 --> 01:36:36.340
at conquering a custom built
obstacle courses using nothing

01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:39.100
but a LEGO Mindstorms
kid and an

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.560
Android-powered phone or tablet.

01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:45.580
Live from the Google Developers'
House at South by

01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:47.700
Southwest, this is
Google Developers

01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.140
LEGO Mindstorms Rumble.
