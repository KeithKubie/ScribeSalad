00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.269
MIKE: Check out
this little bridge.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:04.771
There's the building
right there, baby.

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:08.141
FRANK: It's big.
[honks horn]

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:09.743
MIKE: Hey-hey!
BOB: Hi, there.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:10.877
MIKE: Hey, you Bob?
BOB: I am.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:11.911
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.
BOB: Hi, Mike.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.946
MIKE: Nice to meet you.
This is Frank.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:13.947
FRANK: Hey, Bob,
how're you doing?

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.981
I'm Frank.
BOB: Doing good, Frank.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.249
MIKE: Hit him with the flyer,
Frankie.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.384
FRANK: Here's some of the stuff
that maybe Danielle

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.752
went over with ya.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.086
MIKE: How many years did
your dad work at Ford?

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:22.622
BOB: Uh, pretty much all of
his life, so since he was 18.

00:00:22.622 --> 00:00:25.024
BOB: My dad was an engineer
for Ford Motor Company,

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:26.326
vehicle development.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.361
MIKE: I can see right here,
you've got gas pumps,

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.529
so gas pumps is on there.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.764
BOB: Yep,
I think there is pumps.

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:32.265
FRANK: Advertising.
MIKE: Any kind of advertising...

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.267
BOB: Yeah, there's
a few signs in here.

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:35.502
MIKE: How long was
your dad collecting?

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:36.703
Was he collecting
his whole life?

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.904
BOB: Pretty much
his entire life.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.273
BOB: My dad was really
drawn to anything

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:43.676
that was related to Ford
and the automotive industry.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.012
BOB: Unfortunately, he passed
away when he was 50 years old.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:47.447
MIKE: Oh, wow.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:51.518
BOB: And it's taken the family
25 years now to kind of say,

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:54.754
"Hey, this stuff
really needs to go."

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.990
BOB: Everything in that barn
has remained untouched

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.558
for the past 25 years,

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.560
because my dad put it there,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.861
and disturbing that would be

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.396
almost like
disturbing his memory.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.433
MIKE: Well, I'm glad
that you guys are at the point

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.901
where you're gonna start
selling some stuff,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:12.005
because all of these things will
mean so much to other people.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.607
MIKE: I can understand why
it's taken him this long

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.277
to want to move forward
with the collection.

00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:18.678
I mean, this is
his father's space.

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:19.913
MIKE: What's this one?

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.381
This is a sign I dug out
from over there.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.715
Here's the cool thing,
look it.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.652
You can just see
"Pennsylvania..." something

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.654
"made gas."
But look...

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.355
BOB: What's that?
MIKE: This, this is cut off.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.490
BOB: Oh.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.325
MIKE: So this was
a longer sign at one time.

00:01:32.325 --> 00:01:33.460
BOB: So they repurposed it.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.861
MIKE: Yeah, they
repurposed it, exactly.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:37.030
The killer thing,
is that it's wood,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.233
it's hand-painted,
and it's gasoline 25 cents.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:42.202
That's the biggie.
BOB: It's nice.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:44.037
MIKE: Um...

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.338
200.
BOB: 200?

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:46.372
MIKE: That's kind of where
I feel I need to be on it.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.774
You know what I mean?
BOB: Uh...

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.042
Would you...

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.211
give me two and a quarter?

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:54.080
â™ª

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.415
MIKE: I'm gonna do it.
BOB: Great.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:56.583
MIKE: I'm doing it.
BOB: Great.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:57.884
MIKE: Thank you very much,
I appreciate it.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.118
BOB: Thank you, Mike.
FRANK: Hey, Bob?

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.720
BOB: Yeah, Frank.
FRANK: Check that out.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.121
BOB: Ooh.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.557
FRANK: I mean, you see Pepsi
coolers, you see Dr. Pepper...

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:06.125
BOB: Yep.
FRANK: ...7-Up.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.694
But you don't see ginger ale.

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.230
Um, if I remember right,
this came out of Detroit.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.031
It's missing the spout
on this side,

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.601
but I mean,
it's a great advertising piece.

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.736
Would 100 buy it?

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.137
BOB: Uh...

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.573
Can you do 125?

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:23.710
FRANK: 115.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.944
BOB: 115.
FRANK: Deal?

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.479
BOB: Deal.
FRANK: Thanks, buddy.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.448
BOB: I'm really glad to have
Mike and Frank come out

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.049
and see my father's collection.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.985
I feel better than good,
I feel excited

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.787
that there's the opportunity
for someone

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.424
to enjoy it like my dad did.
