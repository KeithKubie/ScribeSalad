00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.750
 The brain is amazing and complex and this has led to a lack of understanding of a large variety 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.520
 Of legends over the years. 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.660
 Such as "The Great is the Best". While this may be true for some other members, you just need 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.059
 Look at the brain whales Amber, the largest 6 times of the human brain, to see 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.630
 This myth collapses. Yes, they are certainly intelligent animals, but their cognitive skills 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.340
 Dwindling compared to what we have 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.330
 It was an enjoyable night? Do not worry, alcohol actually does not kill brain cells. although 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.650
 It causes damage and creates problems in transmitting messages between neurons, damage 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.500
 Are mostly reversible. Similarly, medications do not actually create holes in the brain. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.610
 Although some can permanently alter the functions of the brain, its structure, 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.590
 The only thing that can put a hole in the brain is physical trauma. 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.270
 A good thing is that you have 100 billion brain cells - or not. Surprisingly, it was not until 2009 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.730
 That scientists have discovered that the real number to be closer to 86 billion. Make sure it looks 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.870
 Is a small difference, but these 14 billion neurons are equal to the size of the monkey's brain. 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.700
 To further develop these figures in perspective, see that 1 million seconds 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.800
 Is 12 days, while 1 billion seconds is 31 years old. The difference is 14 billion neurons 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.940
 It may not be too small after all. 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.820
 Regardless, we can not use all of them, right? 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.890
 Most movies and science fiction books carry us to believe that humans can only use about 10% of our brain ... which is nonsense. 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.720
 With modern brain scanning technology, we know we are using the whole thing - all the time! 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.980
 Not necessarily every time - when you walk, for example, parts of the brain 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.000
 Associated with a more active movement than other areas. However, there is no part of 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 The brain simply does not do anything. It represents 3% of body weight and uses 20% of your body's energy needs. 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.580
 This is a busy brain! 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.610
 But we generally use one side more than the other, do not we? Both! At the time it may be 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.890
 I am convinced that if you are more logical or analytical, you are more using the "left brain" and if you are more 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 Creative or intuitive that you are using the "right brain" it simply is not true. While different aspects 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.340
 Of the brain is already used to perform specific functions - for example, language is used 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.530
 Language is used in the left half of the brain while the right half helps to read emotions 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.960
 - Studies on thousands of individuals have not found evidence of right or left dominance in individuals. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.740
 In other words, you can use both sides. 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.550
 And you do not actually have 5 senses as I always said - in fact, you have 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.230
 Much more! For example a sense of pain, or body posture, in the sense of how our bodies are centered. 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.780
 Not to mention the sense of balance, temperature 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.010
 And the passage of time. 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.440
 Scientists at Global Research Centers GE is collaborating with leading researchers 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.590
 And institutions to reveal new insights about brain functions. If you are interested 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.450
 In uncovering falsehoods or understanding more about the brain, you can follow its progress 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.640
 In the GE reports, they work together to eliminate the greatest brain superstitions.
