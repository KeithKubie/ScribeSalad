00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.939
My favorite monster of ALL time is the abominable
snowman! Mostly because I KNOW he doesn’t

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.410
exist. Like NO WAY!
[Scream]

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.560
I wasn’t yeti for that...

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.750
Hey there, little monsters, it’s Natalia
for DNews!

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.680
If you’ve watched the classic Rudolph Christmas
specials, or seen Scooby Doo, or ridden Disney’s

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.140
Matterhorn ride, you’re familiar with the
fabled Yeti, or abominable snowman. For centuries,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.830
tales have been told about a giant bipedal
ape wandering the Himalayas. In Nepal, legends

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.040
of this mythical beast served as warnings
to be wary of wild animals. These legends

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.780
are not so different from the origin of Yeti’s
of North American cousin and greatest hide-and-go-seek

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.570
champ, Bigfoot, Sasquatch, or Skunk Ape.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.829
These legends led to explorers searching far
and wide for evidence of ape men. They’ve

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.550
casted footprints, collected bones, taken
blurry photos, and looked for possible Yeti

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.630
habitats. There is even a word for those who
study animals that are only rumored to exist-

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.390
cryptozoology. This not only includes the
study of Yeti and Bigfoot, but also of Orang

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.970
Pendek, Yowie, the Loch Ness Monster, Mer
People, and El Chupacabra. The main critique

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.640
of cryptozoology is that very few people follow
the scientific method...and the field has

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.930
been plagued with hoaxes. But in recent years,
scientists have collaborated with these cryptid

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.060
connoisseurs to conduct REAL scientific inquires
in hopes of finding this possible new primate

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.870
species using the gold standard of biology
-- DNA evidence. So even though the hunt for

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.990
Yeti may seem futile, there is an upside to
the increased popularity of cryptozoology.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.870
It allows scientists to teach scientific concepts
to a broader audience and, as a result, has

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.759
yielded some great accidental discoveries.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.799
Like Bigfoot, the majority of evidence for
Yeti’s existence has been anecdotal, including

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.900
sightings or footprints. However, with the
new ability to sequence environmental DNA,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.479
Yeti hunters can now collect biomaterials
when searching for this elusive loner. Environmental

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.110
DNA, or eDNA, is DNA that is left behind by
an individual in its environment. EDNA can

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.149
be gleaned from hair, feces, saliva, feathers,
soil, blood, blood meals from biting insects,

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.069
air (yes air), and water. Because the animal
doesn’t have to be present to collect eDNA,

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.760
scientists can conduct a whole ecological
survey without even seeing the animal they’re

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.709
looking for- like the fabled Yeti!

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.469
For instance, in 2014, alleged “Yeti”
hairs were collected and analyzed. The sample

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:25.379
came back as a bear hair. But not just ANY
bear hair. It was found to be a subspecies

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:30.290
of the Himalayan brown bear that had not yet
been discovered. Not a bad consolation prize...

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.559
Another upside to looking for Yeti? It allows
primatologists, those that study monkeys and

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.470
apes like myself, to talk about primate evolution!
If you’re searching for a new species of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.290
primate, you have to do your homework about
primates, right? Well, many ‘squatchers

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.040
and yeti connoisseurs believe Gigantopithecus,
an extinct Miocene ape that lived in India,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.159
Nepal, Vietnam, and Laos roughly 9 million
to 100,000 years ago, is the ancestor of these

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.709
ape men. Gigantopithecus is a genus with three
species, the largest being Gigantopithecus

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.120
blacki, which some researchers estimate was
over 8 feet tall!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.090
However, researchers are basing the height
of gigantopithecus solely on the size of its

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.810
massive mandible and a few HUGE teeth. Though
parts of Giganto were giant, we don’t know

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.900
anything about its postcranial morphology
-- everything below its head. And if you take

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.890
a look at Robust hominins, a bipedal human
ancestor, you can see they have a similarly

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.659
large mandibles and teeth. But we have fossil
evidence of the rest of this species body,

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.219
including this partial femur, that reveals
they were only about 4 ½ feet tall. So assuming

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:34.299
Gigantopithecus was 8 feet tall JUST based
on his jaw and teeth is a bit of a stretch!

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.779
As a primatologist, I know that the probability
of Yeti’s existence is directly adjacent

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:43.029
to zero. Sure, we are still discovering new
species of monkeys, including Cercopithecus

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:49.409
lomamiensis in Democratic Republic of Congo,
but an 8 foot tall abominable beast? Highly

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.930
unlikely. However, the lack of evidence is
not proof that it doesn’t exist. And it

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.499
gives scientists an opportunity to talk about
uber cool new conservation science, hopefully

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:04.879
leading to a more science-literate public!
That’s a future I’m Yeti for. Yeah I said

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:05.879
that...

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.760
What about you? Are you do you believe in
the Abominable Snowman or Bigfoot? Tell us

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.639
in the comments below. And if you're interested
in other hominid species and wonder if Neanderthals

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.319
were really all the dumb, check out this video
right here and thank you for watching.
