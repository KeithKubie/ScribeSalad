AUSTIN GROSSMAN: Hi everyone.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:07.230
Thanks for coming out
on pre-Labor Day day.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.670
I'm Austin Grossman.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.244
I wrote a novel, "Crooked."

00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:14.660
And we're going
to talk about that

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.451
and we're going to talk
about Richard Nixon

00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:19.230
and what he means.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.040
Here's my quick bio.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.350
I started out in the
'90s writing video games

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.190
and designing video games.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.120
Worked on "Ultima Underworld,"
I worked on "System Shock,"

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.720
worked on "Deus Ex."

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.540
Just doing the ones you
recognize, not the failures.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.290
I worked on "Epic
Mickey" and then

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.272
most recently, the
first "Dishonored" game

00:00:41.272 --> 00:00:43.730
and the second "Dishonored"
game-- I keep forgetting that's

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.640
public-- with Arkane Studios.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.240
I went to grad school for
English literature, which

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.400
is very, very useful on the
job market, it turned out.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.670
And I started writing novels.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.710
I wrote a first novel
called "Soon I Will Be

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.560
Invincible" about a
supervillain, which

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.760
I published at the age of 37.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.241
So I was not one of
your little prodigies.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.240
And then I published a
second novel called "You"

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.590
about working in the
video game industry

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.120
and what video games mean.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.010
And now, I wrote this
book about Richard Nixon.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.730
You'll notice the books are
totally different from one

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.790
another, which is what we
call "not building a brand"

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.404
in the book trade.

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:32.320
So I'm going to-- yes.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.990
I'm going to read a little bit
from the beginning of the book

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.010
and then we'll talk about Nixon.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.140
And then I'll read a little
bit from the end of the book.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.560
So this is Chapter 1.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.190
And to set the scene,
this is the night

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.340
of the Watergate break-in.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.770
This is Nixon sitting
around in the Oval Office,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.902
waiting to hear what's happening
over at the Watergate Hotel.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.130
"The Oval Office always
smelled of cigarette smoke,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.210
of medical disinfectant, and
a faint undercurrent of sage.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.260
I just hope no one ever puts the
great seal under a black light.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.300
Near the end, we had to steam
clean it after each new moon.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.530
The walls were a pale yellow and
on summer evenings like this,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.140
the flags hung limp, like
so much damp laundry.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.880
It's June 1972.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.490
There was nothing to do but
wait, all night if I had to,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.300
looking out at the
black Washington, DC sky

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.760
and my own reflection in the
window, an old man's reflection

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.770
now.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.640
I couldn't help sweating in the
June heat, my shirt and wool

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.870
jacket sticking to my back.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.950
It was always remarked that
I never took it off publicly.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.380
I don't like to come
across as too informal.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.760
That, and there was some
custom tailoring in there

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.090
that it wouldn't do
for people to see,

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.190
a hidden pocket that
held a small caliber

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.430
revolver with a speed loader.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.340
Regular bullets, no
silver-plated nonsense.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.600
My insurance policy,
along with a vellum scroll

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.915
held to my thin, pale, old
man's calf with a rubber band."

00:03:08.915 --> 00:03:10.880
Did I mention that the
other half of this book

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.010
is about a Lovecraftian
supernatural conspiracy?

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.650
Well, it is.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.160
This is my
Lovecraft-Nixon mashup.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.930
"I lit a cigarette.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.880
Pat would be asleep by now.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.300
No one awake but me and
the security guards.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.370
Franklin D. Roosevelt built
the modern version of the Oval

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.380
Office in the 1930s.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.150
At this hour, it can
feel like a time machine,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.180
going back to the barren
swampland that once was here,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.880
square miles of muck
and still black water.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.400
In November 1620, 500 miles to
the north, 102 British settlers

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.490
arrived and started dying.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.510
Half of them went
almost immediately,

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.620
from diseases caught
during the journey,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.420
coupled with no food
and a killing winter.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.660
Only four adult women
survived that first year

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.180
in the Plymouth colony, fugitive
Protestant mystics, Tillies

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.540
and Martins and Chiltons.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.040
They huddled together
in half-built log halls,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.579
reading by firelight on the
edge of a frozen continent

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.560
next to a dark forest
that stretched westward,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.850
all the way to the Mississippi.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.690
They couldn't even
bury their dead.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.640
Outside, the snow had
fallen six feet deep,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.860
and there were moving
shapes in the night.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.980
They were 53 people
without a country,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.320
watching one another die until
one of them-- we will never

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.210
know who-- walked
out into the darkness

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.760
to do what none of
the others would.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.670
The colony at Roanoke had died.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.400
Plymouth would live.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.830
I stubbed out the cigarette
and took off my jacket.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.820
It was time for
me to do my part.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.360
I closed the blinds, knelt
down, and pulled back

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.900
the carpeting to reveal the
greater seal of the office.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.320
I rolled up my left sleeve
and cut twice with a dagger,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.900
as prescribed, to release the
blood of the democratically

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.800
elected, the duly
sworn and consecrated.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.320
I began to chant.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.770
These were not the duties
of the US presidency

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.320
as I had once conceived of them.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.650
But really, ask yourself
if everything in your life

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.590
is the way they told
you it would be.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.970
I speak the words,
light the incense,

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.540
and try to clear my mind.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.360
But it isn't easy.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.930
The first time I was here
was with Eisenhower in 1953.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.290
He was a different kind
of man than you find now,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.790
the last president to be
born in the 19th century.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.220
He knew things almost
nobody knows now.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.500
He remembered waking
up at dawn to pray

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.950
to ancient gods of
small-town Texas.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.380
He told me a lot
about the war, things

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.360
that no one should ever know.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.550
He said that he wasn't afraid
of the future, only the past.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.200
I put my jacket back
on, thinking ahead

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.030
to what would be in that
room on the eighth floor

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.660
of the Watergate Hotel--
chairs pushed to the walls,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.170
perhaps a dead man
in a wool suit seated

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.100
in the lotus position in the
exact center of the room.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.560
It would be freezing inside--
outside, the heat of a June

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.040
night, packing crates
marked in Cyrillic letters,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.660
a scattering of black feathers.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.410
The Cubans would do their part.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.670
Afterwards, the
cleanup and the set

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.560
dressing, staging the next act.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.770
They'd be found and
the police summoned.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.890
The team would be
revealed as amateurish

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.770
hired hands caught
in the wrong place--

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.870
the coverup behind the coverup
Liddy would do his comic turn

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.410
as the loose cannon.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.150
History would take its turn.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.820
And my public life
would begin to unravel.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.900
But I survived.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.840
I outlived the hippies.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.720
I outlived Elvis and Marlene
Dietrich and the Soviet Union

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.310
itself.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.880
It's been 20 years
now since I was

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.100
forced to stage my own death.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.890
The tiny silicon disk on
the moon that bears my name

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.570
is slowly gathering dust.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.010
I lived on to see myself become
a laughingstock, a cartoon

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.940
villain-- that place in the
August roll call of presidents,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.270
where history
pauses and snickers.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.980
This is a story of the
great con game that

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.760
was the late 20th century,
of American history's worst

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.620
presidency, of how
I learned to lie.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.532
It is not history
as you know it.

00:07:45.532 --> 00:07:47.240
Suffice it to say that
there are at least

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.420
three sides to this story, and
I will be telling both of mine.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.960
I promise you, I will
show the same contempt

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.700
for the historical record
that it has shown for me.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.380
My name is Richard
Milhous Nixon.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.060
I swore an oath to preserve,
protect, and defend

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.820
the Constitution.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.850
I was educated at
Whittier College

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.670
in Whittier, California.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.050
And I have seen the devil walk."

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.713
And that is Chapter 1.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.960
And I thought I would
say a few words,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.170
because the first interview
question I ever encounter

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.810
on this book is
why I would choose

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:28.070
to write about Richard Nixon,
our uncanniest president.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.685
And there are several answers.

00:08:29.685 --> 00:08:31.560
For one thing, he was
our funniest President,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.844
I have to say.

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:34.010
I liked writing about Nixon.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.551
He's one of those people where
if you put him in any context,

00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:38.299
he's still funny--
in the grocery store,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.250
at the laundromat.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.580
He's always funny.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.390
And I thought, what if he was
a paranormal investigator?

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.390
That was the best
context I could possibly

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.460
think of for a Richard
Nixon character.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.040
So the book has
two major elements.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.460
Well, it's split a couple ways.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.770
It's split between
as accurate a staging

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.590
of the historical
record as I could do,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.650
and then a behind-the-scenes
story which, as I said,

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.390
involves a supernatural
conspiracy in a fairly H.P.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.610
Lovecraftian cosmos.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.140
Because again, what was the
funnest thing I could do,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.935
I asked myself.

00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:20.560
Does this work?

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.101
It does work.

00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:21.730
OK.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.040
That's Nixon.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.570
I couldn't tell writing
the book, I have to say,

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.080
if people would actually
know who Richard Nixon was.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.810
If you ever teach in a college,
you realize that, like, it's

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.020
not clear always whether
freshmen have a grasp of who

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.800
Bill Clinton was, to say nothing
of Communism and the Soviet

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.910
Union, I have to say.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:45.250
I was born in 1969, which is
just in the dim, dim past.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.000
Nixon was the President
when I was born-- maybe

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.380
for some of you as well.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.790
He was one of the first
public figures I was aware of.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.180
And that posed the question,
because when I was, like,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.930
five years old, I was
trying to make sense

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.490
of what the adult world was
like, or what made sense

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.320
and how it ran.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.800
And so I was aware of
Richard Nixon, very,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.010
very vaguely, as the top guy.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.860
He was number one in the
adult hierarchy of everything.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.210
But I was also aware that
he was a complete joke

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.890
and that everybody hated him.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.160
Because it was '74, '75.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.320
And that began my journey
into the conundrum

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.540
of the grown-up world.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.920
And trying to make sense of
it, it was a stumbling block

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.270
that I've never quite
gotten over, because what

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.800
the hell was going on?

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.000
So that was really
why I dived into this,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.580
to figure out the conundrum
or the secret of Nixon,

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.569
which is in some way the secret
of the adult world to me.

00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:40.610
Because we only see him
through hindsight, right?

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.890
almost a footnote at this
point and in history.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.910
And he's a joke
and he's a villain.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.440
But if you actually step
back to see his life,

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.105
you see how weirdly huge it was.

00:10:51.105 --> 00:10:54.150
He was born in 1913.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:58.440
He died in 1994, allegedly.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.250
He was this huge national
figure from the late 1940s

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.040
to the mid or early 1970s.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.700
He resigned in 1974.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:12.570
So he kind of spans and in
some ways sort of authors

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.460
the political life
of the second half

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.170
of the 20th century in America.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.852
There he is smiling about it.

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:23.810
I think that's when he
got elected to Congress.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:30.170
So he was in at the beginning
of Cold War paranoia.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.570
That's him at the
Alger Hiss trial,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:40.390
one of the early high profile
trials for treason for people

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.610
for Communist spying.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.615
He sort of got in at the
beginning of the idea

00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:45.240
that our friends and
neighbors could be

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.260
Communists and Communist spies.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:53.350
And that put him on the
national stage politically.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.730
At the beginning, he was a
little bit of a nonstarter.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.560
But you can see that he had
this presidential grasp of what

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.740
the political culture would be.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.830
And then he's Vice
President under Eisenhower.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:11.121
So he spends eight years in the
White House during the 1950s,

00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:12.620
at the heart of
things, at the heart

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:17.050
of the golden age, the
highway system, the beginnings

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:24.170
of the culture of the Cold War,
of the culture of brinksmanship

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.760
and containment and craziness.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.560
He's in at the death of Stalin.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.000
He's in at the hydrogen bomb
and all the crazy rapid response

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.930
stuff that gave us such lovely
drama as we were growing up,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.210
waiting for the world to end.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:44.760
That's him at the
Checkers speech,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.120
with his completely
inscrutable wife.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.840
He was losing.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.610
He was going to get kicked
off of the Vice Presidential

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.776
ticket, and he just rented
a half hour of prime time

00:12:54.776 --> 00:12:56.890
television and went on
completely without a script

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.789
and put his wife next to him and
talked about his dog, Checkers.

00:13:00.789 --> 00:13:02.330
And today it's a
joke, but in fact it

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:04.730
was an enormous
political triumph.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.770
Pat is the other major
character of the book.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.010
And if there's anybody we know
less about their inner life

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.540
in American history
than Nixon, it

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:19.870
is Pat Nixon, who was a
complete mystery to this day.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.600
The only good anecdote
I have about Pat

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.420
is-- actually what an
interviewer told me,

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:27.270
because he had interviewed
George McGovern after.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.440
And McGovern told
the story of after he

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.140
had lost the '72 election and
he was seated next to Pat Nixon

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.547
at a dinner.

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:35.880
And it was a little bit awkward.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.650
He had been completely
trounced in the presidency.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.140
And at some point, Pat
turned to him and said,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:45.020
you know he's crazy, right?

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.820
I can't vouch for that
anecdote, but at least I'm

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.270
not the one who made it up.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.600
At least somebody else did.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.470
Anyway, Nixon careers.

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.430
He's the heir apparent to
the presidency in the 1960s.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.549
Of course, he comes up
against John F. Kennedy,

00:13:58.549 --> 00:13:59.590
who he didn't see coming.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:02.380
He loses the popular
vote by 100,000 votes,

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.740
so one of the closest
margins in history.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.880
And I'm just spelling out his
weird dominance in everything.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.640
He was a political
outcast after that.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.280
That's, I think, a still
from the Kennedy debates.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.010
And I have to say, I think
most modern presidents

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.380
would avoid getting that
still taken of them.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:26.510
But this was an earlier,
much more spontaneous era

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.860
in political television.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.560
There he is having a complete
meltdown in 1963 after he

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.740
loses the gubernatorial race.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.240
He has the brilliant
idea of going off

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.160
script in his concession speech,
and just completely trashing

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.890
the political journalism of
the time, in a totally out

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.475
of control way.

00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:47.850
One of the things I love about
Nixon is that he's bizarre

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.250
and he's clearly just
barely holding it together

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.050
the entire time he's
in public, which

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.730
is again, one of the things that
made him great to write about.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.120
But then he comes back, and in
1968, he wins the presidency.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.410
He's exactly a
time-shifted Al Gore,

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:10.080
as if in 2008, Gore had come
back and just swept everything.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.740
He beat Ronald Reagan.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.070
He beat George Romney.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.140
He beat Nelson Rockefeller.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.340
Again, it's another complete
enigma in political history

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.786
that he was able to
come back and do that.

00:15:22.786 --> 00:15:24.160
And this is the
thing that people

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.660
miss in hindsight,
because everybody

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.430
knows the post-1974 Nixon.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.130
Everybody knows the
resignation and the disgrace.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.790
People forget that people
absolutely loved Richard Nixon.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.970
He was a beloved figure.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:40.320
He grew up legitimately poor.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.750
He was a populist.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.240
He was a pragmatist,
which is to say he

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.640
had no moral center whatsoever.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.890
But they loved him.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:55.540
There's him bringing--
that's Dick Cheney and Donald

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.490
Rumsfeld.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.710
And here's another weird quality
of him, which is that so much

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.770
of what he did is what
we got stuck with.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:09.560
I have to say, so much of what
we have now, Nixon gave us.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.980
He also brought George
Herbert Walker Bush.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.440
I mean, these guys
were getting in anyway.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:21.060
But Nixon was the one who
shook hands and welcomed them.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.070
He gave us the space shuttle.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.670
He pulled Roger Ailes
out of obscurity

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.570
in 1968, the
founder of Fox News,

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.660
and made him his media director.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:40.880
He sort of founded the
hyper-scripted, symbiotic

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.380
relationship between
the Republican

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:47.350
Party and a national
news organization.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.790
He got that going.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.320
He gave us the space
shuttle, for better or worse.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.400
When we did the Pluto
flyby, it totally

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.860
came out that we would
have had it a decade ago

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.360
if it weren't for Richard Nixon.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:04.640
He's the kind of Forrest
Gump of American politics.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.000
Like, once you look for
him in that entire era,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.600
he's absolutely everywhere.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:16.220
And by '72, he's one of the
most recognizable members

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.430
of our species on the
entire planet, which

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:24.186
is what makes it so bizarre
that in a couple of years,

00:17:24.186 --> 00:17:26.060
people were going to
realize that nobody ever

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.359
had any idea who he was.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.250
He was the sort of
cranky introvert.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:35.800
Almost nothing he said in public
was in any way uncalculated,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:40.600
except when he
completely lost his shit.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:42.614
And after a moment,
you could see it.

00:17:42.614 --> 00:17:44.280
Like, as far as we
can tell, we can only

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.363
tell two things about him.

00:17:45.363 --> 00:17:47.600
One was that he really,
really hated people who

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.650
went to Ivy League colleges.

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.150
Like, he just-- he hated what
he saw as the New England

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.860
aristocracy.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.200
He was from Orange County.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.180
And like I said,
he was legit poor,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.559
which is one of the few
things you can say for him.

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:03.100
And he really wanted
to be President.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.016
That's the other thing
that we know about him.

00:18:05.016 --> 00:18:08.300
Like, if there's any passion
we can detect in his life,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.730
that's the one.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:14.230
And he clearly got
in way over his head.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.060
He clearly could
not handle whatever

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.610
it was that was going on.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.290
I like to think of him as a
kind of patron saint of impostor

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.490
syndrome.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.340
Because he was totally
unfit for whatever it was he

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.550
got himself doing.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.560
Because the crime itself,
the Watergate break-in,

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.930
made no sense whatsoever.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.230
He sent people, or sent
people to send people,

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.890
however far the
chain goes, to break

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.010
into the Democratic
National Committee quarters

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.880
and steal some papers.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.430
He got nothing for that.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.120
He got nothing for that
and he won the '72 election

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.630
in a landslide, regardless.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.324
Brought down his entire
presidency for nothing.

00:18:51.324 --> 00:18:53.240
And for somebody who
obviously had the ability

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.070
to calculate
politically, it makes--

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:03.570
it's a profound
piece of nonsense

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.270
that for me, it needed
to be explained.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.880
What was going on in there?

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.960
And for somebody who almost
never sort of showed their hand

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.740
in public, was there
even a person in there,

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.350
as we understand it?

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.090
I wanted to show a
short-- that's sad Nixon.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:26.890
He's doing his resignation.

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:29.140
But he's fine, obviously.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:33.140
There's absolutely no reason to
feel sorry for Richard Nixon,

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.482
because he was, among other
things, a horrible person,

00:19:36.482 --> 00:19:37.690
which is not how I wrote him.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.260
But I just wanted
to-- to some degree,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.700
part of the challenge of this
book was to vindicate Nixon.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.610
I came up with it roughly at
peak Lincoln versus vampires,

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.070
when that thing
was a whole craze.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.200
And I thought to myself,
well, that's not a hard trick,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.650
making Lincoln a big hero.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.220
What would be a hard trick?

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.860
What would be the hardest
trick with a President?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.820
It would probably be Nixon-- not
our worst President, but very,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.090
very close.

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:09.920
I'm not going to go
into Andrew Jackson.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.570
Let's not do that.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:13.350
No, that's Nixon.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.410
That's a rare Nixon by
himself moment, I have to say.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.790
And that's more how I
think of him, just this guy

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.990
by himself, trying
to figure out,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:25.690
what the hell is my next
move-- and profoundly isolated.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.700
Because if you're Richard
Nixon, who exactly

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:32.310
do you trust with all your shit?

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.940
This is a very brief video clip.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:37.800
And I wonder if we can show
this from 26 seconds out.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.080
This is the famous-- I probably
can play this without audio.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.030
This is the famous "I
am not a crook" moment.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.290
This is in 1973, I think.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.990
He's well into the
impeachment proceedings.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.320
He's doing a press conference.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.640
He's actually standing in the
hotel at Walt Disney World.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.770
And the Nixon-Disney
World connection

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.770
is, I have to say, by itself
incredibly fascinating

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.144
and gets some play in the book.

00:21:01.144 --> 00:21:03.310
So if we can try to play
this from about 20 seconds,

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.851
this is where we
get the money quote.

00:21:07.414 --> 00:21:08.580
Yes, he's building up to it.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:11.225
I'm doing this
silently for a reason.

00:21:11.225 --> 00:21:13.600
American people have got to
know whether the President is

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.099
a crook.

00:21:14.099 --> 00:21:15.280
He is not a crook.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.000
And right now, he just
realized he said the worst

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.380
thing he possibly can.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.670
And he folds his arms.

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.990
And his body language, as
you watch the fuller clip,

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.470
just starts to go haywire.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.497
Because he knows he has
committed the greatest--

00:21:26.497 --> 00:21:28.080
I think he knows
immediately that he's

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.540
committed one of the greatest
political gaffes in history.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.530
Because again, he's
totally improvising.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.100
He nearly always improvised.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.280
He would start his--
when he was campaigning,

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.322
he started his campaign
speech by someone

00:21:45.322 --> 00:21:47.280
going to introduce him
and he would make people

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.146
take away the podium,
just to show that he

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:50.270
was speaking without notes.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.890
Because he thought people
cared about that, which

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.330
I think is one of the few
very touching moments,

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.590
was that he thought
people would like him

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.798
because he had a good memory.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.980
So Nixon is in the
center of all of this.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.907
And with his [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.240
I wrote a novel to explain that.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.730
And the way I explained it was
by inventing a Lovecraftian

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.800
darkness to the Cold War that
becomes a conspiracy that he

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.540
discovers when he's
investigating in Alger Hiss.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.840
And he just gets deeper
and deeper into it,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.430
and he can never tell anybody.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:26.190
Because one of the reasons is
that a pact with elder gods

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:31.050
is one of the keystones of
America's national defense

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.930
program in the Cold War.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.950
Because if we would
build the hydrogen bomb,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.627
we would make a pact
with Yog-Sothoth.

00:22:40.627 --> 00:22:42.210
There's just no
question that we would

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:44.043
do that if we had had
the chance, because he

00:22:44.043 --> 00:22:46.329
was so clear that we
would have done anything.

00:22:46.329 --> 00:22:47.870
And once you catch
hold of that idea,

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.380
you kind of feel
inevitably you have

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:55.716
to start writing a secret
history of the whole business.

00:22:55.716 --> 00:22:57.590
So the presidency isn't
what you think it is.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.379
The Constitution isn't
what you think it is.

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:01.920
And then there's
Nixon in the middle,

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.930
pretending that everything
is fucking normal.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.680
He's pretending it to
the American public.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.434
He's presenting it to his wife.

00:23:09.434 --> 00:23:11.100
The only people he
can tell the truth to

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.770
are a pair of KGB agents who
he's not even supposed to know.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.570
But they become
his best friends.

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.870
So the second element of the
novel is a character study.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.550
It's what's it like to have
a terrible, terrible secret

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.930
and at the same time to be
in the brightest spotlight

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.310
any human being can be in.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:35.940
And it's my attempt to
explain the darkness of Nixon

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:43.020
and what it would be like if you
were actually a normal person

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:47.180
to be in Nixon's
position, and then

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.270
to go through the
horror and then

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.371
actually to live on
through the humiliation.

00:23:53.371 --> 00:23:55.370
Because one of the starting
points for this was,

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.970
what was it like to be
Nixon in 1975 or 1980?

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.220
And you're still there.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.770
And everybody knows your face.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.420
Everybody knows what you did.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.832
Everybody has laughed at you
and is still laughing at you,

00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:10.290
and thanks to
"Saturday Night Live"

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.810
is just going to keep laughing
at you, for basically forever.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:22.390
And the second-- I'd like
to thank Google Image

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.900
search for letting me put
this presentation together

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.810
about a half hour ago.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.380
So that's the image I
took of Nixon-- Nixon

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.440
by himself on the
phone, kind of shadowy,

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.500
frantically trying to, say,
send some secret message

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.900
to somebody.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.640
And in my imagination,
what he's saying is,

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.380
get me the hell out of this.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.600
Whatever the hell I've
done, I need help.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.860
So I decided to let him talk
about it in his own voice.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.751
And so the second section is
from-- I think I set it in '83.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:08.540
So this is actually part of the
coda, the political afterlife

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.260
of Nixon.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.350
And he's going to one of
his-- I made this part up.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.820
He's going to one of his first
public speaking engagements

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.350
since-- it's well
after Frost/Nixon,

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:24.150
but it's one of his
first public speeches

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.860
as he's trying to come
back into political life,

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.010
because he thinks he can.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:28.740
He thinks he can.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.950
He came back in '68.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.890
He thinks he can not
run for President,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.660
but be a sort of statesman.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.190
So he's going to speak.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.170
"They led me in by
a side entrance.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.160
They took me through quiet
corridors to a steel door.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.440
I could hear the hum and
chatter of the excited crowd

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.750
as the mayor went in and gave
them one last reminder of who

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.070
they were about to see.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.980
And she told the story well.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.410
The Environmental
Protection Agency, Title IX,

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.770
peace in Vietnam, detente,
the voyage to China.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:00.590
And then as usual,
a slight faltering

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:04.120
through the last bits, edging
past the salient details

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.350
like a man on a narrow ledge.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.350
And then please welcome our
37th President, Richard Milhous

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:11.367
Nixon.

00:26:11.367 --> 00:26:13.200
I squared my shoulders
and made my entrance,

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.110
walked solemnly to the
lectern on the podium.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.430
There was a hush as I looked
out at the eighth grade

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:23.150
class of the Des Moines Martin
Luther King Jr. Middle School.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.570
I saw Pat standing at the
back of the gymnasium,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.060
watching it happen.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.080
I let the silence
drop and settle,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.760
breathed in and leaned forward
slightly to the microphone.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.330
And then as I pronounced
the first syllable,

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:36.970
every non-adult
person in the room

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.620
began to yell at the
top of his or her lungs.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.690
I was looking up into a
solid wall of gyrating arms

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:47.510
and bellowing faces and
children screaming at me.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.262
I had miscalculated.

00:26:49.262 --> 00:26:51.220
At first, I couldn't hear
the individual words.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:53.580
But then, I didn't
need to, did I?

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:55.390
Every single
monstrous one of them

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.160
was in the same identical
pose-- arms locked

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.770
rigid overhead, second and
third digit of each hand spread

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:04.930
in an ecstasy of inspired
mockery, shoulders hunched,

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.150
shaking phantom jowls, all
shouting the same thing,

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.510
chanting it, saying it like
I'd never said it-- not crook.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.360
I am not a crook.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.500
I am not a crook.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.820
I am not a crook.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.650
I am not a crook.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.530
Boys and girls, I began.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.360
It was like speaking
into a high wind.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.060
I stood stranded on
the podium, waiting

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.650
for the deluge to recede.

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.290
And if anything, it grew louder.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.630
I looked down at the
cheap wood of the lectern.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.580
I remembered other,
better lecterns.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.980
Boys and girls--
I started again.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.240
It just kicked them into a
higher gear, but I kept on.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.510
It's an honor to be here at
Martin Luther King Jr. Middle

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.240
School.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.570
It's truly marvelous.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.060
I couldn't possibly
be any happier."

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.330
I've never learned to do
a Nixon voice, by the way.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.890
But the guy who does
the audiobook kills it,

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.930
I have to say.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.130
"I was once just like you.

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:58.410
I went to a small school
in Yorba Linda, California,

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.800
in a time long distance.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.050
But my hopes and dreams
were the same as yours.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:02.940
I worked hard.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.790
And in 1946, I was
elected to Congress.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.580
The sun was dying down a little.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.650
In 1948, I was catapulted
to national-- "Tricky Dick!"

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.140
yelled a red-faced boy.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.370
And the cry was taken up.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.030
And near anarchy was again
loosed upon the gymnasium.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.720
Boy wore a t-shirt with the
word "Supertramp" on it.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.210
What the hell did that mean?

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.760
The principal hopped
onto the stage

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.350
and made as if to take
over, but I waved her off.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.690
Down below, children
ran left and right,

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.470
and objects were
thrown, and offenders

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.700
were dragged from the room.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.400
It was the Chicago
riots in miniature.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.400
They had Richard
Nixon himself here,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.229
and they were going to
make the most of it.

00:28:39.229 --> 00:28:40.770
It's all right, I
told the principal.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.570
They're just having
a little fun.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.200
It wasn't her fault.
If I hadn't wanted

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.670
to be mocked by
young teenagers, I

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.795
could have protected and
defended the Constitution,

00:28:47.795 --> 00:28:49.340
like I said I would.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:52.440
You know, boys and girls, I like
a joke as much as the next man.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.610
I really do, I said.

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.460
Politics is a tough
business, and you

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.430
don't get through
without it a thick skin.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.160
It's not always easy.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.400
I ran for Vice President
in '52 with Eisenhower.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.480
We had our own trouble with
the Communists in those days.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.937
Did eighth graders know
who Eisenhower was?

00:29:08.937 --> 00:29:10.770
They had at least heard
the word "Communist"

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.580
as a sort of socialist goblin.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.300
They were Reagan youth.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:19.940
We faced great challenges-- a
nation divided, Soviet Union,

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.390
spies, nuclear
missiles, the Cold War.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.252
I groped for words.

00:29:24.252 --> 00:29:25.210
What could I tell them?

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:26.480
What did these kids know?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.680
I looked out into the
blank half-pubescent faces.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.860
They knew Reagan, that
ignorant pretender.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.140
They didn't know
Eisenhower or Stalin or me.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.420
'For Christ's sake, I
was President,' I shouted

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.110
into the microphone
to a howl of feedback.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.740
In the back of the
room, Pat winced

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.870
and made a slight
shushing motion

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.390
with a pale and trembling hand.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:47.890
But I wasn't done.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.220
Who knew the truth now?

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.380
No one but her and
Kissinger, a creature

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.370
so far from human as
to scarcely matter,

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.610
a being who might
never die at all.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.600
I had to tell them the story.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.890
Your mothers and
fathers voted to make

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.970
me their supreme leader,
the most venerated position

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.870
an American can aspire to.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.510
Laugh if you want
to, but believe it,

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.230
you little shits, I was
your fucking President.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.540
When had the crowd gone silent?

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.820
I heard the last
words ring three times

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.080
through the gymnasium,
like Peter denying Jesus.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.817
And all at once,
I understood them.

00:30:24.817 --> 00:30:27.400
At their age, I didn't even know
what a President was, really.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.760
It was the people of our
country decided who was the best

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.000
person in all of America.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.930
And that person got
to make the decisions.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.490
And I, the boy they had
one day called Tricky Dick,

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.960
wanted to be that person.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.550
God, I wanted it.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.130
I cannot tell a lie.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.560
I don't know why.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.775
I just did.

00:30:44.775 --> 00:30:46.150
So I knew why they
were laughing.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.900
I'd taken the idea
of the presidency

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.574
and I'd turned it into a joke.

00:30:49.574 --> 00:30:50.990
And it's not that
it wasn't funny,

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.057
because whatever else I am, I
am history's funniest president.

00:30:54.057 --> 00:30:55.640
But these children
were laughing at me

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.960
to turn the thrust
of a disappointment.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.860
They were laughing
because I had hurt them

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.130
in a very personal way.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:03.950
I was President the year
they were born, the President

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.660
their parents gave them.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.460
The best person in America
turned out to be me.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.920
And they were still
trying to laugh me off.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.080
After I signed the
letter of resignation,

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.710
Pat and I walked to a
waiting helicopter clutching

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.770
our suitcases like newlyweds.

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.360
And the concrete chambers
beneath the White House

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.460
were then sealed forever.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.540
I am the last chief
executive ever

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.610
to have seen them or
practiced the vile sorceries

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.330
to which they gave me access.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:32.620
I looked at Pat.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.910
She shook her
head, no, leave it.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.670
The Cold War was a lie, and
far beyond the Iron Curtain,

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.960
the blacked-out science
city lay frozen and empty.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.900
There are truths so
awful they can't be told,

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.340
and words so dense and alien
and maligned that they take 18

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.580
and 1/2 minutes to say and even
digital tape cannot reproduce

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.450
their accursed sounds

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.800
The rooms of the sealed chamber
hold all these truths, last

00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:00.530
and least among
them that once I had

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.510
wanted to be President, defender
of the republic, the true one

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.770
that was promised
long ago, holder

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:13.490
of the highest office in all
the land, even if I am a crook."

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.780
That's the end of Nixon.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:24.080
I can do a little Q and
A or talking about Nixon.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.740
When I'm at a cocktail party and
I mention I write about Nixon,

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:28.448
anyone over a certain
age-- although they

00:32:28.448 --> 00:32:30.110
don't have to be--
has something,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.650
something to say about Nixon.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.570
I have to say it's weird.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.570
It brings something to
the surface in a way

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.851
that I find entertaining
and a little poignant.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.770
Oh, I forgot to say, also
director of design at a company

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.560
called Magic Leap, which Google
put an enormous amount of money

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.190
into.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.690
And that's a weird
coincidence and I

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.210
can't say anything about it.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:03.300
Anyway, question?

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.680
AUDIENCE: I was a senior in high
school in '94 when Nixon died.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.450
And I remember
reading the obits,

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.220
and I was just flabbergasted
that he was set forth

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.950
as this elder statesman that
everybody should listen to

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.800
and every new President
took the counsel of.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.990
I'm just curious if you have
any of your own insights

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:23.060
into how he went from
being a total laughingstock

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.722
to having nice obits.

00:33:24.722 --> 00:33:26.680
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: Everybody
went to that funeral

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.760
with a totally straight face.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.700
Everybody acted super solemn.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.870
I just assume it was because the
political culture just couldn't

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:39.390
assimilate the facts of Nixon.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.080
And they just found it better
to go into denial mode.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.250
They were trying to retrieve
the presidency for themselves.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.700
Bill Clinton was there, gave
a very good touching talk.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.160
They just couldn't admit
that Nixon had fucked it up

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.330
for them.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.250
That's my theory there.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.170
They were just trying
to hand wave themselves

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.670
through the whole matter.

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.320
In the book, Nixon
watches it on TV

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.230
and he dies laughing,
practically.

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.770
Yeah?

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.449
AUDIENCE: Sorry to
change gears here,

00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:12.679
I read "Soon I Will Be
Invincible" last year,

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:15.310
and I was curious to hear the
origin story of that book,

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:20.370
same as how you're describing
how "Crooked" came about.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.679
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: That has
an origin story, as it were.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.389
"Soon I Will Be
Invincible" is about what

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.460
it's like to be a
supervillain-- basically what

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.770
is it like to be Lex Luthor.

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:30.920
What is it like on the inside?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.600
What is it like when you go
home and have to make yourself

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.150
breakfast in your
secret fortress?

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.212
I have to say-- I mean,
that was my first book.

00:34:40.212 --> 00:34:42.670
I wrote it when I was in grad
school, when I was supposedly

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:44.820
going to be an
English professor.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.960
It's about a lot of things.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.595
It's probably about being
a graduate student, where

00:34:47.595 --> 00:34:49.170
everyone tells you
how smart you are

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:52.280
and then they just
totally step all over you.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.840
It's about just the
infuriated feeling

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.540
that you're incredibly
smart and the world

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.970
is just laughing at you.

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.480
And it's was also about
getting up in the morning

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.070
and doing it again.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.040
Because any supervillain
is like Wile E. Coyote.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.520
They come back, and they think
it's going to work this time.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.380
And that was, for
me, an affirmation

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.773
of the human spirit.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.079
And also because no one was
going to write-- at the time,

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:25.870
no one was going to
write "Watchman" again.

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:27.750
I just wanted to
read more "Watchman"

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.500
and I was going to
have to write it myself

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.990
if it was going to happen.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:35.440
And then of course they
did, which is even sadder.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.180
Question?

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.070
Hey.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:37.850
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:38.790
This may ramble for a bit.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:39.290
Sorry.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:40.720
One of the cool
things about Nixon

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.680
is that even those of us who
grew up after the whole thing

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.996
happened, we still have
those cultures from the time,

00:35:44.996 --> 00:35:47.120
from the '60s, from the
'70s, that refers to Nixon,

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.670
it feels so alive
today still to me.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.450
I love how you
imagined his character

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.310
and imagined you got inside
his head in the book.

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:56.360
I saw Stephen King
recently in the "Times"

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.820
for some reason slamming
the book "Our Gang," which

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.380
I read and thoroughly enjoyed.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.130
And that was another fascinating
way to get inside Nixon's head.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.088
Do you know "Our Gang"?

00:36:04.088 --> 00:36:06.470
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: I know of
it, but I didn't read it.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.270
It's one of those books
where you're writing a book

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.870
and you keep away
from it, because you

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.520
don't want your imagination
to become contaminated.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.044
But I know what it is.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.655
I didn't hear a question.

00:36:18.655 --> 00:36:21.030
AUDIENCE: Kind of rambled
a little bit, didn't I?

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.390
Just thinking about how cool it
is that all this culture still

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.589
exists about Nixon
from that time

00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:29.130
and how it seems like it's still
alive and could be just kind

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:31.720
of grabbed and
accessed immediately.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.970
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: Well, I know.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:34.410
And I was wondering about that.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:35.701
Did people forget Nixon or not?

00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:36.850
But apparently they didn't.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.570
I mean, he's the
American Lex Luthor.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:44.660
I There's something about
his massive public fuck-up

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:49.270
that people like to
hang on to, I guess.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.870
Like, you're never going
to have a worse day,

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.860
perhaps, than
Nixon did, I guess.

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.130
And I think maybe because people
secretly think or know that all

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.450
our presidents are crooks.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.150
But one of them admitted it.

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:06.790
And it's just a
continuing relief,

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.710
at least maybe that's
how it is for me.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:11.850
Yeah?

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.608
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:37:13.608 --> 00:37:16.380
I might be standing too close.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.930
Sort of a serendipitous moment
here-- you talk about the book

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:20.388
and I hadn't heard
about it until I

00:37:20.388 --> 00:37:21.740
started seeing the posters.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.300
My wife right now is reading
"One Man Against the World,"

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.880
which is a Tim Weiner book.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.800
I was curious in specific,
if you were aware

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.282
of that book and the timing,
because it's pretty well timed

00:37:32.282 --> 00:37:33.240
for you, I would think.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.400
And then also, a
lot of the stuff

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.440
that's revealed in that
book, I haven't read it.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.090
She's like, every
night turning over,

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.550
like, did you know--
one of these things.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.040
I mean, the amount of
drinking Nixon was doing.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.931
Those types of facts-- I'm
curious, where you aware

00:37:47.931 --> 00:37:48.430
of that?

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.940
And then just in
general, where else

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.310
did you take research
from around some

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.282
of the real meaty
historical stuff?

00:37:54.282 --> 00:37:56.490
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: The more
facts you read about Nixon,

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.550
the more you realize
that he didn't

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.720
have any of the
political discipline

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.690
that a contemporary
president has.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:05.320
Yes, he drank like crazy.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.095
He would drink and
make crazy phone calls.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:17.140
If a modern President tried
to do the things he did,

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.630
he would have five advisors who
would tackle him to stop him.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.970
I mean, the example
is after Kent State,

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:30.690
all these protesters are lined
up on the Lincoln Memorial.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.300
Hippy kids are
just camped there.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:35.270
And Nixon drinks until 4:00 am.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:38.770
And then he goes out in person
onto the Lincoln Memorial

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:39.760
to talk to them.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.970
Like, he just walks
across the lawn.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.780
Can you imagine a contemporary
President just drunkenly

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.230
mingling with the
protesters and nobody--

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.170
they would hit him with a
tranquilizer dart or something.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.935
They would just stop it.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.520
At least he was--
there are moments

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.960
when you can detect
a human being who

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:07.930
is just willing to fuck up.

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:11.460
And again, it's a
little sad that we've

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.890
lost that, I have to say.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:17.560
Anyway, it's weirdly
the summer of Nixon.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.440
There were, like, two or
three books that came out,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.880
not even counting mine.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.590
And I'm not sure
why that is, other

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.852
than people who
were born with Nixon

00:39:27.852 --> 00:39:29.268
are old enough to
write books now.

00:39:29.268 --> 00:39:31.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:32.540
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: There you go.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.415
Someone did research.

00:39:33.415 --> 00:39:36.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
after Reagan and Hinckley,

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:37.400
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:46.809 --> 00:39:48.350
AUSTIN GROSSMAN:
That's a good point.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:50.310
It's a weird sea change
when Reagan came in,

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.890
the more you look at it.

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:55.200
Anyway, the book I read for this
was called "Nixon Agonistes"

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.030
by Gary Wills.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.740
And it's a terrible
title, but I really

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.350
think it's one of the
most brilliant piece

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.160
of political journalism
I have ever seen.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.790
There's a great scene where
he's on the plane with Nixon

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:07.850
as he's campaigning.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:11.910
And he talks to Nixon,
but everyone's sleeping

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.410
so the lights are kind of out.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.440
And he talks to Nixon
and he's talking

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.860
and he can't see Nixon's face.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.568
And suddenly, he
realized when you're not

00:40:18.568 --> 00:40:21.610
staring at Nixon's face, he
becomes a totally different

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:28.065
person, because the hypnotic
jowls and nose armature just

00:40:28.065 --> 00:40:29.190
turns him into a character.

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:30.648
But when you can't
see his face, it

00:40:30.648 --> 00:40:32.267
feels more like
talking to a person.

00:40:32.267 --> 00:40:33.350
Anyway, it's a great book.

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.390
It may be out of print.

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:35.230
I'm not sure.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.194
I had to special order it.

00:40:38.194 --> 00:40:39.860
I did a bunch of
research, but I'm never

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:45.737
going to be the guy who
has the-- I did what

00:40:45.737 --> 00:40:47.320
felt like the right
amount of research

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:49.570
so that I could then start
making stuff up from there.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.730
I'll put it that way.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.160
Every once in a
while, I deviated

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.329
from the historical
record here and there.

00:40:55.329 --> 00:40:57.370
The night of Watergate,
Nixon was in the Bahamas,

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.480
or his body double was.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.170
We don't know.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:02.729
And then I actually
transferred some

00:41:02.729 --> 00:41:04.770
of the rides between Disney
World and Disneyland.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.686
And actually, the biggest
pushback I've gotten

00:41:06.686 --> 00:41:11.130
is messing with some of
the details of Disney World

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.270
versus Disneyland.

00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:14.290
Make of that what you will.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.790
Did you know that
in the early '60s,

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.920
they wouldn't let
Khrushchev into Disneyland?

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.660
He wanted to go, and they
were like, no, no, you can't.

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:23.672
What were they hiding?

00:41:23.672 --> 00:41:26.200
AUDIENCE: So in the book,
some of the presidents

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.820
know about the
supernatural activities

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.980
and some of the other
presidents have no idea,

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:31.460
or they only suspect.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.035
How did you decide which
presidents would be in the know

00:41:34.035 --> 00:41:35.410
and which ones
would be ignorant?

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:37.800
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: Well,
it came out weird.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.570
The idea is that at the founding
of the Plymouth colonists

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:49.800
and then the founding of
the proper United States

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.550
becomes a sort of magical
pact with the native elder

00:41:53.550 --> 00:42:00.520
spirits of the
continental United States.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.920
And that certain powers
and responsibilities

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:07.250
devolve onto the president as
a kind of intrinsic element

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.090
to that contract.

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.670
But that knowledge is lost.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.870
It's lost during the
Civil War and then

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.440
Taft kind of
semi-reconstructs it.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.840
But part of what
happens to Nixon

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:20.580
is Eisenhower knows the
most about it of anybody

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.580
during the 20th century.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:24.000
But in '57, Eisenhower
has a stroke.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.050
And in the book, he
loses the knowledge.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.030
So Nixon was supposed to be
briefed on what a sorcerer

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.870
president does.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.150
But then he doesn't know.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.350
He's left adrift.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:37.260
It works out for some reason
that nearly all the presidents

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.870
in the know are Republicans.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:41.350
And it was not on purpose.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:46.130
It just worked out that way
that the Republican lineage

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:50.820
makes it the dominant
one, although I

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.730
will say it's not the
ideological Republicans

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:54.590
of today.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.580
Eisenhower was--
and Nixon himself

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:02.905
was virtually completely
distinct of the Reagan

00:43:02.905 --> 00:43:09.560
and post-Reagan Republican
to the point where he's

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.890
more or less unrecognizable.

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.040
But yes, it just ended
up being the Republicans

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.590
because-- it ended up being
passed down within one party

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.960
and that ended up
being the Republicans.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.200
This is more of
a cocktail party.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.520
So I moved into the States
from Dominican Republic in '74.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.710
I was around 12.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:30.380
And I have to say, it
was a loss of innocence

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.210
to realize that US politics,
as perfectly portrayed

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:38.878
in movies and so on, was just as
corrupt as Dominican politics.

00:43:38.878 --> 00:43:40.790
AUSTIN GROSSMAN: [LAUGHS].

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:42.130
Oh.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.400
Well said.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.280
But again, it was
always corrupt.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.280
He just forced us
to acknowledge it.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:58.390
I mean, Warren G. Harding
was really the-- Teapot Dome

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.220
Scandal.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:02.910
I mean, Harding was really
just as bad, if not worse.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.940
He just didn't have
the charisma to get

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:10.872
in trouble the way Nixon did,
is my only theory on that one.

00:44:14.310 --> 00:44:16.592
If there's nothing else,
we can totally wrap up.

00:44:16.592 --> 00:44:18.800
I'm going to hang around
and have lunch and all that.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.240
I'm happy to talk to people.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.531
Thank you guys for coming
out in the middle of the day.

00:44:22.531 --> 00:44:26.420
This was great. [APPLAUSE]
