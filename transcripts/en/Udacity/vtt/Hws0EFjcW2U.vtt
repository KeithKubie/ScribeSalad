00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:03.790
So one of the GPU computing platforms I'm most excited about is Matlab.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.415
Many of you probably already know about Matlab, especially if you're a scientist or an engineer.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.713
Matlab is a high level programming language and development environment

00:00:11.713 --> 00:00:16.105
that's designed for scientific, numeric and mathematical computations.

00:00:16.105 --> 00:00:19.709
Scientists and engineers use Matlab all the time for algorithm development,

00:00:19.709 --> 00:00:23.866
data analysis, visualization, and mathematical modeling.

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:28.787
Matlab supports GPU computing in a couple of ways by allowing Matlab code to be

00:00:28.787 --> 00:00:33.419
executed on a GPU, as well as by providing a way to interface with custom CUDA code.

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:37.858
We're going to explore these features using an application that fits the theme of this class,

00:00:37.858 --> 00:00:40.143
an imaging processing application called white balancing.

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:45.158
The white balance operation is used to adjust the tints of a photograph.

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.734
So you can see here, if this is the before image

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.335
after a white balance operation, it might look like this.

00:00:50.335 --> 00:00:53.348
And you can see that we've removed the sort of reddish tint from the image.

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:56.863
So this is a simple example of the kind of operation that you might implement in Matlab.

00:00:56.863 --> 00:01:02.672
It's easy to implement, as you'll see, and as you'll see, it's also easy to use the GPU as well.
