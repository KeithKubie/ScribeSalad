[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.920
SPEAKER 1: Today, we're
hosting Luis Fernando Garcia.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.170
Luis Fernando Garcia
is the director

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.010
for the [SPANISH],, which
broadly translates to English

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.680
as the Digital Right Network.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.670
And they're tasked with
defending the digital rights

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.810
in Mexico.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.880
And to that end,
they've conducted

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
a series of
initiatives, among which

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.000
they have an initiative that
tries to track surveillance.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.370
And today, Luis will talk to
us about some research effort

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.400
that they started some
months ago that led

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.070
to some interesting
revelations about how

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
the Mexican government
surveils individuals in Mexico.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.667
And with that, I'll
turn it over to Luis.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:52.750
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA: Hi,
thank you for having me.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.520
Thank you for
Google to invite me.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.940
I'm Luis Fernando Garcia.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.140
And I'm the director of
[SPANISH],, a digital rights

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.490
defense network from Mexico.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.300
We are an NGO--

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.129
nonprofit-- that we do
research, litigation, advocacy,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.340
communications strategies, to
try to promote a human rights

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.450
perspective on the interactions
between humans and technology.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.660
We work on different
range of issues,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.300
from privacy and surveillance--
which is what I will be talking

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.450
about right now--

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.730
to other issues of freedom
of expression online,

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.490
on access to the internet, on
access to knowledge, et cetera.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.915
So just a little bit of
background about Mexico.

00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:35.042
Not everyone is
always aware of what's

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:36.250
happening in other countries.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.120
But in Mexico, there is
a government right now

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.450
that has been five
years on and that

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.020
has been riddled with
scandals from the start.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.320
It's been a government
that has been--

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.360
the government right
now has around 10%

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.490
approval rating,
which is pretty low.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.870
And the reason why they got
there is because there's

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.690
been scandals and
corruption, human rights

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.960
abuses, and there's been
a lot of turmoil in Mexico

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.979
about the situation in Mexico.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.880
And this context is important
to understand the rest

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.260
of the story that I will tell.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.150
But I probably will
explain some other events

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.730
that have been happening in
Mexico, to give some context.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.820
So the presentation that
I prepared for you today,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.770
it's called [SPANISH],,
which translates

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.590
to Spying Government.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.589
And it's about how we've
been uncovering and resisting

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:35.880
illegal surveillance in Mexico.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.600
Our organization is
actually pretty young.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.120
We didn't exist three years ago.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.580
And in that time, 2014,
we started precisely

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.984
because there was a problem.

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:53.400
There was a
telecommunications law

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.630
being discussed in Congress.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.770
And we were very worried
that issues of surveillance,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.020
of privacy and freedom
expression online,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.600
were not going to be part of
the discussion in the Congress.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.910
So we got together.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.330
And we didn't have a website
or a logo or anything.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.115
We just tried to do
what we could to promote

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:15.600
a prospective of human rights.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.400
And one of the issues
that we were worried

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.740
is, what was privacy?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.850
The telecommunications
law that was proposed

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.560
expanded surveillance
in various ways

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.700
that we felt it was dangerous.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.560
But first, there's one thing
that it's important to--

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.960
maybe, it's obvious
for some people.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.410
But I don't want to stop
myself from saying it.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.980
The difficulty to
research, to do advocacy,

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.090
to handle surveillance
as a society

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.930
has its own particularities.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.060
For one, it's a tool
that is highly invasive.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.330
It is highly powerful.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.940
The person that can have access
to other people's information

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.470
has lots of power
over that person.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.410
But at the same
time, surveillance

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.950
that is carried out by the
state, normally and naturally,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.399
is carried out in secret.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.770
So there is a problem here.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.470
Because normally, when there
are abuses by the government,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.930
there are ways in which at
least we can be aware of it.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.800
And you can, maybe,
try to challenge it.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.620
If the police enters your
house without a warrant

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.500
or you get detained, at least
you know you're being detained.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.330
You know your house was entered.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.020
And you can do
something about it.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.700
In the case of
surveillance, you don't

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.590
know that the government's
spying on you.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.048
And it's difficult
for you to know.

00:04:48.048 --> 00:04:51.610
It's difficult for you to
research it, to resist it.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.700
And this presents
a set of issues

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.160
that needs the
law and technology

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.170
and society in general--

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.811
treat this problem differently
than other civil rights

00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:05.310
problems.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.760
In 2014, when we started
working on surveillance,

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.080
there was this trend.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.520
There was this trend-- there
were very strong security

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.020
narratives.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.230
I will explain a couple of them.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.950
But basically-- and probably,
people that are from the US

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.020
have experienced
this since 2001--

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.420
there's all this
narrative of asking

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:37.020
you to lose civil liberties
in exchange for security,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.450
and all this emotional
blackmail that happens.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.700
And of course, there is
a bit of true to that.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.620
But there is this push,
by these narratives,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.130
to try to increase
the power of the state

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.230
and decrease the civil
liberties that citizens

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.460
have to resist it.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.580
So with this narrative,
there's also been, since 2009,

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.340
probably, another
piece of context.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.880
Since 2007, violence in
Mexico increased dramatically.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:16.560
The government and the army
started fighting drug cartels.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.200
And since then, there's
been a lot of violence.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.860
And this has fueled
these narratives.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.920
And in this context,
the government

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.990
has been seeking more
powers, more authorities,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.340
to do surveillance.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.870
And they have
requested and pushed

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.030
for less controls,
less accountability,

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.320
because what they say is
they want to act faster

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.820
and they want to
protect the people.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.190
Basically, there are two
very strong narratives

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:53.010
that have been used to promote
more surveillance and less

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.450
controls.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.870
One-- I like to call it--

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.580
this one-- won't somebody
please think of the children?

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.360
There's an emotional appeal.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.169
Like, we need to give government
these tools, because won't

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.460
somebody think of the children?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.300
They are in danger.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.310
And the other one,
it's when you explain

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.900
that the problems
that can happen

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.870
if the government
or any entity has

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.280
too much power into the lives of
people without accountability,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.990
particularly with this problem
that invasions of privacy

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:37.050
are often hidden from the public
eye, you are labeled as someone

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.120
like him--

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.370
like, tinfoil hat and paranoid.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.180
And this was what we
were against in 2014.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.450
We had these very
strong narratives behind

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:54.000
and pushing massive
surveillance and less controls.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.480
And in the end, the
basic things that we

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.320
had approved by Congress
is this [INAUDIBLE] thing

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.260
where mass surveillance-- we
got their attention mandates.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:07.630
We had a vagueness about who
can carry out surveillance.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.550
For example, the law said--

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.730
it established a lot
of surveillance tools

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.180
or techniques and said that
any competent authority

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.470
could use this.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.920
And we said, when this
discussion was in Congress,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.120
you need to define, who
is a competent authority?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.964
You cannot just leave
it open like that.

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:27.880
And they said, no, no.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.830
We're going to
leave it like that.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.038
Because other law says what
is a competent authority.

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:32.280
Well, this is what we said.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.774
And we'll see if we
were right or wrong.

00:08:35.774 --> 00:08:38.760
If you leave it like this, a
lot of authorities will say,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.940
I'm a competent authority.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.210
I'm interpreting it like
I'm a competent authority.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.250
And then a lot of authorities--
local, federal, municipal--

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.550
will feel entitled or
authorized by the law

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.530
to carry out surveillance.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.630
The same with
judicial oversight.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.950
In the Constitution
of Mexico, to do

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.830
a traditional lawful
intercept of communications,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.270
you need a federal
judge to approve it.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.100
With regard to other
types of surveillance,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.560
like location
tracking in real time

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.810
or to access communications
metadata from people,

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.620
the law was delivered to be
left in a very vague space,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.294
in a very gray area.

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:23.460
We said, you need to establish
very clearly that you

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.460
need a warrant for this.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.580
And they said, we're
going to leave it

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.200
like that, because I
want this room to, maybe,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.790
don't get a warrant.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.940
There was also lack
of transparency, lack

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.800
of independent supervision.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.570
In some countries,
there are authorities

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.680
in charge of supervising
these authorities

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.500
and trying to force them to
have some type of accountability

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.230
with all it's discharging
cases, et cetera.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.570
Or the right to identification--
in some countries,

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.190
as well, there is
a right for you

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.090
to know that you were
surveilled at one point.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.760
And maybe you are not told
during the surveillance

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.620
because, maybe, in
some cases, that

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.860
could frustrate the legitimate
objective of the surveillance.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.700
But you are told, at one
point, hey, six months ago,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.059
we were doing our investigation.

00:10:13.059 --> 00:10:14.350
And we did surveillance on you.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.780
And if you think
it was an abuse,

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.520
you can do something about it.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.200
Well, none of those
safeguards that

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.540
had been identified and
applied in many countries

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.650
were present in Mexican law.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.600
So with these very bad
laws, with these very strong

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.730
narratives in place--

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.290
somebody please think of
the children and, if you do

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.790
something about it, you are a
paranoid tinfoil-hat person--

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.430
we asked, how can we
change the narrative?

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.830
How can we produce change
and make law-makers--

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.330
but society in general--

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.900
understand that this is a very
dangerous place in which we

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:54.560
were and which we are?

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.640
So what we did is a
range of activities.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.840
With did litigation.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.450
And this law that was passed,
we challenged it in court.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.460
We also did advocacy
in Congress,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.050
trying to establish at
least some safeguards.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.770
And we had limited success.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.520
A few years later,
like, a year and a half

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.890
ago, there were some
transparency laws

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.730
approved that established, now,
obligations for authorities

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.670
and even for telecommunication
companies to provide

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.190
detailed transparency reports--

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.050
statistical data mainly.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.950
But also, for example,
telecommunication companies

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.722
need to say who has asked
them for information

00:11:35.722 --> 00:11:38.055
and how many times and how
many times they have said yes

00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:40.120
and how many times
they have said no.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.450
And this does not
solve the problem.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.390
But you will see, it helps.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.670
It gives you indication that,
maybe, things can go wrong

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.610
or things are going right.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.100
The same with
judicial oversight,

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.660
but we'll leave that story
for a little bit later.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.996
We also started to use,
like FOIA here in the US--

00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:03.590
access to affirmation
laws in Mexico,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.670
which are pretty decent, to
try to get more information.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.930
And we tried to know
what was going on,

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:15.490
who was using surveillance,
how many times, et cetera.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.540
We tried to create evidence that
the problems that we identified

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.990
in the law when it was passed
were actually materializing

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.460
into real problems.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.990
And we also tried to document
and to research technologies

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.510
being used and cases of abuse,
which is difficult in general.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.840
For example, with the access
to information requests,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:45.750
we asked thousands of requests
to authorities all over Mexico

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:50.730
to try to understand stuff
like, who is doing surveillance?

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:53.280
Are they doing it with
judicial oversight?

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.970
Is it effective?

00:12:55.970 --> 00:13:00.390
Are there inconsistencies in
the data that we're getting?

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:05.690
Many of these requests turned
into hundreds of lawsuits.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:07.800
And for example,
one of these cases

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.390
even got into the Supreme Court.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.820
Fortunately, we won.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.210
We wanted the NSA of Mexico--

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:15.480
is to call CISEN--

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.519
to tell us how many people
they have surveilled.

00:13:17.519 --> 00:13:19.060
I don't want their
names or anything.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.540
I just want to know how many
did you surveil in 2014.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.850
And they didn't want to
give us that information.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:26.700
It went into the Supreme Court.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.620
And fortunately, we won.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.542
And now-- well, December
of last year we won.

00:13:32.542 --> 00:13:33.750
And they haven't told us yet.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.580
But supposedly, we won.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.640
And they will tell us.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.050
But we'll see.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:43.320
So after all these
requests and all the data

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.190
that we were able to gather,
we found a lot of problems.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.440
And here's a few findings.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.720
Sorry, some of the
charts are in Spanish.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.410
But yeah, I will explain them.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.160
No problem.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.360
For example, this chart--

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.010
this chart shows three federal
authorities, the National

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.500
Security Agency,
the Federal Police,

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.330
and the Federal Prosecutor.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.210
We asked them how
many times they

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:15.000
have asked a judge to authorize
them to carry out surveillance.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.350
But we also asked the courts.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.140
And we told them, how many
times have this guy come to you

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.720
and asked for authorization?

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.450
And we got totally different
results, depending who you ask.

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.150
For example, the National
Security Agency of Mexico

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.330
told us that,
between 2013 in 2015,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.350
they requested of court
to authorize surveillance

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.240
a little bit over 2,000 times.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.620
But the courts say, no.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.680
That guy only came 654 times.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.900
And for example, the
federal prosecutor or, like,

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.430
the Department of Justice--

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.850
similar in Mexico-- it was
completely the opposite.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.290
They said that
they did only 866.

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:56.370
But the court said, no,
he came 2,392 times.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.820
And this is just requests.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.930
We did other
exercise in which we

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:09.380
were able to identify that,
in average, by each request,

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:14.160
these authorities get
authorization to surveil

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.820
on between 7 and 10 people.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.300
So it's important.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.560
2,000 is 2,000 people?

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.630
No, 2,000 requests
which, probably, you

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:27.120
can multiplicate that
for 7, 8, 9, 10 times,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.260
depending on the year.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.290
So this doesn't
prove, necessarily,

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:34.600
that they are using it
against people they shouldn't.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.910
But this just tells
you, something is wrong.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.680
Something's not
functioning well here.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.330
And there's another thing.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.440
For example, we asked,
how many times--

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.340
well, we were worried about--

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.400
the law doesn't say clearly
that you need a warrant.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.620
But you told us that it did.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.172
But we told you, it's not clear.

00:15:55.172 --> 00:15:56.380
It's not clear for companies.

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.270
It's not clear for authorities.

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.410
And when we asked,
how many times did you

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.090
have access to
communications metadata

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.710
from telecommunications users?

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.580
From cell phone users?

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.362
Close to 99% of the time,
they did it without a warrant.

00:16:13.362 --> 00:16:15.070
What we said was going
to happen and they

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.000
said it wasn't going
to happen happened.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.800
99% of the time, an authority
went to your cell phone

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.990
provider, asked for your data.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.330
And cell phone provider
just gave it away

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.090
without a warrant--

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.610
another finding.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:38.850
For example, we analyzed the
free transparency reports

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.770
from the telecommunication
companies.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.720
And we saw that, for
example, in Mexico, there

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.540
are basically three
main cell phone

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.515
carriers, one very big one--

00:16:48.515 --> 00:16:50.160
but basically, it
was a monopoly--

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.170
it still has most
of the market--

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.085
which is called Telecel.

00:16:55.085 --> 00:16:57.000
It was the property
of one of the richest

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.940
men in the world, Carlos Slim.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:04.260
And there's AT&amp;T. And there's
Telefonica, a Spanish company.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:12.357
AT&amp;T, for example, rejects
around 46% of the requests

00:17:12.357 --> 00:17:13.440
they get from authorities.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.869
This means that
they get a request.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:16.710
And they analyze it.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:17.876
And sometimes, they say yes.

00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:20.980
Sometimes, they say
no, as it should.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.640
Telefonica-- it's less.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.599
But still, they reject some.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:27.250
But the biggest cell
phone company in Mexico,

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.470
which is Telecel, never
rejected one request.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.080
So anyone who said, I'm
a competent authority,

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.550
without a warrant, give
me your data, got it.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.590
Among those-- a bunch
of these authorities--

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.420
some that have not been
identified-- but these

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.760
are names of authorities that
do not have any legal basis

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.680
to do any type of surveillance,
electoral commissions,

00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:00.840
local police, the Communications
Ministry, the governor of one

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.030
state, et cetera.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.680
This, again, all
these statistics

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.610
point to something that is very
wrong, that authorities that

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.730
don't have a clear legal
mandate to do surveillance

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.400
are doing it without
a warrant, in secret,

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.200
with no accountability.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.360
It's a recipe for disaster.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.480
And also, as I
mentioned before, we

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.970
wanted to test this
claim that surveillance

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.780
is so important and so
necessary to prosecute crime.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.100
We asked prosecutors
all around the country,

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.810
how many investigations
have you use surveillance?

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.330
And what happens with
those investigations?

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.760
Do they get someone in jail?

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.870
Or not?

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.810
Well, over 90% of
the investigations

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:49.220
in which a prosecutor
used surveillance,

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.570
that investigation
either remains open

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.470
or didn't turn out into
charging anyone with any crime.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.404
So it's safe to say
that more than 90%

00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:00.820
of the people that
were surveilled

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.680
in the context of a
criminal investigation

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.900
were never charged of any crime.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.396
Which, again, mounts
data and evidence

00:19:08.396 --> 00:19:09.770
that there's
something very wrong

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.830
and that the claim
that surveillance

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.380
is super useful in
Mexico, at least,

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.190
for criminal investigations,
is at least an overstate.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.080
So we used this
research in litigation.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.780
And it was very useful.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.830
We were able to get the
Supreme Court to say, OK, OK.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.970
I'm going to say who is
a competent authority.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.890
And that's it.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.180
And they reduced
it to, basically,

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.940
two groups of authorities,
either the Federal

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.700
Police, the National Security
Agency at the federal level,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.850
and the prosecutors, for
investigating crimes--

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.695
and always with a warrant.

00:19:45.695 --> 00:19:49.160
That was something that the
court said, thanks to the case

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.720
that we brought to the court.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.180
So it's clear, now,
that you need a warrant

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.550
to get the content,
to get metadata,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.820
and also to get the
location tracking

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.027
of a person in real time.

00:20:03.027 --> 00:20:05.360
This was something that the
court didn't say you needed.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.210
But we managed to convince
Congress to pass a law

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.330
to require it as well.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.796
So now, it's clear, at least in
the law, maybe not in practice.

00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:14.420
But it's clear that
you need a warrant.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.961
And if you don't get a warrant
to do any type of surveillance

00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:19.632
in Mexico and if you are not
one of these authorities,

00:20:19.632 --> 00:20:21.590
then the surveillance
you are doing is illegal.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.880
But still, these
narratives remain.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.680
Because you haven't
proved that these

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:36.270
have been used against someone
that shouldn't have been used.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.680
We just have data and then
suggestions and suspicions

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.830
which are, I think,
grounded in some evidence.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:45.380
But we haven't found--

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.070
some people just don't
care unless you show them

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.330
where the victim is.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:55.400
So that's what we try to
work on, finding victims.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.630
How can we document?

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:57.770
How can we create stories?

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:03.770
And how can we show, in flesh,
how surveillance looks like?

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.310
And how the surveillance that
we presumed was being abused--

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.040
because all these
data pointed to that--

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.380
how can we prove
and find someone

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.080
that shouldn't have been
surveilled that was surveilled?

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.120
Some of our first indications
that this might be happening

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.877
and that, actually,
surveillance was starting

00:21:23.877 --> 00:21:25.460
to become more
sophisticated in Mexico

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.120
was documenting the
acquisition and use

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.610
of more sophisticated
surveillance tools,

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:33.380
like malware.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.510
Here in the US,
the NSA, the FBI,

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.680
they probably build
their own malware

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.350
and their own
surveillance tools.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:43.058
But in other countries,
like Mexico, they

00:21:43.058 --> 00:21:44.810
buy it from other companies.

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:48.200
So there's a company in
Italy called Hacking Team.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.060
And the Hacking Team got hacked.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:52.340
And all their data
was published,

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.190
their e-mails, their
contracts, and their Twitter

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.300
account, actually, for
more than 12 hours.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.310
And in that data, it showed
that Mexico was the biggest

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.450
client of Hacking Team.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.140
It was the one that
spent the most money.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.270
Even more than-- in this
chart, you will see,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:16.520
Mexico is way, way the biggest
client of Hacking Team,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.110
but also in the
number of authorities.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.550
We've found contracts with
several local governors

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.220
and authorities that are
not part of those groups

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.830
that the Supreme Court
has said are the only ones

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:28.880
that can do surveillance.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.450
You can find
several police even.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:36.620
An oil company bought
surveillance malware

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.350
from this company, et cetera.

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.102
In one case, for
example, we were

00:22:41.102 --> 00:22:43.310
able to prove that the
governor of one of the biggest

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:48.820
states in Mexico, Jalisco,
where tequila comes from,

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.920
bought Hacking Team malware.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.580
And we proved that--

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.420
technically, the prosecutor of
Jalisco can do surveillance.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.590
But the government of Jalisco
can't do surveillance.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:05.770
And we proved that who bought it
was the government of Jalisco.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.687
They installed it,
even, in a building

00:23:07.687 --> 00:23:10.270
that is part of the government
of Jalisco, not the prosecutor.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.000
But when we
discovered this, they

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.470
said, first, no, it's not true.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.832
When we showed the contract,
the signature of the official

00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:20.290
from the government,
they said, OK.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:20.860
We bought it.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.420
But we bought it
for the prosecutor.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.941
And we gave it to them.

00:23:23.941 --> 00:23:26.440
And then we cross-reference the
information with information

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.110
that we got from the access
to information requests.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.240
And we found that the
federal prosecutor has only

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.076
requested a court to authorize
surveillance three times.

00:23:37.076 --> 00:23:38.700
And that's according
to the prosecutor.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.410
Because according
to courts, they

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:41.910
have never come
for authorization

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.690
to surveil anyone.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:43.964
But let's take their word.

00:23:43.964 --> 00:23:44.880
They don't deserve it.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.840
But let's take their word.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.910
Three times, in three
years, you surveil a person.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.520
And let's assume that
those three times

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.060
were with this malware.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.080
There's two scenarios.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.170
Either you spent
millions of dollars

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.450
in acquiring very highly
sophisticated malware

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.790
to use it on three people.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:09.350
Or you're using it without
a warrant and illegally.

00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:10.820
Both scenarios are horrible.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.130
Either you're
incompetent and corrupt.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.410
Or you are incompetent,
corrupt, and a criminal.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.610
This showed us that there
was this big market,

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.820
there was this big
hunger in Mexico

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.840
for acquiring these
tools and for using it

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.850
against who knows who.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.060
And then it came--

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.210
him.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.380
Him is Ahmed Mansoor.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.220
He is, actually, right
now, a political prisoner

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:40.410
in the United Arab Emirates.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:45.060
And he has been under
surveillance by the United Arab

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.730
Emirates government for years.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.410
They have thrown
everything at him,

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.510
all the types of malware
from different companies

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.468
has been thrown at him.

00:24:52.468 --> 00:24:55.330
And he received a few messages--

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.080
SMS messages that said-- he
is a human rights activist.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.890
So it says, here's--

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.660
it's like a news article--

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.390
evidence of torture to activists
in the United Arab Emirates.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:10.810
And there's a link.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.980
He's savvy enough to know that
these might be fishing attacks.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.780
This might be an attempt to
compromise his cell phone.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.280
So he contacts the Citizen Lab,
which is a laboratory that's

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.170
part of the
University of Toronto

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:30.087
that does lots of security
research and told them, hey,

00:25:30.087 --> 00:25:31.170
I received these messages.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:35.490
And Citizen Lab, what they
did was they put it in a phone

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.590
that they could monitor.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:39.880
And they clicked on it
to see what happened.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.550
And two things happened.

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:46.140
First, they discovered three
exploits in the iPhone.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.810
If you have an iPhone,
in September or August,

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:54.720
you received as an update
on the operating system

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.130
that patch patches those
vulnerabilities that

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.870
were found, thanks
to Ahmed Mansoor

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.270
and to Citizen Lab's work.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.200
And also, Citizen Lab was
able to see what happened

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.600
and what the phone did and
who did it connect with.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.950
And they were able to
map the infrastructure

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.140
of this Israeli company
called NSO Group.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.500
And they were able to also map
all the domain names that were

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.460
associated to those servers.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:29.790
So they got a list off
of over 200 domain names,

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.980
which Citizen Lab classified
by country, basically,

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:40.110
by analyzing either whether
those domain names are .mx

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:46.020
or they offer a service
that is only sold in Mexico.

00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.780
It's sometimes these
domains try to impersonate

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.090
legitimate businesses
or newspapers or media

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.140
organizations.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:57.000
So it was pretty easy
to classify it that way.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.740
And they published
this investigation

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.880
that I urge you to visit.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.180
It's called "The Million
Dollar Dissident."

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.416
They published this
in August 2016.

00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.540
And they showed this chart.

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.690
And I saw this chart
and said, oh, Mexico

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.490
is the biggest chunk
of that pie chart.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.210
So that means, most
domains used by NSO

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:19.320
as bait to infect
phones with malware

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.670
were associated to Mexico.

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.470
That told me, well, there must
be a lot of clients in Mexico.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.530
And there must be
lots of victims.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.120
In that investigation,
Citizen Lab

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.600
was able to also
identify a tweet

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.600
from a journalist in Mexico
that says, look at this.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.360
Well, just a little
bit of background.

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.390
This journalist, with
other journalists,

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:42.870
uncovered one of the biggest
corruption scandals in Mexico.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:49.350
The President of the
country and his wife

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.620
received a big house,
very expensive house,

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.720
almost for free,
from a contractor

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.010
that later got lots of contracts
from the Mexican government.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:02.610
This became known as the
Casablanca Scandal, the White

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.690
House Scandal, because the
house he got was white.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.140
And this was one of
the main journalists

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.190
working on this story.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.890
And after they
published this, they

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.750
become enemies of
the state basically.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:22.990
The main journalist that I will
talk about a little bit later,

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:28.560
Carmen Aristegui, she was the
biggest and the most listened

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.510
news radio show in the country.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.250
She lost that, because
of the pressure

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:37.761
the government gave
to the radio station.

00:28:37.761 --> 00:28:39.510
And there were lots
of threats, et cetera.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.300
And he interpreted
these SMS messages

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:48.560
he received as a threat, because
the SMS message he received

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.490
said something like,
the Presidency will

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.480
sue for defamation to those
that published the Casablanca

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.160
report.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.755
And he tweeted, like, I'm
receiving these messages.

00:28:58.755 --> 00:29:00.350
It's not funny.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.180
He thought there were threats.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:07.340
But they were actually attempts
into infecting his phone

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.004
with this malware sold
by this NSO Group,

00:29:10.004 --> 00:29:11.170
this malware called Pegasus.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.904
Just to explain a little
bit more of the messages,

00:29:17.904 --> 00:29:19.570
you will see it in
other examples later,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.250
but it says
[SPANISH] unotv.com--

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.820
that's a media organization.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.760
That's a news portal.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.710
And they use a shortener.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:39.250
But once you analyze that
link, instead of unotv.com,

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.660
which is a legitimate
site, it leads

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.470
to unotv.net, which is
one of those domains

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.455
that The Citizen
Lab was able to map

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.491
as part of NSO infrastructure.

00:29:52.491 --> 00:29:53.740
But we still didn't know that.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.956
We just saw this in the report.

00:29:55.956 --> 00:29:56.830
We saw the pie chart.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.870
We saw that there
was this suspicion

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.150
that there were these
journalists in Mexico that

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.210
had been, also, targeted
with this technology.

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.282
And we started to try to find--

00:30:06.282 --> 00:30:09.750
oh, I got a little jumpy--

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:14.860
we started to try to find
the Ahmed Mansoors in Mexico.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.130
Who are the targets in Mexico?

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:22.390
And we eventually
found a bunch of them.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.270
If you looked at "The New York
Times" in February or June

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.660
or four times that this year
has been in the front page

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.630
in collaboration,
an investigation

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.320
that we have done--

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.730
these cases-- we ended up
in "The New York Times."

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:42.190
They talk about how we have
found more than 20 people that

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.990
have been targets of
this Pegasus Malware.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.820
That we called this
investigation [SPANISH]

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.160
Investigation.

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.370
It was a big scandal
in Mexico, particularly

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.344
after June 19,
which we published

00:30:57.344 --> 00:30:59.260
and "New York Times"
published and Citizen Lab

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.370
published this investigation.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:05.860
It became a big
scandal in Mexico,

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.150
because we basically revealed
that all these people--

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.750
or these people's eyes--

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.600
were surveilled.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.060
And I'm going to speak to you
about, who are these people?

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.590
And what does it say about
the situation in Mexico?

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.160
For example, there is this case.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.860
This is a human
rights organization

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.030
called Centro Prodh.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:28.730
It's one of the biggest and most
important operations in Mexico.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.610
They've been
representing families

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.140
of human rights abuses--

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:38.600
the most high-impact abuses, for
example, killings by the Army.

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.530
Or there was a very high-profile
case that maybe some of you

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:44.840
have heard about the
disappearance of 43

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.694
students in 2014.

00:31:47.694 --> 00:31:49.610
They represent the
families of those students.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:51.110
It became a huge scandal.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.360
Huge protests in the streets.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.850
It almost toppled
the government.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:01.280
And they've been in a
very contentious position,

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.212
because the government
has been put

00:32:03.212 --> 00:32:05.420
in lots of articles for that
investigation to happen.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.980
And they have been
representing the families that

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.720
want to know what happened with
their kids, which are still

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.702
disappeared.

00:32:10.702 --> 00:32:12.410
And three people inside
that organization

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.800
received this Pegasus
infection attempts.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.240
For example is
Director Mario Patron.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:24.230
He received a message that says,
the Mexican government fools

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.730
GIEI.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.686
GIEI is a group of
international experts

00:32:27.686 --> 00:32:29.060
that was brought
into the country

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:32.600
to investigate the disappearance
of the 43 students.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.250
This group of
independent experts

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.710
was brought to the country
because of the pressure

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:38.502
that happened on the
streets, in the media,

00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:40.918
in the scandal that was putting
pressure on the government

00:32:40.918 --> 00:32:42.710
to accept this
independent investigation,

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.410
because people were
rightfully suspicious

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.119
that the official investigation
was not going to lead anywhere.

00:32:48.119 --> 00:32:50.160
And he received something
that is very important.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.190
And we did this analysis
with all the messages

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.590
that we were able to document.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:56.200
He received this message.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.740
It was four days before this
group of independent experts

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.580
published their final report.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.710
And it also received
the message the same day

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:12.510
that a group of forensic
analysts, independent analysts,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:15.980
were-- because the official
theses or the official story

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.050
by the government is
that the 43 students were

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.050
burned in a dumpster.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:27.170
However, there is scientific
evidence that shows that this

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:34.780
cannot be true, that the
dimensions of the fire would

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:37.340
have leaved traces of it.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.809
And it was not possible to do
it in the way and the place

00:33:40.809 --> 00:33:42.350
where the government
says it happened

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:44.330
and when it says it happened.

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.680
And this forensic analysis
showed the scientific evidence

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:55.100
that this was not true, that the
story that the government used

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.180
to cover up what
happened was false.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:03.200
So it was a very highly tense
moment for the organization

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.640
and a contentious situation
between this organization

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.540
and the government.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.969
And that's exactly when he
received these messages.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:12.920
And then, for example,
there's this--

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.630
I already talked about them--

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:19.130
Aristegui Noticias, which is
an independent news portal.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.820
Carmen Aristegui, she's one of
the most important journalists

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.100
in Mexico.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.380
She revealed many scandals--
the Casablanca Scandal.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.110
She has received
lots of pressure

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:40.340
by many governments and even
its own broadcasting company,

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.630
which she worked for
these investigations.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:49.820
And we have been able to
document more than 50 messages

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:54.230
received to her, her
son, who actually

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.520
lives in the United States--

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:58.510
he received messages--
and other two journalists

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.190
of Aristegui Noticias.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:03.320
They also received
these messages

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.860
in moments in which they
were revealing information,

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.610
they were revealing stories that
were particularly uncomfortable

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:13.210
for the government.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.460
There's another case.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.390
Carlos Loret de Mola-- he's
also a very famous broadcaster.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.270
He's like-- I don't know-- like
an Anderson Cooper of Mexico.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:27.640
He's a very famous news anchor
from a very big broadcasting

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.440
company that has actually
been seen by Mexicans

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.590
as very close to power.

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.130
But still, he also
received messages.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.350
And particularly, he
received, for example,

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.550
this message impersonating
the US Embassy, saying,

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.590
we detected a problem
with your visa.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:46.480
Please come to the Embassy.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.920
See details and the link.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:51.880
And that link was a
link to infect his phone

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.620
with Pegasus Malware.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:59.160
He received six messages in a
month in which he was covering

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.480
a story of a federal
police killing of civilians

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:07.346
in one small town in Mexico.

00:36:07.346 --> 00:36:09.220
Particularly, when he
was covering that story

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.260
is when he received
his messages.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:15.340
And apparently, the
government was--

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:17.560
and I will later
explain why I think--

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.100
why there's evidence
it was the government--

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.930
was trying to surveil him.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.250
All these people have--

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.730
and these are just
three examples.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.479
But you can see in the
report, if you read

00:36:28.479 --> 00:36:31.470
Spanish, more and more cases.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.820
And they all have
one thing in common.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:37.140
They were working as journalists
or human rights defenders

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.930
in things that the government
didn't want them to work on.

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.630
They even targeted the
GIEI, which I talk about.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.260
These experts that were
invited into the country

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.160
to investigate the disappearance
of these 43 students

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.230
were actually surveilled.

00:36:55.230 --> 00:37:00.510
And this is the most
outrageous thing to me.

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.530
There are 43 kids disappeared.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:06.240
And you pushed all
this legislation.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.040
And you bought
all this equipment

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.500
by using the argument
that you need

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.190
these tools to prosecute
crime and to prevent

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:15.930
these bad things to happen.

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.090
And instead of using
that surveillance

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.430
to find the students
and to find those

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:22.170
responsible for
his disappearance,

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:24.390
they used it against their
lawyers or their families.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.056
They used it against
independent experts

00:37:26.056 --> 00:37:27.660
that were brought
into the country

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.730
to investigate the situation.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:34.320
And this really shows
what's the problem and what

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.960
the consequences of
this surveillance.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.543
This was also in
"The New York Times."

00:37:37.543 --> 00:37:40.230
This was the third
publication that we

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.000
were able to get
"The New York Times"

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.310
to cover in their front page.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.940
There was a fourth
one, more recently.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:53.520
But in general,
again, this shows,

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.260
now we are closer to not looking
like a tinfoil-hat paranoid.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:37:59.010
We found them.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:37:59.940
We found the victims.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.870
We found the stories.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.610
We've found the
connection between them

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:03.560
and the government.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.370
And we found more stuff.

00:38:05.370 --> 00:38:07.950
We found that the NSO Group
only sells to governments.

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.490
We found that each target
costs around $70,000.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.700
And the Mexican government
spent at least $80 million

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:16.860
in acquiring targets.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:22.230
Because the way it
works, you buy targets--

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.600
the ability to
target 500 people,

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:29.780
which was what one Mexican
authority purchased.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.060
And we also found that
the Mexican government

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.470
acquired and used Pegasus.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.240
We have contracts.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.100
We have the bills that were
also leaked and published.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.410
So it's clear now.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:46.010
It's without a doubt that the
Mexican government has Pegasus.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.100
That its main
opponents-- journalists,

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.725
human rights defenders--
were targeted.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.120
And still, the government
is claiming, oh,

00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.150
we'll investigate, it was
a coincidence, or whatever.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:07.020
So the worst part right now
is that the prime suspect

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.030
of carrying out this
surveillance, the authority

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:11.760
that purchased this
Pegasus Malware,

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.580
is the same authority that is
in charge of the investigation

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.840
of the spying.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:22.890
So we presented a lawsuit
against [INAUDIBLE],, which

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:26.040
is like the Department
of Justice of Mexico,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.730
or the federal prosecutor,
attorney general,

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:33.450
which is the prime suspect of
being behind the surveillance.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:37.430
Because it's the only one that
has accepted and documented

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:41.760
that it has acquired
this malware.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.980
So we don't look [INAUDIBLE] for
tinfoil-hat paranoids anymore.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.280
I think, this was a big scandal.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.590
It was weeks and
weeks in the news.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:59.550
It even forced the President
to make a statement.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.300
He did, as usual, a
horrible statement.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.030
We publish on Monday, June 19.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.390
And on Thursday, he
went on TV and said,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.660
I'm instructing the
prosecutor to investigate

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.050
those to have revealed this
story, because there are lies.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:16.920
Then he backtracked.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.160
Because actually,
there's no law that

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.482
can be used against those
that have been publishing

00:40:22.482 --> 00:40:23.190
this information.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.620
But still, the damage was done.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:27.360
There was outrage as well.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:32.700
And at least in the media and,
I think, in the general public,

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.740
it is established that
the Mexican government is

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:37.230
spying on journalists and
human rights defenders.

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:42.270
But that's not satisfying to
me, because those responsible

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.280
are still free.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.310
They're not in jail.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.470
And this is probably
still going on in Mexico.

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:49.210
So there's still a
lot of work to do.

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:50.940
We are doing a lot
of stuff, trying

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.160
to get justice in this case.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.980
Not only because,
as I mentioned,

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.850
of the spying itself, but
because of what it represents

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:05.837
and because, instead of using
these tools to prosecute

00:41:05.837 --> 00:41:07.920
the corruption that this
government has been found

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.461
to be doing, the human rights
abuses that this government has

00:41:10.461 --> 00:41:12.510
been assisting or
covering up, it's

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.550
being used against
those that have exposed

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.100
or have demanded
justice in Mexico.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.840
And I think that's something
that is not acceptable

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.600
and something that, if we
leave it as just an anecdote,

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.130
will repeat itself
and, probably,

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.710
will be more and more difficult
to detect and to resist.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.350
But we're still fighting.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:32.520
And probably-- yeah.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.860
We hope this story
continues and continues

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:40.090
with people responsible for
this being held accountable.

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:44.790
And just to finish
and, maybe, open up

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:49.070
for questions, if you
have them, there's

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.310
a lot that a lot of
people can do to help.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.880
First, by knowing about these
cases, by letting others

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.710
know about these cases and--

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.380
for example, as a
company, being very aware

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:05.660
about these type of governments
that have these intentions

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.980
and have these resources.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.360
And they will use them.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.050
And they will actually use
them against your customers.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.420
They are using it
against Android users.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.280
And they're trying to find
holes in your equipment,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.190
to try to surveil on
human rights defenders,

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.910
on journalists.

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:26.060
So I think it is
important for Googlers

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.600
to know about these
type of cases to,

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.170
try to understand what
people on the ground that

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.300
use your services
are fighting against

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.180
and what you can do to help.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.850
And I think there's
a lot of things.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.450
And there's a lot of things
that Google has done.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:46.490
Actually, this may be a
little inappropriate to say.

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:50.990
But it's true in a way.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:53.690
For example, Google has done
a lot of things in encryption.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:54.950
And it's great.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:59.810
It's great that there's
encrypted from point-to-point.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:04.890
But just-- and this is
no criticism of Google.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:11.981
It's important to-- don't
think that that saves people

00:43:11.981 --> 00:43:13.480
like these journalists,
human rights

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.190
defenders from being surveilled.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:16.680
Because actually,
what it has led

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.540
is from governments
to buy malware to try

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.390
to go around encryption.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:26.680
And well, then, if I cannot
my in-the-middle attacks,

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.780
because I will only
get encrypted data,

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.780
I will hack your phone and
get it before you encrypt it.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.130
So it's important to always
think about the next step

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.500
and how you can
continually improve

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.720
the security of your
products and your services.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.620
Because the other side, it's
always also looking in ways

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:49.270
to go around the
things that you create

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.140
and you come up with to try
to protect your users more.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:56.140
So I encourage you to
keep thinking of this,

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.870
to be in contact
with us, to also

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:02.050
know what the needs are
in the ground, et cetera.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:05.640
And I thank you for your
time and for your interest

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.450
in this story.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.592
And let's keep fighting.

00:44:11.592 --> 00:44:13.020
Thank you.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.924
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:17.304 --> 00:44:20.380
I don't know if anyone
has any questions.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.240
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:27.610
You talked about how the
government is targeting

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:31.521
specific people
and they're going

00:44:31.521 --> 00:44:33.895
after people who they have,
essentially, grudges against.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:38.980
What sort of efforts are
there or should there

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.750
be to educate those people
and figure out whether or not

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.727
people are targets
of surveillance?

00:44:45.727 --> 00:44:47.310
I know Google does
some sort of stuff.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:50.560
But it's difficult if you're
using a outdated phone

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:52.302
or whatever.

00:44:52.302 --> 00:44:53.760
Is that something
that you work on?

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.592
Or are there more
opportunities there?

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.550
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA:
Well, definitely, there's

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:58.720
people working on that.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.100
And there is opportunity there.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.360
There's both.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.950
And I think, one of the
main positive things

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:09.730
about uncovering this is that
many people have become aware

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.577
of these threats.

00:45:11.577 --> 00:45:13.660
Because, for example, the
first publication we did

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:14.855
was in February.

00:45:14.855 --> 00:45:19.570
And after we published that
one case, many more said, hey,

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:20.429
I saw that story.

00:45:20.429 --> 00:45:21.970
And I think I have
the same messages.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:25.155
So the awareness also
protects, because people now

00:45:25.155 --> 00:45:28.120
are more wary about proceeding
SMS messages with links.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.800
And I would say that
most human rights

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.130
defenders and journalists--

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:38.380
at least if you read and
you noticed these cases,

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:40.400
you are way more wary.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.990
But there are still
a lot of need.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.950
There's a lot of
organizations that were not

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:46.270
taking security serious.

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:48.670
And after these case,
they say, OK, now we

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.430
have to devote resources
and time and effort

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:56.050
into building protocols
and systems that allow us

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.450
to be more secure in our work.

00:45:58.450 --> 00:45:59.110
So definitely.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.560
And I think there's
room for doing stuff

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:07.414
and for helping guys develop
those strategies to try

00:46:07.414 --> 00:46:08.330
to protect themselves.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.400
And I think, whatever you
guys can do to approach them,

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:16.870
because there are
so many in risk,

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:20.877
it's a great way to also help.

00:46:20.877 --> 00:46:23.210
AUDIENCE: What do you think
the government's stands to--

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.584
or what does the
government think

00:46:24.584 --> 00:46:27.310
it stands to gain from
spying on these journalists?

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.520
Is it more than just trying
to stop these stories

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.480
from publishing?

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.890
Do you think that they
have malicious motivations

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.880
to ruin their lives beyond that?

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.992
Is there any evidence?

00:46:38.992 --> 00:46:40.450
LUIS FERNANDO
GARCIA: Well, there's

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:43.840
a bunch of consequences
that come from spying.

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.577
And there's different levels.

00:46:45.577 --> 00:46:46.660
And we have seen them all.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.190
We have seen, in some cases,
just gathering information

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:57.520
for later use, intimidation,
or other more nefarious

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.240
situations.

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:00.010
There's been actual
cases of intimidation,

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:03.070
of leaking that
information into the press,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:06.880
and create reputational
damage to yourself

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.200
or your organization.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.640
But you have to understand
that, in Mexico, the line

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.810
between government and organized
crime is, in many times,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.160
non-existent.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:27.050
So surveillance has a
potential use or a potential

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:32.720
to contribute to even harm
and death to these people.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:36.290
Mexico is one of the
most dangerous countries

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:37.540
for journalists.

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.010
I think, outside of
Syria, is the country

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:44.510
where most journalists have
died in the last years.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:49.120
Just this year, there's been 11
journalists killed in Mexico.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.250
So there's many ways
in which surveillance

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:54.980
can be used against
these people,

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:58.290
either just knowing
their strategies

00:47:58.290 --> 00:47:59.750
and trying to anticipate them.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:01.850
For example, you're a
human rights organization

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.760
and I know what you're
going to say in a meeting

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.780
or in a lawsuit.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:08.180
And then I can try to--

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.160
that intelligence helps
me counter your strategy.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.540
But it can also be used
to affect your reputation.

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:20.570
I've seen many sick
stuff, like, trying

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:27.080
to even create just personal
problems with your wife.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:30.860
Or there's some messages
that says, oh, look

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.167
at this video of your husband
having sex with another person,

00:48:35.167 --> 00:48:36.000
and stuff like that.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.730
So there's also an intention
on creating this turmoil

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:40.560
in your life.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.650
So just, it's an obstacle
for you to conduct your work.

00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:49.040
So it's a whole range,
from just knowing

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:54.230
and to reputation to even
harm or even getting killed.

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:58.440
And who knows what else
they might be using it for.

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:01.100
AUDIENCE: Do you know if your
organization was ever targeted

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.360
by the Mexican government?

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.319
And what about
your own security?

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:06.110
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA:
They always ask this.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.260
I can't answer that question.

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.520
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:20.360
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA: But of
course, it's a consideration.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:23.339
If you work-- basically,
if you do anything

00:49:23.339 --> 00:49:25.880
that the government doesn't like
in Mexico, you are a target.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:27.421
You need to think
about these things.

00:49:27.421 --> 00:49:30.590
And we think about
these things as well.

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:32.630
Our threat model
definitely increased

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:35.947
after these publications.

00:49:35.947 --> 00:49:38.120
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm, thanks.

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.280
This question-- another
question, different person.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:44.120
What your investigation
or research has uncovered

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.780
is alarming.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.640
Thanks for sharing
in this forum.

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.640
Generally speaking, what is
your advice or recommendation

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.027
for people who may be
targeted of surveillance?

00:49:53.027 --> 00:49:55.110
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA:
First, don't click the link.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:56.225
That's the first thing.

00:49:56.225 --> 00:49:58.670
Don't click any link that--

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.140
if someone sends you
something and you're not sure,

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.800
ask that person, hey,
did you send me a link?

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.890
That's the first thing.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.215
And the second is to contact
us or other organizations that

00:50:09.215 --> 00:50:11.660
are on the ground or outside
of Mexico that are doing

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.510
work trying to detect this.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:16.250
Because it helps.

00:50:16.250 --> 00:50:19.310
For example, Ahmed Mansoor--

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.900
who is actually in
jail, and I think

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.450
everyone should try to do
something to get him out

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.500
of jail, for example--

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:28.580
he did a great service to
millions of users of iPhone.

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:32.270
Because thanks to his savviness
and with the collaboration

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:36.120
he did with Citizen Lab three
security holes in the iPhone

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:36.920
were patched--

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.960
thanks to him detecting them.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.880
So I think more collaboration.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.550
I think this also [INAUDIBLE] is
an example of the collaboration

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:46.430
that needs to happen between
different organizations

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.640
to tackle this problem.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.457
Because it affects many people.

00:50:51.457 --> 00:50:52.790
And we have different knowledge.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:53.831
I have the relationships.

00:50:53.831 --> 00:50:56.480
Because building this trust and
relationships with the victims

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.810
is something that takes
time, effort, et cetera.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:03.050
And we've been lucky
enough and to be

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:04.640
able to build
these relationships

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.740
and be able to get
these messages.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.960
But we collaborated
with Citizen Lab

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:15.320
to try to analyze them and
have all the technical evidence

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.460
on the cases.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:18.770
And I think,
definitely, for example,

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.350
in the case of Citizen Lab,
have collaborated with companies

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:24.860
even to also give them, in
a responsible disclosure

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.110
procedure, information
about these holes,

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:28.540
so they can patch
them, et cetera.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.331
And I think, for example,
this is something

00:51:30.331 --> 00:51:32.037
that I know Google
has been working on.

00:51:32.037 --> 00:51:33.620
There's been multiple
occasions on how

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:38.870
they are trying to detect
attacks from malware developed

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.510
by NSO Group.

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:43.000
And I think this
is something that

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.500
is very important,
the collaboration

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:50.450
between institutions, civil
society, academy, corporations,

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.959
to try to detect and
protect users of technology.

00:51:54.959 --> 00:51:56.500
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you, Luis Fernando--

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:56.920
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA:
Oh, thanks to you.

00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.620
SPEAKER 1: --for
joining us today.

00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.560
And thank you, everyone.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.893
LUIS FERNANDO GARCIA: Thank you.

00:51:59.893 --> 00:52:01.720
