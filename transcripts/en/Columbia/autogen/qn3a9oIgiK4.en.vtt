presentation um I'm particularly
interested in the categories that we

01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120
interested in the categories that we
 

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.000
interested in the categories that we
construct and so I was very interested

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.010

FFA and all of this there's big conflict

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780
FFA and all of this there's big conflict
 

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.080

something like that I think there would

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560
something like that I think there would
 

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:30.760
something like that I think there would
be their differences

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:30.770
 
 

01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:34.390
 
um it's interesting to see the two sides

01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400
um it's interesting to see the two sides
 

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.740
um it's interesting to see the two sides
and how they relate to each other and

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:35.750
and how they relate to each other and
 

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:37.600

small qualitative study and I was
 

01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:44.500
small qualitative study and I was
interested more diversity within that

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:44.510
interested more diversity within that
 

01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:48.550

that description threaded people are
 

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.470
that description threaded people are
asked in their french and it seemed to

01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480
asked in their french and it seemed to
 

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.950

communities into you know more diverse
 

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:39.790
communities into you know more diverse
communities and so they actually are

01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800
communities and so they actually are
 

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.790
communities and so they actually are
asked often about their you know about

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800
asked often about their you know about
 

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.399
asked often about their you know about
the role

01:18:43.399 --> 01:18:43.409

01:19:33.739 --> 01:19:35.720
 
can you be more specific about what

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:35.730
can you be more specific about what
 

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.930
can you be more specific about what
needs to change and you like I know it's

01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:38.940
needs to change and you like I know it's
 

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.700
needs to change and you like I know it's
not what you're here to do but it's not

will help and that question is how
 

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:29.580
will help and that question is how
efficient with that be

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:29.590
 
 

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:31.180
 
we

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:31.190
we
 

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:40.040
we
some answers

that may be there articulate a little

01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:11.470
that may be there articulate a little

so because of the discrimination
 

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.149
so because of the discrimination
experience that we're talking about

01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159

plays a role in the way they declare a
 

01:29:31.739 --> 01:29:34.370
plays a role in the way they declare a
sense of freshness so I think that's a

01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380
sense of freshness so I think that's a
 

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:37.699
sense of freshness so I think that's a
generational chance but this would need

01:29:37.699 --> 01:29:37.709
generational chance but this would need
 

01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:41.629
generational chance but this would need
to be further developed as a question on

01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639
to be further developed as a question on
 

01:29:41.639 --> 01:29:45.739

since it's not introduced yet it's hard

01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119
since it's not introduced yet it's hard
 

01:29:48.119 --> 01:29:52.429
since it's not introduced yet it's hard
to know but yeah I've been thinking

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:52.439
to know but yeah I've been thinking
 

01:29:52.439 --> 01:29:53.779
to know but yeah I've been thinking
about this recently because they

01:29:53.779 --> 01:29:53.789
about this recently because they
 

01:29:53.789 --> 01:29:56.569
about this recently because they
introduced in mediation history in the

01:29:56.569 --> 01:29:56.579
introduced in mediation history in the
 

01:29:56.579 --> 01:29:59.089
introduced in mediation history in the
history program in secondary school so

01:29:59.089 --> 01:29:59.099
history program in secondary school so
 

01:29:59.099 --> 01:30:00.529
history program in secondary school so
now it's going to be a chapter that is

01:30:00.529 --> 01:30:00.539
now it's going to be a chapter that is
 

01:30:00.539 --> 01:30:02.149
now it's going to be a chapter that is
going to be taught and it's been a

01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159
