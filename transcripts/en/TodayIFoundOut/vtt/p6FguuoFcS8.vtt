00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.709
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.970
In the video today, we're looking at if there
was ever a specific obese woman who inspired

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.450
the phrase "It ain't over until the fat lady
sings"

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.800
You might think the expression, “The opera
ain’t over until the fat lady sings,”

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.020
derives from some stereotypical “fat lady”
singing to close out operas.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.430
In particular, some have theorized that the
expression in question derives from the last

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.039
part of Richard Wagner’s The Ring of the
Nibelung (knee-be-loong)), Twilight of the

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.200
Gods, where the character of the Valkyrie
Brünnhilde is typically played by a pleasantly

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.790
plump woman who closes out the lengthy opera
via a near twenty minute aria.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.310
But none of this is correct.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.300
The exact expression in question is actually
a relatively recent invention, tracing its

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.600
origins to the 1970s.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.350
It is commonly credited to Dan Cook, a sports
broadcaster from San Antonio, Texas.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.930
He was reporting on a playoff game between
his hometown Spurs and the Washington Bullets

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.250
in 1978 in which the Spurs were down three
games to one.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.420
Seemingly off the cuff, Cook stated: “The
opera ain’t over till the fat lady sings.”

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.010
But this, also, is not the true origin of
the exact phrase.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.550
For that, we have to go back to 1976, when
Ralph Carpenter was giving a report on The

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.860
Dallas Morning News in March of that year:

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.790
"Despite his obvious allegiance to the Red
Raiders, Texas Tech sports information director

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.830
Ralph Carpenter was the picture of professional
objectivity when the Aggies rallied for a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.540
72-72 tie late in the SWC tournament finals.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.380
“Hey, Ralph,” said Bill Morgan (Southwest
Conference information director), “this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.230
… is going to be a tight one after all.”

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.380
“Right,” said Ralph.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.020
“The opera ain’t over until the fat lady
sings.”"

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.910
So while Cook didn’t actually coin the phrase
as is often stated, his utterance did result

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.460
in its popularization via inspiring Bullets
coach Dick Motta to borrow the phrase and

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.560
repeat it frequently during their playoff
run that year as a sort of rallying cry against

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.560
overconfidence.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.170
Motta even had t-shirts made with the expression
on it.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.909
At this point you might be wondering if Carpenter
really came up with the phrase off the cuff

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.990
in 1976.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.990
It doesn’t appear so.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.530
You see, “The opera ain’t over till the
fat lady sings,” is just a modern version

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.610
of a much older Southern expression, with
the family of expression going all the way

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.890
back to at least the 1870s.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.260
For instance, in the October 17, 1872 edition
of The Daily Picayune, it states, “As long

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.610
as the organ is playing, church is not out.”

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.260
Not literally referring to church getting
out, this saying has the same common usage

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.420
as the “opera/fat lady” expression, simply
saying “It ain’t over yet” or, to use

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.410
a similar phrase, “Don’t count your chickens
until they’re hatched.”

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.370
In 1894, another example is seen expressing
the same sentiment in a report from the August

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.120
17 edition of The Fort Worth Gazette,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.920
"The impression is still strong among railroad
passenger agents that there will be further

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.470
reductions in the rate to the Washington encampment
of the Knights of Pythias.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.080
“Church is never out till the people get
through singing,” said one of them this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.800
morning, and all of them talk as if they understood
the language of this parable."

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.830
In yet another instance, this time in 1896
reported in the New York Tribune, one Chauncey

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.270
M. Depew is asked, “Do you think the Governor
still has a chance?”

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.860
(referring to Levi P. Morton seeking a presidential
nomination), to which he responds:

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.790
"While there is life there is hope.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.140
It doesn’t do to count on anything as a
certainty until all is over.

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.120
Church is never out until they stop singing."

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.569
The expression became relatively common from
here, particularly in the Southern United

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.260
States, and, fast-forwarding a bit through
history, is even known to have been used by

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.140
various sports broadcasters in the 1970s.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.430
For instance, in 1974 pioneering female sportscaster
Lee Arthur noted while broadcasting on KDKA,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.140
Pittsburgh during a Rangers / Penguins hockey
match: “Back in Indiana we used to say,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.130
‘The church ain’t over till the singing’s
through.'”

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.461
Two years later, in 1976, it was reported
in The Baltimore Sun that the captain of the

00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:37.879
Baltimore Clippers team, Fred Speck, said
of his team’s chances, “Church isn’t

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.200
over until the choir stops singing.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200
Anything can happen.”

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.129
That same year, in a little obscure work called
Southern Words and Sayings, the first documented

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.250
instance of incorporating “fat lady” to
the phrase occurred where it states, “Church

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.230
ain’t out ’till the fat lady sings.”

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.060
Given the nature of this work, it can be assumed
that this variation was at least reasonable

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.390
well-known in certain parts of the South previous
to this documented instance.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.420
(It has also been claimed, though I couldn’t
find any documented evidence, that another

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.580
common variation at the time was “It ain’t
over till the fat lady sings the blues.”)

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.030
From this, it would seem likely that Carpenter’s
real contribution (if any) to the sentiment

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.190
was simply substituting “church” with
“opera,” using the already established

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.279
“fat lady sings” variation of the phrase.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.469
Two years later, Dan Cook and then Dick Motta
would borrow the phrase, popularizing the

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:37.760
“opera” version with the masses, and the
rest, as they say, is history.
