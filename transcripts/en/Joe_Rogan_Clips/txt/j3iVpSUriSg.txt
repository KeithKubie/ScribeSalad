Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, you should eat.

Speaker 2:          00:03          So Matt, you really should, you should eat, you should eat some animal protein without, I mean, if you oppose the moral aspect of killing an animal, which I totally understand and appreciate, and that's what led me to become a hunter in the first places that I was really uncomfortable watching these animal rights videos of factory farming. I thought it was disgusting. I'm just like, I don't want to participate in this is reprehensible. Hunting's a different thing, man. To me, hunting is this intense. It's very spiritual in a way. I mean, people don't get it because they see you celebrating when it's over because it's very, very, very difficult to close in on a wild animal. Mostly elk. Well, Alex, my favorite for two reasons. One, it's very delicious, super nutritious. Also, if I shoot one elk, I could eat it for like eight months. What you deliver? Yeah, freezing them

Speaker 1:          00:49          breathing. So you're out stalk in an elk on the plains. Where are you like near where you live? You just go to our travel. How'd you can,

Speaker 2:          00:59          yeah. When you do travel on bikes, if you're a white tail hunt, a lot of times would go into the woods with bikes cause they don't leave a scent the way your feet do, you know? And um, animals don't associate the sound of a bike the way they associate with like the sound of stepping by peatal Holland. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14          Slapping 12 evolve, right? Oh yeah. They see you on a bike. They didn't even freak out as much. Delightful. Never seen that. Like what's that? My brain. What are these things? Yeah, yeah. Oh are they hurt animals? So you just see like a herd. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:27          yeah. You see a herd of them and try to figure out which way the wind's blowing and you try to get close to them. Is this a video of us? Yeah. This is a video house from,

Speaker 1:          01:35          Oh yeah, that's on elk now. The thing is you've made, I see that elk there and I sort of feel like I've watched too much Disney. Um, you know, like I see that elk and I feel I'm Bambi literally, you know, like I don't have it. Like is that early in the morning you look tired? Not Tired. My no late afternoon actually. Can you tell if it was late afternoon? Yeah. Like say it like I from that position I couldn't breathe. Like I would love the game of being able to him because actually I've had to go down. Gun Range is, it turns out I'm pretty good shot and it's nice to see that thing come back with like holes around his abdomen and his head and I think satisfied there. You've been dealt with paper man. But, but like the ILC I couldn't, I've got too much empathy in me that I couldn't deal with the feeling of after it was shot. I like it. They like almost thinking about it, the sentimentality of it. I've sentimentalize it now, you know, at least I don't eat meat and stuff like that. So it's not like I have all those feelings of bat can handle it in a packaged portioned off way. It's just like feel too much like, oh that creature. So what in your head when you're doing it, when you're pulling the trigger, you're not having what's going on in your mind.

Speaker 2:          02:48          Well, you, you only are hunting these mature animals that have already passed on their genes. You also are recognizing that if you're not killing these things, they're not, it's not like they're going to live forever. They are, they live a short life, a short life with a very violent death. It's either wolves or mountain lions or bears or something's going to take them out. Yeah. And what you're doing is essentially dipping your toe into the natural world. And I've heard the argument that, well, this is ridiculous because everyone can't do that. You know, if everyone went out and hunted all the animals, so it'd be no animals slept, which is true. But, um, I'm not everyone. And so I don't, you know, I mean to use that, if everyone did he argument, it's a good argument because you, if you're encouraging people to hunt, it is kind of a good argument because it's not realistic.

Speaker 2:          03:36          It's not sustainable. But the other thing to recognize is that the reason why most of this wildlife exist in the first place. A lot of it was wiped out in the early 20th century from um, what they call market hunting and the late, late 19th century, early 20th century. Um, they, you know, they didn't have refrigeration and uh, it was hard to get food and we didn't have the same sort of large scale agriculture that we have today. And so when someone would want meat, they would, uh, someone who would either have to hunt it for you and you'd go to the market and get that hunted food or a, you would go out and do it yourself. And they basically wiped out most of the wildlife in North America to the point of extinction, whitetail deer, elk, they've been extra painted from the majority of their range in North American, only been replaced and a few other places, but the places would, they have been replaced. It's all through money that was generated through hunting tags all through billions and billions of dollars. There's a thing called the a Robertson Pickman, I think that's what it's called, act where a 10%, if you buy hunting gear and equipment, 10% of that money goes to habitat restoration. Um, making sure that a rangers and forest people get funded. So there's a fish and game department gets funded and all and also population conservation, making sure that the populations are healthy, repopulating certain areas with elk and deer. And this has all been done through the money that's generated through hunting.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Yeah, I can see that there's an looking at my own feelings towards it. I can see that there's a, potentially I'm bringing a center mentality to the idea of animals that's like anthropomorphic. Yes. Like I'm not, oh you can't kill that. It will abate babies. And I mean like thinking about things like that. Um, but what I, you know, I live in a rural area in Britain where like hunting is normal and I wouldn't, and agriculture is normal and I wouldn't get very far if I were sort of like, you can't shoot those pheasants, look at their feathers, they're beautiful. You know what I mean? Like it wouldn't, it's not a helpful attitude. So whilst I like record in my cell, I couldn't do that because like it messes me up on a sort of a field, like a very sort of deep visceral level, you know, like, but I feel like this is precisely the kind of territory we have to look at acknowledging and tolerate indifference between us.

Speaker 1:          06:02          This is where I feel like the sort of these ossified polarized positions between right and left are starting to take root because if someone like me who don't eat meat, don't eat animal products and wooden hunt for ethical reasons, start trying to impose on other people now you shouldn't harm because of this that I've not watched Bambi, you know, like that's going to mean that people aren't able to explore who they are. And so my po, I've let go of judging people around things that I don't agree with because my record, I don't know everything. You know what I mean? I'm this, this is like, this is about my morality is about how I behave. And if people said to me, I'm thinking about going hunting, I go, well these are my feelings about it. However though I just heard that hunting does contribute. Apparently that is survival to some species and there is an argument that it's quite natural in indigenous and it's probably a way of getting in contact with who we are originally as hunt in people is an important part of our anthropological history and possibly a lot of the condemnation of hunt in his part of the rejection of who we used to be is we become overly civilized and more and more detached from what it is to be human.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Whether that's sacred or pragmatic, we don't know what human beings are anymore. We reject our own sexuality, we reject our own bodies, we reject, you know, we're trying to turn ourselves in these sort of cyborgs, these emotionless, sexless, meaningless creatures. Where is our passion? Whereas our connection with the sacred, they would go, hold on. Only after about hunting in, when are you going to stop talking? Never gave me an in. I will pummel you with my belief system on all things like, you know, so I don't feel like that ain't where I get into judging people.
