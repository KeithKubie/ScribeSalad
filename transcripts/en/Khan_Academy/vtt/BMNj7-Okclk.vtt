00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.680
What I've done here
is listed a bunch

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.307
of events that might
occur in a given period.

00:00:05.307 --> 00:00:07.140
And what I want to think
about in this video

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.560
is how, if at all, they might
be accounted for in GDP,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.990
especially in this
expenditure view of GDP.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.320
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.640
and try it out yourself.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.690
See how, if each of these
events happen in the period

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.360
for which we are trying
to calculate GDP,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.000
how would they be accounted
for, according to the buckets

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.760
we thought about, the
composition of the expenditure

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.160
view of GDP.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.960
So now I'm assuming
that you have unpaused,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.460
you've tried it yourself, and
so let's try to go through it.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.760
So Khan Academy is a firm.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.960
It's a not-for-profit firm.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.340
No one really owns Khan Academy.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.250
I guess society owns Khan
Academy, but it is a firm.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.410
So Khan Academy employs
a software engineer

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.520
and pays them $100,000.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.960
Well, this is a firm
making the expenditure.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.636
And arguably and
even conceptually,

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:53.760
this also is an investment.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.240
Because this $100,000 is going
to be used to develop code

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.840
that has future benefit.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.350
So this is going to be
the investment category.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.390
Let me do it in that same color.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.150
So I, investment, is going
to get plus $100,000.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.616
In general, the spending by
firms goes into investment.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.240
Now, let's look at
the second scenario.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.720
Accenture, which is
another firm, and this

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.690
is a for-profit firm, earns $10
million-- or maybe I should say

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.570
gets $10 million
in revenue, just

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.900
to be clear what we're
talking about-- by building

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.840
a new IT system for California.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.090
And the important thing to
think about, you might say,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.820
oh, OK, wait, this is
OK, Accenture is a firm,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.650
but California is
clearly the government.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.210
So how do you account for this?

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.970
And it's the
expenditure view of GDP.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.650
So in this situation, California
is spending $10 million

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.450
in the period for
a new IT system.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.760
So this is going
to be government.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.220
The government category is going
to be increased by $10 million,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.340
because of this expenditure.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.160
Now next one.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.250
My mother sells her
house in New Orleans

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.930
to a Swedish woman for $200,000.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.780
Once again, a
house is being sold

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.660
from someone in the country
to someone who was foreign,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.680
what do we do?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.390
But the important
thing to realize

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.540
is that this is not a new house.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690
This is a transfer
of an existing house.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.510
Nothing was produced here.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.359
So this has no
contribution to GDP.

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.900
It doesn't matter it's a Swedish
woman or anything like that.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.110
The house existed before.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.350
It just changed hands.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.380
A new house did
not get produced.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.320
So nothing happens to GDP here.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.290
Next one.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.391
I-- and I'm assuming
that I am here,

00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:45.140
sitting here in Mountain
View, California,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.950
American citizen-- I
buy a Japanese made

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.600
lawn mower for $200.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.290
Now this one is interesting.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.320
Because if you think
about it theoretically,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.080
nothing was produced
in the United States,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.020
so nothing should be added
to GDP on a net-net basis.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.940
And we'll see that that
is actually the case.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.810
But it's going to show up
by adding to consumption

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.040
and then taking away
from net exports.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.990
So two things are
going to happen here.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.020
We'll say, OK, Sal is
an American consumer.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.150
If we just look at how
much more he spent,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.890
he spent $200 more, so it's
going to be added there.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.230
But then we're going to
take it out of net exports.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.160
So net exports-- let me do it
in that same green color-- net

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.230
exports.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.020
Everything else is neutral.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.580
So in this thing
right over here,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.660
there was no foreign purchases.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.430
But there is me buying
a foreign product.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.100
And let me subtract that out.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.640
So I'm going to subtract
out $200 right over there.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.350
So net exports will
be lower by $200,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.280
because essentially
this was a $200 import.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.820
And that completely
cancels out the $200

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.720
increase in consumption.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.820
And so this will have
zero net effect on GDP.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.640
These two terms will cancel out.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.210
Now I buy a new home in
California for $500,000.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.590
Now household spending
for the most part

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.670
is considered C, except when
you are buying a new home.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.760
So even though I am
not a firm, because I

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.899
am buying a house, a new house,
this will go into investment.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:24.170
So investment will
go up by $500,000.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.110
And then finally American
Airlines buys a new Airbus jet,

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.690
and Airbus jets
are made in Europe.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.650
So what's going to happen here?

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.530
So once again,
net-net, nothing was

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.920
produced in the United States.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.320
So on a net basis, this
should not contribute to GDP.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.810
And we'll see that on net
basis, it will break out,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.170
it will be neutral, but it
will be like this situation.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.169
There's an American firm
that made a purchase--

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.960
and actually, I didn't
put the amount here.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.134
So let's say it
was $100 million.

00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:54.550
I think that's actually about
what a passenger plane might

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.890
actually cost, for $100 million.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.760
So the way we would
account for it,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.480
investment would go
up by $100 million.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.512
You have an American firm
making a purchase, $100 million.

00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:09.720
Conceptually, it makes sense.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720
It's going to provide
future goods and services,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.750
going to give
transportation to people.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.200
But it's going to be netted out,
because you have a net import.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.030
So what this is going
to do to net exports,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.590
on this side of it, you're
going to have $100 million,

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.716
because this was an import.

00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:28.631
So you're going to have
negative $100 million,

00:05:28.631 --> 00:05:30.780
when you think of it from
an export point of view.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.430
And you had no corresponding
positive export.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.920
So you're going to have net
exports-- net exports is

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.590
going to go down $100 million.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.670
This was a net import
of $100 million,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.950
so it makes sense that
net exports would go down.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.900
It would be negative
net exports.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.820
And these two, once
again, are going

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.880
to cancel out with
each other, so that you

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.240
have no net GDP,
which makes sense,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.130
because this plane was not
produced in the United States.
