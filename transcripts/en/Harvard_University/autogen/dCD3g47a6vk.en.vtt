this has some problems farmers are
 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.719
this has some problems farmers are
spatially quite spread out often and so

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729
spatially quite spread out often and so
 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.449
spatially quite spread out often and so
it's expensive to travel to reach them

particular pest attack during the season

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840
particular pest attack during the season
 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.359
