1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,570
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,690
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,500
January 11th, 2016 what's
going on? How are Ya?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,310
Oh, is it going? I'm in a great
fucking mode. I don't know why.

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,350
You know what? I haven't boozed in like
fucking, I don't know what it's been.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,390
I don't t nine 10 days
or something like that.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,660
I did have a sip of wine last night,
but I don't really consider that Busan,

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,110
you know, the way I go after it. Um,

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,960
my wife's so, you know, something was
funny when I, when I stopped drinking,

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,770
my wife always tries to
get me back to drinking,

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,390
not to get drunk or anything. She just
is like, you're so fucking, you know,

12
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,450
I drive her so fucking nuts
that I just think sometimes,

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,280
you know, if she wasn't
such a good person,

14
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:57,900
I think she would try and like drug me
every night like around supper. Right.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,110
Make a little dinner and be like,
how is that honey? Oh, look at you.

16
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,230
You look sleepy. Like I have no idea.
Like, she just put some shit in my food,

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,160
not to like kill me, just
to sort of sedate me. Um,

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,210
but, uh, anyways, she bought, I haven't
drank in like 10 days or something. Wow.

19
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:15,540
That really made my head go somewhere
like, wow, that's Kinda fucked up.

20
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,490
She does that. Um, but yeah, I
haven't drank in like 10 days.

21
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:25,380
I, uh, I'm feeling good and that,
so what happens is nice slowly,

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,730
you know, I start to eat better. I'm
starting my day off with the old, uh,

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,400
from the old country thing, you know,
little fucking water at room temperature,

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,330
which should make you keg if you're any
kind of a fucking human being. But, uh,

25
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:43,260
you get used to it with some lemon and
then a little cayenne pepper in it.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,980
And then I take a, I
let that settle in me.

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,110
Then I get a couple of
scoops of a Greek yogurt,

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,860
the all natural stuff that actually
kind of tastes like sour cream.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,410
And the first time I ate it, I was like,

30
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,640
this is the worst shit I've ever
tasted because I was used to the, uh,

31
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,450
the crack baby yogurt that I've been
eating my whole life that has like fucking

32
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,510
40 bags of sugar in it, you know,
and you yogurt, you're like, yeah,

33
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,421
I mean,

34
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:13,170
the amount of sugar that's in fucking
regular yogurt humani you should fucking

35
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:16,820
snort it. I mean, it's literally like,
I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you.

36
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,660
I still fucking love it. But, uh,

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,310
the Greek shit took me a minute and
now I'm actually, uh, I like it, man.

38
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,440
If I drink this shit and just
have a couple scoops of that,

39
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,100
it kind of fills me up. And, um,

40
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,430
that's kind of the big thing is you
become an old fuck like me. It's just,

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,520
just somehow getting the hunger to go
away without doing damage to yourself,

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:36,600
you know,

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,480
and then walking around and burning a
few calories before you go to the next

44
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:41,790
one. You know, and I know
this sponge, you know,

45
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,220
hopefully some younger listeners listening
to this judging Makos and this old

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,290
far talking about fucking lemon water,
Cayenne pepper and fucking Greek yogurt.

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,970
Well, you know something. If you're
lucky enough, you'll live long enough.

48
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,770
If we don't fuck up something or
something bad doesn't happen to you. A,

49
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,450
you know, to get to by age and you know,

50
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,470
it's good to start healthy
habits now. Fuck. Shut up bill.

51
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,200
What do you the fucking first lady,
you know what I'm doing right now?

52
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:11,170
I'm doing shit that like a first
lady does right now. I'm actually,

53
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,670
let's get in shape. Kids,

54
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,010
how about you go outside for 10 minutes
a day and you just do some jumping

55
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:22,600
jacks? Can you fucking believe
that they've got to tell
kids to go out and play?

56
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,663
You know,

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,230
that's how fucking insane
video games have got.

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,221
I mean,

59
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:35,221
if I made video games and I actually
saw Michelle Obama on TV begging kids to

60
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:40,720
try to not have their first
cardiac incident by the
time they were in the third

61
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,710
grade, I mean I, I would tear
up and just be like, I did it.

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,330
You know, I am so fucking great at my job.

63
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,270
I've made children stop playing outside,

64
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,580
you know.

65
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,750
Do you think there's like at the Alec
Baldwin of the video gaming industry,

66
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:05,410
you know, from Glengarry Glen Ross
Ross coming in just screaming at him,

67
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,300
you know, how many kids I cause
to have a heart attack? Seven,

68
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,250
fuck Yo. She's screaming at him

69
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,073
trying to get them to,

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,450
we haven't done our fucking jobs til
every kid has a fucking pacemaker by the

71
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:28,430
seventh grade. Um, I dunno.

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,350
Anyways. Yeah. So I'm trying
to get back in shape. So, uh,

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,580
I've been stone sober. So yesterday I got
my, uh, my f my first massage in like,

74
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:41,320
I dunno, like two years. Whenever
I get a massage afterwards,

75
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:43,570
I always think like, I got
to start doing this, man,

76
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:46,480
this is great for an old Fart, like
make, you know, and then you come home,

77
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:49,270
you crush the waters,
you get all the toxins,

78
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,270
adi or whatever yoga shit
they tell you to do. And um,

79
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,490
both the, I know this always have them.
I don't fucking do this. You know what?

80
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,740
Once, once a month I'm going to
go down there, you know? Okay.

81
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,750
Fucking you haven't worked out my
fucking back. Like my whole right.

82
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,501
I don't know what's like,

83
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:08,050
I have a little curvature of
the spine and the lady's like,

84
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,820
where are the problem areas? Right.

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,660
And of course your brain always goes my
dick, but you know, it's illegal place.

86
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,193
Okay,

87
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,150
okay. Yeah.

88
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,100
They seemed to be able to be a problem
in the central pelvic area on the frontal

89
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:28,080
lobe. Um, I'm like Mike, I never even
noticed it either. I was like, uh,

90
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,740
my right. Yeah. Shoulder,

91
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,250
my right forearm and my right
foot. And I was just like, wow,

92
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,130
how fucked up is my right side?
And then I realized all of them,

93
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,190
all of those injuries I got
from playing drums, you know,

94
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,890
my right forum from fucking
holding this stick wrong.

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
I don't know what I'm
doing with my shoulders.

96
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:50,700
Probably after I fuck up another field
looking at the bass player and shrugging

97
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:54,420
like, I'm sorry. I mean I tried to get
back on one right? And then my foot,

98
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,190
I fucked that up years ago trying to
get my bass drum fast as John Bottoms,

99
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,210
you know, which I never even remotely
achieved. I just had the lifetime pain.

100
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,500
You know,

101
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,100
every time I take a step
I'm always reminded of what
a wonderful drummer jump on

102
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:11,570
him is. Um, so anyways, uh, I did that.

103
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,840
Um, with the lovely Nia, that's always
a good thing to do it, you know,

104
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,170
you go in there with your wife,
then you don't feel like a dirt bag.

105
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,990
Cause anytime I go to get a massage,
I always feel like a dirt bag.

106
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,830
There's just no way not to feel like a
fucking complete piece of shit when you

107
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:28,570
walk in there like, yeah, Hey, I want
you to, I want you to work out the kinks.

108
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,110
This we heard, you know
what I mean? Wait a minute.

109
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:36,550
What am I talking about? I got
a massage and fucking, Nah,

110
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,160
Milwaukee. No, I didn't.

111
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,710
No, I did not. That was a steam.
That was a steam. That's right. Oh,

112
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,640
that's right. That's right. Yeah. I guess
I haven't had like two fucking years.

113
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,770
And they always do the same thing when
they, when they put my hands on my back,

114
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:02,060
they just go, wow. Wow. Do
you have a lot of stress?

115
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,620
Has it been a while to that guy? Yeah.
Yeah. If your back feels like gravel.

116
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,350
So anyways, we did that and
then we came home and um,

117
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,400
we made a Mario Batali's, a
Lasagna, bowling Aes, and uh,

118
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,770
it was fucking delicious.
Uh, homemade pots,

119
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:25,370
the homemade pasta things and all that.
I gotta get my homemade pasta game up.

120
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,540
I tried to make the spinach pasta and
this just the pasta was definitely green,

121
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:33,800
but you could still see the
chunks of a spinach in there.

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,670
You know what I mean? So what does that
mean? Did I not need the dough enough?

123
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,690
Was uh, cause it was frozen spinach,
like it's said to be, you know, like the,

124
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,250
uh, the recipe said to be, am I saying
that right? Like the recipe said,

125
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,360
said to be, what the fuck does that
mean? Like the rest he said it should be.

126
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,380
I think that's what I was
trying to say. But um, you know,

127
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,820
when I dried it out and maybe I
just didn't dice it up enough,

128
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,480
I have no idea. But I'm,
I'm actually psyched that a,

129
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:08,650
the consistency though, I can get
that down. I might've needed it,

130
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,700
needed to need it a little bit more.
I don't know. Is there any, uh,

131
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,160
higher qualified people out there that
could help me out on how to make, uh,

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,490
the right Spanish pasta?

133
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,570
Cause I watched some videos and I
still fuck the thing up. But anyways,

134
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:25,740
so we did all of that and me while I
was watching like the playoff games,

135
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,720
play offs and um,

136
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,340
fucking great games this weekend.
Heartbreakers but just fucking,

137
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,890
just great games with the also that,

138
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,220
that creeping sadness that I always
have when the playoffs are here.

139
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,720
That it's just like, did another
regular season go by that fucking fast.

140
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,820
God Damn it. It's, it's going
to be over. It's another month.

141
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,120
It's going to be fucking over
this time. Next month is good.

142
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,590
This I'm not even going to say cause
it's going to be too fucking depressing.

143
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,480
Um, however,

144
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:01,120
I have gotten totally into the Celtics
and NBA hoop with my Bruin, so I mean,

145
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,590
I got a little game almost every
night sometimes too. But anyways,

146
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,480
so let's go through them.

147
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,710
Let's go throw him his every fucking do
shoe doesn't like sports is gonna roll

148
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:15,180
their eyes. Just fast forward like
fucking 40 minutes and you'll be safe. Um,

149
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,960
the first one I saw, I think I
want, I taped all of them. Um,

150
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,570
so I watched them at
weird times. I watched a,

151
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:24,750
the second half of the original Texas,

152
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,270
the Kansas City chiefs, just absolutely
dominating the, uh, the new Texas.

153
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,280
And I actually tweeted that
out to on a, on Twitter. Um,

154
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,140
and I actually got a ton of
shit for people like, oh,

155
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,360
what are you trying to show off your
sports knowledge? It's like, no,

156
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:43,680
I like sharing it. I love when people do
stuff like that and I'm a sports nerd.

157
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,190
Okay. I'm not acting like I
played at a professional level.

158
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:48,120
I just love that shit.

159
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,810
So I'm going to take you through it for
those of you didn't know that the chiefs

160
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,110
are originally called the Texans.
They actually played in Dallas, Texas.

161
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,990
Um, when the AFL first started
and when the AFL first came out,

162
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,243
the NFL,

163
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:07,110
the established league publicly
laughed at them and said,

164
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:11,370
these guys are crazy. They'll, this
will never work. Hahaha. Whatever. I,

165
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:14,910
you know, I, you nervous now are not
nervous at all. We're just going to do,

166
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,740
you know, the American people know
where the quality football is at, right?

167
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,300
That's what they said publicly.

168
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,310
And then behind the scenes as much as
they may or may have not believed that

169
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:30,960
they then hedge their bets
and they wanted to try to

170
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,450
sabotage the AFL as much as they
could before it even got started.

171
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,280
So the AFL, how many fucking teams did
they have? They had the Boston Patriots,

172
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:44,700
the buffalo bills, the New York titans.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,833
Yeah.

174
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,460
Uh, the Dallas Texans,
the Minnesota Vikings.

175
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,490
And I'll get back to that before
you say that. I'm wrong on that.

176
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:57,090
They had the Minnesota Vikings,
I used to know this by heart.

177
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,840
Denver Broncos, Oakland Raiders,

178
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,290
San Diego chargers. I'm sorry,
the Los Angeles chargers.

179
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,920
And uh, dolphins weren't in
it. Bengals weren't in it.

180
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,190
Who the fuck else has left? Bears.
Lions. Yeah, something like that. I,

181
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,880
I probably forgot a team or two. And um,

182
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,180
so the owner with the most
money was Lamar Lundy,

183
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,340
I believe that was his name. I
didn't look the shit up again,

184
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,680
but I read this whole
book on it. Lamar Lundy,

185
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,830
and he was the wealthiest of all owners.

186
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:39,460
So basically this guy could hold out
the longest in this new crazy venture.

187
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,020
All right. So how, how they
attack the fucking AFL?

188
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:46,490
They did it on two different levels.

189
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:50,570
The Dallas Texans were
owned by Lamar Lundy,

190
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,820
the most wealthiest of all the owners.

191
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,830
So what they the NFL did was
they awarded Dallas a team,

192
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,690
which became the Dallas cowboys.
So for a season or two, I forget,

193
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:05,830
I didn't look it up as I said that you
could either go see the Dallas cowboys or

194
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:08,620
the Dallas, Texas, now the Dallas cowboys,

195
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,750
as much as they were
an expansion franchise,

196
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,190
you could go down and watch them get
the shit kicked out of them, you know,

197
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,690
by Johnny Unitas, Jim Brown
or you know, Frank Gifford.

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
And while these guys, you
know, all these legends,

199
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,010
the fucking Green Bay
packers would come to town.

200
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,730
You get to see Vince Lombardi in
the early days of the packers sweep.

201
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:31,930
You could see all this professional level
talent or you could go across town and

202
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:33,370
go see the Dallas Texans,

203
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,840
a bunch of nobodies playing a bunch of
nobodies cause they wanna establish it.

204
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,230
So obviously that completely,
um, that's a no brainer.

205
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,130
As a sports fan,

206
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,610
you're going to go see the NFL team and
go see all these stars that you've been

207
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:50,350
watching on TV. So, uh,
that completely fucked them.

208
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,440
And they had to move to Kansas
City and they became the chiefs.

209
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,560
They kept their color. So, but they
were originally called the Texans,

210
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:59,620
but they gave up the name. And
then the Minnesota Vikings,

211
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,310
which I did not know. I didn't know
any of that shit till I read the book.

212
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:06,460
The Minnesota Vikings were
originally going to be an AFL team.

213
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,240
So at the NFL did was not
only award Dallas a team,

214
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:15,310
they also went to the owners of the
Minnesota Vikings and said, hey,

215
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,120
do you want to just join the NFL
and not be part of the AFL? Come on,

216
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,730
we're an established league.
And of course they said, hey,

217
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,670
fuck you guys and your new venture.

218
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,790
We're going to fuck a fuck the
whole goal and against the NFL,

219
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,020
we're going to join them. So
that's what they did. They uh,

220
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,130
they opened a franchise across town
from the wealthiest owner and then they

221
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,360
stole one of their teams.

222
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,010
That was their two moves as they publicly
laughed at the AFL. So there you go.

223
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,270
There's a little fucking little
little history from all freckles.

224
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,650
Um, and I haven't said that, you
know, maybe they got him back,

225
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:53,920
but I guess they'd have to beat the
fucking cowboys and are also part of the

226
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:55,390
NFL. So, uh,

227
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,540
congratulations to the
chiefs and evidently they're
playing the Patriots is what

228
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,190
I got from some of the tweets. And uh,

229
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,090
I am not a comfortable Patriot fan know
Patriot fan who's been watching the

230
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:08,800
Patriots is, you know, we had a lot of
losses towards the end of the year. Um,

231
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:12,910
I'm hoping, you know, we're going to get
some help back on our offensive line.

232
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,600
Um, either way it's going to
be, even if we were healthy,

233
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,300
it would have been a brutal
day because, uh, you know,

234
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,180
Andy Reed is no slouch as much as
a guy gets a ton of shit. I mean,

235
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,800
the guy's been to a bunch of, uh, NFC
championship games and shit like that.

236
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:30,970
He has been there before, but you
know, you do need the players.

237
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,990
You do need the ownership. You need
all of that type of shit to try to, uh,

238
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,090
to try to succeed. So
congratulations to them. And, um,

239
00:14:39,091 --> 00:14:44,020
I am by no means comfortable
with next week. Um,

240
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,330
and you know, also, you know,

241
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,650
the chief speak the Seattle Seahawks
as far as p and the loudest fans at one

242
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:53,900
point. And they did it in that old
ass stadium rather than the, uh,

243
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:58,340
the stadium Seahawks fans have that
helps them out and contains the sound

244
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,270
was such a cut, but it's
true. Um, and uh, yeah,

245
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,270
so speaking of the
Vikings and the bangles,

246
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,410
my condolences to fans of
both teams. I've been there,

247
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,770
fortunately you have not been there in
a long time. I guess the Jane's license,

248
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:18,860
but I can't Wayne as a fan with all the
other shit that was going on. But uh,

249
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,690
Jesus fucking Christ.

250
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,590
What the fuck was that guy doing
after he picked off the ball,

251
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,640
walking up to the tunnel already
celebrating. I don't fucking athletes.

252
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,420
We're superstitious.
The fuck are you doing

253
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,053
okay

254
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,490
right there. Yeah. Right. That's
fucking unbelievable to me.

255
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,200
And then he's fucking sitting there.

256
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,460
He probably already took his God damn
cleats off. And then the very next play,

257
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,280
whatever's it two plays in,
they fumble the fucking ball.

258
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,400
I had to watch this part of the game on
highlights cause I taped the game and

259
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,130
for the one time I don't do
the extended fucking record.

260
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,460
This shit happens and I'm probably gonna
put his cleats on and run back out on

261
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:02,070
the field and think he was so fucking
frustrated cause he still had champagne,

262
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,570
you know, of course.
And through his veins,

263
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,560
he was already mentally the next week
that he goes, it was the same guy. Right.

264
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,500
Goes in and fucking
knocks out that player.

265
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,410
Unfucking believable.

266
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,770
Yeah.

267
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,270
I'm fucking believable. Hey
Steeler fence. How many years?

268
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,910
Shut the game off after
the interception, Huh? No,

269
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,200
cause you're a fair weather fan.

270
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,430
Just because you couldn't stomach to
watch the Bengal fans jumping up and down

271
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,360
and having some joy. You know, I,
I'd forgive you if you did that.

272
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:33,910
I'd forgive you if you
walked away. You know,

273
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,620
or if you already started celebrating
and you turn your big fucking sausage

274
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:43,470
Eaton back to the fucking TV and
you're already doing well when it hey,

275
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,810
but up, but who do we got
next week doing all that shit.

276
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,450
Fucking brutal. And, uh,
the Vikings, I won't even,

277
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,343
I don't even,

278
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,960
can you explain to me how you place
kicker had the laces facing your kicker

279
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,790
twice in one fucking
game and a playoff game?

280
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,740
That's unfucking I've never, I mean,
you never see the laces in, right?

281
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,840
I never even knew about it.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

282
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,780
I didn't ever even knew about laces
out since fucking ace Ventura.

283
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,990
That's when I learned about
it. Or is it ace Ventura?

284
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,320
I'm Jesus. Fuck. I mean,

285
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:23,270
I watched the replay of that game and
I went on Twitter beforehand and I fell

286
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,820
and I found out that vikings
wonder, which a fucking sucked,

287
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:29,360
but I was in the middle of, you
know, trying to make spinach pasta,

288
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,020
which was well beyond my cooking ability.
So, you know, I was a little fucking,

289
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,230
uh, got a little sideways
there for a minute. And, um,

290
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,240
I was thinking like, what the fuck?
I mean, he must make this feel goal

291
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,780
and then Seattle just has a ridiculous
kickoff return and then they're able to

292
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:55,050
kick it. Or maybe they score a touchdown
or maybe a defensive back falls down.

293
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,050
I had no idea that he was going
to fucking lose it. Oh my God.

294
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,280
Fucking brutal. But you know what?

295
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,210
Every championship team, you got
to have a little bit of luck.

296
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,990
The first fucking super bowl, the
Patriots won. We had the Tuck rule,

297
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,170
which was a fucking rule. Everybody
blames Tom Brady. It was a blame.

298
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,420
The officials are now there.

299
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,100
The rule rules committee for
coming up with that where we went,

300
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,830
because I say to this day, that's
a fucking fumble. That's a fumble.

301
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,920
The way sugar bear Hamilton
did not interfere with Ken
stay the year the fucking

302
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:29,880
Raiders won in Superbowl 11.

303
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,190
So anybody in Oakland puts
your fucking hankies away,

304
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:36,750
cause I don't wanna hear your crying
about it. That was payback for Superbowl.

305
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,130
Uh, not super 11.

306
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:43,131
The fucking playoffs playoffs in a 77
when sugar bear Hamilton was already in

307
00:18:44,311 --> 00:18:46,220
the air. Jumping at Ken Stabler in the,

308
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,080
and then he lets the ball go and
he called roughing the passer.

309
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,430
And back then it wasn't
a 15 yard penalty. It,

310
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,600
they put the ball where the guy threw
it and it was the end of the game.

311
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,680
He threw a 50 yard fucking prayer.

312
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,350
Ray Hamilton's already in the
fucking air lands on Ken Stabler.

313
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,940
They call roughing the passer and they
took the ball from like the 50 and put it

314
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,630
on the fucking one inch blind and then
the Raiders went and won the fucking

315
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:14,160
game. So I don't want to
hear anything about it,

316
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,580
but I am man enough to say that the
Tuck rule is fucking horseshit and uh,

317
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,480
I think it's a fumble, you know,

318
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:25,260
but I'm not expecting that level of
maturity from radar fence, you know,

319
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:30,090
a fan base that goes to the game,
you know, dressed with, um, you know,

320
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,560
spikes on your shoulder pads that have
been checked by security to make sure

321
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:39,300
that they're totally safe as you
make a, I'm not safe, angry face.

322
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,640
Um, you know, something that does bug
me. I can't stand when they fucking, um,

323
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,940
when people get upset that Hollywood
has the audacity have awards.

324
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,570
We have awards shows and they always talk
about these self-congratulatory night.

325
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,770
Um, like what business
doesn't have an award show?

326
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,110
It's just not fucking televised. You
know, if you fucking drill for oil,

327
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,930
you know, they had the best
of, you know, BP and all them,

328
00:20:07,931 --> 00:20:12,931
they have their fucking yearly fucking
Christmas party in our best rage and all

329
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:17,240
manager goes, da Clem.

330
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,200
Clem failed out of fucking Mishawaka clam.

331
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:24,700
I'm paying for that copper up tonight.
Just kidding. Is his wife here. You know,

332
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,620
they do it and they give
them a little fucking trophy.

333
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,280
They have salesmen or the month
shit. You work at McDonald's,

334
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,640
you can get employee
of the month, you know,

335
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,240
you know they have franchise with
here. You join the fucking cub scouts,

336
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,010
you tie your fucking shoes,

337
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:43,030
they give you a little badge to
sow and your fucking shirt, right?

338
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:44,660
Yeah.

339
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,570
Why isn't Hollywood allowed to
have their little fucking evening?

340
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,080
What is it? Huh? What is it that bugs you?

341
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,890
That there's a bunch of
hot famous ass there?

342
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,233
Okay.

343
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,860
Oh, Geez. I'm sorry.

344
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,553
Okay.

345
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,401
You only want to see,

346
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,610
I want to see somebody go out there and
defend bill Cosby on an award show dead

347
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:12,611
serious and just fucking hold it and
never let anybody in on the joke and then

348
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,870
try to continue hosting
into it in the monologue.

349
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,010
Let's see if they ask you back. All right,

350

verse, Kansas City. No, I'm not. Oh,

What the key to getting
amazing shave is simple one,

360
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,180
use a fresh dollar shave club blade
to use their Dr Covey's easy shave.

361
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,753
That's it.

362

364

smooth. I'm telling you,

have a nine to five regular job, if
you start off with a decent breakfast,

408
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,270
you bring your fucking lunch and then
you ordered a blue apron at night and you

409
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,130
all know, why did I see y'all? Y'All are,
y'all know what I'm talking about? Um,

410
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,530
dinner is what fucks you
diet, at least for me,

411
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:07,870
cause I can eat well the whole fucking
day. Whole Day, I'm doing good,

412
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:09,920
I'm doing good. And then by fucking
four o'clock, I'm like, Hey,

413
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:11,770
I want some fucking potato chips
and I want some ice cream. You know,

414
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,250
if you can just fucking call these cuts
and have them deliver a 500 700 a meal

415
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:21,790
and you just fucking eat the
shit, right. And then you're done.

416
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,760
Drink waters for the rest of the night
and have a little salary already cut up,

417
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,690
you know, throw a spoonful of
peanut butter in there. You know,

418
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,550
it's going to melt off unless
you have, you know, I don't know.

419
00:25:33,551 --> 00:25:36,640
Some built in excuse, you know, like
a lot of overweight people do. Oh Man.

420
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:40,510
Metabolism's really slow. Yeah, yeah.
That and 8,000 calories a fucking day,

421
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:45,370
dude. Alright. MV Empty
watches. Oh, you know,

422
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:48,010
we only have four. This week's, why
don't I do two and two? Let's do that.

423
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:52,060
All right, let's get back to
the thing here. Um, all right.

424
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,700
Uh, oh today as I'm rushing
through this fucking podcast,

425
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,270
um, I'm having somebody coming
over looking at my garage today,

426
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,580
I even have to whisper this shit.
I somehow talked my wife into, uh,

427
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:07,990
you know,

428
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,160
allowing me to have just have somebody
come over and take a look at the garage.

429
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,370
And I know I did that a couple months
back, but then I got busy but now I,

430
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,110
I got the person coming back again and uh,

431
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,540
I'm actually using her skills,

432
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,540
you know, that she does with me.
That's how I ended up with the dog.

433
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,860
Like we're not getting this dog.

434
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,880
We just were a fostering the dog for a
couple of days cause she knew that I'd

435
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,160
fallen in love with the fucking
dog and then that would be yet.

436
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,990
So it's kind of like when you first
start start dating a woman, um,

437
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,500
you know, when she wants a relationship,
when she comes over to your apartment,

438
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,471
which she starts to do,

439
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:47,280
is she leave shit there cause it
gives her an excuse to come back.

440
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,640
I mean it's fucking nuts, right? Like
they're thinking that far ahead. All,

441
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:54,000
you're sitting there like, oh, look
at those dirt or the fucker. Right.

442
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:56,220
That's all you're thinking. And
they're sitting there plotting,

443
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:57,660
you know what I mean?

444
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,740
It's like you're some fucking head coach
that has no game plan and she's across

445
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,640
the field like fucking Bill Walsh calling
the first 25 plays of the game. Right?

446
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,180
Oh, I love a football life. There's
a nice reference to use. Um,

447
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,990
so, you know, it's fucking hilarious.

448
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,860
And speaking with the Patrice O'Neal
benefits coming up, once again, uh,

449
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,020
I'll tell you a quick Patrice story. Um,

450
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:25,430
he was so fucking brilliant that I
remember he was dating this woman and you

451
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:27,660
know, uh, whatever,

452
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,430
seeing her and she started leaving
shit around his house and I,

453
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:34,230
and it just had brought that up. I go,
yeah, you know, I did this for me. No,

454
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,950
she left this shit here and she left
there. It's like, what the fuck? You know,

455
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I only see you like, you know, once
every two weeks. He just has shit there.

456
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:47,001
So for two weeks I keep looking at her
fucking brush or the shampoo she left or

457
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,890
whatever. And it's just, I keep
thinking about it and it's annoying me

458
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,500
and Patrice just goes,
Ecos, so throw it out.

459
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,220
I go, what? He goes, throw it out. I
go, I can't throw it a brush. He goes,

460
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:05,790
I would like, go get the fuck out.
He goes, yeah. He goes, I did that.

461
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,490
They told me a story. Well,

462
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:13,491
there was a woman he was messing around
with and she left these toiletries and a

463
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:18,900
little bag of like, you know,
makeup and brush and all that eddy.

464
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,150
He fucking threw it out.

465
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:27,050
And then he came back like a week and
a half later and she goes to go in the

466
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,330
bathroom and she's like
a, she's like, Hey,

467
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,400
what did you do with my a my stuff? He
goes, and he just plays dumb. He goes,

468
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:39,780
what stuff? She goes, I left shampoo
here, I a little makeup bag. He goes,

469
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:41,250
Oh yeah, I was yours. Yeah. He goes, yeah.

470
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,050
He threw it out and she was
like literally beside herself,

471
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,340
but actually on some level respected him
for like fucking realizing what she was

472
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:54,744
doing.

473
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,430
And then also I think because that early
on he clearly let her know in a very

474
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:07,280
funny fucking way that he wasn't
looking for a relationship and uh,

475
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,090
that she was able to relax and
kind of be thinking that, oh,

476
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,080
we're just fucking all right. I wanted
a little more, he doesn't at least,

477
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:20,730
but he let us know so fucking early
on that it didn't really hurt,

478
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,360
you know? Does that make sense? I mean,
I don't, maybe I'm speaking for her,

479
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:29,010
but I guess I am, but whatever. Either
way it was fucking funny, you know,

480
00:29:29,011 --> 00:29:30,540
Jesus was that the fucking worse.

481
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,040
I literally just jumped out of the plane
and pulled the fucking ripcord on that

482
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:37,170
story. Sorry. It's been a while.

483
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:40,650
It's been a while since I told that
story as it, I have, I told it before.

484
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,450
I don't fucking know. So anyways,
so I'm kind of using, um, my,

485
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,640
the same fucking tricks that my wife used
that got me the dog I'm using with her

486
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,800
because, um, we're gonna like, hey,
why am I whispering here? Like,

487
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:01,801
she can't just listen to the fucking
podcast fucking he that sometimes like how

488
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,780
dumb I am. It just really
fucking, so anyways,

489
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,370
what I want to do is I have this
old school fucking, you know,

490
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:14,371
my house is built in 1923 so the garage
whenever it was fucking built was built,

491
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,013
um,

492
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,910
to house like a fucking model t Ford
kind of car and those things for those

493
00:30:21,911 --> 00:30:25,750
things, you sat inside the fucking wheel
wells, you know what I mean? If you,

494
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,810
if you look at old cars, um,

495
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,710
you know how the fenders used to flare
out and then there was just the engine

496
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,540
and you know,

497
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:39,290
you sat like literally like
right behind basically what you,

498
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:42,130
you sat in the, I can't, I don't know
if I, if I'm explaining correctly,

499
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,760
you know what I mean? You sitting inside
the fucking wheel wheel wells, right?

500
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,090
Not like literally in them,

501
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,120
but as far as like the line
down the side of the car, right.

502
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:52,720
Like if you stuck your head out and
you didn't have any fenders on it,

503
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:57,190
you'd be looking at the fucking
tire. Right. As opposed to, you know,

504
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:00,910
the fucking road. I know all you
guys know what I'm talking about.

505
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,620
And it also goes to show you like how
fucking fat and big people have gotten,

506
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,210
you know what I mean? Two things.

507
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:10,360
If you ever go to Mount Vernon and you
go to Thomas Jefferson's house and you

508
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:14,170
have to duck underneath
the fucking, uh, the, uh,

509
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,730
the fuck, do you come the doorframes
you see how much taller people are.

510
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:20,860
And then when you look at
those old fucking cars,

511
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,050
the fact that two adults could sit side
by side like that and it wouldn't be

512
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,850
the, probably won't even touching
each other, you know. So anyways,

513
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,360
what I'm trying to say is that my, uh,

514
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:36,310
my garage is long and skinny
and it's like high up,

515
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,550
you know, and uh,

516
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,760
and then it kind of flares out at the
back as it kind of wraps around the back

517
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:44,170
of the house a little
bit. So what I wanna do,

518
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,040
the front part is long enough for
me to squeeze my truck in there.

519
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,250
Um, but then in the back,

520
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:54,430
what I want to do is I want to
turn that into like a little gym,

521
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,320
which my wife has all four. And then
I'm also pitching that I build the,

522
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:02,200
maybe a little drum room
that could actually,

523
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,760
I got this drum kit that I bought that
I have in cases that if I want to play

524
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:09,220
it, I have to throw it in the truck
and drive it down to a studio.

525
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,030
I'm thinking of making, building
like a room within a room,

526
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,500
which will add no value to
the house unless I someday
sell it to another fucking

527
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:20,840
drummer who also whispers
on his own fucking podcasts.

528
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,310
Like his wife can't hear it. Fuck it.
I'm still whispering. You know why?

529
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:24,790
You know why?

530
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:29,140
Because the guys coming in like a half
hour and my wife is asleep downstairs.

531
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:30,490
If she hears me yelling about it,

532
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:35,720
I might have to have this argument sooner
than I'm prepared to have it. So, um,

533
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:40,040
that is the game plan. And like a
couple months back I bought those colds.

534
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,560
Um, you know, all those things like
though that American Ninja Shit,

535
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:47,180
so down downstairs in the garage,

536
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:50,870
I want to just have those hanging from
the ceiling so I can do all of that grip

537
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:52,940
strength shit that I want to
get better at. By the way,

538
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:56,820
I fucking started working out for the
first time in forever and I went to Duke.

539
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Go do pullups. Holy Shit. I
literally felt like as like,

540
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:03,720
do I have sandbags in my pockets?
What the fuck's going on?

541
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,550
I did six good ones and whimpered through
the last four. I always try to do 10.

542
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,360
I can't even fucking do
it. It's pathetic. Um,

543
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:14,870
so that's like the big exciting
thing in my life right now.

544
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:18,350
And I got to kind of get
this thing going, um,

545
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,860
before my wife wakes up and find
something else to do in the house.

546
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,220
You know, maybe, I don't know.
So anyways, by the way, people,

547
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:33,220
I'm doing a Gig in a Vancouver,
I'm doing a Gig in Vancouver,

548
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,260
uh, Canada this Sunday
night, alas, second one.

549
00:33:37,261 --> 00:33:41,430
That was added because I left my January
open because I'm still waiting to hear

550
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:43,080
about a season two.

551
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,470
We meet with Netflix this week to
pitch them our ideas for season two.

552
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,030
Uh, so if you've already
watched F is for family.

553
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,960
I thank you so much cause you've got
me to at least getting the meeting.

554
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,200
So we'll see a, we will see what
happens. It's um, with that and um,

555
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,400
so I hadn't booked
anything, um, in January.

556
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:10,120
So now we're having some last
second gigs, um, coming up.

557
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:13,060
I'm going to do a Gig in Vancouver this
Sunday and then I'm going to do a couple

558
00:34:13,061 --> 00:34:17,620
of dates, one or two dates I think right
before the Patrice O'Neal benefit, um,

559
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,230
in the tristate area. We're still,

560
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm trying to fucking iron those
things out as we speak. Jesus Christ.

561
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,740
Bill, spit it out. All right, let's get
to the, uh, the questions of this week.

562
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,550
Uh, all right. Inbox, inbox, inbox.

563
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:38,710
Where's the content? Here's the
con. No, I had it on the other page.

564
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,160
What am I doing? Oh there we go. All
right, Bill Patriots first. Kansas City.

565
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,080
Hello there. Mr. Bird. How's it going?
Your freckled cut there. How are Ya?

566
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,520
Uh, hope your holidays were just
peachy. Same to Cleo and Nia. Uh,

567
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,521
today I just wanted to hear your honest
and objective thoughts about the matchup

568
00:34:57,551 --> 00:35:00,070
between your paths and
my chiefs this weekend.

569
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,580
I was just listening to
your podcast from 12,

570
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:06,670
seven 15 we'll you said
Casey won't when Shit,

571
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,600
somebody tweeted me that I said
that I talked so much trash.

572
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,820
I don't even remember saying that. Uh,

573
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:17,080
and I'm content that you may eat those
words this week. Oh, absolutely. Oh,

574
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,980
I absolutely might eat those words
this week. Uh, but having said,

575
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,990
I think I might, what
Casey, what, when Shit is,

576
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:26,020
you're not gonna win the Super Bowl.
That's what I mean. My pick is, uh,

577
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,330
the Seattle Seahawks,
which is not really a,

578
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,640
it's not really a genius pics
by any stretch of the means.

579
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,420
They've been there two fucking
years in a row. Um, I mean,

580
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,550
didn't they win yesterday
without Marshawn Lynch?

581
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,000
I was running back and forth
trying to make lasagna noodles. Uh,

582
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:48,120
as far as I know, I didn't
see Marshawn lynch in there.

583
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,530
My wife was also clicking back and forth
to like the fucking Golden Globes. So,

584
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,330
um, I just know that they,
uh, now when I wait, that was,

585
00:35:57,331 --> 00:36:01,050
that was the earlier one. Do,
do you know yesterday I watched,

586
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:05,070
I watched fucking Ohio state, Indiana.

587
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,900
I watched two playoff football games
and I watched half of a Celtic game and

588
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,370
fell asleep was fucking ridiculous.

589
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:15,870
So I'm trying to remember what the
fuck I saw this weekend. But, um, no,

590
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:20,190
I don't think it's going to be an easy,
uh, listen, I've got to tell you this.

591
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:24,060
If we were fucking healthy, we would
kick the shit out of you. All right?

592
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:28,290
If we actually had an offensive line and
Edelman was back and Amygdala was back,

593
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:32,610
we had a fucking running game and
a way we, we've, we were healthy.

594
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,480
This is no fucking contest at home.
You know it and I know it right now,

595
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,940
Brady is driving a fucking rental car.

596
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:41,700
So you might go in there and beat us
and then you're going to get all fucking

597
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:45,120
excited and loud. And then, you
know what? I don't know. You know,

598
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,760
why would I root against you guys?
Hey, you know what, you guys, heck,

599
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,950
you guys haven't won since
what? 1970 all right.

600
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:57,740
What was that? Uh, what was
that fucking Hank stream call

601
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,530
power trap. Cross 57 five nine five.
What the fuck was that thing called?

602
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:07,630
I don't remember. You guys have an
a. When you beat the fucking Vikings,

603
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:13,270
Jesus Christ going way
back. You beat the AFL team.

604
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:16,030
That fucking sold up. Maybe
that's why they're cursed.

605
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,990
Maybe that's why they've lost one or
they lose three, three, four Superbowls.

606
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,010
Three Superbowls. Right? They
lost to the fucking chiefs.

607
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,710
They lost to the packages.
They lost to the dolphins.

608
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:34,330
Any loss to the Steelers. Is that right?
Wait, the dolphins lost to the cowboys.

609
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:40,360
Then they beat the vikings
and they beat the Redskins.

610
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,570
That's right. She speak the vikings.

611
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,500
Green Baby. The chiefs.

612
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,430
They didn't beat the Raiders, did
they? They beat the Vikings. Right now.

613
00:37:57,431 --> 00:38:01,480
The Vikings would have been in the NFL
by then. I don't fucking or whatever.

614
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:03,560
You lost like fucking three of
them. Maybe because you'd get,

615
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,810
you didn't stick with the AFL
guys. Does that make any sense?

616
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,140
Whatever. Good luck to the chiefs this
week. A good luck to the Patriots.

617
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:15,790
Obviously my heart is with the Patriots,
but uh, you know, I don't know.

618
00:38:15,791 --> 00:38:18,340
I didn't like, like that dolphins
game where every time Brady,

619
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:20,130
the few times he went back to past,

620
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,250
there was just somebody right in
his grill every fucking time. Um,

621
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,190
but whatever the end of the fucking day,

622
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:30,280
we have the greatest fucking quarterback
and coach of all fucking time.

623
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:33,820
So go fuck yourself. I think
we're gonna beat you. All right.

624
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:37,390
It'd be no fun if I said good luck
to you guys. So fuck you guys.

625
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,900
You don't stand a chance
there. Now if you beat me,

626
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,100
you got something to talk about,

627
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:44,710
then he could trash me and I can fill
out a fucking hour next week on the

628
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:48,400
podcast. Um, alright. Drive
to school. Oh, by the way,

629
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,190
Alabama. Clemson, I have no, I
don't know shit about either team.

630
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,000
I was so fucking busy in the fall.
I didn't get to watch any of it,

631
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,540
but of course, um, I, I
wouldn't care if Alabama won,

632
00:39:05,541 --> 00:39:08,860
but Clemson hasn't won in a while, so
I'd love to see them win. However, if,

633
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,990
if Alabama wins, it just makes

634
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:18,550
the Cleveland Brown's futility even
funnier to me because the dumbest fucking

635
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:19,820
move ever.

636
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,020
Do you realize that they
had bill Belichick and Nick
Saban coaching their team

637
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,490
and they fired them?

638
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,223
Okay.

639
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,380
The VUS, the fucking Paul Brown,

640
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,360
Vince Lombardi of the modern day
NFL and the Paul Brown bear Bryant,

641
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,470
Vince Lombardi,

642
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,910
okay.

643
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,160
Of NCAA Division One football.

644
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:43,220
They had them both coaching together

645
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,340
and they fired the CEO of
Alabama. As a Cleveland Brown fan,

646
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:54,080
you have to be rooting for
Clemson. You just have to,

647
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:57,950
you guys have had enough
fucking pain. Right? Who knows?

648
00:39:57,951 --> 00:40:00,980
Maybe Lebron can get you over
the hump this year, you know, uh,

649
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,950
I always root for Cleveland. Like
I said, I have relatives, you know,

650
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,330
family that grew up out there
and all that type of shit. I, uh,

651
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,860
actually love Cleveland. So, um,
however, I also love a good joke.

652
00:40:09,861 --> 00:40:12,410
So if Alabama wins tonight,
it'll still be funny. Anyways,

653
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,630
continue on drive to school. Hey Bill,

654
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,480
I've been a fan of yours since
the ona days and Chappelle show.

655
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,710
Somewhere along the line I had a kid
and he's old enough to listen to some of

656
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:25,880
your podcasts. Uh, I listened to
it with him on the drive to school.

657
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,710
I listened to the whole episode before
beforehand and cut out any of the stuff

658
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:35,570
that is a bit heavy or sexual. Uh,
Jesus, you're fucking great dad.

659
00:40:35,571 --> 00:40:40,190
When you start editing their content,
you know, look at you, you're a regular,

660
00:40:40,191 --> 00:40:43,610
typical a not because I'm sheltering him,

661
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:46,100
but because he and I don't need,

662
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,970
don't need share certain podcasts
moments. When you talk of Ges in uh,

663
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:55,710
in some skank before 8:00 AM exactly.
Let the kid have a childhood, uh,

664
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,260
trying to keep it light and positive
with the exception of the funny negative.

665
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,010
Anyways, I wanted to tell you that
it's the best thing we got going.

666
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:07,880
We listened to about 15 minutes a day.
It puts him and I in a laughing mood,

667
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:10,790
which he needs schools,
a lot of work these days.

668
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:14,600
And he always got a ton of homework and
projects and his dragon in the morning.

669
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,680
This wakes him up.

670
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:19,820
Sometimes we pause and talk about certain
things or I'll explain certain stuff

671
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:23,360
to him about politics, sports, et
cetera. Yeah. In other words, correct.

672
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,990
The dumb shit that I said,
all that father son stuff.

673
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,330
Thanks for the parental
assist. Oh, that's great.

674
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:33,320
Who would ever thought my
ignorance could be had? Warman

675
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,110
uh, anyways, uh,

676
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,230
I'm already regretting fucking making
funny Ricky Gervais' why did I do that

677
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:45,830
shit? But you know, I mean, he's
making fun of everybody on the show.

678
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:47,150
It's only fair, right.

679
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,040
Does showing up with fucking acceptance
speeches and he's got all those fucking

680
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:55,040
zingers at him and his writing
staff wrote, it's only fair.

681
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,400
That's why I like Mel Gibson.
Mel Gibson gave him shit back.

682
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,570
I don't understand why people
just go out and smiling.

683
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,930
They should fucking trash them.
A vasectomy. Ah, dear bill,

684
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,290
I don't want to get a
vasectomy. I just don't.

685
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,890
My wife and anyone else who chimes in
on this subject started trying to break

686
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:16,690
down positives and point out
the lack of negatives ever.

687
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:19,400
Just not want something.
I just don't want one.

688
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:24,430
Can you believe this or you with everyone
else that it must be rooted in some

689
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:28,700
fear, et cetera. Fuck
that dude. Fuck that.

690
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,260
Are you fucking kidding me?

691
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,650
Do you think you could fucking tell a
woman what the fuck to do with their body

692
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:37,160
for two seconds before she just said
you're a, you're a chauvinistic cunt.

693
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,960
Yeah, Dude. Fuck that.
Fuck that all day long.

694
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,190
That's your fucking Dick and
balls. All right. You got that.

695
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:47,060
They fuck with your Dick.

696
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,940
If you don't fucking want them
to go in there and snip, snip,

697
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:53,360
whatever the fuck I've even looked up
the operation, I still don't get it.

698
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:58,280
I don't get it. Nothing comes out.

699
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,970
So does it stop your
ability to make choices?

700
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,300
Do they put an utter down there where
you got to milk the ges out as well?

701
00:43:05,301 --> 00:43:08,780
That's disgusting. I don't get, I
don't get what happens, but fuck that.

702
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,530
Fuck that. Fuck that. Just just
sit down with you. I say, listen,

703
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,520
I don't want to do that. And she'll be
like, why? Why not you? You're just,

704
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:21,280
you're just fear based.
It's like, no it isn't.

705
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,770
I don't want to be walking
around and like, dude,

706
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,730
you know what that's like.

707
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,850
You like a muscle car and they want to
rip the engine out and put a fucking v6

708
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,790
in there. Fuck you and keep you a
Shelby badge on the side of your car.

709
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:42,290
And every day in the morning you wake
up standing there looking at yourself

710
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:47,230
after you got out of the shower knowing
that it's a lie. Fuck that dude.

711
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,870
Fuck. Do you keep the bullets in that
gun? Alright, she can't handle it.

712
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,470
You know I, you know, what
is she going to do to you?

713
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,170
Huh? She gonna hold you down and make
while someone else does it just, yeah,

714
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:04,550
you don't want one dude.

715
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,690
You don't want one to the level you're
reaching out to a fucking podcast.

716
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:14,280
Okay. Do you understand that? Would
even use that in your argument?

717
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:18,450
Just be like, but I don't play this
audio though. I would just say, listen,

718
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,920
I so do not want to do this
that I actually wrote into
a podcast to get advice.

719
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,790
That's how much I don't want to do this.
And then she'll just be like, well,

720
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,040
maybe we need to go
talk somebody about it,

721
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,790
which means she's going to set up an
appointment with somebody who agrees with

722
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:40,020
her. Okay. All right. Cause she's going
to set up the appointment call. Listen,

723
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,470
my husband needs to get a
vasectomy. He's very nervous.

724
00:44:43,471 --> 00:44:44,910
He says he doesn't want to get it,

725
00:44:44,911 --> 00:44:48,390
but it's gotta be the best for us and
she's going to totally set the fucking

726
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:51,780
table. It's like those dumb
fucks that go on, Doctor Phil,

727
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,560
do you have a c those said sacks that
go on that fucking show with their wife.

728
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,570
Like they have a fucking prayer
doctor. Phil's audience is women.

729
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,550
So he's going to have to side with the
woman every fucking time. Even if he,

730
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:08,410
you know, he's going
to try that, you know,

731
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,570
hide his hand and give
her a little bit of Shit.

732
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:13,210
But at the end of the day he's
going to be looking at you go,

733
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,920
you need to get your balls snipped right.

734
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,790
He's got to come at you like that
while he sits there, you know,

735
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:27,110
with his junk still fucking work. You
know, he's got a giant fucking unit.

736
00:45:27,111 --> 00:45:31,160
Doesn't he do that big fucking Goof, that
big bold goof. Walk it down the hall.

737
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:36,200
I, you know, he's got a fucking
giant fucking unit. Big Greg.

738
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:39,830
Great Dane balls. I don't know why.

739
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,350
I think he's got a fucking giant
unit. He does. He's just like,

740
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,290
he's just dirt. But the
way he talks, he's just,

741
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,420
God always gives them big dicks.
It just, I don't know what it is.

742
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:54,823
Um,

743
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,900
well the giant size 16 brown wooden
wingtips just sitting across from you.

744
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,540
That's gotta be the worst fucking
show ever to be on. Oh my God.

745
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,170
I never thought about doctor Phil's junk
before you see that it takes somebody

746
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:18,060
to fucking bring up a vasectomy, you'll
never be able to think about them again.

747
00:46:18,061 --> 00:46:22,770
Megan, my big Dick say, you
need to listen to your wife.

748
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,480
All right. Jumping out
of a plane. Hey Bill,

749
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,880
where are you at on
jumping out of a plane? Uh,

750
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:34,740
if you're a chicken shit
American, I'm a Brit.

751
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,920
How much money would it take you to jump?

752
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,110
Uh,

753
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:45,110
I got a bet with my mate that you hate
heights and it take 500,000 US dollars.

754
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,990
Don't change your answer to be contrary
to what I just guess. Keep it fair.

755
00:46:51,991 --> 00:46:55,950
Good sir. Thanks a Jesus.
Another arrogant Brit.

756
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,540
These guys think they're
fucking geniuses. Um,

757
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,280
I've already done it. You fucking
idiot. And I paid someone to do it.

758
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,370
Paid. I went to a in Pepperell,

759
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:13,371
Massachusetts when I was 19 years old
and I didn't do a tandem jump either.

760
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:17,070
I did a static line jump. I've told
this story on the podcast, sir,

761
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,360
if you're a little bit, um, more up on it.

762
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,650
Uh, and also I have a pilot's
license. I fly helicopters.

763
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:30,160
So if I afraid of heights,

764
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,660
I mean I'm afraid of heights. Look,

765
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,460
if I don't have a parachute on my
back and I'm not in a, in a, uh,

766
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:40,900
in a vehicle that's designed to fly, okay,

767
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,480
then yes, I'm afraid of
heights. Like, I don't like, uh,

768
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:48,810
you know, like if he should,

769
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:53,400
like one time I watched the youtube video
and they just showed these guys that

770
00:47:53,401 --> 00:47:56,240
had the climb up to the top
of this fucking building

771
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,453
and then,

772
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,080
no, no claims. That was it. They took
the elevator, who's getting hope? They,

773
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,380
they, they were on the roof and it
was already on the fucking roof.

774
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,100
This building was so fucking
high up and you know,

775
00:48:10,101 --> 00:48:11,810
the wind up there must be ridiculous.

776
00:48:11,811 --> 00:48:15,680
I would literally just lay down in the
fetal position and crawl back to the

777
00:48:15,681 --> 00:48:18,320
fucking door that leads to the stairwell,

778
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:23,000
reach up to the handle and
fucking go back down. But this,

779
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:25,460
this dude, um,

780
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,850
then climbs the fucking, the, the,

781
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:34,870
the whatever though though the radio tower
or whatever and it just keeps getting

782
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:40,030
higher and higher and higher in the tower
gets smaller and smaller and smaller

783
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,380
and he's hooking and unhooking
his safety line. I literally,

784
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,290
I couldn't find,

785
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:51,350
I mean obviously the guy lives cause it's
his GoPro on his helmet and I've never

786
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:55,870
been so fucking unsettled watching
something in my life. Okay.

787
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,530
Then I would hate heights. But I think
at that point everybody hates heights.

788
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:04,510
But, um, yeah, when I was 19 years
old, I went to a, this place,

789
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:07,300
uh, in Pepperell, Massachusetts,
which I don't think exists anymore.

790
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:11,860
They might still be an airport
there and they had a, a, a school.

791
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,420
And uh, I did the static line jump,
if you've ever seen that movie,

792
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:20,380
a Fandango when Kevin
Costner's earlier ones

793
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:26,080
were the dude from a breakfast
club, uh, Judd Nelson,

794
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,910
his character jumps out.

795
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,460
Okay.

796
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,750
Um, that's exactly what I did.
And I remember when we went up,

797
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:37,750
the command was sit in the door, get out,

798
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:40,060
and then he slapped you on
the shoulder and said, go.

799
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,013
And uh,

800
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,280
I remember when he said sit in the door.
I thought he was saying close the door.

801
00:49:47,281 --> 00:49:50,130
So I was reaching up, I'm sitting down,
reaching out, trying to close the door,

802
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:52,920
and he had this big smile on his face.
Like he thought I was chickening out.

803
00:49:52,921 --> 00:49:57,921
I feel like I just told this story on
the podcast and then if I really thought

804
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:59,070
he was saying, sit in the door.

805
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:03,400
So you sit in the door and basically
it's one of those planes where the,

806
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,140
the wing is above the aircraft.
Do you know what I mean?

807
00:50:07,141 --> 00:50:09,720
It's on top of the aircraft
as opposed to below,

808
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:12,320
which actually gives you a much
better site I would think. Um,

809
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,970
as far as if you wanted to look down. Um,

810
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:18,810
and then there's the support that
goes to the side of the plane. So,

811
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,300
and then right above one
of the landing wheels,

812
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:25,800
the wheels don't retract on this plane.
They had a welded, a little step.

813
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,110
So you sat the fucking door

814
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:35,600
and a, I forget how high we were at
going to say we will only like 1500.

815
00:50:35,601 --> 00:50:39,890
We weren't that high up because you
shoot immediately comes out. Um,

816
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:43,190
so you said you sit in the door,

817
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,880
then he goes get out and then what you
do is you reach out and you grab that

818
00:50:46,881 --> 00:50:51,881
support beam from the wing and you hold
onto that while one of your feet is,

819
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,740
uh, is standing on that little step
thing. And then basically what you do is,

820
00:50:57,741 --> 00:51:01,390
I'm literally acting this out so I can
remember it, is you then basically you,

821
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,920
you bend your arms and
you bring your chest,

822
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:08,510
like flush with the support
beam and then the, the,

823
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,260
the foot that's dangling, you
put it straight out behind you.

824
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:16,070
It's almost like a yoga pose. So
it was sit in the door, get out,

825
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:20,450
and then he slaps your shoulder
and he goes, go and you let go.

826
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,460
And then you, you arch you arc,
right? Arc One arc, 1002, 1003,

827
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:29,270
1000. Look, if nothing look reached
Paul. And when you're looking,

828
00:51:29,271 --> 00:51:32,510
you're looking over your, your
shoulder to see if you shoot came out.

829
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,830
And then if nothing you
looked down at the handle,

830
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,720
reach, pull it. Cause for some reason
they say if you don't look down,

831
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:45,200
you might be flailing
because you're panicking.

832
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,160
Cause it's the first time you jumped
in, the shoot didn't come out. Sorry.

833
00:51:49,161 --> 00:51:51,980
Cayenne pepper Ra. Hang on a second.

834
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,830
So anyways, I get out,

835
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,020
he goes, go, I let go. And
instead of arching ice,

836
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,080
I don't know what I did. I
just reached for something.

837
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:11,290
All I know is I started doing front foot
front flips as my shoop was coming out

838
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,580
and I felt it go by my
leg, the inside of my leg,

839
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,140
I felt it go by my leg.

840
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:22,760
I felt something hit that and I was
immediately thinking, oh my God,

841
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:25,070
I'm going to roll right up
in this fucking thing. Like,

842
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,970
you know when you put Bacon on shrimp
and a the second I had that thought like

843
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,820
the shoot already had come out.

844
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:38,360
And by the grace of God
I didn't get tangled up.

845
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,190
I think about that sometimes. Like
how easily I could have fucking died.

846
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,530
Um, and then boom, your shoot comes
out and when you shoot comes out,

847
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,100
you don't even feel like you're falling
because there's nothing going past you.

848
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:53,990
Cause you're above the
treeline and all that.

849
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:57,800
So you just feel like you just
sort of suspended in the air.

850
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,540
And uh, there was a radio and this
lady just talked to you and she say,

851
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:05,100
pull the left toggle and you had to
pull it all the way down to your knee.

852
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:06,103
Cause I remember there was this,

853
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,920
this big girl in the class and she
couldn't get it around her hips and she

854
00:53:09,921 --> 00:53:13,340
landed across the street in a pile
of loom in a dislocated her knee.

855
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,300
I remember that before. And then I went
up after her and I was just like, fuck.

856
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,380
Um, and then they have this ridiculous,

857
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,470
you know when you get to the treeline
you suddenly realize how fast you're

858
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:29,370
falling. I think it was like 17
feet per second or maybe 11 feet.

859
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:32,460
I can't remember. But it was really
fast. It was like basically, you know,

860
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,560
jumping off of a, of a basketball
rim. Like how fast you'd come down.

861
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,590
It had to be a little bit
slower, right? No, no.

862
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,840
Cause you're not reaching terminal
velocity. I don't fucking know.

863
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:44,380
So all I know is when you hit the ground,

864
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:48,210
where you were supposed to do is look
straight ahead because for some reason if

865
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:50,550
you look down at your feet,
what you were going to do,

866
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:53,430
they were worried you'd pick your feet
up too quickly and somehow break your

867
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,180
legs.

868
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:59,100
So what you had to do is look straight
ahead and as right as you hit the ground,

869
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,180
you supposed to do this little fucking
like collapsed down and then this big

870
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:03,931
ridiculous,

871
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:07,980
bring your both your legs straight up
in the air and then over to your side.

872
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,110
I don't know why. I doubt that they
still have people do that. And I did.

873
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:17,790
What everybody else did is I came down
and the second my feet hit the ground,

874
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:22,791
I did a face plant right into the
grass and my buddy grabbed the,

875
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,130
uh, the Mike from the person who called
me a Dickhead, something like that.

876
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:30,210
What a dick hit or something in
the um, in the, in the radio.

877
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,710
Um, so yeah, there you go. So I did it.

878
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:39,210
And what are you basing chicken
shit. American not, Huh? Oh,

879
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:43,410
you tough guys over there with your
fish and chips. Have you done it yet?

880
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,490
500 euros. I, there's nothing you can
sub. If I don't want to do something,

881
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,740
I wouldn't do it. There's not money that
you can give me and all. He goes, oh,

882
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,950
you fuck a break now I'm making
great money. I got enough money,

883
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,590
I got enough money. I'm good to take
my life in my fucking hands. Now.

884
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:06,690
That's one of those things. Now, I was
back working at the warehouse. I mean,

885
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:11,430
granted I pay somebody when I was
working in a fucking warehouse, I a shit,

886
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:16,010
you know, let's see. How much would
they, I mean, if they gave me,

887
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,760
literally, if you gave me $400, you
would've doubled my pay for the week.

888
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:25,940
So I would have done
that. Well, let's see,

889
00:55:25,941 --> 00:55:29,330
let's go back to the building
to climb up dead building.

890
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,970
How much money would
they have to give me a,

891
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:36,670
when I was working in
the warehouse, uh, $800.

892
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,813
Um,

893
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,120
and that now for that, that
building, uh, I would say, uh,

894
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,750
yeah, I just wouldn't do it. That's,
no, I'm all right. I'm all set.

895
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,800
I'm all set. I, you know, I should
actually send you guys dead video.

896
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,990
Um,

897
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:57,600
so it's not that I hate
heights, sir. I hate,

898
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,580
I'm risking my life to that level.

899
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,830
If there's like a parachute
or something like that,

900
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:10,140
it is a bungee cord or there's like
a fucking safety line, that's fine.

901
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:10,650
But you know,

902
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,190
going up that tower where I have to unhook
the safety line and then hook it back

903
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:17,610
up and there's wind and shit. Fuck
that. That's too much of a risk.

904
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:18,444
I wouldn't do that.

905
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,850
You know? Fuck.

906
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,210
Why do I even want to fucking talk
about college cooking dear Billy boy.

907
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:34,270
Oh, that's a great one. What a great
one. Bill. Billy Paul. Yeah. D.

908
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,620
Oh fuck. I gotta wrap this up. This
guy's coming in 12 minutes. Uh,

909
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,590
I'm sure everyone is blowing you
up to make another cooking video,

910
00:56:41,591 --> 00:56:44,410
so don't worry. This isn't
that I'm a college student.

911
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:48,580
I know you've lived like a college
student into your early thirties.

912
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,180
From past stories about living
with Bobby Kelly. Oh Dude.

913
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:55,360
We weren't living like college students.
We will live in like fucking animals.

914
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:00,490
Uh, do you have any menu
suggestions besides pasta?

915
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:04,930
What would you mix together? I'm pretty
current creative, and I do all right,

916
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:06,820
but I'm open to some suggestions.

917
00:57:06,821 --> 00:57:10,630
What's good to throw together on a
budget and on a fly. You know what dude?

918
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,590
I would go to, um, I would,
this is what I would do.

919
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:18,970
I would go on Youtube and I would ask
that question and you'll find videos and

920
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:19,990
then just start searching.

921
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:24,610
And at some point you're going to connect
with somebody. And I feel like I'm,

922
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:30,610
you know, dropping the ball here on
the question, but like I'm not a chef.

923
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,080
I'm not even a cook. I'm really
early on this to this myself.

924
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:39,190
So that's what I would do. There's
a bunch of old episodes of Mario,

925
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,000
Mario Batali's, multiple
Mario, m. O. L. T. O, Mario.

926
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,890
Um, I really suggest watching
those. Just watch the guy.

927
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:51,430
I used to just watch the
show and just by watching it,

928
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:56,380
you learn things and you start
to see how things are made. Um,

929
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:02,400
and, and, uh, the big thing is
not having, you just have to, to,

930
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:07,320
to learn shit in life. You got to have
the, the mindset of like, I'm gonna,

931
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:10,090
you know, I'm going to fuck
this up probably the first time.

932
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,540
And that's all right. And then I'll get
a little better like the pasta already.

933
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,790
Just even just running it through the
pasta maker. I already have like three,

934
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:21,400
three fucking things that I'm not
going to do the next time. Um,

935
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,170
and by the way, somebody
gave me a great tip when you,

936
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:27,160
after you find needed the dope and
you put it through your pasta maker,

937
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:32,020
be sure to douse like both sides with
flour, be liberal with the flour.

938
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,760
Cause if you don't it's going to tear.

939
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,090
It could tear when you're in there cause
it's supposed to be like sticky and

940
00:58:37,091 --> 00:58:40,930
elastic at the same time. And uh,
when you run it through there,

941
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:43,950
um, yeah you could,

942
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:47,530
you could possibly have some issues and
it tears then it's a big fucking pain in

943
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:50,800
the ass. And then he gets sad. You feel
like a fucking failure and you're not,

944
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,680
he had the balls to
try it. So I would, uh,

945
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,070
I go that Rachel Ray's got a great bunch
of great ones from back in the day.

946
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:59,350
Everybody always makes fun of
her, but she wouldn't, she,

947
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:02,680
I made 20 minute meals. He did
little fucking lab. She'd do.

948
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:04,060
I used to watch your shit all the time.

949
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,300
That's great shit for
probably where you're at.

950
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,750
But I would also Google
some stuff like that. Um,

951
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,400
but it's great as a college student,
if you start to learn how to cook,

952
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,200
if you start to learn how to cook
right now and you do it religiously,

953
00:59:20,201 --> 00:59:24,230
you are going to be a beast
compared to the average person.

954
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,660
Um, by the, by the time you're in
your thirties, dude, forget it.

955
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,460
If you add like shit,
like learning how to,

956
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,360
how to make a pie crust cause then
then you can make Turkey pot pie.

957
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,130
You can make key, she can
make all of this shit.

958
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,390
You start making homemade pasta.
Forget it. It's fucking over.

959
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:44,780
Then you learn how to do all this
other stuff. I forget what I mean.

960
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,560
I made it with Nia. I was really
concentrating on making the pasta.

961
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:51,980
She did the bowl and Aes and then
she did the whole milk sauce thing,

962
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,640
but I just was watching her do that
where you heated up some butter and some

963
00:59:55,641 --> 00:59:57,800
flour and then he heated up some milk.

964
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:02,330
Then you poured the whole thing together
instead of using like a ricotta cheese,

965
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:06,230
um, or any of that type of shit. Um,

966
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,890
you use this really rich milk
thing. It was almost too much.

967
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:12,530
The fucking dish was like, it
almost tasted like a dessert.

968
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:14,540
It was so fucking good. But, um,

969
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,550
I didn't know how to do
shit when I was your age.

970
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:21,260
So I think it's great that
you're doing it. Um, you know,

971
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:22,790
you want, how about Blue Apron?

972
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,870
Sign up for that shit and just, you know,

973
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:30,420
steal some of their meal ideas and
then expand on them. If there's a,

974
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,600
or if there's a style of
cooking that they give you,

975
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,560
then you go on Youtube and, uh,

976
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,370
you just start looking at recipes
about that. Like, you know what, I,

977
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:41,900
I don't know anything about,

978
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:46,700
which is weird because I loved the
food is any sort of Asian style, um,

979
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:51,260
cooking. I actually smoked some
ribs and I, and I had this, uh,

980
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:56,960
this dipping sauce that was like,
oh, uh, you know, whatever, uh,

981
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,880
Chinese or Japanese influenced, you know,

982
01:00:58,881 --> 01:01:01,460
with the fucking soy sauce
and all that. And it was,

983
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,820
and I was in a part of the grocery
store that I never went to.

984
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:09,290
And it was the shit. It
tasted great. And, um,

985
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,090
that's something I was
kinda thinking this year.

986
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:15,410
I want to get down pasta and
start to have some Asian, uh,

987
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:17,000
type dishes in there.

988
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:19,850
So if there's anybody out there that can
help me with that, I'd appreciate it.

989
01:01:19,851 --> 01:01:23,630
So anyways, the guys coming here in eight
minutes, I get to upload this fucker.

990
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,820
Um, I'll talk to you later.
