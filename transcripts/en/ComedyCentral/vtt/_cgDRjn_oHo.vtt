&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW COULD
OBAMA NOT BE THERE?

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:06.472
LOOK HOW MANY WORLD LEADERS
HE COULD HAVE BOWED DOWN TO

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:10.710
AND APOLOGIZED.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:11.811
HE COULD HAVE -- HE MISSED AN
OPPORTUNITY.

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:14.147
HOW COULD THE U.S. NOT BE THERE?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.383
WHEN REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH
BEACONS OF FREEDOM AND LACK

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:22.255

FLOGGED A BLOGGER.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.611
COULDN'T OBAMA HAVE AT LEAST
SENT A FRIEND?

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:48.314
&gt;&gt; ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:49.682
&gt;&gt; Jon: OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
THERE YOU GO.

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:50.750

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.418
I JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:55.221

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.432
&gt;&gt; ALTHOUGH ATTORNEY GENERAL
ERIC HOLDER WAS IN PARIS FOR

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:10.603
COUNTERTERRORISM MEETINGS,
HE DID NOT ATTEND THE MARCH.

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:12.271
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE [BLEEP]?

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:15.341
ERIC HOLDER, YOU

PROBABLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF
THE SHORTEST TOURIST LINES

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.551
IN FRENCH HISTORY.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:28.554
WHILE THE MARCH IS GOING ON
YOU'RE JUST KICKING BACK

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:32.959
SNAPPING SELFIES WITH THE MONA
LISA, STEALING CATACOMB BONES,

IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING?

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.932
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:43.236
 AN ENORMOUS GLOBAL RALLY IN
SUPPORTING FREEDOM OF

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:46.372
EXPRESSION AFTER ATTACK ON A
CLOSE ALLY AND THE U.S. WAS

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.375
A NO-SHOW?

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.478
