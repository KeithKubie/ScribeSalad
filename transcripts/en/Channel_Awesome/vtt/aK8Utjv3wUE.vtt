00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.700
As I get closer to the end of watching all these Disney sequels, I can say that, honestly,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.980
the most entertaining out of all of them is "Cinderella 3".

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.900
Yeah. I know, right? The third "Cinderella" movie? That's ridiculous!

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.000
Look at this opening! It doesn't even look like it's gonna be anything!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.540
It looks like a sequel even worse than the previous sequel!

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.820
But, when I was telling people I was gonna do all these Disney sequels, what I kept hearing over and over

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.260
is that "Cinderella 3" is good. "Wait 'till you get to 'Cinderella 3'. That's a good one."

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.640
And, for the most part, they're kinda right.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.460
Are there problems? Yeah, I guess that's sorta to be expected with any of the Disney sequels.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.520
Is it my favorite? No, but, again, its -- How do I put this? -- easily the most fun.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.720
Like I said before, it opens up kinda corny and chintzy with a goofy little song. Not really that impressive.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.440
But, suddenly, the villains return: the stepmother and the stepsisters.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.240
They come across the Fairy Godmother's magic wand, turn her to stone,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.980
and start going back in time to make it that the stepsister is the one that has the shoe that fits.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.580
Thus, everything is altered, Cinderella's left in the dust, and she doesn't have her happily ever after.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.380
The villains are taken to the palace,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.340
they hypnotize the prince into thinking that the sister was the one that he fell in love with,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.020
and it's up to Cinderella to sneak in there and convince him what's really going on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.760
without getting caught by the guards or the evil stepmother.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.300
On the one hand, this sounds incredibly forced and silly, and... yeah,  I guess it kind of is,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.480
but, for such a forced and silly idea, they do everything that they can with it.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.540
They realize that the most interesting characters are the villains, and there's a *lot* of time focused on them.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
Look at the drawings on them. Look at these closeups.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.540
They are just so devious, and they love every second that they're on screen, and so do we!

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.380
I remember there's a scene where Cinderella sneaks in as a servant, and she has her face covered,

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
and the stepmother is sort of looking at this reflection in the water, and she can kind of see her face,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.860
and I actually went, "Oh, no!" Which is amazing!

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.500
I actually said, "oh, no" during a "Cinderella" film, let alone a sequel. That's insane!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.960
But, on top of that, they actually give a lot of characters who didn't have much development

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.600
in the other films a lot more development.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.940
The king, for example, is more than just a guy who's bouncing up and down,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.640
saying, "Ah! Get me grandchildren!"

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.640
They make him this really sentimental guy who lost his wife years ago,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.000
and so he's passing on this piece of jewelry to the now daughter-in-law, and it's actually really sweet.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.180
One of the stepsisters is given a lot more development, too. And what makes this so clever

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.640
is that it actually ties into the second film, "Cinderella 2".

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.040
Yeah! That stupid sequel that nobody cared about. They actually have some things that tie into it.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.100
Not only is her character given a lot of depth and a story arc, but they even have characters

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.120
from the second film that were introduced in this one, as well.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.020
Remember the woman in charge of the servants?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.680
Of course you don't! Because nobody remembers the second film!

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.000
But she's in this. What an incredible touch of detail!

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.020
Even the prince, who had maybe one line of dialogue in the first movie and, I don't know,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.500
maybe two in the second one -- he was clearly just the eye candy --

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.900
has a lot more character in this.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.460
Well, okay. Not a *lot* more character, but, certainly, there is a personality there.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.420
He's gentle, nice, and charming, but you do get to know him a little bit more.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.320
Enough that you want to seem him get with the right person.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.540
The animation is fantastic,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.260
and what's so great about it is that is doesn't necessarily try to recreate the same animation from the first film.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.920
"Bambi 2" kinda fell into that trap, and, while it wasn't really bad or anything,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.020
you're just constantly reminded that this isn't its own thing.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.800
*This*, even though it's a sequel, does feel like its own thing.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.240
The imagery gets a lot more creepy and a lot more creative.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.480
There's this scene where she throws Cinderella into this giant pumpkin, and it's all gross and disgusting inside,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.420
and these vines just grab this horse and wrap around it,

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.140
and then she turns the cat into this evil servant who's laughing maniacally as he's gonna ride it off a cliff,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.220
and it's just crazy! It's something that you want to see in a fairy tale sequel.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.140
It gets a little darker, it gets a little crazier, and it gets a lot more fun.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.980
It's like half Cinderella and half Tim Burton. It's just so enjoyable to view.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.520
So, okay, this movie sounds great. Is it great?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.640
Well... there are a few little problems that hold it back from being a complete piece,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.900
and I don't think it's just nitpicking.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.320
The biggest one is Cinderella, herself.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.760
Which is not to say the characters is done horribly, I mean they actually animate her very well,

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.960
and the pacing is good, and there's even a scene when she finds out that everything's been changed,

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.800
where you don't even see her reaction.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.980
You just see her place her hand on the door, and that's kind of all you need.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.560
Little moments like that are really, really good.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.740
But the problem is, in the story, it's kinda like "The Little Mermaid": She doesn't learn anything.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.080
She doesn't go through an arc. She just kinda wants to get something, and she gets it.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.360
I guess it's just kind of a distracting contrast

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.540
when you see what these other characters are going through and all the changes that they have going on.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.120
On top of that, some of the morals are a little weird, like there's this ongoing thing

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.120
that when you touch a person's hand, you immediately know if you're in love, and... yeah, I know.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.900
Disney. Fairy tales. They kind of teach even weirder lessons than that if you really think about it, but...

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.020
I don't know. That seemed particularly odd.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.020
For a movie that's really trying to fix the dated problems of the first film,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.180
it seems like that was something that was clearly really distracting that they maybe

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.900
should have taken another look at.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.580
On top of *that*, this movie has three climaxes.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.580
Yeah, there's one where the prince saves her, then there's one where she saves herself,

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.800
and then there's one where she saves him, and it's just kind of all over the place.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.300
But they're all kind of fun, too.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.020
It's, like, all this green stuff flying everywhere, and this choir going, (vocalizing).

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.400
It's something you can clearly tell the animators, and the writers, and the directors were having fun doing,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.940
and we feel that fun.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.260
The hard work and effort is clearly there in a project where it didn't need to be there.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.420
They went 110% on something that clearly was just meant to be thrown out really fast,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.760
but they really tried, and you can tell they really tried.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.700
But, yeah, those problems I mentioned before are still legitimate problems.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.180
They do kinda focus a little too much on the side characters, and, yeah, I know the first film

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.480
you could argue that, too, but the center was still around her need, her want,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.940
her going through this endurance to get what was needed, working hard and finally getting that reward.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.860
Here, I guess it's just kind of the same thing, working hard and getting that reward,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.300
but we already saw that, so why is that interesting?

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.520
But, in my opinion, the rest is so much fun, and so crazy, and so enjoyable

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.940
that I can kinda overlook it, and I think a lot of other people overlook it, too.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.560
All I can say is what everyone's been saying about is strangely right.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.900
It is really entertaining, and I highly recommend it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.520
I can't say it's perfect. I can't say it's a Disney classic, or anything, but it's just a ton of surreal joy.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.960
I like how they took something that was pretty pointless and even a kind of dumb idea

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.320
and turned it into something that was just kinda cool,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.240
and focused on the elements that were the most enjoyable from the first film.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.960
If you want a Disney sequel that doesn't need to exist but is still really, really neat,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.500
"Cinderella 3" is, bizarrely enough, the one to check out.
