00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.130
The answer is this here.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.600
We start from state 4, so

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.755
I write that out, as q, followed
by the binary representation of 4.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.710
We read an x, so I write out
the representation of that symbol,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.190
and then we go back to state q4.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.298
So I write that out again here.

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:23.199
And then we want to leave this x alone,
so I write x, or

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.865
rather the encoding of x,
as the symbol to write.

00:00:27.865 --> 00:00:29.630
Then we want to move to the right.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.530
So I write R as the last
element of the pool.
