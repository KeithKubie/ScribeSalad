00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.750
We can connect the subject's thinking
to several topics we have already

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.220
covered in this class.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.470
You may recall that
early on in this course,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.810
we used frames to understand
stories of this kind.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.700
Now this story is actually capturing
some information about a system.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.910
In this political system, there is
a country with people and a president.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.610
It also had geological faults as
a result of which earthquakes occur

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.160
that killed some people.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.510
So the components, the complex
relationships between these components,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.540
the complex processes that emerge out of
this interaction between the components.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.960
Scripts, too,
are related to system thinking.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.240
Dining at a restaurant
is a complex system.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.560
Once again, there are a number of
components, relationships, interactions,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.390
processes, functions.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.720
A script is a knowledge for presentation
that allows us to capture knowledge

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.910
of a stereotypical dining
experience at a restaurant.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.440
When we discussed diagnosis,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.060
at that time we talked about systems
thinking a little bit more explicitly.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.980
To begin with, we said that diagnosis
is identification of a fault

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.520
responsible for a malfunctioning system.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.100
Diagnosis begins with the observed
data about some system what are its

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.528
expectations of the behavior
expected of it.

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:11.930
The diagnostic paths takes the data and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.330
matches it to hypotheses of a fault
responsible for that behavior.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.030
What makes a diagnostic task so hard,
again, is that there are a large number

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.970
of components that interact with each
other, and it is a complex behavior that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.700
emerges out of the interaction
between these components.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.070
Just think of program debugging.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.920
Program debugging is hard because there
are a large number of lines in the code,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.640
and these lines in the code
interact with each other, and very

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.720
complex behaviors, output behaviors,
emerge because of those interactions.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.610
&gt;&gt; So another good example of how
diagnosis is a case of systems thinking

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.932
is if we look at ecological systems.

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:48.840
Recently there's been a massive drop in
the population of bees around the world.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.340
That's our data.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.550
As it turns out, the cause for this drop
in bee population is the presence of

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.060
a poisonous substance in insecticides
used in the past several years.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.800
However, we can't see the process of
bees getting poisoned by this chemical.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.230
All we can do is infer it based on
higher level interactions of seeing

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.740
the bee populations drop and
seeing a rise in this chemical.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.040
So, in this way, there's multiple
levels of abstraction in this process.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.720
There's the visible bee population,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.600
there's the visible use of pesticide,
but

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.330
there's also an invisible layer where
the pesticide actually poisons the bees.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.760
So, we have to discern the interaction
between these multiple levels.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.715
&gt;&gt; In any complex system there will
be many levels of abstraction,

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:28.995
some invisible, some visible.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:33.325
The human eye, or human senses more
generally, can see only some of these

00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:36.245
levels of abstraction,
the visible levels of abstraction.

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:39.765
System thinking helps us
understand the invisible levels.
