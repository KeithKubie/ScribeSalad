FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.530
I'm Florina Muntenescu
for The Developer Show.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.080
This is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.810
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.040
In partnership with
Udacity and Andela,

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.520
we're offering
15,000 scholarships

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.700
to aspiring and professional
developers across Africa.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.557
If you're interested
and want to learn more,

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:21.390
take a look at the post
and follow the links

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.130
to the application.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.310
Google believes everyone should
be able to access and enjoy

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.090
the web.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.230
Which is why we've open sourced
GTXiLib, an accessibility test

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
automation framework for iOS
under the Apache license.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.860
Head on over to the post
for the Github link.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.830
We recently worked with MongoDB
to expand the availability

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.740
of MongoDB Atlas on
Google Cloud Platform,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.680
making it available
across most GCP regions,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.510
as well as on Cloud Launcher.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290
[INAUDIBLE] how it
works with the post.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.905
Chrome 66 beta is here,
with CSS-type object model,

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:56.280
[INAUDIBLE]
synchronous clipboard

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.480
API, the audio worklet
object, and more.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.090
A full description and code
are available on the post.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.190
We made more than 20
security announcements

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.040
across the Google Cloud
portfolio at last week's CEO

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.270
Security Forum in New York,
covering VPC service controls,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.290
Cloud Security Command Center,
access transparency, and more.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.470
For a lot of in-depth
details and a bunch of links,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.690
head on over to the post.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.170
Back in December, we announced
that the Firebase Realtime

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.510
Database had integrated
with Google Stackdriver

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.440
to let you create dashboards and
graphs of powerful new metrics.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.020
We've now made all of this
data actionable through Google

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.580
Stackdriver Alerts.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.450
Find out how to
set and customize

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.420
the alerts from the post.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.130
We've been working
hard to make Firebase

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.770
more valuable for all
you game developers.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.110
Last week, we stopped by the
Game Developer Conference

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.570
in San Francisco to
share some announcements,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.550
including Google Play Games
Services support in Firebase

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.340
Auth, desktop support for C++
end-unit development, and more.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.180
More details, and a link to the
documentation is on the post.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.860
Please remember to like,
subscribe and share.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.122
I'm Florina Muntenscu
for The Developer Show.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:06.080
Thank you for watching.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.790
And I'll see you next week.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.699
SPEAKER: OK.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.077
Developer Show with Florina.

00:02:10.077 --> 00:02:10.910
Scene one, take one.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.410
