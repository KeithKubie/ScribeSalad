1
00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.150
Dude, dude, dude, dude, they're Dell. No whiskey row. Do you want some? Yeah,

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.910
I want a drink. Yeah. Rally. No, Bro, you've got a long day. Okay,

3
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.540
I'll stay drunk. Oh, let's get a little, okay. Pause it.

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.880
I'll get it. Okay, Jamie's going gonna get the booze. Look at that.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.180
Jamie leaves the salon to get the booze. Thank you Jamie. Real, real pro.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.740
Get some ice too. Beautiful. So lot of fucking shit going on, man.

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.900
Lot of shit going on. How about that Colby Covington Fella. Huh Bro? Dude,

8
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.890
everybody better shut the fuck up now. He's for real. He's for real.

9
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:36.530
Anybody who didn't think he was for real after that Robbie Lawler fight,

10
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.340
you got to go. Wow. Well the problem is is he talked so much shit,

11
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.900
which I find hilarious and it's you're tuning in to watch him lose,

12
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.990
which is he's doing it right cause to, in all honesty,

13
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.080
we like him cause we're balls deep in UFC and MMA.

14
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.800
But like my brother who's not that big of a fan, it's like this is all he does.

15
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.680
I'm like, I know you, you gotta understand though what he's doing.

16
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:02.681
This guy is amazing and he's going to do it for five rounds or 25 minutes.

17
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.420
And where's Ya, it's to me, it's fascinating. It is fascinating,

18
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.410
but it's not entertaining for a general fan. Typically.

19
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530
He's not knocking dudes out. He's not a lot of submissions.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.980
You know what I'm saying? So for the, for the General Fan, like, oh,

21
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.300
this guy talks all this shit,

22
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.930
but he's doing it right because talking all that shit,

23
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.970
like don't only see this guy get fucked up. Even Jon Jones posted,

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.830
you let everyone down, you know, like, uh, uh, Robbie Lawler let everybody down.

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.500
You know what I'm saying? Cause he wants, everybody wants Colby to lose, right?

26
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.020
Kobe's doing an exact, everyone's playing into his game plan. The idol. Love it.

27
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.090
Well that's how Floyd Mayweather became so rich.

28
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.810
Floyd Mayweather did not become so rich because his fights were so exciting.

29
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.350
His fights in his early career were way more exciting.

30
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:47.530
He was a savage or then he could go to [inaudible],

31
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.350
but he broke his hands a bunch of times. Correct. And you know,

32
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:55.850
and also realize like this is not the way to have a long career and walk out of

33
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:57.980
it with all your brains intact. Well think, remember,

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.930
think how good Jon Fitch was. Oh yeah. He was up Monster Chore. Nice guy,

35
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.350
true professional beat. Some of the very best was tough to beat.

36
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.990
Didn't talk shit though. So no one really cared.

37
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:11.360
So as soon as he had some issues, I remember he was like, Hey,

38
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.000
I don't like the way my face looks in that video game. UFC was like, cool,

39
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.020
your cut. Like what the fuck? I'm 20 and oh man. Yeah,

40
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.590
I think they'd cut them just because of, um,

41
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.280
but either one of those is good. This is all we have in this room.

42
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.580
We have a bunch of that. Um, which the Buffalo Buffalo Trace.

43
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.680
We have buffalo trace in the bag. I don't trust skinny bottles. Yeah,

44
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.740
that seems weird, right? Yeah, it's for girls.

45
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.110
I'll trust skinny girls wear skinny bottles, bro.

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.970
Canadian whiskey and Maple Syrup now can't do maple on Quito, Bro.

47
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.840
Straight Quito. When did I say I sent you and Brian a text.

48
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.550
Your boy was up to two 73 dude, you got to two 73

49
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.970
what were you eating? Road. Lot of tough road dog life. Cause when I get into,

50
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.070
and there's all this,

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.040
<v 1>you know if you're in Nashville and Philly where there's great food,</v>

52
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.120
so I was just eating and drinking at night and no one said anything to me.

53
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.540
I hear Ya. No one said anything. No. And then I remember I went to Hawaii,

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.820
I went to Hawaii. I was looking at the other dads and like, damn,

55
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:16.900
these dads aren't shape. I look like shit. My girl is like, no,

56
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.500
you look fine. Everyone's lying man. Now I got on the scale.

57
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.080
It's not fine. Your Boys Been Kito 14 days. I feel grained days, 40 days.

58
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.450
Stress can knock. You had a creek. Quito. Anyway though, this is whiskey.

59
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.330
There's no sugar in whiskey. There's not, nope, it's alcohol,

60
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.180
but there's no sugar in it. But alcohol doesn't convert to cheers. My brother,

61
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.220
his brother. Good to see you, man. Good to see you too.

62
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.070
Alcohol doesn't convert into sugar. I don't think so.

63
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.730
Especially whiskey cause whiskey and vodka are safe on Keto genic diet.

64
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.220
Oh Woo. It's two in the afternoon, Bro. Yeah, two in the afternoon.

65
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.610
Fight Alcoholic now. Hey drink. And I'm like a super shitty rum light.

66
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.170
It's fun to uh, drink a little bit before a show, right? Nothing better man.

67
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.590
Okay, so me take that. Started me on it. Oh my God. You look good up here.

68
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.300
I'm messing around. I get loose. Yeah. I don't want to be tight now.

69
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.030
I want to be tight. No, you don't want to drink your problem either.

70
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.800
But the Colby Covington thing is, um, look what he did.

71
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.470
If, if you, if you want to put it in perspective for a regular person,

72
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.260
Robbie Lawler is one of the biggest fucking savages to ever compete in the

73
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:20.950
sport. He's an animal. And Colby shot him down. He shut everything down.

74
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.120
He shut his entire game down and he did it with an unprecedented work rate he

75
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:28.960
made. He was punching one punch every two seconds. Nuts,

76
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.740
which is nuts. I mean that is it for,

77
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.750
to do that over five fucking rounds against one of the greatest welterweights of

78
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.140
all time and Robbie Lawler and when every single fucking round, some 10,

79
00:04:41.141 --> 00:04:44.950
eight rounds, I thought, this isn't even close. Not even close. I mean,

80
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.790
Robbie occasionally would swing and connect and then Colby would immediately hit

81
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:52.210
him three or four times more and then take him down or clinch with them and beat

82
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:56.630
him up and it was amazing. Colby strike is not terrible either. It's very good.

83
00:04:56.631 --> 00:05:00.940
Pretty damn good. It's very technical and the volume, the volume is incredible.

84
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.280
Here's my thing, if I'm fighting Colby, like if I'm a Karma Uzman,

85
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.030
if I'm fighting Colby, I'm getting a guy like campaigns.

86
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.400
If I see my opponent running with campaigns,

87
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.330
I'm reaching out to another ultra marathon or figuring it out. Well,

88
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.250
Comoro can't run. That's right. He can't do roadwork. His leads still. Yes.

89
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.740
Oh yeah. It's not getting any better. His knees are mangled,

90
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.340
but if you're doing something right, well his cardio is off the charts too,

91
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:29.530
but it's just, he does different things.

92
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.000
You can do a lot of different things to work storming and stuff. Sure.

93
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.650
Swimming you can do a lot. Oh yeah. The uh, assault bike.

94
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.020
Um, you know the, um, that echo bike,

95
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:44.080
that rogue makes that is as good as Jacob ladder thing. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.900
They need that. [inaudible] and I feel like it's lying to me.

97
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:51.100
I work out every morning on that thing. I've never been thicker. Yeah.

98
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.580
But you're eating like an animal still. It says I burned a thousand calories.

99
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.250
Probably I call bullshit dude. I don't think so. Manto hippie

100
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.990
<v 0>full of Shit. Food truck diaries.</v>

101
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:04.991
You need to stop lying to no food truck tiger thing going hard in those

102
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.870
[inaudible] and I'm the only one eating it. Yeah.

103
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.610
Cause the other day the guest is talking. So tell me how you got started.

104
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.860
Lobster. Fucking sandwiches and shit. Pizza. None stuff.

105
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.840
And he had no shit ready to 70. Yeah.

106
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.720
That's why I can't find at heavyweight right now, man. That's what happens. Oh,

107
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.830
hard. But if I'm a Camarillo, y'all see cardio's not a prom for him,

108
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:35.240
but man Colby, have you ever seen him tired ever? No. No,

109
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.220
I mean he had that one loss in the UFC,

110
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.820
but that was particularly because he came to the fight injury,

111
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:42.950
took the fight on short notice, but he's,

112
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.840
he's got an amazing style,

113
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.910
that style of wrestling and striking and as a person who's fascinated by

114
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.470
tactics, right? Yeah. Like his tactics are incredible because he's,

115
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.350
he's got great discipline to never,

116
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.370
he's never bites down his mouthpiece and throws as hard as he can. Never.

117
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:06.320
Everything is like a calculated, the output is all the same.

118
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:10.820
It's just constant, constant back, back, back kick, Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang,

119
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.150
Bang, Bang. He doesn't really fire power shots like he's like, oh no,

120
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:18.890
this is a marathon where you're going to sell. It's all the same pace.

121
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.280
It's all, he's just constantly hitting you constantly moving forward.

122
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:26.330
Constant volume and it seemed like Robbie was waiting for him to pause in front

123
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:30.320
of him or get a little tired so he could fire shots off and the bobbing and

124
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:34.100
weaving that Robbie was doing. Like what was all that about? 20 tired. I mean,

125
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.380
I guess doing all that Bob and weave and I was like damn rough on the Corp.

126
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.600
Yeah man, that's rough on the core. I try bobbing and weaving for a minute.

127
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.720
If you're at home, just try doing this for a minute. Just a minute.

128
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.890
Just a minute. Realtime. And Robbie's just trying to avoid getting beat up.

129
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:51.530
I mean this punch is just relentless. They never end.

130
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.240
And what's funny too about Colby is love him or hate him is he doubles down

131
00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.110
cause he got on the mic and his line about Matt Hughes. Oh my God. Dude. Pete.

132
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.980
I was watching it and I was, where was, I was in Nashville.

133
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:08.210
I was watching the room with the Derrick posting a son, uh, Ahmad my openers.

134
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.090
And uh, when they said that they were aware of uh, Matt Hughes and go,

135
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.320
that's ridiculous. I'm like, that's fantastic.

136
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.790
It's hey cause it is messed up. But that's his character, man.

137
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.260
He's a heel and he just doubled down so hard, so hard.

138
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:28.010
Cause Matt Hughes is really close around me long. And he said,

139
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.860
you think what he said for those that have what's fight, he goes,

140
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.640
you would think Robbie Lawler would take a lesson from his boy,

141
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:37.310
Matt Hughes and get off the train tracks when a train is coming.

142
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.450
He's just all fair in love and war. Yeah. The most controversial,

143
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.440
ruthless shit that he could say. And here's what else do.

144
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.580
So we're impressed by his tactics, right?

145
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.280
You know what's even more impressive as a former fighter,

146
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.240
it's stressful enough fighting another grown man

147
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.580
<v 1>with a steel cage, especially when they're really good. It's fucking stressful.</v>

148
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.440
Now imagine talking all that Shit and you gotta deal with the consequences.

149
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:08.610
People hate you and he's a good dude. Yeah. Dr Campaign is,

150
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.600
he's a different guy. Great Guy. Yeah. So he's a normal dude outside,

151
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:15.150
but he has to deal with all that pressure and still perform.

152
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.090
Then get on the mic. I wonder if he's ever just in bed. It's like,

153
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.040
God damn tell me these death threats are getting real old after that fight.

154
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.640
He has a real shot at being a world champion. A real shot.

155
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:28.470
I know he was already the interim world champion.

156
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.240
Those don't count after that fight. They don't count. No. And well,

157
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.460
you know how, you know they don't count.

158
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.830
They stripped him and he didn't even lose. Yeah. It doesn't matter.

159
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:36.330
How does that make no sense? He,

160
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:40.110
they stripped him because he didn't want to fight again quickly after a five

161
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:42.690
round fucking war with RDA. Any needed surgery.

162
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.890
But also they don't count either because your contract doesn't, you don't get,

163
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.210
when you're a champ, your contract,

164
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:51.150
you get bumped up to higher pay interim champs. Don't get bumped up.

165
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.570
What it was. What was the surgery for? Um,

166
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.120
it was something I feel like in his face, like in sinus. Yeah. Something else.

167
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.810
Major. Yeah. Something like a deviated Septum. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah.

168
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.310
So he's a fucking f. He's a phenomenal fighter. But now think about this.

169
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:11.460
You take his style, he doesn't go backwards. Wrestling, cardio,

170
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.210
Kamara Huseman doesn't go backwards. Wrestling. Cardio. Yeah.

171
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.460
The only thing I see.

172
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.580
I would imagine Comoros can be a slight favorite because of his power. Yeah.

173
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.980
One kind of distinguishing kind of factors. Kamar has a lot more power, right?

174
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.500
Camaros. He can knock you out. Neither was a knockout artists, right?

175
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.200
C'Mon can knock people out though. [inaudible]

176
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.740
can knock people out too.

177
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.980
But his approach is to throw everything at like 50 60% he was slaying in some

178
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:42.540
early in that first round against Robbie. They were exchanging,

179
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:45.120
if you want to connect, it could have been trolled for either guy or either guy.

180
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.610
He was getting Robert's respect and I think that was the strategy that you ha

181
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.510
you kind of have to wade through the fire with Robbie in the beginning cause

182
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:54.780
he's coming hard. You know he's coming, coming. He's coming hard.

183
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:59.810
Now here's the question for you is what's more impressive what Colby did to

184
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.290
Robbie Lawler or what C'mon Huseman did at Tyrone Woodley?

185
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.730
It's a very good question.

186
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.350
Well obviously Tyron Woodley was the champion and Robbie Lawler was several

187
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.900
years removed from the title. So you have to look at it that way. Right.

188
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.640
Tyron took the title from Robbie with a one punch knockout and Robbie's had

189
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:22.260
some, some losses since then. Some wars. Yeah, some wars since then.

190
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.040
The Ben Asker fight in particular all beat Woodley when he was fucking would,

191
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.210
yes, yes.

192
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:31.590
But according to many people would lose injured going to that fight.

193
00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.510
He said some pretty significant problems with his hands.

194
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:37.140
Something was up with them. He just seemed off and he was also, I mean,

195
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:38.790
I don't know how much of a factor that says,

196
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:42.150
but he also released a record with Wiz Khalifa. He was rapping,

197
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:44.400
he was doing his TMZ shows doing a lot.

198
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:47.760
And I love the fact that he's doing that because Tyron Woodley's a smart man.

199
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:50.970
He realizes he's in his thirties and how much more time does he have his

200
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.830
[inaudible]. He's very talented, very talented, very smart.

201
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.970
And his wrappings good man. I listened to his shit mindfully. He's good.

202
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.490
It's not cringey at all. No, it's fucking good. You could,

203
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.740
you could see him being a successful rapper.

204
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.660
100 will be successful in whatever he does.

205
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.140
Any funny does anything and he's smart. He's ambitious.

206
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.250
He's been in a thousand movies. He grinds as a fucking hard work and man,

207
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.570
but he wants a title back. Right. So he's on the grind right now.

208
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.640
Try to get that title back and the Po,

209
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.490
the beating that ou swollen put on him was fucking one of the motivational,

210
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.010
impressive performances, whatever. If Woodley had one arm or whatever.

211
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.710
But I didn't know that going in,

212
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.570
just seeing what he did to Woodley's got him down. I couldn't believe it.

213
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.470
I couldn't believe he looked like he broke him,

214
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.700
which was crazy cause even willing in the corner, he didn't would,

215
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.380
and I don't know if you had Woodley on since, uh,

216
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.620
he just didn't look like he was there. He wasn't present.

217
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.740
Like it didn't look like your normal world champion Woodley.

218
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.740
What is weirdly scheduled for a fight right now? I don't think so.

219
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:50.410
I think he's trying to heal up and have you, you know,

220
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.650
you're supposed to fight Robbie again. Yeah. But here's the other thing.

221
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:54.940
Did you know, you know,

222
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.270
remember Woodley had that whole kind of back and forth with the Dana and all

223
00:12:58.271 --> 00:13:02.650
that. And I remember, um, I forget who he, he told this to,

224
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.460
but they asked him if you could do it all over again with the way you handled

225
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:09.490
the UFC, would you do it? And he goes, no. It was exhausting. I wouldn't,

226
00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.500
I wouldn't do that again. What was exhausting fighting with UFC kind of,

227
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:18.010
you know, remember he was like Anti Dana. It never works out for anyone.

228
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:22.420
Does it? Well, I get their perspective that they want respect and you know,

229
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:24.990
they want to be treated like a champion. And you know, I,

230
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I felt like my personal feeling was that he wasn't being represented correctly

231
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.370
in terms of the way they were talking about his fights.

232
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.160
100% I felt like he was fighting in,

233
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.550
especially me as a fan of tactics.

234
00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.940
Like he was fighting Wonderboy for two fights and one, two boys.

235
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:45.370
The most difficult guy in the fucking sport to look good against.

236
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.340
He is so difficult to look good against. But the first fight, it was amazing.

237
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.500
It was great, great fight. And the one son,

238
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.350
he was the one who was doing the damage.

239
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.320
Wonderboy is one of the best strikers to ever fight in MMA.

240
00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.940
He knocked Wonderboy down. He had Wonderboy hurt. Wonderboy never had him hurt,

241
00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.690
but he fought and intelligent fight to deal with the tactics that Wonderboy

242
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:08.260
provides. Like you can't chase Wonderboy. You can't go after him.

243
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:10.660
He will fucking catch you with a counterstrike.

244
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.590
So what he did is he made Wonderboy lead, he weighed for his openings,

245
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.580
he stayed patient. It wasn't a lot of action, but when real delivered,

246
00:14:18.581 --> 00:14:23.050
he opened up, he landed a fucking haymaker in the first fight,

247
00:14:23.051 --> 00:14:24.310
had him really badly hurt.

248
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.060
He did the same thing and the second fight had him really badly hurt in a couple

249
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:30.760
spots. He's also one of the most active champion.

250
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.700
But you gotta be able to say that like if you're a fan of the sport,

251
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:37.390
like what I would say if I was in Dana white shoes and I was talking about that

252
00:14:37.391 --> 00:14:38.830
fight, I would say if you're a fan of sport,

253
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.880
you got to understand that there are certain fighters where it's very difficult

254
00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:43.691
to look good against.

255
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:47.110
I understand that if you're a fan and you want blood and you want chaos,

256
00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:49.090
it didn't really quite live up to your expectations.

257
00:14:49.091 --> 00:14:52.010
But that's not what this sport is all about. With this swap, the sport

258
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:57.010
<v 0>is all about his two incredibly talented and well trained killers and they're</v>

259
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.260
going after each other and they're both trying to figure out the openings to

260
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:03.620
win. And Tyron was able to win and he was able to win against one of the most

261
00:15:03.621 --> 00:15:07.370
difficult guys in the division. And you know, does Damian do that? Did they? No,

262
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:07.850
they didn't.

263
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:12.170
But there's going to be guys where he looks amazing against like fucking Darren

264
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:16.200
till he made Darren show. He Shut Darren till down Darren till it's,

265
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.400
that's a shame to me that the Darren till's story right on his story is not

266
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:23.240
over. He's a young kid, but the way he was handled, and I know, you know,

267
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.570
they've exploded guys in the spotlight and it does work out. But that,

268
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:29.490
and that is the professional sports. That's UFC with Dan Tiller,

269
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.370
you look at all the talent that he had and it's just, they still got talent.

270
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.150
Oh no, he, he's going to be fine. He's so big. It's fucking tough.

271
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:41.480
I think he's cutting way too much weight to make one 70 I really do.

272
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.890
I mean he's that kid. You stand next to him. He looks like all I'd have you.

273
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.980
I've always been the guy who goes, man,

274
00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:50.210
guys should grow up weight classes and now when Mac tolerate went to 55 against

275
00:15:50.211 --> 00:15:52.730
us in poor dental, you know it was a good fight,

276
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:56.310
but it looks way better at 45 85 what?

277
00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.660
Dustin [inaudible] going to one 55 made his career.

278
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.430
He was nine oh five he was struggling. He goes a 55 makes it clear. I know,

279
00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:08.900
I mean I always [inaudible] at 70 there's a bunch of cases for it while Dos

280
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.790
Angeles at 70 those not one the title,

281
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.770
but he started off hot as fuck and he's running some problems but run into a lot

282
00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:18.140
of really? Yes. He's running a lot of really tough guys.

283
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:21.800
Like Rockhold from 85 to two oh five I was shouting from the rooftops,

284
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:24.800
this guy that maybe can compete with Jon Jones.

285
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:29.060
And then he got in there and just look slow, lethargic, just different game.

286
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.910
He didn't look good like white man.

287
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.370
I think she'd be great at two Oh five but y'all [inaudible] look great.

288
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:38.750
You got to think about this was like a showcase fight for him and he's a big

289
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:42.890
fucking strong guy and when he clipped, fucking knocked him out for sure.

290
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.640
I mean Luke, Luke didn't look like himself. He looked slower. Hesitant.

291
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.180
He's had injuries. He's on model Bro. Yeah, he's a model. Like real money. Yeah,

292
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:54.320
but he's spraying like perfume and commercials. So Quinny doing,

293
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.490
making bank bro. Like fucking busted nuts I guess. So making banging,

294
00:16:58.770 --> 00:16:59.820
busting nuts. That's what he's doing Joe.

295
00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.280
But right now he's drinking through a straw. Yeah, I know shit. Yeah. I mean,

296
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.140
hey, that's why he wants to fight was jaw wired,

297
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:09.410
shut spray Cologne and buss nuts. It might be what he's doing from now on,

298
00:17:09.411 --> 00:17:10.400
but when he, I think it is,

299
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.710
but when you're a world champion in the back of his head,

300
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.590
it's probably that feeling of being a world champion. When he beat Chris,

301
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.960
Chris Weidman probably the greatest feeling of his life,

302
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.910
but he's also had real problems with that Shin [inaudible].

303
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:25.130
They let him fight with that Shit anyways, kicking within shit. You know,

304
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.410
for people who don't know what we're talking about,

305
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:29.660
he had a massive staff infection, horrible.

306
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:32.690
And he had to get skin grafts on this shin and it's still fucked up.

307
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.330
Here's the thing about Luke though, and I love Luke. He knows this.

308
00:17:35.331 --> 00:17:39.500
He's a friend of mine, but he's had a great long ass career man.

309
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.980
Like this is to me. That's when I said story. If Darren Tilden come champion,

310
00:17:42.981 --> 00:17:43.880
that's a sad story.

311
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.720
Luke Rocco has been a world champion at Strikeforce and the UFC.

312
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.130
He smashed Machi too. He's beat some of the very

313
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.750
<v 1>best guys in the world. He's a dying piece. He's fine. He's made his legacy.</v>

314
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.490
So to me the shame is a guy like dear until if he doesn't bounce back. Yeah,

315
00:17:59.520 --> 00:17:59.941
maybe.

316
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:04.380
But I think Luke Rockhold really believes that he could get back into the sa the

317
00:18:04.381 --> 00:18:07.500
kind of form that he was in when he was world champion.

318
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.890
I just don't think you could ever make one 85 again and two oh five is a

319
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:11.724
different animal.

320
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.760
There are enormous men that are dropping down to two oh five and he looked like,

321
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.900
like he was carrying weight. He was jacked. It looks huge. It looked slow.

322
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.800
Yeah. He looked real slow. He looked angry. He got her thank you.

323
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:29.250
Get 20 extra pounds on you. That's what he likes around that.

324
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.860
You know what I'm saying? He walked around that way.

325
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.380
I think you might've put weight on to and to cut down to two oh five so it can

326
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:37.680
be a big two oh five and that might've been part of the problem to a five

327
00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.050
Scandipop and these days. And we got a little sad,

328
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.320
his struggle city about a year ago. A lot of killers, a lot of killers,

329
00:18:43.321 --> 00:18:47.790
but no one that is a real promising threat to Jon Jones.

330
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.830
Santos put on a fucking show, put on Chicago Song with one leg.

331
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.550
Yeah. And I knew it was nick leg blew out early on. I didn't.

332
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.060
And then when they told me he tore his ACL, MCL, everything,

333
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.370
and he still competed like that.

334
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.760
I could tell early in the first he threw something early in the first you could

335
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:09.030
see his leg go and I could you, you said something about it, right?

336
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.930
That's going on. Although I will say this as Santos is bad as fuck.

337
00:19:12.931 --> 00:19:16.320
And then before that, Anthony Smith, both amazing fighters.

338
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.050
John's getting older. John's getting lower in that.

339
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:21.600
And I think there's a guy in, I think John's the greatest of all time.

340
00:19:21.601 --> 00:19:23.700
Hands down. No argument. But he,

341
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.570
I think there's starting to be a little chink in his armor. Maybe. You think so?

342
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.850
Yes. You said bull with Santos there.

343
00:19:29.851 --> 00:19:33.960
There were some Santos that fucking savage man Santos. A shit savage for sure.

344
00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.650
And John fought him stand up for some strange reason. I was surprised,

345
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:38.520
especially with Santos,

346
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.360
his fucked up leg that John didn't take foreman stand blow me away by John by no

347
00:19:42.361 --> 00:19:45.990
means. And Santos had one leg. I didn't understand that performance.

348
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.570
I don't know why he didn't take him down. Right.

349
00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:49.860
I felt like John was one of the best wrestlers in the fucking sport.

350
00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.890
He took down Daniel Cormier. He submitted fucking leave them a cheetah.

351
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.890
Vidor Belfour Rampage Jackson. Ryan Bader. He's amazing. Yeah.

352
00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.130
He could take him down.

353
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.470
I wonder what was going on there and the guy's got one knee.

354
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.770
I mean you can't even walk. It's very straight. The game plan was very strange,

355
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.400
but I saw that went well and here, here's where I was thinking like that is,

356
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.000
will John go on defeated? Probably. I bet a good amount of money on that.

357
00:20:12.001 --> 00:20:13.470
But there's a guy like, like uh,

358
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.250
I don't think you can sit on outside and beat John like a ray,

359
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.300
like a guy who's super technical and long.

360
00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.910
You're not going out smart John on the outside. It's not happening.

361
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.360
I think it's going to come from a guy like Johnny Walker throws like a spinning

362
00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:28.710
heel kick. Try and catch his giant. Someone good. Who's he? I fighting your boy.

363
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:33.030
He was just on the wrestler. The black dude. Oh Cory and Cory Anderson.

364
00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.570
They were talking shit to each other. That didn't fucking New York. Ooh,

365
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.970
that's a good Cordy hat. Cory has crazy cardio. That's a great phrase.

366
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.500
He curtsy. What if Johnny Walkers, cause if you beat Coriann you're ready to go.

367
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.370
You beat him. We're going sizzler. Yes, yes. Or of Corey beats him.

368
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:52.480
He's going [inaudible] he's already there. Corey. Corey is already an elite guy.

369
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.590
Well he is an elite guy,

370
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:56.530
but he's not being talked about in terms of a title shot.

371
00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.700
Very frustrating to him. Yeah. But that style is fucking hard to handle, man.

372
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:02.590
He doesn't matter. They're not in the business of that.

373
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.280
You put look at fucking look at Colby Covington. It's a similar style.

374
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:08.410
Just constant pressure. Yeah, you're right.

375
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:12.370
And you know he talks a lot of Shit Colby did to get there. Yeah. Well,

376
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:17.320
Cory's is a really nice guy and his guys finish last little shit.

377
00:21:17.321 --> 00:21:22.000
Sometimes they win. Really? Yes in no, he can win for sure.

378
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.430
He's the dot's gonna take a lot of work though. Yep. To get there. Like,

379
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.590
like let's say you have a guy like let's say you have a guy who's um,

380
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.030
like a Conor McGregor,

381
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.010
he's gonna Catapult to the front before a guy you talking about [inaudible]

382
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.950
personality. Yes. Yes. Catapult. You have season. Go rocket ship. Go.

383
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.740
Isn't that crazy though? That's like part of the sport,

384
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.730
part of this sport is how much money can you generate because it's not just

385
00:21:45.731 --> 00:21:49.960
about how well you perform as a fighter and about how many people were

386
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:52.300
interested in you. Fighting is crazy. It's crazy.

387
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.940
But that's the nature of the beast.

388
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
And that's why I hope that having a guy like Corey on my podcast or you having

389
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.730
him on your podcast that lets people know what a great God is,

390
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.080
says like this is the guy to root for. He's a great guy. Agree.

391
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:08.410
And he can fight his fucking ass off. I agree. But the casuals don't,

392
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.560
for whatever reason, they don't gravitate towards it. If he wins, they will.

393
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.340
Well, you just got to become undeniable. He slowly gets this.

394
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:18.250
He's slowly getting there and he's got one of the best trainers in the fucking

395
00:22:18.251 --> 00:22:19.600
world. You know, mark,

396
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:23.950
Henry's the shit the best and his camp is fucking fantastic.

397
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.390
It's got Marlon and Frankie. He'll get a title shot. I think so too.

398
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.150
And you know who's another Nice Gal? Fucking lunch.

399
00:22:31.151 --> 00:22:32.950
You better pack a lunch if you're fighting Corey.

400
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.590
But here's the way your nice guys don't finish last.

401
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.180
If the guy they're fighting is down to play the game via DC, John Jones,

402
00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:44.710
DC's as nice as they come. He doesn't talk shit him for steep aid though.

403
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.920
Especially the first fight now. But that sales just off their talents.

404
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.810
But if you can get a guy like Josie Aldo, Conor McGregor chose ace,

405
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.720
nice as they come get this fucking Irish tidal wave and it looks like,

406
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.120
I'll watch that. And then Josie Aldo,

407
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.230
even though he's one of the greatest of all time at 45,

408
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.010
everyone tuned in and then he kinda took a lot of fans with him. Even,

409
00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.830
even though he lost, he was a huge star. Yup.

410
00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.250
That can happen for Corey with John Jones. Yeah. Although John John,

411
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:14.680
John Jones doesn't really talk shit. He's just a bad guy.

412
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.170
He'll sign in DC though.

413
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.910
Him DC hate each other dude saying John Jones DC for the heavyweight title.

414
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.390
I think that's the future you do. If Steve Bay wins in this, uh,

415
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.240
in this fight, that's next weekend tweak. I think that steep bay fights,

416
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.270
John Jones has heavyweight and Jon Jones moves up to heavyweight and tries to

417
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:36.790
win the title. Okay. Then do you see fights,

418
00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:40.030
John Jones for the heavyweight title? When John's a champion,

419
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:45.630
if John can beat Steepbank or if Steve Bay can beat DC and then Steve Bay could

420
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.870
be Jon Jones and they have a admin depending on how the fight goes. Look,

421
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.410
the bottom line is DC,

422
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.420
not Steve Bay senseless one round knocked him out cold for the title.

423
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:02.780
What was it? A dominating fight. That doesn't mean it doesn't matter. Boom.

424
00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:07.730
I'll close the lights. 100% channel shot. I'm cold. If he can beat him again,

425
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:12.240
man, and say John Jones, he's going to say she's smart. Yeah,

426
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.120
he does that. Oh God. Damn. Biggest fight in UFC history and heavyweight,

427
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:20.120
it will be enormous. What is this pound for pound Daniel Cormier.

428
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.020
Number two Khabib. Number three. Jon Jones. Come on, settle down folks.

429
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.920
Settle down. Whoever's doing that. Come on here, but I'll show you.

430
00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.130
Let's say Jon Jones beat him twice. He's undefeated.

431
00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.340
He's beaten every fucking human being he's ever competed against in real life.

432
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.920
Okay? Every single one. There's one loss in his career. It's a nonsense loss.

433
00:24:40.921 --> 00:24:44.340
They're trying to reverse. I'm 100% support reversing that law.

434
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.190
At the very least. Make it a no contest. John dominated that fight.

435
00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:52.430
Smashed Him. There is no fucking way. That's a loss. There's all CFC.

436
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.810
I'll just mark it as he's undefeated. How would he be knowledge? Undefeated.

437
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.030
Vomiting, knowledge. Fuck your athletic commission. I just met him last night.

438
00:24:59.031 --> 00:25:02.560
Went watch the fight. Did you see Matt Hamill Talk Shit to John? Shit,

439
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.540
let's have a rematch. Like, whoa, are you crazy bro?

440
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.660
You won't lose your fucking vision to what,

441
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.820
dude? Just stop them. Ship this stuff. All that dude.

442
00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.730
Hamill be cool though. Cool. Even John went, come on Bro.

443
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.730
He said to him, this just goes, come on Bro. I'll never fight.

444
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:29.360
It's not even a conversation about who's the light heavyweight goat is.

445
00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:32.390
No conference. No, no. What are we talking about? No, John,

446
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:35.720
anytime talk pound for pound. John's clearly even that,

447
00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:39.140
it's like only one was challenging for pound for pound was mighty mouse and

448
00:25:39.141 --> 00:25:40.190
mighty mouse. You know,

449
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:44.570
the caveat was that he never beat anybody like Jon Jones beat.

450
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.330
It wasn't the same caliber. A fighter wasn't a DC.

451
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.140
And then when he lost a hammer, so udo go out with them. By the way,

452
00:25:51.141 --> 00:25:55.130
super close fucking decision. Law Close could've gone that close.

453
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.910
Could've gone to mighty mouse. So in losses, a lot of loss losses, a loss.

454
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.200
It's like I see Demetrius Johnson and mighty Ma and, and uh,

455
00:26:03.201 --> 00:26:06.380
and John Jones as being a, an argument for number one.

456
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.640
But after that there's no arguments and especially in light heavyweight,

457
00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.880
there's no argument. Yes, Jon Jones,

458
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.330
everybody else can go pound sand. There's not, it's not even close.

459
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.820
I think John goes to heavyweight. Everybody's fucked too.

460
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.660
Although him hinders DC at heavyweight is so much more instant than light

461
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:28.310
heavyweight cause DC Knox do to help man. Right and John Jones,

462
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.240
if he goes up, who knows if he will have the same cardio,

463
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.880
who knows via the same if he'll be as fast.

464
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.110
There's something about guys going up like look, Luke Rockhold same,

465
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.100
same story.

466
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:43.560
He goes up to light heavyweight and he's got all this extra bulk on them. Now,

467
00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:43.831
see,

468
00:26:43.831 --> 00:26:46.980
I don't think John's going to go to like two 40 I think he's going to come in at

469
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:51.981
a fucking lean mean to 25 to 30 doesn't cut any weight.

470
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:56.310
That's what he trained that. Anyways, I was just fucking does work. Yeah.

471
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:59.580
Maybe he just comes in and looks just like John Jones at light heavyweight.

472
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:02.820
He just doesn't cut any weight and that's all. I mean, I don't know about now,

473
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.800
but especially back in the day when I was at Jackson's,

474
00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:09.240
all he really did is go with heavyweights and we'll ragdoll ragdoll I'll tell

475
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:10.590
you what, when he fought, oh,

476
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:14.610
s p I talked to Jackson afterwards and Greg was saying,

477
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.430
I don't like the fact that he's been doing all this power lifting.

478
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:21.000
And he goes and I feel like that played a part in this fight. So Jack,

479
00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:24.290
he did get [inaudible] but I don't, I didn't think that I felt,

480
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.750
I felt that it was OSP.

481
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.950
I feel like OSP rose to the occasion. He's a dangerous guy.

482
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:36.360
He's a super athletic guys big, he's got a powerful left kick, you know,

483
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:37.590
and he's an awkward fighter.

484
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.700
OSP fights awkward and you fuck up and he catches you with a leftover explosive,

485
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.880
impossible to take down typically guy man.

486
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.340
And yeah, I don't know,

487
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:50.070
maybe we're just not giving these guys enough credit because that's because we

488
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:53.010
think so high of John. Whenever it's close I'm like, ah,

489
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:56.670
cause John had enough nut that's maybe these guys are really fucking good.

490
00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.090
I think OSP rose to the occasion. I have a lot of respect for OSP.

491
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.050
When I looked at that fight,

492
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:05.250
I was saying OSP fought a great fight and he fought with a fucking broken arm.

493
00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:05.970
Okay.

494
00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.840
You fought the entire last round with a broken arm and never even said a thing

495
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:13.650
about it. He was fighting with a fucking broken forearm. He's a beast.

496
00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.860
He's a beast, and that's why I think John didn't look so good in that fight.

497
00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:20.820
I disagree that he didn't look good because of the weight lifting,

498
00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:24.570
but I don't know him the way Greg Jackson. Here's the caveat to that,

499
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:26.170
and I don't want to open this can of worms,

500
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.290
so that was also the first time he's been under strict testing.

501
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.540
That's what the naysayers are saying. Well,

502
00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:33.900
that is the first time maybe a little Pico wasn't around

503
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:39.180
and hit it. Here's my defense of that being a Jon Jones Dick sucker.

504
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.660
Even with Pete,

505
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.980
you can fucking fill up anyone who he fights on whatever PD you want.

506
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.820
He's still being him. Whatever he's doing, whether he's taking things or not,

507
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.780
the you could give his fricking opponents as much as they want to.

508
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.680
They're not beating. It's a tough argument though. I'm saying. Yeah.

509
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.010
I don't know if that's necessarily true.

510
00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.670
You fill up Tiago Santos full of fucking anti drawl 50.

511
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.300
He might run right down by that Brazilian [inaudible]. Yeah, you might be right.

512
00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.540
I fucking, I kick his head. He might throw some fuck out.

513
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:11.100
Hey Doorbell for spitting tag. Who knows, man. I still think Joe, he just,

514
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:14.400
he's too smart. Too technical. I don't know. I don't either,

515
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:15.870
but we don't and we don't have to.

516
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.200
I don't have to know cause that testing is strict. Yeah.

517
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.480
I think I legitimately believe that what he got was through tainted means,

518
00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:26.640
and I don't even know if it was supplements. You know,

519
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:30.060
the big theory was that he got cocaine that was laced with creatine.

520
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.250
I hope thing gets caught with creatine.

521
00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.730
Apparently according to someone who I know who really knows their shit.

522
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:39.780
It was d, I mean there's not an ex, this is an expert. He said,

523
00:29:39.781 --> 00:29:43.650
this is very common that when you buy cheap creatine, um,

524
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.520
cheap creatine often has other shit in it because you're buying it from China

525
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:51.580
and from other places that have unscrupulous mixing thing.

526
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:55.330
And I listen as one of the owners of Onnit. I know that this,

527
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.730
we never had our stuff test positive or steroids,

528
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.990
but what we did have is when we looked at the early batches of Alpha brain,

529
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.960
we had it independently tested. You know, when we first,

530
00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:07.180
when Aubrey and I first opened on it,

531
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.270
we didn't know what the fuck we were doing in terms of we hadn't run a

532
00:30:10.271 --> 00:30:12.970
supplement company before and there was a lot of learning to do.

533
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:16.810
And one of the things that we learned was that when you're buying stuff and then

534
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.510
you're having stuff mixed, the people that are mixing it,

535
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.960
if you don't get the very best people,

536
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.830
you're getting people that mix stuff that don't clean out their vats.

537
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.980
So you might get wind stroll in the gay. Anything in there. We never got shit.

538
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:32.020
I, we never got steroids in ours,

539
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:35.170
but probably cause with the stuff we're buying is nootropics, which are just uh,

540
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.620
nutrients that enhance brain function. So the,

541
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:41.320
the people that were selling stuff, we're selling similar things,

542
00:30:41.321 --> 00:30:42.520
vitamins in the like. So,

543
00:30:42.521 --> 00:30:47.521
but we did get our stuff tainted in a sense with other nutrients that weren't

544
00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:48.910
supposed to be in there.

545
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.480
So then we had to do some investigation and then we figured out what the problem

546
00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:56.290
was and we adjusted our methods and we changed the way we changed the people we

547
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:58.210
work with. And we did a lot of different things.

548
00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:03.040
But if you're buying cheap creatine, that's what, that's what coke dealers use.

549
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.970
See, buy cheap creatives. Oh, you're saying a coke from a shady dude.

550
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.450
Guys buy a New Mexico coke. I'm not saying he is. It might be,

551
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:12.660
listen,

552
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.850
I've smoked some weed from some fucking shady people each and I'm a millionaire

553
00:31:15.851 --> 00:31:19.210
to preach. People bring me some weed if they're my friend. I'm like, hey bro,

554
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.800
smoke some weed. You ain't lying. Yeah, I've ate some weird stuff. Yes, yes,

555
00:31:23.801 --> 00:31:27.610
yes. Yeah. That's fair. Yeah. I don't know if I buy,

556
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:29.890
investigate everything I eat. No, never.

557
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:32.730
Dave Chappelle gave me some edibles the other day. I don't know where they ship.

558
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.600
They can throw in a bag. He probably made himself,

559
00:31:36.601 --> 00:31:40.620
I pretty sure he ate mushrooms from a fan the other day. That so gangsta.

560
00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.690
So we went to see a once upon a time in America.

561
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.850
I want to talk in the morning. Dave rented out the entire movie theater.

562
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.700
We do this fucking sold out show in the Tacoma dome.

563
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:56.650
We break the all time attendance record for the Tacoma Dome. 25,000 people.

564
00:31:56.651 --> 00:32:00.910
It was a madness, right? We're flying high. It's insane.

565
00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:03.880
It was an insane show. Who's the Elsa who opens for you guys? Well,

566
00:32:03.881 --> 00:32:05.640
it's Ashley Barnhill. She goes on,

567
00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.510
she does 10 minutes and then Ian Edwards goes on, murders it, and then I go on,

568
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.510
murdered it. It was a fucking crazy intermission. There's a,

569
00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.080
DJ's got a hype man. Chuck a chalk jogs your wall.

570
00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:20.050
People get drank in fucking lights and everything. It's madness. Okay.

571
00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:23.890
Then don just goes on murders, murders.

572
00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:26.710
Then Dave goes on lights, the place on fire.

573
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:32.470
Pisses gasoline on the flames. Then afterwards he and I go on stage together.

574
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.900
And what do you take to get Una with the crowd?

575
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.530
Don Males got a microphone and he's doing in the crop of 20 fucking 5,000

576
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:42.020
people. People are rushing the stage. It's madness. I mean man, it's,

577
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.980
what questions did you get? So random French bitch. People are just there.

578
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.810
Everyone's drunk. Sure. Dave. Hey,

579
00:32:47.811 --> 00:32:52.610
the show is five hours old by the time this is happening. I'm not exaggerating.

580
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.930
We go on state.

581
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:59.050
The show's supposed to start at eight probably starts at (830) 910-1112 the show

582
00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:04.190
was at least at least three and a half, four hours old by the time was over.

583
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.100
So the show ends like 1230 ish.

584
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:11.960
We go immediately from the arena straight to a movie theater that David rented

585
00:33:11.961 --> 00:33:12.560
out.

586
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.700
We have a private screening of once upon a time in Hollywood at one o'clock in

587
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:17.410
the morning,

588
00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.510
Dave's eating mushrooms that some fucking guy gave him in the crowd.

589
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:24.980
Did you eat them too? Oh fool me once.

590
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:29.120
Shame on you twice. Shame on me. Oh, is that us? Up there yet,

591
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:34.240
bro was nuts. It was nuts. You like the movie long at one in the morning.

592
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.780
We got out of there four 30 in the morning.

593
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.900
Then we get on a jet in the morning at 10 we fly to salt lake city and

594
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.420
immediately everybody gets a ivy vitamin drip with a date set up.

595
00:33:46.551 --> 00:33:51.090
I own, yeah. B12 shots. These motherfuckers go rock style,

596
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.730
rockstar style.

597
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:56.330
Dave's got sunglasses on the entire time the whole crew was getting,

598
00:33:56.331 --> 00:34:00.800
he has a potty with him. He brings his own photographer. It was madness. Legend.

599
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.590
I was like, okay, I see how you guys are doing. Oh, we get, by the way,

600
00:34:03.591 --> 00:34:07.790
we get picked up at the, at the airport in a tour bus. It takes a tour bus.

601
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.200
10 minutes in a tour bus to the airport from the airport to the hotel and you're

602
00:34:12.201 --> 00:34:15.900
flying privately. Why? Why? Why drive around in STV?

603
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.060
We could drive in a fucking tour bus for fucking, it's hilarious. Wow.

604
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:22.940
So much fun. How did this get, but this was what I was wondering.

605
00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.250
So were you and Dave at the store and Dave was like,

606
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.260
who asks who like you're both titans. Dave called up my, well,

607
00:34:30.261 --> 00:34:32.630
he called up his agent like I want to do a show with Joe Rogan.

608
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:37.310
And then his agent calls up my agent and they call me and I go, I'm in,

609
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.490
let's do it. And then then you guys texts out to Ellie kill. It's going down.

610
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.060
We didn't even tell them this is all business [inaudible] at the arena.

611
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.230
Well look, I love that guy. So he didn't know each other and we see each other.

612
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.960
He says, you know when, when they say it, I'm like, yeah, let's do it.

613
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.100
Oh it sounds like an awesome idea. And I'm free that weekend. Great idea.

614
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.310
It was only like five weeks out. The show sells out in 24 hours.

615
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.280
He doesn't have social media. No,

616
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:04.520
but that was the thing is that since he doesn't have social media and I do it

617
00:35:04.521 --> 00:35:08.210
like magnifies everything because with all the fucking people that I have 7

618
00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.320
million on Instagram and 5 million on Twitter, 2 million on Facebook, it's like,

619
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.860
oh that shit. And then the Po, I don't even think I mentioned it on the podcast.

620
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.870
We didn't think we had to have two. It's sold out.

621
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:23.120
So it's like secret shows that sell out in like 30 seconds. Exactly.

622
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.630
Well he does a lot of clubs and theaters and does whatever he wants.

623
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:31.160
He said he's a free bird. You know what I'm saying? Like he's free.

624
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.390
He just does whatever he wants. He wears his own clothes too. He does.

625
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:39.270
You notice that he's on his show, right? I love it, man. I can love it.

626
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.840
He's w he's living wild man. It's beautiful. You guys can do more together.

627
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.490
Yeah. Where are you scheduling them?

628
00:35:44.491 --> 00:35:46.470
I can't say anything because they're not so schools.

629
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.410
So we had a great goddamn tied to what drives me nuts.

630
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.370
That's for any artists out there. Your guys is art and I s I I text you this,

631
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.210
you to take this everyone. You two are fucking legends, man.

632
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:02.360
For you to to get together and do shows is insane and to use like a shit that

633
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.250
mere or use to promote the shows drove drove me nuts. That's nonsense.

634
00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.320
It's not though. Joke for the fans.

635
00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.920
If you get a dope fucking artists do something like you and Dave Chappelle,

636
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.590
it's not for you. I'm sure we will in the future.

637
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:20.460
Any artists please may run off some tee shirts, uh, in Salt Lake City.

638
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.730
Just a small batch for the fuck of it. There's one, I sent a Jamie,

639
00:36:23.731 --> 00:36:28.260
it's Jay z and m and M in New York like two times. Come together. Oh Man.

640
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.650
When I saw what you guys are posting, I was like, oh mother. Fuck yeah.

641
00:36:31.651 --> 00:36:35.810
You worry about that too much. I don't know. I don't, I'm a fan and that,

642
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.130
that things at that, that's a history.

643
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.420
We'll iron that out because we're going to do a gang more of these so we'll iron

644
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:45.480
all that shit out. Hey, I'm sure Dave cares, but he doesn't have social media.

645
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.590
No, he doesn't give a funny social media closing though.

646
00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.820
He doesn't even pay attention. He's,

647
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:53.820
he's the freest guy I've ever met in terms of not being locked into his phone.

648
00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:56.790
He doesn't even look at his phone. I didn't even have it on him. Let's meet.

649
00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.571
He's got a phone,

650
00:36:57.571 --> 00:37:00.510
but he don't look at it and fuck with and he didn't care his phone calls,

651
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.720
you know, it's like he, he facetimes people and Shit.

652
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.400
He's not checking social media at all.

653
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.820
Did you learn anything from him just being around him? Well that is interesting.

654
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:09.960
Well this is what I learned.

655
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.990
There's levels to everything and he's on this like super celebrity rock star

656
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:20.760
level. That is really weird. It's really weird. But he's so nice.

657
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.660
He's so like, he's so fun to be around.

658
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.560
Like part of why Dave is so funny is because he's fun.

659
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:33.150
Like when you're around him it's not like he's serious and then he goes on stage

660
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.740
and then he's funny. No all day long is all day long.

661
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:42.450
It's like legs slapping and looking me in the eyes and fucking cracking and high

662
00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:47.010
five and it's fun, man. He's a fun dude. But he's also,

663
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.850
he's very wise, he's wise in his approach to like for instance,

664
00:37:50.851 --> 00:37:53.310
he lives in the middle of Ohio in a fucking farm.

665
00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:58.170
And that's by design because he does away from all the noise to get away from

666
00:37:58.171 --> 00:38:00.540
all the fucking noise. Man. He wants, you know,

667
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:04.290
he wants peace and quiet mixed in with these inner intermittent bouts of

668
00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:08.610
madness. So he has these crazy radio city music hall shows.

669
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:12.400
And similar to you though. Well you don't live in fricking no, but I,

670
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.010
but eventually I'm going to move out of California. How dare you. Yeah,

671
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.560
no, not that much time, I think pretty soon. No. Yeah. You mean get a place,

672
00:38:22.561 --> 00:38:25.230
but you're still going to be here. I'm going to eventually store and shit.

673
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.620
I'm gonna eventually move. Yeah. Yeah. For good. Yeah. Okay. I'm going keep,

674
00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.330
I'm gonna keep a place here and uh,

675
00:38:32.331 --> 00:38:34.830
I'm probably gonna still do shows out of this studio.

676
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:37.090
I'll fly in to do them like a,

677
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:40.840
probably wind up banking them like doing them in a week and then taking the rest

678
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:44.620
of the month off. Wow. Yeah. I don't want to beat, what about the store?

679
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.620
There's two, well, I love the store, but you know,

680
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:52.350
I also love the Improv and doing a lot of Improv shows. ISS is amazing.

681
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.010
I'm still going to do shows,

682
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.180
but I really think that there's something that's taxing about the volume of

683
00:38:58.181 --> 00:39:01.390
people here that bothers me. Especially with kids when I yeah.

684
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:04.330
And when I came back from Italy and I was in Italy for 12 days,

685
00:39:04.331 --> 00:39:08.170
when I came back like to the fucking highway at,

686
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.520
we landed at like 10 o'clock at night, just bumper to bumper on the three, five.

687
00:39:12.521 --> 00:39:17.110
I was like this is stupid. This is stupid place to live. Cause I travel so much.

688
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.480
I mean I could travel out of Denver, you know,

689
00:39:19.481 --> 00:39:22.570
I could live in Denver and travel out of their crowd as fuck too though.

690
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.980
Mine's bad. Not as bad month moving there. It's a beast.

691
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.730
It's blown up. It's a lot. Maybe Montana,

692
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.770
there's places to live that are more peaceful. Yeah.

693
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:38.920
But are you going to be satisfied not doing sets every night at the store, man?

694
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.310
Uh, there's no way. Like your happiness, you know what I'm saying? Like it's,

695
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:47.260
it's a weird balance cause I hear Ya, I hear you.

696
00:39:47.261 --> 00:39:48.910
Where the balance for your family and stuff.

697
00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.290
But like I check off boxes when I go out at night and I can,

698
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:57.760
I see like my, I don't, I don't, you're saying I don't hang out man.

699
00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.700
I hang out the store when I see you there at the Improv,

700
00:40:00.701 --> 00:40:04.480
when I see my friends or this is me hanging out, I checked those boxes on that.

701
00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:08.890
I don't hang out man. And I need that for my own sanity. It's gated,

702
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.700
but I mean I feel like you can also get that when you tour, you know,

703
00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:16.090
you can get that when you go on the weekends. I think I'd have to do more clubs.

704
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.540
I can't just do theaters because I really feel like it's a numbers thing.

705
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.930
Like in terms of a,

706
00:40:20.931 --> 00:40:24.560
almost like if you're doing cardio or you can't do hard cardio once a week in

707
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.190
Spec, expect to be in shape. You,

708
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:28.990
you won't be in shape to do a bunch do it many, many times a week.

709
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.770
So if you're going to live somewhere other than La,

710
00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:35.320
I feel like you have to do at least five sets a week.

711
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:36.700
I think that's the magic number.

712
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.810
So I think you'd have to do a weekend where you're doing two shows a night.

713
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.840
Friday, two shows a night, Saturday, and you'd have to do a week night.

714
00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:46.900
So Monday and Friday. So yeah, you have to do something like that Thursday,

715
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:47.890
Friday, Saturday, or Friday, Saturday,

716
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:51.160
Sunday where you could open your own club in mind is better than Thursday.

717
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.690
Then Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Sunday can suck my dick. Yeah. Sundays at night.

718
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.110
That's the Lord's Day. Brahma, urban night. Right. Everybody's exhausted.

719
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.670
I don't do Sunday. Joey d isn't, I think you enjoyed his.

720
00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.830
Told me never do Sundays. I did it once and I was depressed,

721
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.190
but also then I don't get a day off with my family. Yeah, not good.

722
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.520
I don't work Monday nights and then I don't work Sundays. That's my only rule.

723
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.070
Those are smart days. Yeah. Yeah. I'm the same way with you Sunday and Mondays.

724
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.870
I've been doing it lately. Yeah, and you got to do that.

725
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:22.420
You've gotta have those boundaries where you decide to take nights.

726
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:25.360
I'm going occasionally I'll do on Monday night, but most of the times, not.

727
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.950
Most of the time I take those off.

728
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:32.290
But I think there's a real benefit to not being overrun by the volume of people

729
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:35.060
out here. Is that what you do you think? That's why Dave,

730
00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.330
one of the reasons he excels, you guys are similar with that, where you don't,

731
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:42.230
you're not really tuned in with like the masses meet meeting tune in where

732
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:45.620
you're not glued to your frickin no Twitter, Instagram,

733
00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.160
he's not into going into like red carpet events and getting photos.

734
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.820
You hate that shit. But I just feel like it's a circle jerk, you know?

735
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:55.880
And everybody's just, you know, it's just weird. The, the,

736
00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:59.240
the whole celebrity world is very weird. It's very weird.

737
00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:04.390
But I get how people love when you're famous and then you're around other famous

738
00:42:05.841 --> 00:42:08.600
people. They're the only people that think you're normal. You know?

739
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:12.650
They also understand what you're going through. Yeah. But it's like,

740
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:15.950
I ran into Jamie Fox the other night at a steak house. Again,

741
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:18.990
the rand nicest cancer down the most talented guy in the world. But, uh,

742
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:22.730
but when I see him, it's like, what's that? What are you doing? What's going on,

743
00:42:22.731 --> 00:42:26.360
man. We talking and laughing and joking around. I'm like, he's,

744
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.800
he's never weirded out. He like, he's so famous. He's like,

745
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:36.130
he's probably never gets a chance to be a normal person unless he's around other

746
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.310
famous people. You don't want a picture or an autograph or some,

747
00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.920
you know that movie you did? I'm like, man. Yeah. Yeah. I mean he,

748
00:42:43.921 --> 00:42:45.800
he likes to just hang out and have fun.

749
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.080
I wish you'd get them back on the podcast. He wants to do it.

750
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:50.630
We were talking about like a real long form podcast this time.

751
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.900
He was like pushing a sunglass assumption. Oh yeah, that's right.

752
00:42:53.901 --> 00:42:58.250
He had a sunglass deal. Who's dealing and he's even doing that a great story.

753
00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:58.940
No, I don't.

754
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.940
Probably shackled out some fucking shutter to serious Jamie fucks and those

755
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:09.020
bullshit sunglasses. Yeah, man. It was him and Jeremy Pivot.

756
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.460
They were pushing sunglasses, assumed him and put them together.

757
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.580
Live those sunglasses. Pavements. No, no sunglasses. I don't think.

758
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:20.430
I don't think, no, no. They, the company answer all that snow. Yeah. Yeah.

759
00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:22.100
The thing I think fizzled out,

760
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:24.740
but you gotta figure Jamie Fox to push some classes.

761
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:27.920
You think you need money from your fucking sunglass sales.

762
00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.640
They had to pay him fucking bang.

763
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:33.950
Can I tell him every time I ran to him and a gas station,

764
00:43:33.951 --> 00:43:36.770
some guy pulls up in a fucking car that doesn't even look like it's from this

765
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:41.510
planet. [inaudible] some strange SUV, some weird fucking,

766
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.060
I dunno what it's called, but I looked at, I was like,

767
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:48.620
what the fuck is on those apocalypse tank? We are weird looking thing.

768
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:51.470
It's, I forget what it's based on.

769
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:55.130
It's based on like the frame of a jeep wrangler and they build this insane,

770
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.030
you know like $500,000 fucking SUV on it. I'm like,

771
00:43:59.031 --> 00:44:03.200
who is the window roads down? What's up Joe? It's Jamie Fox. I'm like, oh,

772
00:44:03.201 --> 00:44:05.720
what are you doing Django? I'm like, what is this?

773
00:44:05.721 --> 00:44:08.240
And his friend was selling them. His friends sell those.

774
00:44:08.241 --> 00:44:12.050
Probably gave it to Jay. We didn't try for sure. We sold. Yeah.

775
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:16.490
Almost like this is the craziest thing we've ever seen. It's so weird looking.

776
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.480
You know what it is like boxy. Right. But then they have squeaky little lights.

777
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.110
I'll even find it. Yeah. Just me.

778
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.900
Fox crazy SUV is expensive. Jeep wranglers. But I got so far. Why? I know this,

779
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:32.280
I don't know, but it's a, uh, Chris Brown

780
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.270
<v 0>drives when the new,</v>

781
00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:35.940
his new video where he dances with the house or whatever too. Yeah.

782
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:40.760
They probably given them away to people or sure. As Vani. Yes. Yeah. Let me see.

783
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.980
Let me see what that pitch looks like. Yeah, they're sick. Yeah,

784
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:47.490
that makes sense. Give it to Chris Brown. You know his video. That's it. Yeah,

785
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:50.730
that's it. That's exactly, I think so. Cool.

786
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:55.020
Look at that thing. It's not, it's a, it's fucking robocop.

787
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.620
Like it's dope though. He pulled up, ah,

788
00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:00.960
got the suicide doors in the back and the interior is gorgeous.

789
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:04.980
The engines made based off a jeep wrangler. I don't know what it is.

790
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.700
I don't know what it is yet. There, there you there?

791
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:14.200
That's a dope ride, man. Yeah, it's really incredible. But I hear,

792
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.550
I want one. I mean, they're real expensive, right?

793
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:21.420
I'm 50 180 so I'm like, oh, oh, that's not that bad. Not Terrible.

794
00:45:21.421 --> 00:45:23.030
I thought it was like a half a million, maybe two. I was going,

795
00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.120
I thought at least three 5,500 horsepower efficient.

796
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.460
180 wow. Isn't it funny that 500 horse probably used to be insanity?

797
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:35.100
Me and my brother were talking about this on that. My brother is a huge car.

798
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.980
We're talking about this and I just got my uh,

799
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:42.780
Freud over 800 and I mean Jay phrase,

800
00:45:42.781 --> 00:45:46.650
I just got my four run over 800 so ridiculous horsepower, so ridiculous.

801
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:50.430
Here's the thing, they're going to come out while they, the TDF in,

802
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.060
they have a TDF version of mine. They only be six on the DF. It's the,

803
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:58.410
the s like the souped up a virgin of mine. It's the race version.

804
00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.370
They only made 600 of them and that comes stock with like 817 horsepower.

805
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.470
But then they then for I went, cool story.

806
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:09.471
We're coming out with eight 12 super fast V12 tents for the Tour de France,

807
00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.070
but they can't call it the tour to fancy stuff called TDF cause Tour de France.

808
00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.470
The fucking the [inaudible]. The bike boys own it.

809
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.910
Did you see that shit where this guy had a super fast and he's apparently a very

810
00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:25.911
famous designer and he put his sneakers on the roof of this dope fucking Ferrari

811
00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.240
that he owns. He owns this crazy green Ferrari. Super fast. Yes,

812
00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.700
it's gorgeous. And he put his sneakers,

813
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:37.730
which are green as well on the frog and Ferrari sent him like a cease and desist

814
00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.891
and they threatened him.

815
00:46:38.891 --> 00:46:43.770
This Guy Philip plein lashes out a frog overseas and does this letter but like

816
00:46:43.771 --> 00:46:47.010
look at the photo. It's an alligator jacket. Look CEO's.

817
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.910
Apparently I asked my wife and this guy is a fit. Look how dope that color is.

818
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:55.240
I'm not usually in the a green car that that lizard green looking amazing.

819
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.150
It makes the GT three in it, but that's, I like the metallic. Yeah,

820
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.560
there's like the hot electric green. Yeah.

821
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.230
See if there's any other pictures of his car. But look at that.

822
00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.320
He's got these dope sneakers and they're sitting on his Ferrari and Ferrari was

823
00:47:07.321 --> 00:47:10.980
angry. They were like, you're using our brand or something like that.

824
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.590
Oh because w I'm trying to think cause he painted green.

825
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:17.760
Then are those his shoes and it's with the Ferrari so that like can be said for

826
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.420
robberies,

827
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:23.420
trademarks and model cars are are associated in your pictures with a lifestyle.

828
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:29.121
Totally inconsistent with Ferrari's brand perception in connection with

829
00:47:29.351 --> 00:47:30.010
performers

830
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:35.010
<v 1>making sexual innuendos and using Ferrari cars as props in a manner which is per</v>

831
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.600
se distasteful.

832
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.850
This behavior tarnishes the reputation of Ferrari's brands and causes Ferrari

833
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.530
further material damage.

834
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.560
In fact the undesirable connection between Ferrari's trademarks on the one hand

835
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:54.400
and Phillip Cleans Line of shoes and the questionable manner in which they are

836
00:47:54.401 --> 00:47:59.401
promoted on the other hand is interfering negatively with the rights enjoyed by

837
00:47:59.471 --> 00:48:03.880
Ferrari's selected licenses which are exclusively entitled to use Ferrari's

838
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:08.870
trademarks to produce and promote line of shoes for our bread as non.

839
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:13.120
That's why I love for I [inaudible] branded shoes. Fuck yeah they do. They sell,

840
00:48:13.121 --> 00:48:16.510
you know they sell more Mertz than cars. They make their money off merge.

841
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.960
But this guy is a very successful designer.

842
00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:23.290
His stuff is very expensive. It's like Ferrari. No,

843
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:28.090
you get that Shit Outta here. That shit fry. Holler to boy halter boy.

844
00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.700
Nah, I'm just kidding dude. No. Here's the thing.

845
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:33.040
He probably got allocated the super fast cause you can't,

846
00:48:33.041 --> 00:48:35.470
you know how Friday where she can't just walk in the store and buy one.

847
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:38.610
So you got allocated one. So he probably owned other V12.

848
00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:41.920
It's a crazy lots like Ferrari's for 10 years. He said, there you go.

849
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:45.550
So he gets allocated the new ones. So he probably had access to the TDF.

850
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:49.180
Then he got a super fast and then in painted green like an asshole,

851
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:54.040
which cool color green. Now he can't, well he might've had it may paint a show.

852
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:58.240
I don't know. I don't think fry offers that green. He tried. No, no way. No,

853
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.360
he did that to himself. That's why Fry's like Jesus Christ. Dude, be cool.

854
00:49:01.361 --> 00:49:05.320
Really? Yeah. You don't think Ferrari offers that color? I don't think so.

855
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:09.250
I wouldn't doubt it. You ever seen another fry? If they did,

856
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:13.300
he probably paid such a premium for that color cause they don't make that color.

857
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:15.580
Well, the only one I've seen in the flesh is yours.

858
00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:18.790
I've never seen one of those cars before. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

859
00:49:18.791 --> 00:49:22.690
I see one of them at a dealership. I saw a,

860
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.850
there's only 700 of them in the states. I saw a, uh, gray like that.

861
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:31.090
Battleship gray. God, it made my Dick Card.

862
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:36.670
Certain cars do. Man, I want so many cars. I know. It's crazy, right? Yeah,

863
00:49:36.671 --> 00:49:39.040
man. It's a problem with cars. I'll tell you that. I love,

864
00:49:39.041 --> 00:49:42.070
I absolutely love Ferrari. I'm a fro. I love Ferrari.

865
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:47.490
There's nothing like a Porsche. I owe it. I've terms of driving Bentleys.

866
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.600
You named. I've had all the cars.

867
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.950
There's nothing as far as the driving experience, but in the Porsche. Yeah. No,

868
00:49:53.951 --> 00:49:55.660
I think I have to always have a portrait.

869
00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.840
The reason why I still have that 2007 gt three Rs,

870
00:49:58.841 --> 00:50:01.930
the char quirks worked on every discards ever. Every time I get in there,

871
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:06.070
I get happy. It just feels amazing. It's just [inaudible]. Wow.

872
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:08.220
And also can feel him.

873
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.700
I want a goddamn manual transmission to the portion is the last of the Mohicans.

874
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.780
They still don't do it though for the gt three Rs and they still don't do it for

875
00:50:16.781 --> 00:50:20.080
the gt two rs, the Gt three Turing,

876
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.750
the Gt three and the gt three touring. They'll,

877
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:25.360
they'll sell you with a manual trends, which, which is what, yeah,

878
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:28.010
I want to get one of those to the new corvette. Abandoned

879
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.780
<v 0>the manual. I know. Fast as fuck. No, that I agree. Comment.</v>

880
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.720
I mean, you drive a Tesla but so,

881
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:40.720
but the corvette to me it looks bad as they completely ripped off Ferrari.

882
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:44.210
I mean that's a, I mean, come on some mid engine car. Mid Engine car. Yeah,

883
00:50:44.211 --> 00:50:48.320
but I have a 65 corvette with a giant Hirsch shifter with a fucking cue ball.

884
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:53.090
The cue ball shift. That's the real guy. That's America. I know.

885
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.560
I not pipes bitch. I know. Oh, I don't want one of those Corbett's though.

886
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.690
They look cool, but I don't want dope man.

887
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.830
You when the Zr one comes out and it goes zero to 16 three milliseconds.

888
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.130
It's not all about zero to 60 I'm not vin diesel.

889
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:09.170
I don't live my life one quarter mile at a time.

890
00:51:09.171 --> 00:51:13.880
Guess who else is in Vin diesel? Vin Diesel. Yeah, you right. You right fucker.

891
00:51:13.881 --> 00:51:18.110
Wear sunglasses at night. Yeah, he does. Yeah, he does. You know he's going to,

892
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.920
he's quietly becoming a billionaire from the fast and furious franchise cause he

893
00:51:21.921 --> 00:51:26.600
owns it. Yeah. So like, yeah, tis so like universal, the rides and all that.

894
00:51:26.601 --> 00:51:30.800
He's quite becoming a billion is probably in a castle somewhere doing Caligula's

895
00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.240
shit and fucking dudes.

896
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.330
You don't get those vibe from him. Even when he's in the life beater,

897
00:51:38.331 --> 00:51:43.070
like barbecuing all the time. He's barbecuing and passive beers. I do too,

898
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:47.540
but in a beater for a wife, Peter, my wife yells at me.

899
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:51.880
She doesn't let me wear those. I could go shirtless. Rightfully so.

900
00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:57.160
Rightfully so. If I have a wife beater on,

901
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:00.500
she'll start making fun of me. That's given, it's so old to go.

902
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.540
Remember that video? What's he done by fucking thing in the Beyonce? Oh,

903
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.310
there's nothing better than that going viral. What's going on with his pants?

904
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:10.340
Why they're so low. I can't, I'm not gonna show up.

905
00:52:10.341 --> 00:52:14.300
I just went viral on the show. Joe Doe drunk in love.

906
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:18.350
What is he doing? This is the longest three minutes.

907
00:52:18.351 --> 00:52:21.300
He made it himself and we can't play this. The song will get it.

908
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.880
They can hear the audio. Those unnecessary. Just the dancing is on this dude.

909
00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.250
He's celebrating like his movie. You went, I don't know,

910
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:31.250
platinum or some shit like that, so he does drunk in love.

911
00:52:31.251 --> 00:52:35.090
He does a cover of him singing kit. Kill this before. Throw it. Can you hear it?

912
00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:38.960
Listen, I'm on team rock. You do not leave here one quarter mile at a time.

913
00:52:38.961 --> 00:52:43.880
If you're doing that. I'm on team to rock all day every day.

914
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:47.780
He's feeling himself in the block. Don't get along. They hate each other.

915
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.460
How does that, everything happened there.

916
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.730
I heard Brock was a big deal on set clock diva.

917
00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:56.900
That's what I heard from who people. What'd you hear that are in the,

918
00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.940
that were on the set? Just that, you know,

919
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.540
the rock sometimes shows up late and there's trailers and he wanted the biggest

920
00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:07.280
trailer and obviously been diesel. You know, he's Mr fucking fast and furious.

921
00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:11.300
Who knows who's right. Listen, he just did Beyonce cover. So I don't know.

922
00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.390
16 rules. Yeah, let's kill that team.

923
00:53:15.391 --> 00:53:19.760
Rock kids fast and furious have to follow onset. What? There's rules.

924
00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:22.100
Certain guys can't get hit a certain amount of times.

925
00:53:22.101 --> 00:53:25.710
They have to win fights and certain ways, you know though,

926
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:29.160
you know the rock and go back to that, that sounded, just go back to it.

927
00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.080
[inaudible] you know, but this isn't the best.

928
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.080
Do you have to go to racing school in Las Vegas? That, that makes sense.

929
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:37.900
That doesn't look fast and fierce, but you know, the rock of indies will,

930
00:53:37.901 --> 00:53:39.990
couldn't be on set at the same time. They hate each other so bad.

931
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:43.170
They just shoot different scenes and like, like shoot it.

932
00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:45.660
So it looked like someone was there. They hate each other so much.

933
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.000
The Rock gotten a big thing with Tyrese too, right by tires.

934
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:55.110
Just flipping out because like all he has is fast and furious so that when the

935
00:53:55.111 --> 00:53:59.880
rock did a spinoff, he's like, how dare you? We're a family. Rock was like, no,

936
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:02.910
we're not. Well Damien spin off dumb ass.

937
00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:06.660
But remember when the Rock was shitting on his music? That was fantastic.

938
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.550
Let cause rock is so positive.

939
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:13.060
Tyrese Gibson reignites fast feud with Dwayne Johnson calls spinoff.

940
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.910
Hobson Shaws not a win video. Why is he crying? He went crazy.

941
00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:22.080
He went crazy for a shine. This is all I've got and he has will Smith for money.

942
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.040
That's what he's mad about.

943
00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:27.030
Why do you Ras will Smith for money fell on hard times. He said, yeah,

944
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.700
the video. Here's the thing. People lose their mind, man.

945
00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.680
The actors really lose their mind.

946
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:34.050
They will quit cause you're pretending to be someone else all the time.

947
00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.860
Separate the rock. Not good for you. That guy, you know what he does?

948
00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:40.570
He just goes to the gym. The rock with two hours sleep. A lot of steroids. Yeah,

949
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.870
Thick Gel. Do you really think he's getting big like that from cocaine again

950
00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.730
and again? He used to cocaine. No, I'm saying the Jon Jones thing,

951
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:55.060
but I'm just saying like anyone, it, me,

952
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:58.020
me and Burt cries. We're talking about this thing. Burt's can make a bit of it,

953
00:54:58.021 --> 00:55:02.070
but when you see the Rock, you know how this is working out?

954
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.060
Two hours of sleep for sure. He's doing that stuff, man. He's grinding.

955
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:06.900
He's on private jets.

956
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:11.680
He is loaded on performance enhancing drugs too.

957
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.760
So his body is pulsing.

958
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.640
As your boys are going statutes say with fuck,

959
00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.420
I don't know Bro. I don't know. I don't know Bro. Jason, stay them in the rock.

960
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:28.280
Refuse to lose fights against one another. Jason State them. Come on Bro. Uh,

961
00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.570
Jason settled down. Yep. How about you bro? How about you?

962
00:55:30.571 --> 00:55:35.340
Really fighting in that determines what happens. You weigh 170 pounds.

963
00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.190
He used to be an Olympic swimmer. You know that he's a bad motherfucker though.

964
00:55:38.191 --> 00:55:41.000
Jason stayed them. But the rock is an enormous human. Well,

965
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.340
how are they the same height there? That doesn't make any sense.

966
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:48.150
That's just strange. Is he on a box? That doesn't make any sense. Okay.

967
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:50.940
[inaudible] egocentric demands are nothing new on how,

968
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:54.330
first of all we don't know if this is true and this is the Guardian,

969
00:55:54.331 --> 00:55:57.420
which is kind of a nonsense website, so let's just stop reading.

970
00:55:57.421 --> 00:56:01.710
It's interesting though and then you'd know it's also probably true behind the

971
00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:05.640
movies here he's told the Wall Street Journal paywall that actors including

972
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:06.721
Jason's t them Dwayne,

973
00:56:06.721 --> 00:56:10.440
the Rock Johnson and Vinnie's off contracts demanding that limit the amount of

974
00:56:10.441 --> 00:56:10.980
punishment.

975
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:13.920
There's characters taking fights because they don't want to look like bitches.

976
00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.640
You imagine telling your agent that like I'm down to do it. Bam.

977
00:56:17.641 --> 00:56:20.010
I read through the script when he punches me in the face,

978
00:56:20.011 --> 00:56:22.950
I'm not going down bro. I'm not doing it. You imagine doing that.

979
00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.620
That's so crazy. Thank you for your group of friends. Where around you like,

980
00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:28.150
dude, what the fuck are you doing? What's up Jason?

981
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.990
Diesel sisters report to have been president on set asking for her brother was

982
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:36.991
going to get his licks back in that could she been joking around?

983
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.910
My sister might say that too. If she saw me in a movie, get my ass kicked,

984
00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.740
cause fuck him up. We'd play laughing together, slap her in the face.

985
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:47.710
Can I get my licks back in?

986
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:51.670
We know it's fake bitch talking about I'm also making $100 million.

987
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:55.020
You'd whip my ass every seen for that money.

988
00:56:55.030 --> 00:57:00.030
It's funny when a movie franchise just gets bananas huge like that.

989
00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:02.920
Just so big and vin diesel is like, yeah, cool man.

990
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.710
But he's always doing a million things at once.

991
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:09.880
I have never seen or is he just doing facet? What else is he doing bro?

992
00:57:10.140 --> 00:57:14.260
Well he's got a television show. Well, yes he does. He's in diesel. Yeah,

993
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:18.130
like a a game show. Fear factor type television show.

994
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:23.340
He is always doing something. He's also doing Jumanji. He did a new Jumanji.

995
00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.470
You talking about the rock? Oh, you don't have to rock rock. What'd you say?

996
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:30.970
Vin Diesel. They're all, he does videos. He goes, I'm going to make $1 billion.

997
00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:34.840
Suck that David ds or the rock you said Vin diesel. I'm sorry, drunk.

998
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:38.590
Unless he's fixing the rides at universal studios is always doing a million

999
00:57:38.591 --> 00:57:41.470
different things at once. Always. He's got borrowers on HBO,

1000
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:44.860
he's got 'em that that TV show that he does,

1001
00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:49.720
which is like some crazy fucking fear factor type deal. He's got Jumanji,

1002
00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:52.750
he's always filming a million different [inaudible] movies. Here's the thing,

1003
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.500
do that again. To my point, lot of steroids,

1004
00:57:56.850 --> 00:58:00.190
lot of before Anson drugs and I'm all about it. I have no problem with this,

1005
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.940
but let's tell the kids like it is like, I thought Arnold was an, I was like,

1006
00:58:03.941 --> 00:58:06.580
man, hopefully I can get there one day. If I keep it in the gym, I wish my dad,

1007
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.030
I'm like, ah, it's never happening man. We got to inject some shit in your ass.

1008
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.960
Forgot to vin diesel. Listen in the Avengers. What? What? He's crude.

1009
00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.380
Oh,

1010
00:58:17.381 --> 00:58:20.610
he's the voice of due to the Gow cause I take some 30 minutes,

1011
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:24.310
I take some 30 minutes to do that. Yeah. Um,

1012
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.080
you know what else does that trip that I did with Chappelle that opened my eyes.

1013
00:58:29.110 --> 00:58:31.710
Do you ever done when those things are done? Ivy Ivy violence.

1014
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:35.200
Whereby in brother I swept it up a bag and a half and I was ready to run through

1015
00:58:35.201 --> 00:58:38.170
a wall. And it was three hours from your house? Yeah, they'll come anywhere.

1016
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.130
They came to our hotel room. Yeah, I get them at the crib all the time.

1017
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:45.160
My girl's pregnant again. We have another one coming November and uh,

1018
00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:50.530
for the nausea we, we get ivs, I swear. Oh Dude. Two night and day.

1019
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:54.850
It's amazing for like pumping you up [inaudible] Vegas side to get it.

1020
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:56.830
What'd you, we had a,

1021
00:58:56.860 --> 00:59:01.420
you had a show there and like I showed up wasted I think type of like the New

1022
00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:05.140
Year's eve UFC. I like to wake up when I had to get it had to get done.

1023
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.500
You felt so much better minutes. 20 minutes. I was good to go. It's crazy.

1024
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:12.250
It's crazy. You know what's crazy to me is the UFC doesn't allow, well,

1025
00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:16.930
it's feels so good. You can mask the use of performance enhancing drug haters,

1026
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:21.620
Bro. God speaking to performance enhancing drugs.

1027
00:59:21.890 --> 00:59:22.070
Let's

1028
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.390
<v 1>talk about the Cyborg situation. I knew you're going to go there.</v>

1029
00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:28.940
How about that? See Dana go hard in the paint.

1030
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:32.300
You know what I like when he goes hard in the paint? He's, he only got listen,

1031
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:37.010
say what you want about Dana and I do like it. Like we always say,

1032
00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:39.560
can you imagine if another commissioner did this? Another owner did this,

1033
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:43.490
but I do like when he does spit the cause. What he's saying is the truth.

1034
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.070
Like sometimes he's on one and you're like, what the fuck you talking about?

1035
00:59:46.071 --> 00:59:48.950
You're screwing these guys over. Then sometimes like with the cyber thing,

1036
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.610
when you send that to me, like I agree with them 100% I love when he does that.

1037
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:54.920
Well, they fucked up and they really fucked up.

1038
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:57.560
Let me try work's team Cyborg's team, whoever did it,

1039
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:02.650
whether it's her boyfriend or whoever it was that edited that video that lied

1040
01:00:02.931 --> 01:00:06.530
and put words in his mouth is so fucking stupid.

1041
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:09.410
You don't think that they're going to do something about that.

1042
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:13.250
You're out of your goddamn mind when they edited that video to say that whenever

1043
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:16.640
I'm talking public, I'm not telling the truth, which is not what he said at all.

1044
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.850
And then to have it edit and cut right there. Well,

1045
01:00:18.851 --> 01:00:23.210
I'll tell you this right now, Dan, Dana's too smart it, let's say he would,

1046
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.360
let's say he thinks that you think he would say that in a public form to Cyborg

1047
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:30.010
when they're face to face like that.

1048
01:00:30.011 --> 01:00:32.390
And you don't think you realize there's cameras around. No,

1049
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:35.150
he's way too smart for that. So eight that I'm like, well,

1050
01:00:35.151 --> 01:00:39.020
he's not that dumb be that video was, you can tell it's so full of shit.

1051
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:42.200
Same thing happening with, with me and Nate Diaz had our confrontation.

1052
01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.160
I didn't say any of that stuff. Someone made that all up. Yeah.

1053
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:50.630
Well what also they did was they're bringing back shit that happened five years

1054
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:52.520
ago. Like Cyborg was saying.

1055
01:00:52.521 --> 01:00:56.600
She wanted an apology from me and I don't think it was that she wanted apology

1056
01:00:56.601 --> 01:01:00.470
from me. I think it was her boyfriend or someone on a team. I apologize to her.

1057
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.550
Me and her.

1058
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:06.260
No one around face to face and I took a photo with her afterwards.

1059
01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:09.860
There's a photo of me and her on my Instagram. Would you say you're just like,

1060
01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:12.860
hey, me and my guys were shooting around starting on fighting in the UFC.

1061
01:01:12.861 --> 01:01:17.060
She hadn't fought in UFC before and I said, Hey, I'm sorry about the jokes.

1062
01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.310
I promise no more jokes. And I said,

1063
01:01:19.311 --> 01:01:24.110
I am actually a fan of yours and I want you to succeed in the UFC and I wish you

1064
01:01:24.111 --> 01:01:26.870
the best of luck. I go, no hard feelings. She goes, no, those, you know,

1065
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:29.420
those jokes kind of hurt my feelings and I said, I'm sorry. I go,

1066
01:01:29.421 --> 01:01:30.860
I promise no more jokes.

1067
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:35.450
I gave her a hug and we took a picture together and that was a, when was that?

1068
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:38.540
2017 here's the only time where I'm like,

1069
01:01:38.541 --> 01:01:42.650
God damn man is sure kids getting bullied at school because of the,

1070
01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:45.640
didn't know she had a kid. Oh yeah, yeah. How many kids did show up?

1071
01:01:45.830 --> 01:01:50.060
She has one daughter I think in like fourth grade and she goes because of the

1072
01:01:50.061 --> 01:01:53.870
narrative that the UFC painted, right or wrong. I get it from the UFC side.

1073
01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.620
Doesn't mean to try narrative that she's this heel.

1074
01:01:57.621 --> 01:02:00.950
She's this monster pds, right? Yeah,

1075
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:04.910
but that's because she tested positive once. We don't talk about John Jones,

1076
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:06.620
he's talks about possible more than once.

1077
01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:11.240
First of all there's Jon Jones got tested positive for this tiny amount of

1078
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:13.660
something that probably came from a tainted supplement.

1079
01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:17.840
She tested positive for a serious steroid and something that you,

1080
01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:23.260
you're like a woman taking a steroid is different than a man taking a stone with

1081
01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.510
a takeout female male, which is tough to do here, but it is. There's,

1082
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:29.130
there's been people who have tested positive before where that's not their

1083
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:33.240
narrative. Brock Lesnar. Yeah, but it is Brock Lesnar's narrative.

1084
01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.800
It's also Alister Overeem's narrative. Is it,

1085
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:40.590
is it beats or is it t r t v to u of C doesn't tell you that though.

1086
01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.653
They're not market.

1087
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:45.720
The fans do kind of marketing the fact that Stipe's hardware was taking

1088
01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:46.920
steroids, that oh,

1089
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:50.310
their market are into this kind of heel roll dog where if you know her,

1090
01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:53.250
she's awesome. But no, the marketer's destroyer,

1091
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.360
which she is in her career is scary and destroy, but also, yeah, in a good way.

1092
01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.510
Look, if you look at her fights, you look at the fight with, look,

1093
01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:05.670
the way it gets dark is when you go back to the non testing days like the Gina

1094
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:06.410
Carano fight,

1095
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:09.280
which had veins coming out of her face and she looked like Gina Chrono murder.

1096
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.460
This sweat. My argument for, I don't mean to interrupt you,

1097
01:03:11.461 --> 01:03:15.960
but Gina Carano ate the hottest Chica to ever fight MMA.

1098
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.860
B fought Cyborg when she was juiced to the Gills and did pretty well.

1099
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:21.560
They put go back and watch her at one point,

1100
01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:25.560
but eventually out to Gina Chrono eventually got beaten down and there's a

1101
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:26.101
video.

1102
01:03:26.101 --> 01:03:31.101
There's a picture rather of Cyborg holding Gina's face and punching her and you

1103
01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:35.520
see the black fingernails and she's got this mean look in her face and she's

1104
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:38.710
punching Jean in the face as I bring this one up. Jamie,

1105
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:41.520
you ever seen that picture? I've never seen it, dude. It's,

1106
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:45.120
it's one of those pictures. It was the demise. No, no, no.

1107
01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:48.510
It's a standing photo of a Cyborg punching.

1108
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.540
Is it that one French? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go left. Go left.

1109
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.880
That's French. I love that one about friendship. Bam. That's the photo.

1110
01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:01.050
So look at the black thing. Grab her face like the end punter. Jesus Christ.

1111
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:03.390
The end of the fight. I mean, she's already beaten her down,

1112
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:08.220
but I mean she's holding her face with those black fingernails and just crushing

1113
01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:12.690
Gina's head. She beat the shit out of her, but debt. Gina was a beast man.

1114
01:04:12.691 --> 01:04:14.220
And she hung in there as long as she could.

1115
01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:18.960
But the consensus was that Cyborg was juiced up in that one. That one. Right.

1116
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:21.810
You mark it as beauty and the beast. Right. That's just the way it is.

1117
01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.170
Gina's a gorgeous individual. Cyborg,

1118
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.980
not so much when it comes to the, the feminine,

1119
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:32.460
like the Looks Department. So I get that market beauty and the beast.

1120
01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:36.360
I was taught, I had a Kyla Harrison on, you know who that is? The BFL.

1121
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:41.400
She's a two time gold medalist. A judo judoka Kayla, right? Kayla Harrison.

1122
01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:44.190
Yeah. Monster. And uh, she wants,

1123
01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:47.230
she's in the PFL and she's in the tournament there and she's, uh,

1124
01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.720
she wants to fight Cyborg. Yeah.

1125
01:04:48.721 --> 01:04:51.300
Well there's a lot of people that are wanting to fight. She definitely wants,

1126
01:04:51.301 --> 01:04:54.720
right. Undefeated gold medalists. And I was talking to her about why does,

1127
01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.890
why does she think that kind of Cyborg has gone down this road in her career?

1128
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.440
And then I pitched her on, you know, if I found the UFC in here,

1129
01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.880
this might be completely fucking wrong. I don't know.

1130
01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:08.640
But this is how I would do it and this is what they're doing is what I think.

1131
01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:12.060
But if I'm the USC, as Nice as a person Cyborg is,

1132
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:16.620
there's no other girl walked in this plant that looks like Cyborg really because

1133
01:05:16.621 --> 01:05:21.190
maybe pds to your point or there's a light. When you say maybe like most likely,

1134
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.470
that's what I'm saying. Yeah. I'm trying to be cool. I'm trying to be nice.

1135
01:05:23.471 --> 01:05:23.921
I know you're trying,

1136
01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:27.600
there's a lot of girls that look like paint fans and there's a lot of girls like

1137
01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:29.920
Paige vanzant or Rhonda Rousey or Misha Tate,

1138
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.720
so they're going to push those girls more because that's what people can relate

1139
01:05:34.721 --> 01:05:38.530
to more than a girl like Cyborg and I don't think I'm saying anything.

1140
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:42.970
No one has assumed already and this, and I liked Cyborg,

1141
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.910
the nice person and I don't think Cyborg is a bad person.

1142
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:49.720
I think her management and the way they've handled things have completely fucked

1143
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:53.470
her and I think you're going to battle with the was the worst thing and it's not

1144
01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:54.580
hurt. I don't think it's hurt either.

1145
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:57.330
And I think she is a nice person and every time I've ever phenomenal,

1146
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:59.260
fine interacted with her, I've been luck.

1147
01:05:59.290 --> 01:06:03.370
Even that last fight and that was a thing with the Spencer fight like that,

1148
01:06:03.371 --> 01:06:07.570
people were saying that, oh you guys, it was biased commentary. No, it wasn't.

1149
01:06:07.571 --> 01:06:08.890
That girl survived.

1150
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.830
That girl said [inaudible] you're the greatest calm.

1151
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.680
Taylor will turn eighth pro fight

1152
01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:19.970
ten eight round Cyborg beat duff. Fuck out of her dude. Don't fight.

1153
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:22.000
Wasn't close. No, no, no. It wasn't close,

1154
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:25.120
but the narrative was how tough she was. I'm like, sidebar, he's beaten up,

1155
01:06:25.121 --> 01:06:30.060
bragged on this girl and she cut cyborgs face wide open one with one elbow. Yes.

1156
01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:32.470
Gives a fuck. She got beat up the rest of the fight.

1157
01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:36.460
There's the idea was that she was going to run through that girl and she didn't,

1158
01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:39.580
that girl was tough as shit wasn't, it wasn't a competitive fight,

1159
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:42.790
but she doesn't have striking that was on the level of,

1160
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.200
she doesn't have power to keep cyborg offer. She just does.

1161
01:06:46.201 --> 01:06:48.070
Cyborg lit her up like your Christmas tree.

1162
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:50.500
She got though there was ten eight rounds and I was like, oh that fights.

1163
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.333
I'm close.

1164
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:54.850
No it's not gonna I feel you guys cause it's the Jon Jones things when you go

1165
01:06:54.851 --> 01:06:58.210
into a fight it's like when John doesn't destroy someone.

1166
01:06:58.211 --> 01:07:01.750
You're talking about the other guy and was sidebar to you expected just a Merck?

1167
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.050
This cargo Santos was way closer. I mean that was a way closer fight.

1168
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.910
Thiago Santos was a 1.1 some rounds. Well this is a split decision for sure.

1169
01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.690
Yeah. Some one judge thought that Tiago won the fight.

1170
01:07:13.691 --> 01:07:16.870
I don't agree with that challenge but that's how close that fight was.

1171
01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:20.530
There was no one that thought that Spencer won that fight after it was over.

1172
01:07:20.531 --> 01:07:24.520
But it was amazing that she was able to endure the fucking beating this I've

1173
01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:28.280
were put on her. It was incredibly tough girl. None the saying no,

1174
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:33.610
but it's actually one of those fights where it really like no one's clamoring

1175
01:07:33.611 --> 01:07:36.640
for that fight in the first place. Who was asking for that fight? Not me.

1176
01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:41.680
Other than her. Yeah. I'm excited for the fight card next weekend in him.

1177
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:45.040
Cause the cards. I don't know if you agree with this.

1178
01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:48.700
The cards up to this point of being dog shit. The main events have been good,

1179
01:07:48.701 --> 01:07:51.060
but other than that they've been Gotcha. But I think you're doing homework.

1180
01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:55.210
There's so many. The main events have been great. Other than that been awful.

1181
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.360
Carts Anaheim. This can be amazing. Again. What else?

1182
01:07:58.361 --> 01:08:00.950
Who else fought this past weekend? I looked at the card.

1183
01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:03.370
I mean I don't know what to say. Other fights in the undercard.

1184
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:07.330
There was some good fights. [inaudible] mailers, clique. Guido was wild.

1185
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:10.390
Jim Mueller, quick widow. It was fucking wild. That was wild.

1186
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.550
But in terms of like title implications, yeah, this is the big one this weekend.

1187
01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:20.030
[inaudible] you got Yo Romero next weekends as Paul goes next. Next,

1188
01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.940
next weekend. Yeah. Yo El Ramiro versus polar coaster,

1189
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.430
which is best body contest of all time. First team. All diamond. Yeah.

1190
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:31.520
Amazing fight too. I mean Kosta is just on a fucking rampage to golden snitches.

1191
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:36.440
Just like Bella's. Yeah. Yeah fellas. Well, the deal,

1192
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:38.750
Yo, Al was the freak of all freaks. You know what I mean?

1193
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:42.380
He is the freak host is no punky. There was no body. No both of them.

1194
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:45.620
Both of them were beasts. That's an amazing fight. As long as the bay DC,

1195
01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.900
which to me is so interesting.

1196
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:49.910
You know what to it wasn't that interesting to me too.

1197
01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:53.570
I came on her a wild few months ago and you're talking about it and I'm like,

1198
01:08:53.571 --> 01:08:57.320
that is a really good fucking fight because if you go back and watch the first

1199
01:08:57.321 --> 01:09:01.520
fight with Steve and DC, DC wasn't dominating and then clipped him,

1200
01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.330
you know, and Steve Bay said time Steve pays a motherfucker.

1201
01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:07.040
Like that's a really good fight man.

1202
01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:09.580
Well I don't like the long layoff for steeping was good bite.

1203
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.630
The reason why I like it is he was coming off of that fucking crazy war with

1204
01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:17.810
Francis and Ghana where he took some big shots, particularly in the first round.

1205
01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.690
How impressive is that now that my nails let Francis capable. Yeah,

1206
01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.530
and Francis knocks everybody dead and steep is the only guy not to just,

1207
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.880
just to survive Francis, but to beat him. He figured it out like a champion.

1208
01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:32.330
Got Him to the ground, you know, neutralized all his weapons and beat him.

1209
01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:32.811
I think,

1210
01:09:32.811 --> 01:09:36.380
I think d C V or I think Francis for Steve Bay would be different this time.

1211
01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:36.860
I think.

1212
01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.000
I think Francis has made leaps and bound improvements to his grappling and

1213
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:46.120
confidence and he's not so a rockstar reckless lifestyle.

1214
01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.040
And his ego's in check, like you sit and talk to him like,

1215
01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:51.950
Oh fuck this guys tuned in, man. Yeah. I mean,

1216
01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:55.940
it's a look and he knows what's at stake now with Daniel, you know?

1217
01:09:55.970 --> 01:09:57.140
And Daniel knows too. I mean,

1218
01:09:57.141 --> 01:09:59.870
Daniel's treating it like he's about to fight the greatest heavyweight of all

1219
01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:01.790
time. You know, that's his approach. I mean,

1220
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:04.450
that's what he said to me behind the scenes. And uh,

1221
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:07.910
but he just thinks he's better in every way and he thinks he's going to beat him

1222
01:10:07.911 --> 01:10:10.820
again. And [inaudible] thinks he just got clipped with that one punch.

1223
01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:12.950
If he doesn't get clipped with that one punch, she wins that fight.

1224
01:10:13.250 --> 01:10:16.670
You know what? I'll take both arguments. Yeah, you're right. You're right.

1225
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:19.670
Let's see what happens then. Fuck knows. It's such a great phasing.

1226
01:10:19.671 --> 01:10:23.500
Amazing fight. And then you've got pat s versus Nate Diaz, which is Saturday,

1227
01:10:23.501 --> 01:10:26.000
right? Yeah. Well that's an interesting look.

1228
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:29.090
Nate doesn't want to cut any weight and pat has just knocked out Wonderboy,

1229
01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.370
so he's like, fuck it. Let's do this. Pedis.

1230
01:10:31.371 --> 01:10:34.550
Last fight was against a Tony Ferguson, right? Wonderboy,

1231
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:36.470
Wonderboy knocked out

1232
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:42.230
Wunderbar Tony Ferguson was before that first one was at 55 and pedis his first

1233
01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:46.310
fighter at 70 I mean, look man, when you, when you've been starving yourself,

1234
01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:51.311
you get to 45 and 55 and then finally fight at one 70 and you knock Wonderboy

1235
01:10:51.471 --> 01:10:55.490
out with a superman punch. You gotta say, maybe this is my weight class.

1236
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.750
The only question when Nate Diaz and I would assume Nate dia, or, I'm sorry,

1237
01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.860
Anthea pedis is a favorite cause Nate Diaz ended up font.

1238
01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.280
No hot fucking seconds. Here's the favorite.

1239
01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.580
I bet Nate's even at every pedestal. The favorite. Yeah. Please check.

1240
01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:11.130
Let's check in terms of, you think Diaz would be the favorite? Yeah, I think so.

1241
01:11:11.131 --> 01:11:13.920
Doing kicks from Anthony Pettis. Well, I think gambling

1242
01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.440
<v 0>right? Well, I think, I think pat is the favorite. Okay.</v>

1243
01:11:16.441 --> 01:11:20.250
Maybe you might think pedis is the favorite in terms of the way you view the

1244
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:22.230
fight. But when you think about favorites,

1245
01:11:22.231 --> 01:11:24.210
favorites depend upon who's betting for who.

1246
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.360
And I think it's going to be a shit ton of people betting on Nate Diaz ideas as

1247
01:11:27.361 --> 01:11:30.240
an army behind. Yeah. Other than put money down, huge star.

1248
01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:32.160
He is one of the least.

1249
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.650
He's like the worst promoted superstar him,

1250
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.713
him and his brother.

1251
01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
They can imagine China minus minus one 25 minus one 25 Pederson.

1252
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:46.210
Nate's even money and pedis is minus one 30. Okay. That's it for today.

1253
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.070
We'll see what it happens. Layoff. Yeah, I agree. It's gonna be,

1254
01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:51.810
I bet I bet them you're probably right.

1255
01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:55.500
The money because Nate Diaz is so famous. The money's going to go his way.

1256
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.650
What else is on the claws?

1257
01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:59.550
Pull the rest of the card up so we can see the rest of the card because it's a

1258
01:11:59.551 --> 01:12:03.660
great card even on top of that. Um, what else we got here?

1259
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:08.010
Derek Brenson site. Yeah. Let me get a little dicey after those top three,

1260
01:12:08.011 --> 01:12:10.800
but I feel you. But this is probably more on the ESPN card.

1261
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.860
Let's see what else you got with the ESPN card. Yeah. Oh,

1262
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:17.100
my board's slurry to Hagen telling you versus a Sun Sal.

1263
01:12:17.101 --> 01:12:21.030
That's a great for that. For him that he beats him your seat to me.

1264
01:12:21.031 --> 01:12:22.960
When I talked about guys who are gatekeepers there,

1265
01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:26.840
I don't believe in the term gatekeeper. We're like, Yo, you get the top 10.

1266
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:29.970
The guys in the twilight of his career, to me gatekeepers, you beat him.

1267
01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.540
You get title shot, son sells that guy. Few beat him.

1268
01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:36.660
You gotta fight one or the champ number one or champ.

1269
01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.700
And that's where Sandy Hagans right at.

1270
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.930
What did you think about a Marla Mariah's submitting a Sun Sal?

1271
01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.040
I mean that was pretty crazy. Amazing. But then how much did you learn from,

1272
01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:49.700
you know Marlon Mariah's, his last fight, where your lost?

1273
01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:53.790
We got kinda got broke, man. I thought, I wonder what was happening there.

1274
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.360
I wonder if it's stress of the fight, if that's what made him fatigue.

1275
01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:00.180
Here's what you got to pay attention to is when Mark Henry,

1276
01:13:00.181 --> 01:13:05.181
who's to me the best coach in MMA and him or for us when he's in the corner and

1277
01:13:06.481 --> 01:13:09.690
he, he must have seen in trainer and something because he goes,

1278
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.900
think about your mom. Don't give up. Think about your fucking mom.

1279
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:17.490
What took you to come here when a coach has to pull out that fucking yellow card

1280
01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.100
after the first round, he's thinking, yeah, that's why I'm like, oh,

1281
01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.880
he's quitting practice before. Now mark decked me if I'm wrong,

1282
01:13:26.881 --> 01:13:30.870
but I assume that he's seen some sort of quit in him in practice.

1283
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:35.220
When you gotta think about your mom after the first round,

1284
01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:38.610
you go zero to a hundred thinking about your mom's a rough.

1285
01:13:38.611 --> 01:13:41.790
That means he saw something that he's seen in practice before he went, oh fuck.

1286
01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:44.670
There it is. No, no, no dude, dude, remember you met your fucking mom.

1287
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.310
What took to get here and stilled in and work?

1288
01:13:48.270 --> 01:13:50.910
The crazy thing is if you saw that first round, you thought,

1289
01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.330
and Mirage is the best fighter in the world. Yeah, like my God.

1290
01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.510
So who though doesn't even belong in here today? You're so screwed. Yeah.

1291
01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:01.290
I'm like, so who does fucked, how good his skin, his legs destroyed.

1292
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:06.210
He just look, you had an injury, unstoppable belief in himself, unstoppable.

1293
01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:09.360
He just believes in himself past reality.

1294
01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.760
He's arguing right now these pound for pound in the world because gold medalist,

1295
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.900
then two division champion. You had some work to do though. My mouth says,

1296
01:14:16.901 --> 01:14:21.400
hold my little bear. I beat a shitload of dudes. They're tiny.

1297
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.310
They're tiny. You know, they're tight,

1298
01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:27.920
like a little fucking diet coke can this little,

1299
01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:32.260
those little baby ones you get when you go to a kid's party, like yeah. Yeah,

1300
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:36.250
that's a, it's not a good argument in terms of him being the best of all time.

1301
01:14:36.251 --> 01:14:39.350
But in terms of being the one of the greatest combat sport athletes all the

1302
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.433
times, the shore,

1303
01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:45.780
Olympic gold medalist and then UFC champion in two different way classes.

1304
01:14:45.970 --> 01:14:50.620
I mean fuck, but the thing about that, uh, Kayla Harrison,

1305
01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.740
who's a two time gold medalist,

1306
01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:58.800
if she were able to get a championship over and PFL come over the UFC two gold

1307
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:00.500
metals, that's nuts, dude.

1308
01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:05.110
But she will not be fighting the same caliber of fighters that Henry Sudo

1309
01:15:05.410 --> 01:15:07.890
fought. No, that's, that's just where the females are at. Right.

1310
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:08.813
And it's just where they're at.

1311
01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.850
Unless she fights Valentino Schiff Chanko or Amanda Nunez though she trains with

1312
01:15:12.851 --> 01:15:15.310
Amanda. Amanda's gonna retire by the time she gets to the UFC.

1313
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:19.570
Amanda Nunez and Valentina Shevchenko or as good as any fucking male fighter on

1314
01:15:19.571 --> 01:15:22.940
the planet, especially Valentino striking foul.

1315
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:27.070
Tina is so she's assassin. She's so tactical.

1316
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.280
What's Amanda Nunez do now? Cause hurt. Cyborg was the fight.

1317
01:15:30.281 --> 01:15:33.100
I still think they make the cyborg fight, by the way. Absolutely.

1318
01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:35.740
Don't you think Dana's going to do it? Well, he said it. He would do it.

1319
01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:36.371
He's like, I'll do it.

1320
01:15:36.371 --> 01:15:39.310
Fucking coffee or one fight contract if she wants to do what she could do.

1321
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:42.340
But she does not want to fight Amanda Nunez. Look to take Dana Smart,

1322
01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:43.810
all that shit that he said. Oh,

1323
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.020
he calls me up right now and she says she wants to fight Amanda Nunez.

1324
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:51.190
I'll make the fight. He goes, but she's not gonna do it. So he said,

1325
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:55.090
if she calls me up, I will make the fight putting the ball in her court.

1326
01:15:55.091 --> 01:15:56.560
Pass it still. Don't worry.

1327
01:15:56.561 --> 01:16:00.100
That's not going to happen this cause you [inaudible] she's gotta be devastated

1328
01:16:00.101 --> 01:16:03.520
by that video. Whoever made that video, I don't know who it is.

1329
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.590
You don't know who it is. I know it wasn't her.

1330
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.220
She didn't make that stupid shit.

1331
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.580
She doesn't tweet her boyfriend tweets for so exhausted. It's just complaining

1332
01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:17.830
because it's not her to, it's so dumb. And then she'll post on like Sunday,

1333
01:16:17.831 --> 01:16:20.230
like, hey everybody. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

1334
01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:23.350
I just want Twitter to go. Fuck you. How about that?

1335
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:27.490
My favorite flavors each yet it's Anna draw 50 that's my favorite flavor.

1336
01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:31.690
The whole thing is fucking, the whole thing is ridiculous.

1337
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:36.790
Like you can stack the rocks on top of a piss test.

1338
01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:41.791
That guy come out green like less than like a Ninja clerical like radiator

1339
01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:48.470
fluid. The fuck is lime green like the Ferrari man.

1340
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:51.180
When we were kids there was no 50 year old action heroes.

1341
01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:52.870
They didn't look like that. No.

1342
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:56.020
How the fuck do you look like that's just alone these days.

1343
01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:00.190
I do a horrible special own impression like what is he doing now?

1344
01:17:00.191 --> 01:17:04.660
He's doing something that isn't even rewriting fucking a some TVs like rocky

1345
01:17:04.661 --> 01:17:08.050
nine or some shit and he's doing a TV show with like Dolph Lundgren.

1346
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:11.710
They're doing a TV show yet. Appreciate the hustle man. Who was he 70 something?

1347
01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:15.020
He's a thousand years old and still swinging for the bleachers.

1348
01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:18.570
He doesn't give a fuck in a town. Gigantic Mozo from Baba.

1349
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:24.550
So proud to announce there's incredible new show called the Endo Nijah show.

1350
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.100
It's going to be there.

1351
01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:30.490
Does that working with my own hard punch in front of fans. [inaudible]

1352
01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:34.460
his, his Instagram is dolphin fans.

1353
01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:41.250
Doff underscore fans still working on a new TV series together and we can't

1354
01:17:42.111 --> 01:17:46.610
wait. Who said that? I can definitely fill a hard path for your boy hair.

1355
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.210
Hard patch and stars are collaborating again, dude.

1356
01:17:50.211 --> 01:17:52.810
They just don't give it up to it. I will say this though. Savannah,

1357
01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.250
that mother fucker with the, like the Rockies,

1358
01:17:55.251 --> 01:17:57.240
even the newer ones I created and stuff. He's,

1359
01:17:57.300 --> 01:18:01.220
he's doing well or did you see the escape with him and Arnold?

1360
01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:03.800
They're both like a hundred years old. See that all. It's fucking good.

1361
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:07.300
They've got beards. It's fucking good, man. It's a good movie dude.

1362
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.280
They don't miss when they make movies now this, that's going to be terrible,

1363
01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:14.620
but their movies, is that going to be terrible? Maybe

1364
01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.710
[inaudible] the extracts.

1365
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.660
You still jacked looking at me. Look at his forearms. Hey,

1366
01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:30.080
remember when he got those forums? Oh Dude. Have you seen his answer?

1367
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:34.050
He's shredded man. Let me see some recent pieces. Fucking jacked.

1368
01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.020
I wish I could go to his ass. Shot his Instagram. Did you see,

1369
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:42.590
did you see when he got caught in Australia though? Am Son? Oh,

1370
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:45.830
his daughter is a smoke show. She's up age to be cool.

1371
01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.950
<v 2>A uh,</v>

1372
01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:50.360
<v 0>did jack do weird like drawing lines on it?</v>

1373
01:18:50.361 --> 01:18:53.660
Like someone accidentally threw the screenshot thing on it and didn't take it

1374
01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:56.050
off before the post that, oh, well he's he,

1375
01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:59.150
he's 90 so he didn't know bro.

1376
01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:01.700
He probably posted himself and can't see what he wrote on it.

1377
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:07.370
He probably signed it that he was autographing his own fucking Instagram.

1378
01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.760
Take a look at. This is a good dude.

1379
01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.570
You want me to see some photos of him where he's like, Oh hey,

1380
01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.520
go to the one where he's walking an alligator at his daughter's birthday party.

1381
01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:23.810
There it is. Far Right. It's awkward. It's, he's stiff.

1382
01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.210
You know how you said I was stiff? He is so stiff.

1383
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:28.130
I'm going to say please like physically stiff.

1384
01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.040
<v 3>I'll go for a walk, but then again,</v>

1385
01:19:33.100 --> 01:19:37.600
I have my friend here. He's got a porcupine in his house,

1386
01:19:38.230 --> 01:19:41.780
if you know what I mean. Oh yeah.

1387
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.200
He's a little awkward,

1388
01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.370
but you got to think all those years of lifting weights and he broke his neck

1389
01:19:48.371 --> 01:19:49.580
when he was filming the expenditure, the

1390
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:52.970
<v 0>Bulls. He's got bolts and shit in his neck. He ever see it, bro.</v>

1391
01:19:52.971 --> 01:19:57.740
He's got his neck fused like several of his disc blew out filming the expendable

1392
01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:00.950
fucking right. They take, cause you're 90 jumping out of planes and shit.

1393
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:04.820
Somebody threw him into a wall. He was doing his own stunts.

1394
01:20:04.821 --> 01:20:08.490
I blow my asshole out. Some of them I in a little wall. Fuck.

1395
01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:13.120
But there's never been a guy as old as him that literally pulls off doing uh,

1396
01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:16.890
like when he smashes somebody in a movie, you're not going no way.

1397
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:20.730
It's not like when Bob Barker beat up Adam Sandler and happy gill. No,

1398
01:20:20.731 --> 01:20:23.550
I believe in that price is wrong bitch. It's not like that.

1399
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:28.200
It's like a guy fucking a guy up like you buy it. Yeah, you're right.

1400
01:20:28.201 --> 01:20:33.100
He's still jacked. Like he'll still fuck people up. [inaudible]

1401
01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:39.240
now he's a legend man. I like, he's the fucking light.

1402
01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:41.780
He's just doing the damn thing. How long can he do it though? Could,

1403
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:44.890
will you buy it when he's 90. Oh, he's still going to be able to fuck people up.

1404
01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.820
[inaudible] towards doing the damn thing. That's true. However,

1405
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:51.810
he owes me fucking seven 99 for renting the mule was a piece of shit.

1406
01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:56.610
He's 94 directing, starring his own movie is not good. It's tough.

1407
01:20:56.611 --> 01:21:01.200
It's just boring. It's him driving down the highway. That's it. That's it.

1408
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:04.680
Wasn't he supposed to be a drug meal in that movies and that was the best part

1409
01:21:04.681 --> 01:21:07.410
is though. He gets to the cartel and then the, hey, just have these smoke shows.

1410
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:11.640
Fuck his brains out. Fuck his brain. And he's like 90 yeah. That's pretty cool.

1411
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.360
Yeah. He's like, yeah, well yeah, he wrote and directed it.

1412
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:18.810
Really important that I fuck dude, he's 90 at least, right?

1413
01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:23.700
I think he's 92 right? He's killing it. He's still bangs out. Well,

1414
01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:28.110
he wrote it in the script. You got divorced. I want freedom.

1415
01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:30.810
He has a bunch of kids, man. You got a bunch of kids.

1416
01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:34.740
I've had one of my sons on Scott. No, nice guy. Looks like them too.

1417
01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:37.250
It looks like he does look like him. Yeah, you gotta imagine that.

1418
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.180
Plenty's where's your dad? Not around a lot.

1419
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:40.860
Probably not teach how to play catch and shit.

1420
01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:45.600
Starting fucking whatever the movies he's doing. Yeah, that's a problem.

1421
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:48.660
Yeah. I mean, when you're doing movies too,

1422
01:21:48.661 --> 01:21:51.980
you're off for months and months and months at a time, and I don't know.

1423
01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:55.350
This is just me to calculate in my head. I know how busy I am.

1424
01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.400
But then you look at the rock schedule. Yeah. Dude, why did he go home? Well,

1425
01:21:59.401 --> 01:22:02.040
it probably brings his family with him. Does he? I mean,

1426
01:22:02.041 --> 01:22:06.090
I would imagine you see, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know either.

1427
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.500
How do you not? I mean, you know the rock. Yeah.

1428
01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.890
You're the rock. I couldn't do it. I would need my kids to be [inaudible].

1429
01:22:14.030 --> 01:22:18.560
I would die if I'm on the road longer than four days. I die. It's I,

1430
01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.510
I don't do well. When I did the only two movies that I've ever done,

1431
01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.920
the Kevin James Movies, the here comes the boom. I brought my family with me.

1432
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:30.810
I'm like, I'm not doing this. How long was it? Two weeks. Three weeks,

1433
01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.080
two. I'm like, that can't do it, man. Too Long. Yeah. That's my third whiskey,

1434
01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:36.180
by the way. Yeah. It's just the fucking,

1435
01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:41.100
that's the sadness and the solidness dude. Be By yourself.

1436
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.520
Face timing your family. And it's like, oh well my son goes, Daddy,

1437
01:22:44.521 --> 01:22:48.690
where are you? I'm trying to describe it. He's like, class you. Yeah.

1438
01:22:48.691 --> 01:22:52.770
Those little voices. I miss you so much. Oh Man. Oh. Can't do it.

1439
01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:56.100
I gotta get back. That's why I only do weekends when I go on the road.

1440
01:22:56.190 --> 01:22:59.760
I do weekends. Yeah, you're at a level now where it's perfect man. That that's,

1441
01:22:59.790 --> 01:23:03.750
that's Hashtag goals is kid Hashtag Inspo is when uh,

1442
01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:07.390
you can do like one or two huge shows a month.

1443
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:10.420
So you're not missing stuff at home. I was thinking about this. Oh, go ahead.

1444
01:23:10.450 --> 01:23:12.760
No, go ahead. Go ahead. You were thinking about this. Um,

1445
01:23:13.450 --> 01:23:16.930
when my son starts playing sports, I don't want to miss a game. Right.

1446
01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:19.180
While I'm on the road for Thursdays, I'm up to figure it out.

1447
01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:20.800
Hopefully by the time he starts doing that,

1448
01:23:20.801 --> 01:23:24.660
I'm on a level where I don't have to do so many shows every week. You know?

1449
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:27.270
I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out. I,

1450
01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:29.380
I couldn't sleep the other night thinking about it.

1451
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.450
You know there's another thing too when you think about it,

1452
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:34.330
like when do you retire? Like as a con would be. Yeah.

1453
01:23:34.331 --> 01:23:37.930
Do you want to be George Carlin to be dying a hotel room somewhere?

1454
01:23:38.170 --> 01:23:40.420
You know better than me, Joe, you told me brother. I don't know.

1455
01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:42.250
I'm thinking about it cause I'm older than you too.

1456
01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.280
You know I'm going to be 52 in August but you never been better.

1457
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:49.930
I know that's the problem I experienced is the name of the game never been

1458
01:23:49.931 --> 01:23:54.610
better. It's also, it's experience but it's also focus,

1459
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:58.650
discipline, enthusiasm, all those things haven't weaned and,

1460
01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.440
but you're also not out of touch. Like you ever see some old comedians.

1461
01:24:02.441 --> 01:24:05.260
I won't say names, but I seem to stamp like, oh bro,

1462
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:07.960
you open up fucking Twitter.

1463
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:11.410
You're talking about fucking on Jersey shore.

1464
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:14.620
That show hasn't been relevant in seven years. Dumb ass.

1465
01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:19.750
But he or they're just not current, you know, they have no idea. I think look,

1466
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.330
stand up. Comedy is a constant pursuit.

1467
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:26.200
You take like I took a couple days off from this weekend, right?

1468
01:24:26.230 --> 01:24:28.480
I did this weekend was Chapelle.

1469
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:34.000
I took Sunday and Monday off and then Tuesday I got to get back on the horse

1470
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:35.950
again and you've got to really get back on the horse.

1471
01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:37.800
You got to go over the nodes, you can't have acid.

1472
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:41.320
You've got to really prepare and you've been doing it for how long? Forever.

1473
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:45.010
Forever. You gotta come out guns, blaze. And every time and then you know,

1474
01:24:45.011 --> 01:24:46.870
obviously I'm gearing up for this weekend.

1475
01:24:46.930 --> 01:24:50.380
I got a sold out show at an arena and Portland on Friday night.

1476
01:24:50.410 --> 01:24:51.790
You're at her freeness us.

1477
01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.960
We're basketball teams play

1478
01:24:59.050 --> 01:25:03.340
just talking shit. It's so cool. He is. He ain't going with you. Yeah, this one.

1479
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.300
Yeah. And Allie, Allie Makowski. She's Great Love Alec. Love Ellen.

1480
01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:08.134
She's a lot of water.

1481
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:11.740
She's like 22 I love watching her get better and she's so smart.

1482
01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:14.950
She's a beast man. Hard works hard. She works hard.

1483
01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:18.250
She was with me last night at the Improv. She's with me tonight. Ty's house.

1484
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:21.940
She grinds kids always grind and dude, I had a,

1485
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.630
or Derek posting a as my feature and uh, he's been with me for a while.

1486
01:25:25.631 --> 01:25:28.240
He's a comedy store. He's great.

1487
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:32.020
He's from Memphis and we did shows in Nashville and his parents came to the

1488
01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:34.810
show, Hey, his dad is white as fuck. So I was a little confused.

1489
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.140
Those mom was super dark, that's whatever. But I was just like, wow,

1490
01:25:38.141 --> 01:25:38.974
how's this happen?

1491
01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:43.840
I felt like a proud dad telling them how good he's doing.

1492
01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.170
I started tearing up like this guy, man. The Dad was like, all right man,

1493
01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:52.090
be cool. He's got real potential. I mean, I'm talking killer Joe. There's,

1494
01:25:52.091 --> 01:25:52.924
there's guys,

1495
01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:57.610
friends of ours that are comedians who brought Derek on the road and he crushed

1496
01:25:57.611 --> 01:26:02.350
show hard. He, they don't bring him in anymore. You're coming with me, bro.

1497
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:05.840
That's how I met her. You come in with me. That's hilarious.

1498
01:26:05.841 --> 01:26:10.520
He's been doing comedy like three years. I think he's been doing a six or seven.

1499
01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.770
I didn't really, but I mean, you know,

1500
01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:15.590
no small amount of time for you to be scared of him. Yeah, he's a monster man.

1501
01:26:15.650 --> 01:26:19.770
Well, you know, that's nice, but it's, we need more, you know, I'm,

1502
01:26:19.771 --> 01:26:22.820
I'm a big encourager of young comedians. We need more.

1503
01:26:22.850 --> 01:26:25.570
We need as many as we can. You know, it was really funny. Oh,

1504
01:26:25.571 --> 01:26:28.670
I had a work with me at the Improv the other night is Jimmy o Yang.

1505
01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.800
He's amazing. Hilaire oh, I worked with them at the Ja comedy store, rather.

1506
01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:36.920
I saw him at the Improv and then I had them come and do a set. Yeah,

1507
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:40.010
I brought him up. I went after him at the Improv and I was like,

1508
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.930
he destroyed all seven people. Funny Dude. Yeah. He, he's amazing.

1509
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:48.800
He's a great two and funny offstage. Just a fun dude. It was so funny.

1510
01:26:48.801 --> 01:26:51.380
Meeting with, we were at the Improv and, uh,

1511
01:26:51.381 --> 01:26:55.010
we're chilling the back-talking and this like random Asian dude comes up and

1512
01:26:55.011 --> 01:26:58.430
goes, are you Chinese? And he goes, no, I'm actually not.

1513
01:26:58.670 --> 01:27:00.920
And he goes like through this whole Asian thing and the guy that,

1514
01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:05.060
he was fucking hate that man. He was Asian people too.

1515
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:09.590
It was so funny. What nationality is Jimmy? I think he's Korean.

1516
01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:13.850
I think Jimmy don't kill me. Fuck. I just think he's Korean. Fuck this up.

1517
01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:14.930
I hope not.

1518
01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:17.780
I got a bunch of Asian people that work for me and I messed it up all the time.

1519
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:21.260
Do you think Asian people do that with white people? Like are you Portuguese?

1520
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:25.920
I don't think so. It's pretty obvious. Pretty obvious. Oh, you Polish you Paul.

1521
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:30.440
Are you Swedish? What are you never go? Oh, you're white. Born in Hong Kong.

1522
01:27:30.441 --> 01:27:34.340
According to Wikipedia. It's tough, dude. It's tough.

1523
01:27:34.810 --> 01:27:37.010
I've got a Filipino that works for me and I got a Korean.

1524
01:27:37.011 --> 01:27:39.200
Have you ever watched those fucking protests on TV?

1525
01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:45.220
Where at [inaudible] they been going now and they're making changes,

1526
01:27:45.321 --> 01:27:49.970
aren't they? It's been gone forever. It hasn't gone for a hot second. People.

1527
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.630
I've been avoiding the news with the mass shootings. I got an Assu.

1528
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:56.210
Nothing gets me into a depression like mass shootings. Now it's Obama bomber,

1529
01:27:56.211 --> 01:28:00.020
man. It's a bummer. And it's like, you know, I had Bernie Sanders on yesterday.

1530
01:28:00.021 --> 01:28:03.050
That's what scares me even more. We had him on. You go burning.

1531
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.620
What are you gonna do with this? No answers. No one has an answer.

1532
01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:08.990
No one smart as fuck.

1533
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:13.610
Banning assault rifles and all the NRA people are like, good luck with that.

1534
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:15.530
See, but here's my thing. I know you've got a big, hey,

1535
01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:19.070
you gotta take her away from me. Oh my God.

1536
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.960
We're looking at a photo of Hong Kong right now and it is the most insane crowd

1537
01:28:23.961 --> 01:28:28.430
of people that are filling the street. It's like a sand of beach sand of people.

1538
01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.610
It's like the women's march times a million on sterile.

1539
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:34.620
That women's march was weak as fuck. No, this is serious shit.

1540
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:37.160
Is he hats there now they're ready to kill.

1541
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:41.150
So what is the problem?

1542
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:45.500
There was anti extradition bill that people are, oh, because yeah,

1543
01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.030
that extradite people to China to get prosecuted. Correct. Is that what it is?

1544
01:28:50.410 --> 01:28:54.770
And they don't want that shit. Anti X. Okay. Okay. Um,

1545
01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:58.190
process series of ongoing demonstrations in China, in Hong Kong,

1546
01:28:58.191 --> 01:29:02.130
rather against the fugitive offenders and mutual legal

1547
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.600
<v 1>assistance in criminal matters legislation amendment bill proposed by the</v>

1548
01:29:06.601 --> 01:29:07.530
government of Hong Kong.

1549
01:29:07.531 --> 01:29:12.330
This legislation was proposed by the security bureau in 2019 in response to a

1550
01:29:12.331 --> 01:29:15.690
murder that occurred in Taiwan the previous year,

1551
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:19.800
which the suspect had fled to Hong Kong as a special administrative region.

1552
01:29:19.801 --> 01:29:24.801
Hong Kong is jurisdictionally distinct from mainland China and maintains a

1553
01:29:25.051 --> 01:29:28.020
separate governing and legal system under the one country,

1554
01:29:28.021 --> 01:29:29.370
two systems principle.

1555
01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:33.390
The regional government was unable to transfer the fugitive Taiwanese

1556
01:29:33.391 --> 01:29:37.620
authorities citing a lack of formal extradition arrangements between the two

1557
01:29:37.621 --> 01:29:41.070
jurisdictions. Say Hong Kong, pick your battles. Yeah. If enacted,

1558
01:29:41.071 --> 01:29:45.480
the bill would allow local authorities to detain and extradite people who are

1559
01:29:45.481 --> 01:29:50.481
wanted in countries or territories that Hong Kong does not have extradition

1560
01:29:50.521 --> 01:29:52.710
agreements with, including mainland China. Well,

1561
01:29:52.711 --> 01:29:56.640
the problem is that Hong Kong until a certain, yeah,

1562
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:59.790
well Hong Kong was controlled by Britain, right.

1563
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:03.270
Until a certain amount of time, and then they gave it back to China.

1564
01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.650
And the people that live there are very unhappy with this shift from a think it

1565
01:30:07.651 --> 01:30:10.800
was Great Britain. Not they're pissed. Yeah. Talk about.

1566
01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:15.510
And then yet the dedication is very, it's so rigid. I mean,

1567
01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:18.380
there's so authoritarian. Scary. You're lucky counseling here.

1568
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:21.120
You'd have a three hour podcasts either. Did you say Hong Kong and China?

1569
01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:24.950
Let me break it down for you. Um, here's my thing. Back to the,

1570
01:30:24.951 --> 01:30:28.470
the mass shootings and like gun control with the semiautomatic weapons.

1571
01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:32.550
If they said, hey man, if we get rid of semiautomatic weapons,

1572
01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:36.150
there won't be any more mass shootings like this. Don't you think? In general,

1573
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:39.490
most people are like, yeah, cool. Take them in. Are they that fun? No.

1574
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:42.620
Are they that cool to shoot? People would not do that. There's that.

1575
01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:45.690
Why do you need them? Doesn't it doesn't matter whether you need them.

1576
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:49.140
A stupid Joe. Listen to this stupid. It's a real problem man.

1577
01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:52.380
The kids are dying left and right. Okay, but you're looking at it the wrong way.

1578
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:55.920
You got to look for an answer. Yes. In terms of the way they are looking at it,

1579
01:30:56.250 --> 01:30:57.720
they're not going to say, okay,

1580
01:30:57.721 --> 01:31:01.350
you take them because their ideas that government eventually wants all your guns

1581
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:04.860
and they're going to start with assault rep weapons and then work their way to

1582
01:31:04.861 --> 01:31:07.370
all weapons. What if they just stopped at a, sorry,

1583
01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:08.490
you're looking at worst case scenario.

1584
01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.650
What if it is just assault because of the mass shootings?

1585
01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:12.750
Because they don't think that they should be able to do that.

1586
01:31:12.751 --> 01:31:16.650
They think that the government does not have the ability to take away your guns,

1587
01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:21.540
but we haven't Snobelen. The problem is crazy people shooting people.

1588
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:25.410
The problem is noise automatically. The problem guns shooting people, right.

1589
01:31:25.411 --> 01:31:26.221
It's interesting.

1590
01:31:26.221 --> 01:31:29.040
You're going to go after those people that have the guns that have never done

1591
01:31:29.041 --> 01:31:30.930
anything. Well, hey, you're going to say, well,

1592
01:31:30.931 --> 01:31:34.830
the Second Amendment protects my right to keep and bear arms amendment's written

1593
01:31:34.831 --> 01:31:39.600
in the 17 hundreds that hasn't changed. True. The thing is though is if you can,

1594
01:31:39.630 --> 01:31:42.390
hey, we have a problem. If we can get rid of these for now.

1595
01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:48.000
What I'm saying is that most Americans would be like, yeah, you're right man.

1596
01:31:48.001 --> 01:31:51.480
We don't need them. That bed. No chance. That's mind blowing. To me it is,

1597
01:31:51.630 --> 01:31:52.800
but people went, hey, Brendan,

1598
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:55.590
Ferrari's are killing people left and fucking right, dude,

1599
01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:57.480
you gotta get off the road with this thing.

1600
01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.520
So many people are dying like get rid of the fucking fraud. Yeah,

1601
01:32:00.521 --> 01:32:03.250
but that's a simplistic perception of what's actually going on.

1602
01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:05.590
No one's going to think about it that way. They're gonna think,

1603
01:32:05.610 --> 01:32:08.100
I mean the people that don't have guns are going to think about it that way that

1604
01:32:08.101 --> 01:32:12.610
the people that are second amendment enthusiastic are going to say this is a

1605
01:32:12.611 --> 01:32:15.220
slippery slope and I don't give them any ground.

1606
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:18.550
Like Joe Biden has been saying we're going to take your assault weapons.

1607
01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:21.670
This is one of the things that Joe Biden has said publicly and this is one of

1608
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:24.280
the reasons why the people that are pro second amendment are never gonna vote

1609
01:32:24.281 --> 01:32:28.420
for him. They think that if you give in in any way,

1610
01:32:28.421 --> 01:32:32.230
shape or form to take my free slope and they're going to take away pistols.

1611
01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:35.290
I mean California's already reduced the size of the magazines,

1612
01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:39.670
but that actually I think that was voted back like I think that was ruled to be

1613
01:32:39.671 --> 01:32:42.310
unconstitutional. They had like limited magazines.

1614
01:32:42.311 --> 01:32:45.370
Like you only have a magazine like six rounds or 10 rounds or something like,

1615
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:48.190
no, it was 10 I think they try to make it lower,

1616
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:51.610
but that that has been reversed. I'm pretty sure.

1617
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:53.710
Here's my thing with the mental health or, and he goes, well,

1618
01:32:53.711 --> 01:32:54.940
America has a mental health problem.

1619
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:56.710
There's a mental health problem all around the world.

1620
01:32:57.130 --> 01:33:00.550
We just have a gun problem. That's not true. The mental is just here.

1621
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.720
The mental health problem in United States is extremely exacerbated by the use

1622
01:33:04.721 --> 01:33:09.640
of psych drugs. There's way, way, way more drug prompts to brother.

1623
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:13.390
They don't have nearly as many prescribed drugs in Europe as they do.

1624
01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:16.940
Are you sure? Yes. SSRI talked to Bernie saying, oh, well,

1625
01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:20.200
I know I do not. As I've talked to psychologists. Yeah,

1626
01:33:20.201 --> 01:33:21.070
you've probably done your research.

1627
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:23.800
It's this pharmaceutical lobby in this country. Look,

1628
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:27.040
obviously not everybody on psych drugs is that murdering people.

1629
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:31.990
The problem is many, many, many layers, right? There's people that are abused.

1630
01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:34.240
There's people that grow up with a lot of violence.

1631
01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:37.630
There's people that grow up and they, you know, they're psychotic. They,

1632
01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.660
they have psych drugs. The psych drugs are disassociated.

1633
01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:42.370
Some people just be bad apples though.

1634
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:44.260
Like does it always have to be a mental illness?

1635
01:33:44.410 --> 01:33:47.470
Like all these shooters just happen to have mental illness? All of them.

1636
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:51.040
Well someone just don't suck at life. Maybe some suck at life,

1637
01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:55.690
but almost all of them. I mean in the high 90% are on psych medication.

1638
01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:56.740
Yes,

1639
01:33:56.740 --> 01:34:01.740
and as coming from someone who's who was murdered by his wife when she was on an

1640
01:34:01.841 --> 01:34:06.770
SSRI and on cocaine, like people when they're on those drugs, it's,

1641
01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.230
it's a varying reaction and suicidal thoughts are very common as well as

1642
01:34:11.231 --> 01:34:14.850
homicidal thoughts. Very common. The and also the,

1643
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:16.750
the feeling that things aren't real.

1644
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:19.750
The people that I've talked to that were on SSRI as they got off of them,

1645
01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:22.390
one of the things that they all say is that nothing seemed real.

1646
01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:26.170
That's kind of what you did in every game. Like a simulation. Yes.

1647
01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:30.520
Everything is blank and those kids, yeah, everything felt flat.

1648
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:33.370
I think that's a big problem for sure.

1649
01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:38.460
A crazy person with a semiautomatic weapon is a real problem and you would want

1650
01:34:38.461 --> 01:34:42.730
to take a semiautomatic weapon away from a crazy person, the other PR.

1651
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.510
But the problem is if there's a guy like you who has a semiautomatic weapon and

1652
01:34:46.511 --> 01:34:51.511
you have a ranch somewhere and he just like shooting coyotes and fucking fucking

1653
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:55.210
metal targets that are out in the distance and you don't harm anybody and you're

1654
01:34:55.211 --> 01:34:59.910
a good person, you are technically protected by the second amendment.

1655
01:34:59.930 --> 01:35:03.260
Why should you? But okay, but then what about your pistol?

1656
01:35:03.261 --> 01:35:04.970
Should you take your pistol? What about your shotgun?

1657
01:35:05.150 --> 01:35:09.110
What if you get a shotgun and you fucking keep reloading it automatic again to

1658
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:11.810
the, with shotgun, they're not going to kill as many people.

1659
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:13.700
Depends on whether or not the people are armed.

1660
01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.370
If the people are not armed and running around a mall,

1661
01:35:16.371 --> 01:35:20.990
you can kill a lot of fucking people with a shotgun. The automatic yes, maybe.

1662
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:23.990
Yeah, maybe. I mean, here's what the scary thing me,

1663
01:35:23.991 --> 01:35:27.020
you're one of the smartest people I know. Bernie Sanders is smart motherfucker.

1664
01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:30.740
This, he lives in this world. When you said, what are we going to do? His aunts,

1665
01:35:30.741 --> 01:35:34.340
I was like, that was as good as mine. It's the truth. You're right, dude.

1666
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:36.050
You're right. There's no one that scared me.

1667
01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:40.160
It's a good thing to be scared because there's no one out there has a shining

1668
01:35:40.161 --> 01:35:44.900
light like one answer you like. That's it. The smartest minds in the world,

1669
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:47.270
and then I'm listening. I'm like, well, I've thought of that.

1670
01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:48.710
That's not going to work for me, dude.

1671
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.960
The Joe Biden answers that dumb ass answer. We're going to take away your guns.

1672
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:53.660
You're going to have a civil war. Guns. You can't,

1673
01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:57.680
you can't take away the St take away assault guns and assault rifles.

1674
01:35:57.681 --> 01:36:01.620
You're not going to do that. They're not going to give them the constitutional.

1675
01:36:01.890 --> 01:36:06.500
They do give Joe, let's say they do do it. There's too many out already, right?

1676
01:36:06.501 --> 01:36:07.640
There's too many on the market.

1677
01:36:07.641 --> 01:36:09.670
So let's say you bought 100 million guns in this case.

1678
01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:12.650
How many people that there's 300,000 people in this 300 million.

1679
01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.780
There's 100 million more guns than there are people. Okay. So you're,

1680
01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:20.300
so if you stop the manufacturer of automatic guns right now,

1681
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:24.050
there's still 100,000 more than people out there and then you'd have to go get

1682
01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:27.680
them, but you'd have to go door to door and search. We can't do that. You can't,

1683
01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:29.540
that's what everyone's thinking will happen.

1684
01:36:29.541 --> 01:36:31.760
It's not realistic like the porridge or some shit.

1685
01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:34.040
How else are you going to get those guns from this? Clearly not.

1686
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:37.430
The answer is that that's never going to happen. Now it's something, you know,

1687
01:36:37.431 --> 01:36:39.710
no one's going to give you those guns. So that's not the answer.

1688
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:41.300
I don't know what the answer is. I don't either.

1689
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:44.060
But the crazy thing is if you look at the mass shootings across the world,

1690
01:36:44.170 --> 01:36:46.490
the most and other countries see like two or three.

1691
01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.060
I know for us it's over 300 already this year,

1692
01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:53.990
yet I think it's two 70 something in a mass shooting is three or more. Yeah. Um,

1693
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:57.620
the other thing to me that's interesting is I used to always think it was kids

1694
01:36:57.950 --> 01:37:00.970
who on you know are in their basement and on bread at their,

1695
01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:04.250
these losers and they have nothing to live for. Probably true.

1696
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:08.400
Some of them sub most nine out of 10. But then you got homeboy like a over in a,

1697
01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.480
where was it, Ohio who had these chicks are coming out.

1698
01:37:11.481 --> 01:37:15.140
He's banging a few girls had a bunch of girls that are like, man, we saw signs.

1699
01:37:15.141 --> 01:37:18.350
He was always talking about mass shootings. Like you have a bracing something.

1700
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:22.730
He had a rape list in high school. Yeah, they all fed. He's fucked up.

1701
01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:23.960
They all thought he was really fucked up.

1702
01:37:23.961 --> 01:37:28.961
But he was also Elizabeth Warren supporter who wrote a post about the need for

1703
01:37:29.271 --> 01:37:31.910
gun control after different mass shootings.

1704
01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:36.740
I mean he was a real left wing guy and this is something that the media is

1705
01:37:36.741 --> 01:37:39.950
ignoring because it doesn't fit the narrative because the narrative is they're

1706
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:44.540
all white male right wing. And he was left wing when he was laughing. Like yeah,

1707
01:37:44.541 --> 01:37:47.540
he's a leftist. I mean, he, he wrote leftist, he,

1708
01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:51.860
him as his pronouns on his page. Wow. Yeah. I mean he was,

1709
01:37:52.310 --> 01:37:55.430
but that has nothing to do with him. He's a psychopath there.

1710
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:56.220
They're saying the kid

1711
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.710
<v 0>that they caught and got in, I don't want to talk about them as students.</v>

1712
01:37:58.711 --> 01:38:01.410
Bums me out when did, after this we'll move on something else. But, um,

1713
01:38:01.940 --> 01:38:04.130
they're saying the kid that caught in a El Paso who,

1714
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:09.000
the one who did end up dying when she did die, but, um, he was saying that,

1715
01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.570
uh, it shows no remorse. He's like, fuck yeah, I did it man. And like,

1716
01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.670
are you kidding me dude? You killed kids. And he's like, you're damn right.

1717
01:38:15.671 --> 01:38:18.950
Shot a baby. How crazy is that? Oh,

1718
01:38:20.610 --> 01:38:24.470
and he's going to get a cushy fucking, you know, Rome. He's living better than,

1719
01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:25.021
than, you know,

1720
01:38:25.021 --> 01:38:29.970
most of these fucking immigrants that come here and get detained. It's insane,

1721
01:38:29.971 --> 01:38:30.300
man.

1722
01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.400
They should definitely kill them and they should definitely should torture them

1723
01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.190
in. Ah, just, just, just, ah, just a quick, it's, it's not fair, man,

1724
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:42.000
but having them suffer doesn't help anybody. It really doesn't.

1725
01:38:42.030 --> 01:38:44.550
But having them around doesn't help anybody either. No,

1726
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.950
you're not going to reform that. Here's the, here's the good thing though.

1727
01:38:46.951 --> 01:38:50.590
In his manifesto, he went, hopefully someone gets them in,

1728
01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:53.850
shoots me so I don't have to go through the legal system. That's way worse.

1729
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:57.330
It'd be way better. Die Real quick. So at least he doesn't want this.

1730
01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:00.120
That's a good thing. Why is it all white dudes

1731
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.240
that weirdness? You know Charlotte crazy. Charlemagne actually put that,

1732
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:10.170
that it was all these white guys that white guys are the biggest threat in terms

1733
01:39:10.171 --> 01:39:14.580
of terrorism in America, and Instagram took his posts. How crazy is that?

1734
01:39:14.670 --> 01:39:16.410
They're more of a threat than isis,

1735
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.400
but he had rows of all these different white guys who committed mass murders and

1736
01:39:20.401 --> 01:39:24.450
as a white guy, I'm like, yeah, yeah, me too. I went, go shit. Charlemagne.

1737
01:39:24.450 --> 01:39:27.120
Yeah, you right. But they took his post down. Well, how crazy is that?

1738
01:39:27.121 --> 01:39:29.640
Then they put it back up. They put it down right? They did.

1739
01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:33.360
Sherman has some power, man. Well, he made his case and he was correct.

1740
01:39:33.361 --> 01:39:37.770
He had literal photographs of all the different people that were white that have

1741
01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:40.770
committed mass murder. Just looked like shit named the last time.

1742
01:39:40.771 --> 01:39:43.950
The last time there was a black guy that committed a mass murder was those

1743
01:39:43.951 --> 01:39:46.980
fucking guys in d c they were shooting people out of their car.

1744
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:50.790
I was talking about this DC sniper. It was a son and a father. Yeah.

1745
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.190
It was a guy in a younger guy where the younger guy was his son. He,

1746
01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.620
that's a serial killer though. Yeah. Yeah.

1747
01:39:58.650 --> 01:40:01.370
Not so much a mass cause really wasn't at a time one. Yeah,

1748
01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.220
he wasn't killing three.

1749
01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:05.250
But that was scary because people were just at like gas stations getting

1750
01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:08.340
Mercked. Well, you know what, this fucking sniper in his van. Well, no,

1751
01:40:08.341 --> 01:40:12.390
he had a car and he had a snipers nest. Like he was shooting out of the trunk.

1752
01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.860
Oh, that's right. He had a hole in the trunk.

1753
01:40:13.861 --> 01:40:17.700
We put the barrel out of the trunk. I mean, scary dude. I mean,

1754
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.910
you would just see people in the distance and just unload. Dude.

1755
01:40:20.911 --> 01:40:24.880
Have you seen the move on? Have you seen the documentary? Uh, um, I,

1756
01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:29.040
it's like terrorist John Isis. John. It's a documentary on HBO. No,

1757
01:40:29.041 --> 01:40:31.840
I heard that's crazy. Jihadi John Gotti. John. Yeah,

1758
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:36.100
I heard it's crazy fucking memory. Yeah, it's crazy. It, oh,

1759
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:39.660
it's fucking good dude. It's crazy. This was, uh,

1760
01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.390
like a normal dude grew up in England.

1761
01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:45.030
He was a refugee right from I think Syria or something like that.

1762
01:40:45.031 --> 01:40:48.750
Somewhere over in the Middle East comes England, played football, soccer,

1763
01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:51.390
football as they call it, grew up normal. Had friends,

1764
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:55.120
was just a normal dude and then just went freaking happen to him.

1765
01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:00.100
They had these girls that went over from England too and they joined isis and

1766
01:41:00.101 --> 01:41:02.440
they're trying to get out and now the camp, cause they got over.

1767
01:41:02.441 --> 01:41:05.890
Then the homeys are run a train on yet 1:00 PM every day.

1768
01:41:05.891 --> 01:41:08.540
That's the way it goes. You fucking moron.

1769
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:13.360
And you gotta dress like job of the hut. Yeah. Dressed like a Ninja.

1770
01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:17.350
[inaudible] thought it was, you have to pay.

1771
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.920
You got to be pretty stupid. The fuck were you thinking, you know,

1772
01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.140
dressed like a Ninja and the homies gonna run a train on everyday.

1773
01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.350
What'd you think you would do with front front and center with automatic rifle

1774
01:41:26.351 --> 01:41:27.880
firing at Americans? You Morons.

1775
01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.730
I wonder what they thought of when they thought they were fighting for good.

1776
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:33.550
Imagine if that's your daughter. Your daughter goes and joins isis like,

1777
01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:37.640
oh see I was thinking about this, the Manson murders, why I'm so into it.

1778
01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.790
I have no idea you got problems. But the Manson murders,

1779
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:44.500
those girls were like 17 and 19 imagine when you're 17 well they were also

1780
01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:48.490
homeless. So you're dealing with people that are probably crazy. Crazy.

1781
01:41:48.491 --> 01:41:50.800
And then this was, that was their family, right?

1782
01:41:50.801 --> 01:41:53.860
This was like the first time they'd ever had like real family and they didn't

1783
01:41:53.861 --> 01:41:54.400
know the murder,

1784
01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:57.010
what the exactly they were going to do till they got to the house.

1785
01:41:57.040 --> 01:41:59.980
Then they're like, all right. I guess one girl dips out, the other two are like,

1786
01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:02.440
all right, let's do this. It was once upon a time in Hollywood,

1787
01:42:02.490 --> 01:42:05.890
their depiction of it twist. You saw it movie loved it.

1788
01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.300
I cannot get enough of the 60s I want to 68 Porsche right in that movie.

1789
01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:14.440
Like amazing. Yeah. I mean, Brad Pitt was great in that movie.

1790
01:42:14.441 --> 01:42:17.970
Leonardo DiCaprio and Oscar. They were both amazing. How about,

1791
01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.410
how about the way they depicted a Bruce Lee?

1792
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:25.660
That was fucked up was it, was it, was it not? I don't know.

1793
01:42:25.690 --> 01:42:26.171
Like I,

1794
01:42:26.171 --> 01:42:31.090
and I'm sure Bruce Lee's Dodger's gonna jump all over it for the stuff I've

1795
01:42:31.210 --> 01:42:34.090
heard. Bruce Lee was a philosopher. W was he a fighter?

1796
01:42:34.091 --> 01:42:37.450
Was He really that much of a bad-ass? I don't know. Like I've heard,

1797
01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.310
I've heard he is, I've heard from people like, no,

1798
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:42.190
and he's never been really a lot of fights. I've heard, I've heard both.

1799
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:46.180
So what I thought was great is they put like Quentin Tarantino put his

1800
01:42:46.181 --> 01:42:47.980
perspective on it where it's like,

1801
01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:51.260
I've heard that narrative and I loved it because I've let,

1802
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:55.480
I've seen it both ways. I've heard where he was in that much of a bad-ass,

1803
01:42:55.481 --> 01:42:59.020
like he doesn't have a crazy record. Yeah. But there wasn't just that. It was,

1804
01:42:59.021 --> 01:43:03.370
he was a dummy in the movie and the problem was in real life there's no evidence

1805
01:43:03.371 --> 01:43:05.440
that he was ever at like an egomaniac dummy.

1806
01:43:05.530 --> 01:43:09.130
He was very interesting guy and very insightful. And I do and I believe,

1807
01:43:09.131 --> 01:43:11.170
and he was like a philosopher and he's brilliant.

1808
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.360
But when it comes to the actual toughness, we don't, we don't know.

1809
01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.330
We don't, we don't know for sure. But that's one. Yeah.

1810
01:43:19.331 --> 01:43:22.840
You've heard that narrative before, right? What narrative that like,

1811
01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:27.430
like he's not an actual tough guy. Well, what I had heard was that it,

1812
01:43:27.490 --> 01:43:31.750
at the time, he was incredibly innovative in terms of martial arts,

1813
01:43:31.751 --> 01:43:35.470
but he didn't really fight and he had like a sparring match wants at a

1814
01:43:35.471 --> 01:43:39.700
tournament and he had some street fights, but he didn't, you know,

1815
01:43:39.701 --> 01:43:41.820
he wasn't like John Jones and that.

1816
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:45.520
But then I've also heard that he was this bad-ass and fought other dudes from

1817
01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:49.000
Dojo Joe's and he's amazing. Yeah. I'm somewhere in the middle. I went and I,

1818
01:43:49.001 --> 01:43:51.590
but he's a big base of all. So what was not the problem though?

1819
01:43:51.591 --> 01:43:54.470
The problem is they made him look like a buffoon and there's no evidence I need

1820
01:43:54.471 --> 01:43:56.570
a little problem with, it's a movie everyone's crying about.

1821
01:43:56.571 --> 01:44:00.440
It's going to turn about a real person who was a real legacy and about to come

1822
01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:04.250
on Joe. It's a fucking Quintin Tarantino movie. And the way that they,

1823
01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:07.940
I don't want to give it spoil the ending, but the ending too. That's not real.

1824
01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.580
Well that's true. Then they had a totally different ending,

1825
01:44:10.670 --> 01:44:13.640
like you're living to make believed everything. No one's real.

1826
01:44:13.641 --> 01:44:17.480
In that step forward, like obviously the, the ranch is real where they went,

1827
01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.290
Charles Manson, who is barely in it, the Manson family, but everyone,

1828
01:44:21.620 --> 01:44:22.820
everyone's kind of dumb.

1829
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:26.120
Like even even Leonardo DiCaprio whose character is a bit of a kidding.

1830
01:44:26.210 --> 01:44:30.350
He's a bit of a dumb ass. Yeah. But that real guy might've been a dumb ass.

1831
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:33.150
I mean we don't know. But we do know that about Pursley either. Yeah.

1832
01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.200
But there's a lot of evidence that Bruce Lee was this brilliant,

1833
01:44:36.201 --> 01:44:40.130
insightful guy and in that movie they made him a caricature of that.

1834
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:43.540
And you have a problem with that? I did. I stood up. I didn't lie flat.

1835
01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:48.530
I don't have a problem with it because it's nice. It was so good.

1836
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:52.300
Cause I thought, I thought Bruce, he's going to beat the fuck out of Brad Pitt.

1837
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:54.710
And then when you see that when I went,

1838
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:58.120
that twist is hilarious cause y'all don't expect it. And I,

1839
01:44:58.190 --> 01:45:00.860
I think of Bruce Lee as a bad ass, which he is.

1840
01:45:01.130 --> 01:45:02.870
Whether he's been in a million fights or not.

1841
01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.350
The way what he's done for martial arts is his own president.

1842
01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:09.320
It's amazing what he did. So take that twist for me in the mood.

1843
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:12.830
That's what I want from the family's reaction. Oh my God,

1844
01:45:12.831 --> 01:45:16.670
the sisters are may his daughter's pissed. She'd be pissed if that was my dad.

1845
01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:20.720
Like fuck you. And that movie is so big. Like fuck you guys.

1846
01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:24.470
Cause when's the last time Bruce Lee got brought up besides Jesse at root to

1847
01:45:24.471 --> 01:45:25.940
fight selling a Bruce Lee t-shirt?

1848
01:45:25.941 --> 01:45:27.530
When's the last time you got brought the fuck up?

1849
01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:31.760
The dude who played brucey was not shredded enough. Yeah,

1850
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.650
he should've been more shredded. Conch round.

1851
01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:38.180
See I like the twist because eight, it's not real. B,

1852
01:45:38.181 --> 01:45:42.010
you thought Bruce Suzanne beat the fuck out of back then. I did for sure.

1853
01:45:42.011 --> 01:45:44.840
I was like, oh, he's about to get fucked up. I knew the way he don't.

1854
01:45:44.841 --> 01:45:47.600
Bruce Lee doing that, jumping, flying kick, his signature kick.

1855
01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:51.200
That's probably how it towed. Right?

1856
01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:55.220
Talking about with the guy who's been in fights like, get the fuck Outta here,

1857
01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.490
Bruce Lee's philosophy in real fights though,

1858
01:45:58.491 --> 01:46:01.940
was that keeping things simple like leg kicks and quick punches.

1859
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:04.670
You're living rowdy Joe. You're living in the legs here. Bruce Lee,

1860
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:07.760
which is probably true, but in a Quintin Tarantino movie.

1861
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:11.720
That was fucking great, man. I thought that movie's brilliant.

1862
01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.113
Movie was brilliant.

1863
01:46:13.130 --> 01:46:15.620
I did not like the Bruce Lee things because I thought it was,

1864
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:19.220
it wasn't necessary. It was there. They made him look like a Dork,

1865
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:23.810
but everyone sucks his dick. So to mix it up,

1866
01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.260
it's fantastic. Like Bruce Lee, everyone, you know, he's the best.

1867
01:46:27.261 --> 01:46:28.340
And I agree he's the best.

1868
01:46:28.341 --> 01:46:33.341
So it's a movie that's supposed to be about a real guy that has a real legacy

1869
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:37.670
and they made him look like a buffoon. It's the Dan V's though. I know,

1870
01:46:37.671 --> 01:46:42.530
but they, they, you know, you're making the guy look like a fucking idiot. Yeah.

1871
01:46:42.531 --> 01:46:46.100
But anyone who wasn't really an idiot, it wasn't anybody at all. Not at all.

1872
01:46:46.101 --> 01:46:47.300
He's a brilliant philosopher.

1873
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.880
And what he did for martial arts is that is amazing. That's what's great.

1874
01:46:51.990 --> 01:46:54.720
That's what's great. Cause we know he has, he's great.

1875
01:46:54.930 --> 01:46:56.580
And you assume he's going to beat up Brad Pitt, right?

1876
01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:00.000
You're a weird fucking guy. I Dunno. Why he like, I think that's good.

1877
01:47:00.150 --> 01:47:04.260
I like the twist. Like if you were to beat Brad Pitt up, I went. All right.

1878
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:06.960
Well all right. Yeah, moving on. I didn't think that was gonna happen.

1879
01:47:06.961 --> 01:47:10.380
I thought Brad Pitt was gonna fuck him up. I didn't prep it. Knew how to fight.

1880
01:47:10.890 --> 01:47:11.723
Yeah.

1881
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:16.230
Who's that bigger guy and he knew how to fight and the reality is a bigger guy

1882
01:47:16.231 --> 01:47:17.310
who knows how to fight.

1883
01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:20.620
Who really knows that if I is gonna fuck up 130 pound shines. Right.

1884
01:47:20.621 --> 01:47:21.780
You're thinking about it too much.

1885
01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:26.900
Did you think about things [inaudible] though? Yeah, you do. You're like, oh,

1886
01:47:26.910 --> 01:47:30.840
I loved it. The twist. I love the twist. His family is furious. Right?

1887
01:47:30.841 --> 01:47:33.660
You got anything on that? Is his daughter's pissed? She did a video.

1888
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:38.730
I was looking into, uh, just people talking about what really happened, I guess.

1889
01:47:38.731 --> 01:47:41.400
Or this might come from a story from some, oh,

1890
01:47:41.401 --> 01:47:43.650
there was a real interaction between the two styles.

1891
01:47:43.651 --> 01:47:48.350
I'm trying to figure out how to pick this up. It's already four 30. Is it?

1892
01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:52.540
Fuck out of here. Um, can I have everybody? Wait? What's going on? K,

1893
01:47:52.590 --> 01:47:54.480
where's your, where's your comedy tonight? Everybody?

1894
01:47:54.810 --> 01:47:59.280
I'm in Portland next week with a Derek Postin Chappelle, Lacey, Portland,

1895
01:47:59.281 --> 01:48:01.980
helium. Thursday, Friday. Saturday is two monsters.

1896
01:48:02.250 --> 01:48:06.210
Did a good show and then still go back. Flip. Yes. He's a male cheerleader.

1897
01:48:06.211 --> 01:48:09.720
Easy cheese. Wider than you and me. Yeah. He's so powerful.

1898
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:12.960
He's like Greenbay through this girl up. The girl weighed like a hundred pounds,

1899
01:48:13.110 --> 01:48:17.610
threw her up in the air card, her on one hand and she standing on his hand.

1900
01:48:17.611 --> 01:48:19.380
I'm like, God damn that dude strong. However,

1901
01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:22.830
we played basketball at my house and he couldn't get through a game of 21 love

1902
01:48:22.831 --> 01:48:26.610
Chappelle though. Why not? Not In shape for basketball, bro. Oh,

1903
01:48:26.611 --> 01:48:30.270
we mean the exhausted started. You do that too. Yeah, I know.

1904
01:48:30.271 --> 01:48:33.990
That's what he say. He say he loves it. Yeah. Uh, but so I'm in, uh, Portland,

1905
01:48:34.190 --> 01:48:36.300
uh, next week, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Portland, helium.
