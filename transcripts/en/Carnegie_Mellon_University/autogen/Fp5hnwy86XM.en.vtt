the genome is expressed in different
 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.430
the genome is expressed in different
cell types and no one would have ever

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440
cell types and no one would have ever
 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.959
cell types and no one would have ever
thought ten years ago that's what an

right now understanding what genes are

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340
right now understanding what genes are
 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.769
right now understanding what genes are
there but not just what genes are there

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779
there but not just what genes are there
 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.779
there but not just what genes are there
how are they expressed and how are they

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789
how are they expressed and how are they
 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.519
how are they expressed and how are they
expressed such that my ears state ears

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529
expressed such that my ears state ears
 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.830
expressed such that my ears state ears
and my liver stays a liver the whole way

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840
and my liver stays a liver the whole way
 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.420
and my liver stays a liver the whole way
through my body's development it's

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430
through my body's development it's
 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.660
through my body's development it's
really important so we look at this as

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670
really important so we look at this as
 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.610
really important so we look at this as
DNA is both a very complex polymer

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620
DNA is both a very complex polymer
 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.590
DNA is both a very complex polymer
system so we can apply traditional

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600
system so we can apply traditional
 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.690
system so we can apply traditional
aspects of chemical engineering but also

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700
aspects of chemical engineering but also
 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.250
aspects of chemical engineering but also
it's a complex polymer that does

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260
it's a complex polymer that does
 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.040
it's a complex polymer that does
important things so we really combine

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050
important things so we really combine
 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.510
important things so we really combine
these two techniques and we're able to

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520
these two techniques and we're able to
 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.540
these two techniques and we're able to
get at very fundamental important cell

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550
get at very fundamental important cell
 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.850
get at very fundamental important cell
biological problems that like I said

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860
biological problems that like I said
 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.290
biological problems that like I said
could not be dealt with any other way

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300
could not be dealt with any other way
 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.569
could not be dealt with any other way
tissue engineering and drug delivery are

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579
tissue engineering and drug delivery are
 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.819
tissue engineering and drug delivery are
the next big things for most engineers

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829
the next big things for most engineers
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.290
the next big things for most engineers
but unfortunately they haven't been

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300
but unfortunately they haven't been
 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.999
but unfortunately they haven't been
successful because people don't really

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009
successful because people don't really
 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.770
successful because people don't really
understand the fundamental character of

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780
understand the fundamental character of
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.300
understand the fundamental character of
the cell and that's what we're trying to

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310
the cell and that's what we're trying to
 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.100
the cell and that's what we're trying to
do from the smallest molecular level

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110
do from the smallest molecular level
 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.140
do from the smallest molecular level
inside the cell trying to understand

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150
inside the cell trying to understand
 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.840
inside the cell trying to understand
what controls it now we have a building

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850
what controls it now we have a building
 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.539
what controls it now we have a building
on the shoulders of giants in biology so

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549
on the shoulders of giants in biology so
 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.160
on the shoulders of giants in biology so
biologists have done a great job of

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170
biologists have done a great job of
 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.740
biologists have done a great job of
explaining what binds to what what

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750
explaining what binds to what what
 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.990
explaining what binds to what what
interacts with what the time scales and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000
interacts with what the time scales and
 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.210
interacts with what the time scales and
things like that we're really looking at

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
things like that we're really looking at
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.130
things like that we're really looking at
the whole system now and understanding

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140
the whole system now and understanding
 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.960
the whole system now and understanding
how that system is all put together and

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970
how that system is all put together and
 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.539
how that system is all put together and
what could possibly be the regulatory

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549
what could possibly be the regulatory
 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.460
what could possibly be the regulatory
components of the system things like

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470
components of the system things like
 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.609
components of the system things like
that so I think the future is unlimited

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619
that so I think the future is unlimited
 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.800
that so I think the future is unlimited
once you understand something you can

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810
once you understand something you can
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.870
once you understand something you can
change it so we're also looking at the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880
change it so we're also looking at the
 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.389
change it so we're also looking at the
changes involved in cancer metastasis so

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399
changes involved in cancer metastasis so
 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.800
changes involved in cancer metastasis so
once we understand what's really the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810
once we understand what's really the
 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.109
once we understand what's really the
underlying mechanism that would turn to

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119
underlying mechanism that would turn to
 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.510
underlying mechanism that would turn to
normally possibly over proliferated cell

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
normally possibly over proliferated cell
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.020
normally possibly over proliferated cell
into a tumor we can control it so I

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
into a tumor we can control it so I
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.810
into a tumor we can control it so I
firmly believe that understanding comes

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820
firmly believe that understanding comes
 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.200
firmly believe that understanding comes
before creation and design in particular

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210
before creation and design in particular
 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.420
before creation and design in particular
in biology we're making big headway now

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430
in biology we're making big headway now
 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.550
in biology we're making big headway now
into understanding so the future can

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
into understanding so the future can
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380
into understanding so the future can
really work on the design concepts of

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390
really work on the design concepts of
 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.400
really work on the design concepts of
making biology better

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410
making biology better
 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.470
making biology better
