00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.300
- [Instructor] Let's review calculating

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.700
confidence intervals for proportions.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.440
So let's say I have a population,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.300
and I care about some proportion.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.227
Let's say I care about the proportion

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:11.810
of folks that are left-handed.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.350
I don't know what that is,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.020
and so I take a sample of size n,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.980
and then from that sample,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.510
I can calculate a sample proportion.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.380
That's why I put that
little hat on top of it.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.660
It's a sample proportion that's estimating

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.410
our true proportion.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.430
Now I wanna construct
a confidence interval,

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.220
but before I go down the path,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.500
I need to actually set up
my conditions for inference,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.980
make sure that I meet them.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.810
And we've done this many times.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.710
So the first condition for inference

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.920
is the random condition.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.630
I need to feel good that
this is truly a random sample

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.090
from the population.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.500
The second one is often known
as the normal condition,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.340
and that's the condition that hey,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.180
in order to feel like
the sampling distribution

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.160
for the sample proportions
is roughly normal,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.990
n times our sample proportion

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.270
should be greater than or equal to 10

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.320
and n times one minus
our sample proportion

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.470
should be greater than or equal to 10.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.770
We've seen that multiple times before.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.970
And then the third one is
the independence condition,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.490
and there's two ways to meet this.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.560
Either the individual
observations in our sample

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.580
should be done with replacement

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.170
or if it's not done with replacement,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.210
we can feel pretty confident about this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.280
if our sample size is no more than 10%

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.230
of the size of the entire population.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.860
But let's say that we meet
these conditions for inference,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.430
what do we do?

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.370
Well we come up, we set
up a confidence level,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.390
confidence level,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.090
for our confidence interval
that we're about to construct.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.390
And let's say we said it
was a 95% confidence level.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.700
That would mean that 95% of the time

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.840
that we went through this exercise,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.113
the confidence interval that we get would

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.880
actually overlap with the
true population proportion.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.530
And 95% is actually a fairly typical one.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.300
But from that confidence level,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.340
you can calculate a critical value.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.330
And the way that you do that,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.710
you just look up in a z-table,

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.360
and once again all of this is review.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.590
You would say hey how
many standard deviations

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.760
above and below the mean
of a normal distribution

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.880
would you need to go in order to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.880
get say 95%, that confidence
level of the distribution.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.360
And now we're ready to calculate
the confidence interval,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.923
confidence interval.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.600
It is going to be equal to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.030
our sample proportion

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.730
plus or minus our critical value,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.450
our critical value,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.380
times the standard deviation

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.270
of the sampling distribution

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.020
of the sample proportion.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.240
Now there is a way to
calculate this exactly

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.370
if we knew what p is.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.520
If we knew what p is,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.500
this would be the square root
of p times one minus p over n.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.333
But if we knew what p is,

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.380
then we wouldn't even
have to do this business

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.200
of constructing confidence intervals.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.250
So instead, we estimate this.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.700
We say look, an estimate
of the standard deviation

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.790
of the sampling distribution,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.600
often known as the standard error,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.640
an estimate of this is going to be

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.380
the square root of,

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.490
instead of the true population parameter,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.180
we could use the sample proportion.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.760
So p hat times one minus p hat,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.790
all of that over n.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.160
Now the whole reason why I did this,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.470
this is covered in much
more detail and much slower

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.303
in other videos,

00:03:29.303 --> 00:03:32.050
is to see the parallels
between this and a situation

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.040
when we're constructing a
two-sample confidence interval

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.420
or z-interval for a difference
between proportions.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.340
What am I talking about?

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.660
Well let's say that you have
two different populations.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.460
So this is the first population,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.820
and it has some true
proportion of the folks

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.070
that let's say are left-handed,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.870
and then there's another population.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.840
So let's call that p two.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.820
You know maybe this is

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.140
freshmen in your high school or college

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.390
and maybe this is sophomores,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.920
so two different populations,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.240
and you wanna see if
there's a difference between

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.670
the proportion that are left-handed, say.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.760
And so what you could do,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.080
just like we've done here,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.420
is for each of these populations,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.950
you'll take a sample here,
we'll call that n one,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.130
and then from that sample you calculate

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.140
a sample proportion,
let's call that p one.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.970
And then from this second population,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.070
we do the same thing.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.710
This is n two.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.110
Notice n one and n two do not have to be

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.540
the same sample size.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.700
That's a common misconception
when doing these things.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.750
These could be different sample sizes.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.190
And then from that sample,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.260
you calculate the sample proportion.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.450
Now after you do that,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.460
you would wanna check your
conditions for inference.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.040
And it turns out that the
conditions for inference

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.010
would be exactly the same.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.970
Do both of these samples
meet the random condition?

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.660
Do both of these samples
meet the normal condition?

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.340
And do both of these samples

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.110
meet the independence condition?

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.640
And if both samples meet these
conditions for inference,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.120
then we would have to
calculate our critical value.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.720
And you would do it the exact same way.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.240
I'll just write it down again.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.950
So first, you need to check all of these.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.790
Then you would take your confidence level,

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.730
confidence level,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.160
and from that get a critical z.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.537
And then you're ready to
say what your confidence

00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:22.040
interval's going to be.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.323
So your confidence,

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.393
confidence interval,

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.080
interval for p one

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.720
minus p two, so it's
the confidence interval

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.700
for the difference

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.660
between these true population proportions.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.010
That is going to be
equal to the difference

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.360
between your sample proportions,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.310
so p hat one minus p hat two,

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.423
p hat two, plus or minus,

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.790
plus or minus your critical
value right over here

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.330
times the standard deviation

00:06:04.585 --> 00:06:06.430
of the sampling distribution
of the difference

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.700
between the sample proportions.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.689
So it would be p hat one minus

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.590
p hat two.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.920
And so we already know
how to calculate this,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.240
how to calculate this,
how to calculate this.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.690
How do we calculate that?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.940
Well I will just give
you the formula first,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.030
but then we just have to appreciate

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.970
that this just comes outta the properties

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.336
of standard deviations and variances

00:06:30.336 --> 00:06:33.100
that we have studied in the past.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.030
So the standard deviation

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.530
of the sampling distribution

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.210
of the difference between
the sample proportions,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.633
it is a mouthful,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.720
this is going to be
approximately equal to,

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.020
approximately equal to the square root

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.020
of p hat one times one minus p hat one

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.360
over n one, over n one,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.460
plus, plus, p hat two

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.220
times one minus p hat two

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.560
over n two.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.720
And then you put that there.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.730
You have constructed
your confidence interval.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.990
And once again how would
you interpret that?

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.280
Well let's say your
confidence level is 90%,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.710
and from that you're able to construct

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.543
this confidence interval.

00:07:20.543 --> 00:07:22.300
That would mean that 90% of the time

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.040
that you go through this exercise,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.180
your confidence interval would overlap

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.040
with the true difference

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.680
between these population parameters,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.500
the true difference between
these population proportions.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.840
Now where did this thing come from?

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.970
Well you might notice
some similarities here.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.070
This part over here

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.870
is an estimate or it's
approximately equal to

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.090
the variance of the sampling distribution

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.180
of the sample proportion
for our first population.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.030
And then this right over here

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.260
once again is approximately
going to be equal

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.500
to the variance of the
sampling distribution

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.060
for the sample proportions
for this population,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.443
for p two.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.600
How did I know that?

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.310
Well look if this is approximately
the standard deviation,

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.310
you square that, you
approximately get the variance.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.810
And so the big takeaway is,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.060
is that the variance for
the sampling distribution

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.210
of the difference is just the sum

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.000
of the variances of each of
those sampling distributions.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.440
That's a lotta big mouthful and I know

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.550
it can get confusing, but
hopefully that makes sense.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.250
And that's where this formula comes from,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.360
and so it's really not
that much more to remember.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.940
