socio-ecological and yes the mouthful

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
socio-ecological and yes the mouthful
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130
socio-ecological and yes the mouthful
but I think it describes the problem in

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

we're trying to answer we need to look
 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.859
we're trying to answer we need to look
to some specific sets of science that

to some specific sets of science that
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.440
to some specific sets of science that
could help us solve them and I don't

socio-ecological the terms mixed
 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.150
socio-ecological the terms mixed
together allows you to accept the fact

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160
together allows you to accept the fact
 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.280
together allows you to accept the fact
that it science is never going to be the

and the kind of culture associated with
 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.030
and the kind of culture associated with
how we live on this earth and the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040
how we live on this earth and the
 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.759
how we live on this earth and the
government's that work with us to accept

government's that work with us to accept
 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.979

that change is going to happen but it's

that change is going to happen but it's
 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.210
