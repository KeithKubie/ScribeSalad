00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:05.220
BRUNO DENUIT: Hi.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.226
I'm Bruno.

00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:08.870
I'm the Chief Software
Architect at EnPlug.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.060
We are the first open software
platform for digital signage.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.050
In this video, I
would like to show you

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.820
how you can use the EnPlug
platform to develop an app

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.240
and deploy your content to any
physical device in the world.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.030
So when we started
EnPlug, we decided

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.810
to go with the Android platform,
because it's an open platform.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.060
It's very popular, and it
also let us run our software

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.810
on inexpensive hardware.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.200
We decided to make our
software an open platform

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.730
so that the people
who want to bring

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.290
their content into
the digital world

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.690
could focus on their
value add by building

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.500
an app on our
platform, and wouldn't

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.940
have to worry about
all the details

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.830
that we had to worry about.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.190
So how do you start doing that?

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.880
How do you start writing an
app for the EnPlug platform?

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.060
Go to developers.enplug.com.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.710
Sign up and download our SDK.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.420
Our SDK is made up of two parts.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.910
Obviously, there is the SDK
for actually writing the app

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.350
that we run on the devices.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.880
It will run for
Android, but it also

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.250
runs in desktop, Mac and
Windows, and now Chrome OS,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.960
like I mentioned.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.640
And the other part is
if you want your app

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.310
to be more customized, if
there are certain configuration

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.370
settings that you want
the user to select,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.280
then you can use our web
SDK to create a web page,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.470
and have the user save
all these configuration

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.540
and things in EnPlug.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.510
We have two examples on
GitHub of sample apps

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.780
that you can download
and use out of the box.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.820
The first one is
a very simple app

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.520
that allows you to show
any kind of web page.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.690
So you can get going
from the start.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.990
Just download that app,
point it to your websites,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.620
and it will start
showing on the screen.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.630
The second app is
for people who want

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.390
to go a little bit further
and create their own app,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.110
customize their own app.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.240
And that contains a
framework for creating an app

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.210
on our platform.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.760
So here you have an
example of our web app

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.200
where you can configure
your different apps.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.520
You can toggle them on and off.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.620
I selected Waitlist.me app
to show how to configure it.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.170
You can go and configure
your Waitlist app.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.660
It asks you to connect with
an account on Waitlist.me.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.390
So this is an example of the
integration between EnPlug

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.290
and a third party.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.915
Type in your credentials
for Waitlist.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.710
You select the location that
you are checked in with.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:17.640
And type some
text, some tagline.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.970
Minimum number of people.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.540
These are all configuration
settings for Waitlist.me.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.870
You save it, and it
shows up preview of how

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.160
your screen will look like.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.750
I hope you check out EnPlug.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.130
Go to developers.enplug.com.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.910
Sign up, download our SDK, try
it out, and you'll see how easy

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.400
and how much fun you will have.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.790
Thank you.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.240
