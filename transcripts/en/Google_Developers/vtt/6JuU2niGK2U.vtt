FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hello.

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.330
I'm Florina Muntenescu
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.550
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.530

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.200
We recently released the
first production ready version

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.920
of Oboe, a C++ library for
building real-time audio apps.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.670
Oboe provides the lowest
possible audio latency

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.610
across the widest range
of Android devices.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.340

in Mountain View, California.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.930
It will be two days of
deep, technical sessions

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.580

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.970
And here are a few
of the announcements.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.640
Container-native load balancing

on Google Cloud Platform,
is now available in alpha.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.970
We're adding enhancements,
to Cloud Spanner's SQL

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.940
capabilities, to make it
easier to read and write

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.060
data in Cloud Spanner
databases using SQL,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.920
and use off-the-shelf
drivers and tooling.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.180
Cloud Spanner's API now supports
INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE SQL

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.390
statements.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.540
We're also offering
Key Visualizer,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.870
so you can see key access
patterns in heatmap format

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.240
to optimize your
Cloud Bigtable schemas

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.280
for improved performance.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.800
There are some Cloud Storage
updates that give you even more

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.080
control over how and
where your data is stored,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.610
including the new dual-regional
option for replicating data,

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.360
Nearline and Coldline
data are now geo-redundant

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.330

for active question answering--
a research project that

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.780
investigates using
reinforcement learning

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.979
to train artificial agents
for question answering.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.740
ActiveQA interacts with QA
systems using natural language,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.230
with the goal of
providing better answers.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250

to hover over a live expression,
to highlight a Domino, store

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.360
Dominoes as global variables,
picture-in-picture breakpoints,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.180
and more.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.650

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.310
Flutter Live is happening on
December 4th at the Science

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.690
Museum in London.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.730
This is a worldwide
celebration of Flutter

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.845
that will include announcements,
live demos, and more.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:48.490
The event will be optimized
for online viewers,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.100
with viewing parties
happening around the world

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.600
So make sure you
head on to the site

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.990
to save the date and sign-up
to watch the livestream.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.300
To provide additional
assurances for users,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.530
we recently announced new
policies focused on Gmail APIs.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.700
They'll help ensure
appropriate access, how

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.470
data may not be used, how data
must be secured, and more.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.920
The policies go into
effect on January 9, 2019.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.759
More details are
available in the post.

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:16.300
Over the next few
months, we'll start

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.790
showing each Google Account
permission that an app

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.210
requests, one at a time,
within its own dialogue

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.890
instead of presenting
all permissions

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.570
in a single dialogue.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.810
Users will have the abilities
to grant or deny permissions,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.370
individually.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.810
To prepare for
this change, there

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.476
are a number of actions
you should take,

00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:36.400
within your app, which are
outlined in the post linked

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.210
in the description below.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.930
