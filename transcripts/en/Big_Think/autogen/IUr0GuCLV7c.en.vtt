the top left now and we'll be moving a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530
the top left now and we'll be moving a
 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.190
the top left now and we'll be moving a
little bit further up actually which

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200

daily and so really sort of just by kind

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
daily and so really sort of just by kind
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920
daily and so really sort of just by kind
of testing and looking around the site

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

staying just on the homepage and not

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290
staying just on the homepage and not
 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.560
staying just on the homepage and not
looking around and also not joining the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570
looking around and also not joining the
 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.990
looking around and also not joining the
