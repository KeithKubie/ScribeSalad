00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.890
Exercise makes you thinner and does all sorts
of other stuff.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.220
But who cares about that because it makes
your brain stronger too!

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.059
Hey guys, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.990
We all know that exercise is good for us.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.080
Getting off the couch and onto the treadmill
strengthens our muscles, increases blood flow,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.960
gives us energy and, of course, burns fat,
so that we can ACTUALLY fit into those skinny

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960
jeans.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.500
For most people, this is more than enough
incentive to hit the gym.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.490
But, for some of us, particularly those stay-home-and-read
types, those of us who are less sporty, health

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.780
and fitness alone just isn’t enough reason
to slap on the spandex.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.190
But here's another benefit: exercise could
also strengthen your Brain - particularly

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.190
your memory!

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.500
A new study out of Radboud University in the
Netherlands gathered three groups of random

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.210
participants and asked each to look at the
same set of images.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.190
The first group did a somewhat-strenuous,
35-minute workout immediately after.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.820
The second group did the same exercise four
hours later, and the third didn’t exercise

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.470
at all (yay control!)

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.230
Two days later, all the participants retook
the image test, and those in the second group

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.939
who had a four-hour delay were able to recall
the the most images.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.490
This suggests that regular exercise may improve
long-term memory, that is, the ability the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.159
recall anything from more than just a few
minutes ago.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.159
The catch?

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.700
The exercise must happen around the time the
memory is formed.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.259
According to researchers, this is because
when you work out, your Brain releases neurotransmitters

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.540
like dopamine and noradrenaline that help
your Brain consolidate memories.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.759
If these chemicals are absent when your Brain
absorbs information, that information is thought

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.630
to decay more rapidly.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.750
This suggests that regular exercise may improve
long-term memory, that is, the ability the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.210
recall anything from more than just a few
minutes ago.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.210
But here’s where things get tricky.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.850
The participants in that first group (who
worked-out immediately after the test) recalled

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.090
about the same number of images as those who
didn’t work-out at all.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.299
This means that your ability to remember things
depends not just on IF you work out but WHEN

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.299
you work out.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.649
That is, a short delay between the moment
your Brain logs the information and when you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.590
get on the treadmill could be crucial to your
ability to recall that information.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.789
Of course, more research is needed, so scientists
can’t yet say for sure whether delayed exercise

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.099
leads to better memory.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.709
But, when it comes to exercise as a direct
cause of increased cognitive ability, scientists

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.840
are pretty much in agreement that it does!

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.670
This is because exercise releases hormones
that reduce inflammation and insulin resistance,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.260
as well as stimulating the growth of cells
and blood vessels in your Brain, making it,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.689
in a sense, stronger.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.129
Some studies have even suggested that the
parts of the Brain that control your memory

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.730
- the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal
cortex - are larger in people who regularly

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.730
exercise.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.730
The best part about it?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.870
You can just be same old lazy you, apart from
just two hours of moderate exercise a week.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.870
Two hours a week!

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.769
That could mean walking your dog for a half-hour
every other day, riding your bike to work,

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.580
or playing 18-holes on the weekend.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.860
Harvard researchers even count household activities,
like raking leaves or “intense floor mopping”.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.860
Seriously.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.069
That's a quote.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.810
Basically, as long as you break out in a light
sweat - it’s exercise!

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.000
And the key to unlocking these benefits - at
least in a long-term sense - is regularity.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.180
To do that, fitness-experts recommend group
fitness classes or personal trainers, because

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.390
you’re more likely to follow an exercise
regime that is scheduled.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.230
When exercise becomes routine, your memory
strengthens, and soon enough, “forgetting

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.260
to workout” will no longer be a viable excuse.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.720
You know what's not exercise?

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
Sex.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.050
Sorry, every human ever.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:48.430
