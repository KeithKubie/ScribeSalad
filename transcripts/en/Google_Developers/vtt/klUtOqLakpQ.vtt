WAYNE SUTTON: Hi,
I'm Wayne Sutton.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.210
MELINDA EPLER:
I'm Melinda Epler.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.160
We're the founders
of Change Catalyst.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.260
We empower inclusive and
sustainable innovation

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.840
globally through startup
ecosystem and tech inclusion

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.710
programs

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.626
WAYNE SUTTON: Welcome
to this series sponsored

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:22.740
by Women Techmakers,
Google's initiative that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.790
provides visibility,
community, and resources

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.170
for women in technology.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.420
MELINDA EPLER: Together we're
helping tech hub leaders

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.060
to develop more inclusive tech
cultures, programs, and spaces.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.710
In an ever expanding
tech economy,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.140
tech hubs are the centers
of innovation for cities

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.430
and regions around the world.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.140
WAYNE SUTTON: A
tech hub is usually

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.420
a physical space
or community that

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.120
provides educational
opportunities, meet ups,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.980
events, and co-working spaces.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.096
It may also house an
incubator or accelerator.

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:50.720
MELINDA EPLER: Inside
a tech hub you'll

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.120
find a community of
entrepreneurs, engineers,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.910
investors, and community
leaders building innovative tech

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.380
products and services.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.030
WAYNE SUTTON: Tech hubs
provide support to early stage

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.980
startups, access to mentorship,
and new team members' skills

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.610
building and career development,
shared spaces, and learning.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.640
As well as formal and
informal opportunities

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.390
for collaboration.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.806
MELINDA EPLER:
We're going to talk

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.230
about diversity and inclusion
a lot in this series.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.730
Here's how we define it--

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.640
diversity is bringing people to
the table from a wide variety

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.886
of backgrounds.

00:01:20.886 --> 00:01:22.760
But it's not enough just
to sit at the table,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.390
inclusion invites them to speak
and encourages them to lead.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.725
You need both together
for your team to thrive.

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:30.350
WAYNE SUTTON: A fully
inclusive culture

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.980
is one where
everyone is welcome,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.330
accepted, respected,
supported, and able to thrive

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.230
across all genders, races,
ethnicities, abilities,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.370
religious beliefs, veteran
status, geographic origins,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.785
sexual orientations, ages,
social economic backgrounds.

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:48.410
MELINDA EPLER: When
we're all included,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.830
we all feel happier and produce
better business results.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.370
We love coming to work,
we have more confidence,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.530
we're more productive, and we
can show up as our full selves.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.710
Our staff satisfaction
increases, turnover decreases,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.260
and we all invest
in our workplace.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.420
Tech hubs are the center
of innovation for cities,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.280
and collaboration
between diverse peoples

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.199
creates the best solutions.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.380
Inclusive teams solve
problems for everyone.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.100
Innovation must come from
all of us, for all of us.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.890
WAYNE SUTTON: Tech is the
most rapidly growing sector

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.200
with some of the
highest paying jobs.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.780
Yet, right now, it's
leaving people out.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.780
This is what we call the
wealth and opportunity gap.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.830
At the same time, there are many
unfulfilled tech jobs, which

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.420
is continuing to increase.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.190
MELINDA EPLER: Yeah, tech is
one of the few industries where

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.350
you can enter the workplace
with the right skills

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.366
in under a year.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:38.990
WAYNE SUTTON: Right
now, tech is losing

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.619
out on this great opportunity
by not including more people.

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.660
MELINDA EPLER: Increasing
diversity and inclusion

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.820
can dramatically affect
the products you make

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.920
and the bottom line
for your company.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.910
Here's the data-- diverse
and inclusive teams show 22%

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.840
greater productivity, 39%
higher customer satisfaction.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.170
Gender diverse leadership
teams have 15% higher

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.110
financial returns, and
ethnically diverse leadership

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.244
teams have 35% higher
financial returns.

00:03:06.244 --> 00:03:07.910
WAYNE SUTTON: We all
have a role to play

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.700
in solving diversity
and inclusion in tech,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.420
because we all had a role in
creating the imbalances that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.812
currently keep under-represented
people out of tech.

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:19.520
MELINDA EPLER: There
is a network effect.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.520
WAYNE SUTTON: Access to
capital and jobs in tech

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.320
both rely on networks that some
people don't have access to.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.050
Even understanding
the tech culture

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.850
and how the tech
industry operates

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.100
can be tough for people
who aren't currently

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.235
inside the tech industry.

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:33.860
MELINDA EPLER: There's
a tech education

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.470
gap that starts in early
childhood education

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.970
and grows larger from there.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.220
Without early digital
access and role models,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.260
kids are less likely to
be interested in tech

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.610
in the first place.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.110
And even if they
become interested,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.640
unless they attend
an elite school,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.800
they're less likely to
be hired for a tech role.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.930
WAYNE SUTTON: There's
a false meritocracy

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.130
in the tech industry.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.840
There is a belief
that everyone gets

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.810
to the top due to
their own merit,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.190
and that others who
aren't at the top

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.480
just didn't have the
skills to get there.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.770
But our systems are
created for, and by,

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.760
a homogeneous culture that
actively, and passively, leaves

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.944
out the majority of
the world's population.

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:12.110
MELINDA EPLER: Where skills
and the ability to learn

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.546
are universal,
opportunity is not.

00:04:14.546 --> 00:04:16.670
WAYNE SUTTON: There's also
a lack of representation

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.899
in media, in textbooks,
in toys, and in films.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.220
If you can see
it, you can be it.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.160
But if you don't see
it, you might not

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.204
think tech is a
real path for you.

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:29.120
MELINDA EPLER: Changing
behavior is hard, too,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.640
and full of economic
and emotional barriers.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.350
We're humans with
biases that affect

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.682
our judgments about people.

00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:36.140
WAYNE SUTTON: To
be more inclusive,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.035
we must work on our
own empathy for others

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:41.457
and acknowledge and
filter our own biases.

00:04:41.457 --> 00:04:43.790
MELINDA EPLER: And to have
more inclusive tech companies

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.400
and tech hubs, we have to change
a lot of individual behaviors.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.930
This is not an easy task and
takes both time and resources.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.305
WAYNE SUTTON: But
it is worth it.

00:04:51.305 --> 00:04:54.450
When you develop an inclusive
culture at your tech hub,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.690
you will be rewarded
with an innovation

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.940
ecosystem that truly thrives.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.610
It's good for business, it's
good for the local economy,

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:02.640
it's good for the world.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.720
Watch the series of videos to
learn how you and your team

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.980
can address these issues and
become a more inclusive tech

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.700
hub.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.241
MELINDA EPLER: It starts with
measurement and accountability,

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.530
the role of leadership in
diversity and inclusion,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.167
creating an inclusive culture.

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:18.000
WAYNE SUTTON: Expanding
your diversity goals

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.900
through external
programs, and create

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.300
inclusive physical
spaces in your hub.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.030
