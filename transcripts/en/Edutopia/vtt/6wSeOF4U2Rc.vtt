00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:06.039
(students chattering)

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:08.020
- [Jason] So the name String Theory is

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.210
a little bit of a play
on our strings program,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.950
but also is a way to bring
science to the forefront.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.700
In physics string theory
was a way to rationalize

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.170
how you can have mutually exclusive worlds

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.660
operate at the same
time in perfect harmony.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.980
In education kids need
some rigor in academics,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.643
but also things like innovation
and joy and creativity.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:31.515
(students clapping)

00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:39.830
(bright guitar music)

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.613
String Theory Schools is based here

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:43.680
in Center City, Philadelphia.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.500
Some of our overarching design
elements are our pathways,

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.930
the passion, our mobile first approach

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.363
to technology integration,
and our real world culture.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.530
We began with the idea of
giving students the opportunity

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.840
to figure out what type
of learner they are,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.690
and also what type of creative they are.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.930
So in our school model we have
a 90-minute-longer school day

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.650
that begins in kindergarten,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.320
and they have seven extra classes:

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.880
vocal music, instrumental
music, classical ballet,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.041
French as a foreign
language, creative writing,

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:17.980
visual arts, and science and technology.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.850
- [Teacher] Alright, vinegar's done!

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.860
- They have those classes once a week,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.500
and the idea is that in the younger grades

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.180
we're nurturing them and seeing
where their strengths are.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.400
- Being exposed to all
the majors at a young age,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.620
you got to feel out where
you fit in the best.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.720
- [Jason] And then by middle school

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.150
they choose one of those
subjects as a major,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.860
and then get to spend every
single day in that major.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.060
- [Teacher] You see if
you can use those lines

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.900
and incorporate that into your design.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.370
- [Rosemary] We try to really make them

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.480
think about what area they're
truly passionate about.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.650
- I love to write, act, and film,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.550
so I chose TV and
broadcasting specifically.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.130
You learn so many different things,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.330
from script writing to being on camera

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.340
and being behind the camera.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.250
- [Teacher] Alright, ready,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.210
everybody's still rolling.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.880
- So my major is STEM.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.410
I absolutely fell in love with it.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.470
We did forensics.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.700
We're doing DNA barcoding
and sequencing now.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.740
Do five of the sample, right?

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.573
- [Male Student] Yup.

00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:12.930
- When I found out you could pick a major

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.600
since I love to dance, I picked ballet.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.693
The training's pretty rigorous.

00:02:17.693 --> 00:02:19.680
- [Dance Teacher] 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, continue.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.630
- Playing violin every single day

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.680
has really taught me time management.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740
I didn't know how much
work would come along

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.380
with being a professional.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.850
- We talk a lot about the
discipline that comes from

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.470
doing something everyday and
to really do a deep dive.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.290
- It takes determination.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.640
It takes dedication.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.060
All of those types of skills

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.720
are skills that you can also apply

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.390
to the academic classroom.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.070
- I get a lot of people saying,
"You just dance everyday."

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.800
but we are really focused
on getting our education

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.890
and going to dance or
singing, whatever your into.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.173
It's really equal.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.890
- Another overarching design element is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.010
our mobile-first approach
to technology integration.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.690
We know that how students consume
content and create content

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.700
is first and foremost through mobile,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.660
so we gave them all iPads that were both

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.090
1-to-1 and 24/7 with the
idea that that was gonna be

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.970
the primary device for them
to engage with their learning.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.820
- You're learning completely differently.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.760
You're learning off Apple TVs

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.980
as opposed to blackboards.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.840
- All of our courses are on iTunes U,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.360
so I'll go to english, click the course.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.360
I'll go to history, I'm
gonna do the same thing.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.630
So it's just nice having
everything in one screen

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.740
or our teachers are
constantly getting us to

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.660
be creative with our projects
and what apps we use.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.020
- [Teacher] Very nice, so this

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.150
I think is the most important part.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.650
- [Jason] Lastly, we have
artists in residence,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.870
scientists in residence,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.600
and entrepreneurs in residence

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.620
that really are bringing a real world

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.600
perspective to these kids,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.640
all while going about their school day.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.670
- [Teacher] And once
this gets to about 350,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.070
we're gonna start our roast.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.550
- I think just seeing the
professionals in their element

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.130
I think it makes it more cool.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.420
All of a sudden it made it real.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.890
It was like, Oh I can
actually do this with my life?

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.350
- My teacher here, she's
been dancing her entire life.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.810
She pushes us to be the
best that we can be.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.910
She makes us focused.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.380
- [Dance Teacher] 5, 6, 7, 8

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.780
- Some of the biggest
benefits are the creativity

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.590
and the innovation that we all have gained

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.250
from this environment.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.170
If I didn't have an instrumental class,

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.960
or if I didn't have
experience in the Cafe Vine,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.352
I wouldn't have been able to develop

00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:24.890
into myself.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.530
- When kids get a chance to do
something they like everyday

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.008
they become really well developed kids.

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:31.950
So giving kids an opportunity

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.510
to find different ways
to pursue their passion

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.460
is really central to our
approach to learning.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.086
- Actors ready?
Sound, Camera?

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.133
Action.
