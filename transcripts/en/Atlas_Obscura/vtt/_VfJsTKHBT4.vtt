00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.830
- On the top floor of
a library in Manhattan,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.840
there is a secret apartment,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.757
and it's been left empty for years.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.020
I'm Sarah Laskow. I'm a senior
writer at Atlas Obscura,

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.460
and this is the secret apartment

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.127
at the Fort Washington
Library in Manhattan.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.710
Back at the beginning of the 20th century,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.250
Andrew Carnegie gave the
city $5.2 million dollars

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.680
to build libraries all over the city.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.500
They all look a little bit like this one,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.690
with these big, sweeping windows

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.440
that are supposed to keep
the buildings light and cool.

00:00:41.805 --> 00:00:45.230
Downstairs, it looks like
pretty much any library.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.300
Upstairs though, it's a
completely different place.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.570
Someone who works for
the library once told me

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.300
it feels to them like being
in a haunted house, even.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660
Walking up the stairs,
you can sort of feel that.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.370
There's this water stain
coming down one of the walls,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.000
and the stairs are
pretty, but they're dirty.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.780
And there's this like white plaster

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.193
falling from the ceiling.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.730
The first thing you see
when you get up there

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.970
is this big room, and
it would have been used

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.410
as a public space, maybe for lectures,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.440
or meetings, or dances.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.277
But the really cool, surprising
thing here is the apartment.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.890
It's pretty much a dream to
live in a library, right?

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.410
I mean, at least for me.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.860
The first time I came here, it was creepy.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.940
The light switches weren't
working, so it was really dark,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.520
and we had to watch where we stepped,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.990
because they told me the
floors weren't really safe.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.960
But one of the first things I noticed

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.550
was how bright the walls are.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.990
I mean, whoever lived here wanted

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.710
to make it feel welcoming and fun.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.400
It's a pretty big, sweet apartment.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.500
I mean, I think most people
that I know in New York

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.580
would be really happy to live here.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.600
You can just feel what
it would have been like.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.260
In one of the rooms, there's a mirror,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.090
and I can imagine standing there

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.200
and just checking what I
look like before going out.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.830
I did get to meet someone once

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.610
who lived in an apartment like this.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.010
The buildings were
heated by coal back then,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.100
and the custodians had to keep feeding

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.440
the furnaces all day and all night.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.960
Since they had to be
available all the time,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.560
it just made sense for them
to live in the library.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.830
So, these apartments were built for them,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.060
and for their families, too.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.660
Now there are just 13 of these left.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.910
I mean, this is an
enormous amount of space

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.230
to go unused right in the
middle of New York City.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.090
And when the buildings stopped using coal

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.880
and the custodians retired,

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.480
the library would just
shut up the apartments.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.920
But now, they're trying
to repurpose all this room

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.960
by converting the
apartments to public spaces.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.050
If everything goes according to plan,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.100
the library will repurpose
this apartment, too.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.380
And, you know, everyone I
tell that to is disappointed,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.380
because it really would
be awesome to live here.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.790
Thanks so much for watching.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.820
