they mean is what's typical put a metric

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250
they mean is what's typical put a metric
 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.610
they mean is what's typical put a metric
of what's typical and then you look at

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620
of what's typical and then you look at
 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.130
of what's typical and then you look at
your observation maybe it's a drug

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140
your observation maybe it's a drug
 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.870

effect or maybe it's whether you've just
 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.140
effect or maybe it's whether you've just
made an unusual your your probability of

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150
made an unusual your your probability of
 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.270
made an unusual your your probability of
making a shot is unusually high compared

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280
making a shot is unusually high compared
 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.909
making a shot is unusually high compared
to a notion of typical and then you say

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919
to a notion of typical and then you say
 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:17.290
to a notion of typical and then you say
well there's there an effect or not in

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300
well there's there an effect or not in
 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.030
well there's there an effect or not in
effect that's how hypothesis testing

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040
effect that's how hypothesis testing

works and so there's a lot of art and

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020
works and so there's a lot of art and
 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.380
works and so there's a lot of art and
science and deciding what ordinary means

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390

in a row you think well maybe a trend

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990
in a row you think well maybe a trend

in a row you think well maybe a trend
that's a small sample error right maybe

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240
that's a small sample error right maybe
 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.610
that's a small sample error right maybe
the fourth one's going to be going in a

the fourth one's going to be going in a
 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.080
the fourth one's going to be going in a
different direction but we are very

one knew it better than Amos Tversky and

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910
one knew it better than Amos Tversky and
 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.409
one knew it better than Amos Tversky and
yet he had a small sample of data and he

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419
yet he had a small sample of data and he
 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.330
yet he had a small sample of data and he
treated that small sample along with his

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340
treated that small sample along with his
 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.980

an infinite set maybe the best way to

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940
an infinite set maybe the best way to
 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.600
an infinite set maybe the best way to
start is with coin flipping okay so this

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610
start is with coin flipping okay so this
 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.330
start is with coin flipping okay so this
is like a toy example of the sort of

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340
is like a toy example of the sort of
 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.950
is like a toy example of the sort of
thing they were doing coin flips could

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960
thing they were doing coin flips could
 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.779
thing they were doing coin flips could
be like hitting or missing shots heads

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:34.789
be like hitting or missing shots heads
 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.140
be like hitting or missing shots heads
tails hits and misses maybe so here's

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150
tails hits and misses maybe so here's
 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.980
tails hits and misses maybe so here's
the kind of thing

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990
the kind of thing
 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.300
the kind of thing
we're thinking about because after all

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310
we're thinking about because after all
 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.850
we're thinking about because after all
we're looking at the probability of

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860
we're looking at the probability of
 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.219
we're looking at the probability of
making a shot given that you've just

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229
making a shot given that you've just
 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.230
making a shot given that you've just
made some shots or making a shot after

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240
made some shots or making a shot after
 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.420
made some shots or making a shot after
you've just missed some shots so we want

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430
you've just missed some shots so we want
 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.249
you've just missed some shots so we want
to look at what's happening after

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:51.259
to look at what's happening after
 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.559
to look at what's happening after
something else happens so we could play

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569
something else happens so we could play
 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.559
something else happens so we could play
a game with a coin and we're gonna think

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569
a game with a coin and we're gonna think
 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.409
a game with a coin and we're gonna think
that we have a completely unbiased coin

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419
that we have a completely unbiased coin
 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.559
that we have a completely unbiased coin
50% heads 50% tails and we're going to

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:02.569
50% heads 50% tails and we're going to
 

00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:04.420
50% heads 50% tails and we're going to
think that my flips of the coin are

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430
think that my flips of the coin are
 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.730
think that my flips of the coin are
independent so what happens on the next

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740
independent so what happens on the next
 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.650
independent so what happens on the next
flip has nothing to do with what

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660
flip has nothing to do with what
 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.969
flip has nothing to do with what
happened on the previous flip or

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:09.979
happened on the previous flip or
 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:11.469
happened on the previous flip or
anything else in history we're going to

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479
anything else in history we're going to
 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:14.290
anything else in history we're going to
flip the coin three times and we're

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300
flip the coin three times and we're
 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.029
flip the coin three times and we're
thinking we're looking for what happens

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039
thinking we're looking for what happens
 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.490
thinking we're looking for what happens
after something so here's the game I

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500
after something so here's the game I
 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.070
after something so here's the game I
flip the coin and then we're going to

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080
flip the coin and then we're going to
 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.159
flip the coin and then we're going to
write down what happens after I flip

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169
write down what happens after I flip
 

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.339
write down what happens after I flip
ahead so if I flip tails we don't think

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:27.349
ahead so if I flip tails we don't think
 

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:28.839
ahead so if I flip tails we don't think
about anything then I flip the heads

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849
about anything then I flip the heads
 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:30.969
about anything then I flip the heads
we'd become alert then flip something

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:30.979
we'd become alert then flip something
 

00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:32.770
we'd become alert then flip something
else we write down an H if it's a heads

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:32.780
else we write down an H if it's a heads
 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.149
else we write down an H if it's a heads
or a T if it's not a head so we're gonna

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:34.159
or a T if it's not a head so we're gonna
 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.100
or a T if it's not a head so we're gonna
do this three times and so the question

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110
do this three times and so the question
 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.559
do this three times and so the question
is what do we think before we do the

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:38.569
is what do we think before we do the
 

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:41.080
is what do we think before we do the
experiment is get them given this is an

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090
experiment is get them given this is an
 

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.670
experiment is get them given this is an
unbiased 50/50 coin and my flips are

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680
unbiased 50/50 coin and my flips are
 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.189
unbiased 50/50 coin and my flips are
completely independent you can ask what

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:48.199
completely independent you can ask what
 

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:49.779
completely independent you can ask what
do you expect to see on the piece of

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:49.789
do you expect to see on the piece of
 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.029
do you expect to see on the piece of
paper like half heads and half tails why

00:07:52.029 --> 00:07:52.039
paper like half heads and half tails why
 

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.129
paper like half heads and half tails why
not because being cued by a head

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:54.139
not because being cued by a head
 

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:58.270
not because being cued by a head
shouldn't have any effect on the next on

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:58.280
shouldn't have any effect on the next on
 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.800
shouldn't have any effect on the next on
the next flip but in fact it did I can

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:02.810
the next flip but in fact it did I can
 

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.959
the next flip but in fact it did I can
write down all the outcomes there's only

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:04.969
write down all the outcomes there's only
 

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:06.820
write down all the outcomes there's only
eight of them so I think I got all eight

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:06.830
eight of them so I think I got all eight
 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.129
eight of them so I think I got all eight
of them and let's look at what we would

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:09.139
of them and let's look at what we would
 

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:10.240
of them and let's look at what we would
have written down if we were keeping

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:10.250
have written down if we were keeping
 

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.659
have written down if we were keeping
track of what happened after heads so

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:13.669
track of what happened after heads so
 

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:17.830
track of what happened after heads so
TTT is a non-starter tth is also a

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840
TTT is a non-starter tth is also a
 

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.839
TTT is a non-starter tth is also a
non-starter because even though you

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:19.849
non-starter because even though you
 

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:21.580
non-starter because even though you
Scott a heads here we don't know what

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:21.590
Scott a heads here we don't know what
 

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.899
Scott a heads here we don't know what
happened afterwards because we were only

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:22.909
happened afterwards because we were only
 

00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:26.740
happened afterwards because we were only
looking at streaks of length total

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:26.750
looking at streaks of length total
 

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.140
looking at streaks of length total
length three okay so tth we don't write

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.150
length three okay so tth we don't write
 

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.820
length three okay so tth we don't write
anything down so you could already see

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:30.830
anything down so you could already see
 

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.350
anything down so you could already see
something funny's going wrong because

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360
something funny's going wrong because
 

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.069
something funny's going wrong because
out of my eight cases two of them have

00:08:36.069 --> 00:08:36.079
out of my eight cases two of them have
 

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:38.560
out of my eight cases two of them have
already been problematic the next guy is

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:38.570
already been problematic the next guy is
 

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.620
already been problematic the next guy is
not problematic because here's an H

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:41.630
not problematic because here's an H
 

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.659
not problematic because here's an H
right in the middle so you flip the T

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:43.669
right in the middle so you flip the T
 

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.030
right in the middle so you flip the T
you don't get do anything

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040
you don't get do anything
 

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.829
you don't get do anything
flip the H it's right in the middle your

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839
flip the H it's right in the middle your
 

00:08:47.839 --> 00:08:50.480
flip the H it's right in the middle your
alert then you get a T so you write down

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.490
alert then you get a T so you write down
 

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.139
alert then you get a T so you write down
Attie in this next string h.t.t.h starts

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:54.149
Attie in this next string h.t.t.h starts
 

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:56.150
Attie in this next string h.t.t.h starts
off right away gets your attention you

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160
off right away gets your attention you
 

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.400
off right away gets your attention you
write down a T here in this string you

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.410
write down a T here in this string you
 

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.840
write down a T here in this string you
start with the T don't write anything

00:08:59.840 --> 00:08:59.850
start with the T don't write anything
 

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.240
start with the T don't write anything
then we see an H we become alert we get

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.250
then we see an H we become alert we get
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.639
then we see an H we become alert we get
an H we write it down okay and then

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:04.649
an H we write it down okay and then
 

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:06.199
an H we write it down okay and then
we're finished this age would have

00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:06.209
we're finished this age would have
 

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:08.360
we're finished this age would have
queued us if we were doing strings of

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.370
queued us if we were doing strings of
 

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.930
queued us if we were doing strings of
length four but we aren't here H th so

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940
length four but we aren't here H th so
 

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.769
length four but we aren't here H th so
the first H tells us to write down the T

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:14.779
the first H tells us to write down the T
 

00:09:14.779 --> 00:09:17.420
the first H tells us to write down the T
the second T tells us to do nothing then

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:17.430
the second T tells us to do nothing then
 

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.800
the second T tells us to do nothing then
we end with an H which is kind of

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:18.810
we end with an H which is kind of
 

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.850
we end with an H which is kind of
dangling here HH T so the first age

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860
dangling here HH T so the first age
 

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.430
dangling here HH T so the first age
tells us to write down what happens

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440
tells us to write down what happens
 

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.310
tells us to write down what happens
after which is an H second H tells us to

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320
after which is an H second H tells us to
 

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.079
after which is an H second H tells us to
write down what happens which is a T we

00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:30.089
write down what happens which is a T we
 

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:31.880
write down what happens which is a T we
don't do anything when we see a T and

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:31.890
don't do anything when we see a T and
 

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.329
don't do anything when we see a T and
here finally we have HHH so the first

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339
here finally we have HHH so the first
 

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:37.460
here finally we have HHH so the first
two H's each tell us to write an H and

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:37.470
two H's each tell us to write an H and
 

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.230
two H's each tell us to write an H and
we don't get to do anything after the

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240
we don't get to do anything after the
 

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.329
we don't get to do anything after the
third in the first two cases we write

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339
third in the first two cases we write
 

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:44.389
third in the first two cases we write
nothing in the rest six cases we write

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399
nothing in the rest six cases we write
 

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:47.090
nothing in the rest six cases we write
something so let's see what fraction had

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100
something so let's see what fraction had
 

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.120
something so let's see what fraction had
heads so in the first one the fraction

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.130
heads so in the first one the fraction
 

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.040
heads so in the first one the fraction
is zero and in the second one the

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.050
is zero and in the second one the
 

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.199
is zero and in the second one the
fraction is zero and the third one the

00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:54.209
fraction is zero and the third one the
 

00:09:54.209 --> 00:09:57.260
fraction is zero and the third one the
fraction is one again we have a zero

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.270
fraction is one again we have a zero
 

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.260
fraction is one again we have a zero
here we have a heads and a tails half

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.270
here we have a heads and a tails half
 

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.449
here we have a heads and a tails half
the time we saw heads half the time we

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459
the time we saw heads half the time we
 

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:05.750
the time we saw heads half the time we
saw tails that's 0.5 and here a hundred

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760
saw tails that's 0.5 and here a hundred
 

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.579
saw tails that's 0.5 and here a hundred
percent of the time we saw a heads again

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:07.589
percent of the time we saw a heads again
 

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:09.620
percent of the time we saw a heads again
so we have a one so we take these

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:09.630
so we have a one so we take these
 

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.540
so we have a one so we take these
numbers their average represents

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.550
numbers their average represents
 

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.810
numbers their average represents
expectation so I add them up I get 1

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820
expectation so I add them up I get 1
 

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.250
expectation so I add them up I get 1
plus 1/2 plus 2 that's 2.5 the average

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260
plus 1/2 plus 2 that's 2.5 the average
 

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.940
plus 1/2 plus 2 that's 2.5 the average
is equal to 2.5 over 6 which is

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:22.950
is equal to 2.5 over 6 which is
 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.430
is equal to 2.5 over 6 which is
definitely less than 1/2 6 is the number

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440
definitely less than 1/2 6 is the number
 

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.639
definitely less than 1/2 6 is the number
of examples that I'm averaging over so

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:28.649
of examples that I'm averaging over so
 

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:30.410
of examples that I'm averaging over so
don't forget we're asked what do you see

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420
don't forget we're asked what do you see
 

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.510
don't forget we're asked what do you see
what happens given that you have a head

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:32.520
what happens given that you have a head
 

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.840
what happens given that you have a head
and so here we never first 1 we never

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:35.850
and so here we never first 1 we never
 

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.280
and so here we never first 1 we never
had a head at all in the second one we

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:37.290
had a head at all in the second one we
 

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.750
had a head at all in the second one we
had a head at the end but we don't know

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:38.760
had a head at the end but we don't know
 

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.100
had a head at the end but we don't know
what happened given that we had that

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:40.110
what happened given that we had that
 

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.389
what happened given that we had that
head so those things are out of the

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399
head so those things are out of the
 

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:43.370
head so those things are out of the
sample this is exactly how you would

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380
sample this is exactly how you would
 

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.010
sample this is exactly how you would
have treated a sample with heads being

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:46.020
have treated a sample with heads being
 

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.350
have treated a sample with heads being
make a shot and tails being miss a shot

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360
make a shot and tails being miss a shot
 

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.449
make a shot and tails being miss a shot
if you were doing this for basketball

strings so if we were happening to look

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160
strings so if we were happening to look
 

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.910
strings so if we were happening to look
at only three shots bringing this back

at only three shots bringing this back
 

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.160
at only three shots bringing this back
to basketball we would have seen that

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.170
to basketball we would have seen that
 

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.840
to basketball we would have seen that
there was a bias downward from the 1/2

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:01.850
there was a bias downward from the 1/2
 

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.400
there was a bias downward from the 1/2
that we would have expected to see again

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:04.410
that we would have expected to see again
 

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.280
that we would have expected to see again
the fact that the coin is 50/50 and that

strings that average would have tended
 

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.650
strings that average would have tended
toward 1/2 and if we looked at very long

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:18.660
toward 1/2 and if we looked at very long
 

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.600

strings even not all the way infinite it
 

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.369
strings even not all the way infinite it
might have been so close to 1/2 that

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:22.379
might have been so close to 1/2 that
 

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:24.470
might have been so close to 1/2 that
this difference didn't matter but in

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480
this difference didn't matter but in
 

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.499
this difference didn't matter but in
fact what we're seeing is that in data

00:11:27.499 --> 00:11:27.509
fact what we're seeing is that in data
 

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:30.619
fact what we're seeing is that in data
in this finite data set the reversals

00:11:30.619 --> 00:11:30.629
in this finite data set the reversals
 

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:33.860
in this finite data set the reversals
were more likely than the continuation

were more likely than the continuation
 

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.790
were more likely than the continuation
and that is a finite data a small sample

season and playoff game by game and we

00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339
season and playoff game by game and we
 

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:30.829
season and playoff game by game and we
looked their strings of hits and misses

00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839
looked their strings of hits and misses
 

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:33.829
looked their strings of hits and misses
and we asked the question in each game

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839
and we asked the question in each game
 

00:12:33.839 --> 00:12:36.350
and we asked the question in each game
were they having a hot hand or not were

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360
were they having a hot hand or not were
 

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.050
were they having a hot hand or not were
they more likely to make a shot after a

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:39.060
they more likely to make a shot after a
 

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.910
they more likely to make a shot after a
string of shots than they were after a

string of shots than they were after a
 

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.379
string of shots than they were after a
string of misses that's the question

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:42.389
string of misses that's the question
 

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:44.030
string of misses that's the question
that we asked following the original

researchers we have to set up a concept

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:46.259
researchers we have to set up a concept
 

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:49.280
researchers we have to set up a concept
of ordinary no effect and then look at

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:49.290
of ordinary no effect and then look at
 

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.069
of ordinary no effect and then look at
the observed string and see if it's

00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079
the observed string and see if it's
 

00:12:52.079 --> 00:12:54.350
the observed string and see if it's
different from ordinary in an important

different from ordinary in an important
 

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.350
different from ordinary in an important
way so Steph Curry gets 10 shots in a

way so Steph Curry gets 10 shots in a
 

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.269
way so Steph Curry gets 10 shots in a
row there's a chance that was just luck

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:03.170
he just you know if he was a 50/50
player he'd get 10 shots in a row so

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180
player he'd get 10 shots in a row so
 

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.030
player he'd get 10 shots in a row so
sometimes Wright could be like

that luck or skill it's exactly the same
sort of question it's great to see that

00:13:10.309 --> 00:13:10.319
sort of question it's great to see that
 

00:13:10.319 --> 00:13:12.199

that we did we looked at two warriors so

00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:25.559
that we did we looked at two warriors so
 

00:13:25.559 --> 00:13:28.100
that we did we looked at two warriors so
the Warriors were the champions NBA

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.110
the Warriors were the champions NBA

Klay is Thompson's probably the
 

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.309
Klay is Thompson's probably the
streakiest of the shove the shooters and

streakiest of the shove the shooters and
 

00:13:43.319 --> 00:13:45.679
streakiest of the shove the shooters and
then we also looked at Kevin Durant who

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:45.689
then we also looked at Kevin Durant who
 

00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:48.410

is just we did this per game and then

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:05.790
is just we did this per game and then
 

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.259
is just we did this per game and then
what we did was we looked to see in that

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:09.269
what we did was we looked to see in that
 

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:12.319
what we did was we looked to see in that
string what was the probability of a hip

two misses but to see if there was any
 

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:19.069
two misses but to see if there was any
difference in that string and then we

00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079
difference in that string and then we
 

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.109
difference in that string and then we
took that string and we scrambled it did

00:14:21.109 --> 00:14:21.119
took that string and we scrambled it did
 

00:14:21.119 --> 00:14:23.389
took that string and we scrambled it did
a random permutation and made the same

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399
a random permutation and made the same
 

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:25.220
a random permutation and made the same
calculation think about it

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:25.230
calculation think about it
 

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.249
calculation think about it
scrambling that thing ruins the order

00:14:28.249 --> 00:14:28.259
scrambling that thing ruins the order
 

00:14:28.259 --> 00:14:31.069
scrambling that thing ruins the order
oh and no no streaks I mean whatever

randomness and we looked at all those

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480
randomness and we looked at all those
 

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.780
