00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.126
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
before, like we

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:28.495
were talking about Trump not
winning the popular vote.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.097
So how do you feel about
our system of voting

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.734
in the United States versus
a preferential voting system?

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.637
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well,
it's a kind of a--

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:42.375
it's a fact known among
political scientists,

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:46.479
but not the population that the
American political system is

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.015
so regressive that
it would not be

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.785
accepted by the European
Court of Justice.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:52.719
Literally.

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:57.657
Some of the East
European states that

00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.926
have come into
the European Union

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:03.797
have proposed voting systems
like the American one

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:08.401
and they're rejected because
they're so undemocratic.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.703
This goes back to the--

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:13.073
If you take a look at a--

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.942
we don't have any political
parties in the United States.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.145
Remember, they do in Europe.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.683
You can't be a member
of the Democratic Party.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.886
What you can do is go
into the voting booth

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.021
and put an x somewhere.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:32.826
That's your role as a citizen.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:37.797
Elite party managers
set up the programs,

00:01:37.896 --> 00:01:39.199
pretty much pick the can--

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.234
they vet the candidates.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.971
Only certain ones get through.

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:50.310
You look at a ballot, it says,
Republican, Democrat, nothing

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.845
else.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.680
Those are your choices.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.850
So these are
candidate-producing machines.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.687
The role of the citizen is to
show up every couple of years

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.523
and put in an x,
and then go home.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:05.458
That's not democratic politics.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.497
But that's a deeply
ingrained system.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.733
It comes out of the way the
party system developed here

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.169
in the 19th century
post-Civil war, mainly.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.175
I mean, these are
really serious issues.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.944
It makes it almost impossible
for an independent party

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:27.579
to participate.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.683
And those things are
not graven in stone.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.085
They can all be changed.

00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.623
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Talking
about black matters,

00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:39.091
there's been claims that
this system of voting

00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:43.062
reflects earlier concerns
about blacks in America.

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:44.329
NOAM CHOMSKY: It does.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.166
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So can you
say something about that?

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.133
NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.402
Well, you go back to the--

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.704
slavery lasted
until the Civil War.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.375
And incidentally, it was
the most vicious system

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.442
of slavery in world history.

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.212
There was never
anything like it.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:03.383
Slavery is bad enough, but the
American system was unique.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:08.121
Also, it's worth remembering
that the slave system is

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:10.890
the basis of our prosperity.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.596
The main commodity in the
early 19th century was cotton.

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:21.301
Cotton was the fuel of the 19th
century Industrial Revolution.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.837
Cheap cotton led to the
manufacturing industries

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.739
in New England.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:30.109
The early manufacturing,
big manufacturing industries

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.312
in Lowell and Lawrence
were textiles.

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:36.783
It led to the development
of the financial system.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.952
Credit, loans, and
so on, was mostly

00:03:39.052 --> 00:03:41.221
for the cotton-based system.

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.522
Same in England.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.324
That's why Liverpool
was one of the richest

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:47.227
countries in the world.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:49.662
It's where the slave
cotton came in.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.699
So cotton, if you look at
it, was the real basis right

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.202
through the 19th century for
commercial and industrial

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.570
development.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.640
And it was based on extremely
cheap and highly-productive

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.908
labor.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:06.312
The productivity of labor
was improved by technology,

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.715
but the technology
was very simple.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.783
It was the whip and the pistol.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.620
That's all you needed
to improve technology.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.024
The whole story is unbelievably
hideous when you look at it.

00:04:18.124 --> 00:04:23.830
OK, theoretically it ended with
the emancipation declaration.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.099
But that was only theoretical.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.003
There was a 10-year
period, the Reconstruction,

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:33.373
in which federal troops were
in the South, union troops.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:39.112
And that's one of the decades
in which African Americans had

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:41.781
a small chance to
get into the system.

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:42.448
And they did.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:43.650
They were elected.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.987
There were people running
towns and legislatures.

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:51.224
There was a bit of economic
development and so on.

00:04:51.324 --> 00:04:56.095
It ended in 1877 with
a North-South compact

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:00.700
that essentially left the South
free to do whatever it wanted.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.870
So what they did was
re-institute slavery.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.071
Literally.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.607
In fact, the main book
on this is called Slavery

00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:13.246
by Another Name by a Wall
Street Journal bureau chief

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:15.081
who studied it in some depth.

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.485
Scholarship [inaudible] wrote
a good, popular book about it.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:24.090
What happened was black
life was criminalized.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.827
So if a black man is
standing on a street corner,

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:31.297
he can be charged with
vagrancy and given

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:32.732
a fine which he can't pay.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.001
So he's in jail forever.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.004
If a black men look,
somebody says somebody

00:05:38.104 --> 00:05:39.072
looked at a white woman.

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:42.108
OK, he's charged
with attempted rape

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:43.843
and he's in jail for
the rest of his life.

00:05:43.943 --> 00:05:46.145
And pretty soon, most of
the black male population

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.714
was in jail.

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:50.850
That's a wonderful
slave labor force.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.618
From the point of view
of the capitalist,

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.521
it's much better than
slavery because you don't

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:58.524
have to sustain your workforce.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:01.661
If you have slaves, you
have to keep them alive.

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.431
If it's a prison population,
the taxpayer keeps them alive.

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.567
You just get the profit.

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.802
And a large part
of the second wave

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.071
of industrialization
in the United States

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.740
was based on that.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.179
Mining, steel, so on, used
essentially incarcerated slave

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.280
labor.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:24.317
I mean, we were familiar
with the chain gangs

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:25.685
because you see them.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.854
We don't see them,
but you did see them.

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:29.722
The agricultural workers.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:32.291
But it was happening
all over the economy.

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:36.362
Well, that lasted almost
until the Second World War.

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:38.898
And now we have
another version of it.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.937
The massive incarceration
since the Reagan years

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.907
is kind of reconstituting
that in many ways.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.942
Well, all of this has
to do with voting.

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.744
These people don't vote.

00:06:51.844 --> 00:06:55.281
What's more, we have
very harsh voting laws.

00:06:55.381 --> 00:06:58.418
People convicted of what's
called a felony, which

00:06:58.518 --> 00:07:02.989
could be being caught with
pot three times or something,

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.090
they don't vote anymore.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.726
They're out of the system.

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.628
This is a big part of it.

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.931
Also, their families are
destroyed, so they don't vote.

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:12.665
They live in--

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:20.273
I once took a walk through--

00:07:20.373 --> 00:07:24.043
with a sociologist friend
who studies these things

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:26.145
through an area of
the Bronx, which

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:29.115
I happen to know from childhood
because a lot of my family

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:30.450
lives there.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.453
There used to be immigrant
communities, poor communities.

00:07:33.553 --> 00:07:35.855
But now, they've
been gentrified.

00:07:35.955 --> 00:07:37.256
High rises, and so on.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:43.029
And I asked this woman,
sociologist from Columbia,

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.298
what happened to the people?

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:50.503
She said, well, the men are
in jail in upstate New York.

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:53.339
The women and children
sort of followed them,

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.508
so they can visit
them on Sunday.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.877
So they're in upstate New York.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.447
And now, the rich
people live here.

00:08:01.547 --> 00:08:02.381
Things like that.

00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:05.551
That is happening
in South Boston.

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:07.820
We've seen it in my lifetime.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.622
It's happening all
over the country.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.624
These are things that
are going on constantly

00:08:11.724 --> 00:08:13.426
right in front of our eyes.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:14.727
And voting?

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.396
Sure, it's knocking a large
part of the population out

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.366
of the voting list.

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:24.170
By now, I'm sure you know
the Republicans particularly

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.707
are dedicated to trying
to reduce the vote.

00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:31.077
Because the more people vote,
the more trouble they're in.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:34.713
So you have all
these ludicrous--

00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:38.484
Jeff Sessions, the
Department of Justice,

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.686
head of Department
of Justice, is now

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:45.157
in charge of trying to figure
out ways to, what they call,

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.592
prevent voter fraud.

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:48.794
There's virtually
no voter fraud.

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:52.331
It's so minuscule, it's
physically undetectable.

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:57.303
But on that claim to try to
readjust the voting so that you

00:08:57.403 --> 00:09:02.975
can keep the poor
and black people out.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.512
The French election, if
you noticed, was on Sunday.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:07.947
There's a good reason for that.

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.048
Sunday.

00:09:09.148 --> 00:09:10.950
people are free, so
they can go and vote.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.854
Here, it's on a workday,
making it hard to vote.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:15.855
Except for the rich.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.557
They can do it easily.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.259
If you're an executive,
leave your office.

00:09:20.359 --> 00:09:23.462
Or a college professor,
you can take off.

00:09:23.563 --> 00:09:27.199
But for a lot of people, you
just can't vote on a workday.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.201
And there are all sorts
of other rules now.

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:33.839
You have to have a
driver's license, photo ID.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.341
And a lot of people
don't have that.

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:35.875
OK.

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:38.911
Poor people.

00:09:39.011 --> 00:09:43.049
Along with the gerrymandering,
which is by now a bad joke.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.853
Many devices are
being used to try

00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:51.524
to prevent the limited
democratic system

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.292
from functioning.

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:55.027
But again, all of
this can be changed.

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:01.100
Bigger gains have
been won in the past.

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:09.709
Forget blacks.

00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:11.177
Think about women.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:15.381
I mean, if you go back to the
early days of the republic,

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:18.517
women were not
considered people.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:22.655
Literally, they were property.

00:10:22.755 --> 00:10:26.425
In our constitutional
system, the early days,

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:30.296
a woman is the property of her
father, which is transferred

00:10:30.396 --> 00:10:31.931
over to her husband.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.165
Then she's his property.

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.935
In fact, if you take a
look at the early debates

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:39.538
about whether women
should be allowed to vote,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.440
one of the arguments
against it was

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.810
that it would be
unfair to unmarried men

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.314
because a married man would
have two votes, his own boat

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:50.349
and the property's vote.

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:55.955
And this lasted for a long
time until pretty recently.

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:59.558
It wasn't until 1975--

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.293
not that far back--

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:06.365
that women had a right to
serve on federal juries meaning

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:08.868
being treated as peers.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:11.003
That's half the population.

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.072
It's not African Americans.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:15.975
It's been a long
way to go to achieve

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:18.911
some kind of real right.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.580
And a lot has been achieved.

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.481
Lot of victories.

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:23.849
It's a sign of where you can go.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:27.019
A lot of things we
take for granted

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:29.588
just didn't exist years back.

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.457
Take this class.

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:37.863
When I came to MIT in 1955,
it was white males, period.

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:43.402
Well-dressed, ties and jackets,
deferential, do your homework.

00:11:43.502 --> 00:11:45.204
That was MIT.

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:46.739
It's not what it is now.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:48.040
And it didn't happen that way--

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.075
change by magic.
