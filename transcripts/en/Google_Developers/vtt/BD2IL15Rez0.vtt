IBRAHIM ULUKAYA: Hi everyone,
I'm Ibrahim Ulukaya from

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.100
YouTube API Developers Relations
team joining you

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.320
today from New York studios.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.970
And today, we'll talk
about getting help

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.430
with YouTube APIs.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.180
Either you're just a new
developer starting to develop

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.170
with YouTube APIs, or you
are already building the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.310
applications and you just want
to create a new functionality

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.960
and you're having
some problems.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.140
You may need some help.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.200
And we'll definitely help you.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.240
We're just trying to
present the best

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.730
ways to get that help.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.570
So I will go over the four
different ways to get help.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.450
I'll start with a demo.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.360
I'll start with YouTube
developer documentation.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.130
I'll talk about today the
developer documentation first,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.930
and our API blog second, Stack
Overflow third, and the last

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110
one using the issue tracker.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.300
Let's get started.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.340
Let's talk about the developer
documentation.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.520
So developer documentation is
the site map on the left side.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.345
And let's say that you're having
a problem with version

00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:21.010
three, and you're trying to
find the functionality.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.640
In getting started, you'll see
some help with adjusting your

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.670
application, implementing
the OAuth2 [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.515
methods, or getting the client
libraries to start developing.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.570
In Guides, you will see how to
upload a video of it, the code

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.040
samples, or doing it [INAUDIBLE]
upload, as well as

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.700
there will be some technical
documentations like the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.850
difference between the channel
IDs versus user names and the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.140
Google+ IDs.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.515
Or you can be having some
problems, and you want to

00:02:02.515 --> 00:02:07.730
actually migrate from client
login to OAuth2 some technical

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.270
documentation here as well.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.400
Also, you have a detailed
documentation on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.000
the reference site.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.510
You'll see all the resources
here like video, channels,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.900
playlists, search, thumbnails.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.700
And let's think that
you actually

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.560
want to list the channels.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.970
You want to actually get some
information about a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.260
channel of a user.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.430
And you actually want to use
the list method call.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.120
Here, you will see all the
required parameters, the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.230
request itself, the filters,
some optional parameters.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.490
And you'll see it shows the
response here, how the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.700
response will look like.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.620
You'll see the response will
be a channel resource.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.810
You'll see all the error codes
and why they could be

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.760
happening, as well as at the
end, you will see an API

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.090
explorer, which you can actually
just plug in your

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.910
parameters and try the actual
code, the actual

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.160
functionality.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.780
As I mentioned earlier,
it will return

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.815
that channel resource.

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:15.010
And in the channel resource in
the response, you can actually

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.390
see what you can get back.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.370
You can get the likes, the
uploads, playlists, or you can

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.965
get some statistics--

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.970
and a lot of information will
be available here--

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.180
and the formats of the responses
and the other

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.410
parameters, as well as the
attributes depending on that,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.410
attached on that.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.750
So developer documentation is
really helpful for this.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.630
You can even search developer
documentation with additional

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.490
problems like channels.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.680
You can actually go to
documentation from there.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.400
Or you can just use the site map
on the left side, the left

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.650
navigation.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.050
The second resource
is the API blog.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.240
In API Blog, we usually blog
about the new things about use

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.770
of API, what's changing, what
is new, and all the other--

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.590
could be even a change on the
developer documentation or

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.470
something else.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.829
And they are really helpful.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.459
You will get the most
updated information.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.110
So I really suggest you to
subscribe to RSS feeds and get

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.490
the updated documentation
right away.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.680
And here, you'll see the
latest documentation in

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.930
apiblog.youtube.com.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.490
You will see all the latest
challenges or the differences,

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.960
the latest updates
on YouTube APIs.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.330
You can do a search.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.530
So today, actually, I want
to talk about [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.300
featured requests or get more
help, like one to one help

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.510
from the YouTube APIs.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.630
And from there, we'll
actually use Stack

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.450
Overflow of an issue tracker.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.500
So I will actually search for
a Stack Overflow blog.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.180
And September 14, 2012, we
actually issued a blog about

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.940
that talking about that
we are not using

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.310
Google Groups anymore.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.790
But instead, we are using the
Stack Overflow for the coding

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.900
questions as the issue tracker
for files, bugs, and featured

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.930
reports, featured requests.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.420
So Stack Overflow is a really
nice community to ask the

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.850
questions and get answers
from peer to peer.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.950
In that case, you can
actually just--

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.480
all you need to use,
the YouTube-API.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.080
So we can track off all the
questions about YouTube API.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.260
And we can get the answers
right away.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.780
So far, we are actually trying
our best to get all the

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.820
questions answered over there.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.950
You will get your questions
answered really fast.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.340
Even before asking a new
question, you can just search

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.730
for another question.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.960
Or you are trying to get the
thumbnail links, maybe.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.160
You actually use YouTube
API tag and ask for the

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.240
thumbnails.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.130
Here, you will have already an
answer about the thumbnails.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.690
And you just go and just use
the answer over there.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.570
Or if your question is not
over there, you can just

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.820
create a new question.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.220
If you're not going to use the
search engine, or you are

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.530
just-- even for faster response,
you can actually

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.130
just use a Google search engine
and just try to find

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.750
your question.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.930
I use always these kinds
of questions.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.500
I use YouTube API tag.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.750
It's a YouTube API question.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.390
And then I say, how
to set thumbnails.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.430
Maybe my question is
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.050
PHP.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.100
I'm maybe looking for a PHP
answer, PHP coding answer.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.340
And here, I can actually see
that the thumbnail set

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.130
operation, the method is
already here from the

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.200
developer documentation.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.140
All ready, people ask
about the similar

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.650
questions of Stack Overflow.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.070
As far as I can see here, I
can just click the Stack

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.865
Overflow questioning here.

00:07:15.865 --> 00:07:17.450
And it will actually
take me to the

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.200
Stack Overflow question.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.100
Or someone already asked about
how to set the custom

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.330
thumbnails for videos.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.960
And there's a response
already here.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.520
And they agreed on that.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.620
So I can use the
same response.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.940
Or if there's not enough, I
can actually create more

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.650
comments at the end
or ask another

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.930
question from Stack Overflow.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.160
But I will need to mention
that Stack Overflow is a

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.890
community to ask coding
questions.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:50.420
So if your problem is more
about YouTube's own thing

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.110
about how the videos are
handled, how the search is

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:58.090
handed, or something, not about
API or not coding, then

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.030
Stack Overflow is not a good
platform for that one.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.230
And if you have--

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.190
maybe you're already trying
something, and you found the

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:11.680
bug, or maybe the server's not
responding for your method,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.030
and you want actually
[INAUDIBLE], so rather than

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.620
creating a question in Stack
Overflow, we highly recommend

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.610
you to use the issue tracker.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:26.290
It's under
code.google.com/p/g.issues

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.710
[INAUDIBLE] issues.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.940
It's the open public issue
tracker that you can actually

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.690
find your other issues
over there.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.110
Or you can create a new issue
or a featured request.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.190
To find the YouTube issues,
you can actually use

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.980
api:youtube.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.270
And it will actually go through
and find all the

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:52.340
YouTube API problems,
YouTube API issues.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.930
Maybe you're adding some issue
with the [INAUDIBLE], and you

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.710
see it's already filed here,
so we don't need to create

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.680
another issue.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.900
Rather than that, you'd actually
rather just go and

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.180
star this issue.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.350
You can star this issue, or
you can create your own

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.650
problem maybe under
the same topic.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.870
So you will actually be notified
when this issue is

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.940
fixed, or someone else had a
similar problem or found a

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.600
different solution.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.220
Rather than creating a new one,
that's really helpful.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.610
And it's also helpful for us,
because we can actually track

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.080
how many people are
having this issue.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.790
And if the issue's really
critical or the issue's really

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.400
valid that so many people
already filed this issue, or

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.890
this featured request is
really on high demand--

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.470
so they can prioritize things
way easier if you rather than

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.040
creating a [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.120
issues just going to
[INAUDIBLE], write your own

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.630
stuff or star this issue.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.910
So we highly suggest people to
use for their featured request

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.150
or bug filing to use the
g.issue tracker.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.260
And in the blog itself,
you'll see the only

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.850
the templates here--

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.770
either Stack Overflow templates
that will create a

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:17.770
Stack Overflow question or that
will create a template

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:22.370
for you, a YouTube [INAUDIBLE]
report which will show you

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:28.180
which API was affected off
that, or the steps to

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.670
reproduce the issue.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.620
So you can say that, oh, I used
this API method call.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.240
My code was like this.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.570
And it returned to
me like this.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.250
Or when you did these
parameters, the

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.470
response was like that.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.290
So you can easily produce
the issue and it can

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.010
help you way faster.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:49.260
Or you may just want to actually
create a featured

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.240
request using another
template here--

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.530
filing your featured request.

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.510
And you will see that you
create a request and the

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.090
reason for this feature,
how it can help you,

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.230
and things like that.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.750
You can even list the existing
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.360
We always ask you to check the
list of existing [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.660
before filing a duplicate
request.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.390
So you just create this one.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.280
You actually click the
list of open APIs.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.150
As you see, it will
actually check the

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.950
label dash API YouTube.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:29.300
Or you can just do the
api:youtube as well.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.420
So today, we actually went over
the four different ways

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.430
of getting help.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.880
The first one was going to
developer.google.com/youtube

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.640
or developer documentation.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:47.045
The second one was API Blog
using the apiblog.youbue.com.

00:11:47.045 --> 00:11:49.960
The third one was asking a
call-in question on Stack

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.820
Overflow and getting peer to
peer help or getting help from

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.510
us direct from here.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.560
Or if it was a server issue, if
it was any issue, like you

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.780
want to file a bug or create a
feature request, you can just

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.920
use the g.issue tracker.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.690
So these are the things
that actually I

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.410
want to go over today.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.160
And as the last thing, I want
to mention that as developer

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.280
relations team, we
are hiring almost

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.070
everywhere around the world.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.350
And you go into
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.750
You will see all the open
positions as well as

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:28.770
descriptions of all the
available jobs.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.810
And make a comment, just check
it out, and maybe if there's

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.360
something for you.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.630
That was all the things that
I want to talk about today.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:39.810
Thanks for joining me, Ibrahim
Ulukaya from New York.
