00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.638
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians,
historians, and linguists.

00:00:02.638 --> 00:00:03.666
David here with Paige.

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.499
- [Voiceover] Hi.

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:05.665
- [Voiceover] And Jake.
- [Voiceover] Hey.

00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:06.589
- [Voiceover] And we're gonna talk about

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.069
the history of the apostrophe.

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.402
The apostrophe isn't
just a punctuation mark.

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:16.569
In fact, the word apostrophe
comes to us from Greek,

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.504
from two different compounds.

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:23.786
"Apo," meaning "away," and
"stroph," meaning "to turn."

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:26.079
So it's a turning of strophe.

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.068
We need to turn away.

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.004
So it's a turning away.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:31.593
And in rhetoric, in classical rhetoric,

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:34.093
when we talk about apostrophe,

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:38.945
it's turning away from
your actual audience

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:41.888
to deliver a message to absent people

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:45.638
or inanimate objects or
just non-personified,

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:51.236
you're trying to personify
an inhuman concept.

00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:52.604
- [Voiceover] So before
it was a punctuation mark,

00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:54.057
it was a literary technique.

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:54.985
- [Voiceover] Yes, it was a turn,

00:00:54.985 --> 00:00:57.220
it was a figure of speech.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.829
You know, so if you think
about examples from literature,

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.998
this can be, the two things that my mind

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:04.850
immediately leaps to, being me,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.875
are "O, happy dagger,"

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.446
the speech from the end of
Romeo and Juliet in act five.

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:12.464
Boom, sorry, y'all didn't see.

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:15.040
I plunged the stylus into my breast.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.227
(giggles)

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:19.237
"O, happy dagger, this is thy sheath."

00:01:19.237 --> 00:01:21.444
"There rust and let me die."

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:22.277
Boom.

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:23.707
So, like in that, like, you know,

00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:25.240
we're addressing the dagger.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.101
The dagger is not alive.

00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:27.934
It is a knife.

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:28.930
It cannot respond.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.513
Or, on a lighter note perhaps,

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.718
from H.M.S. Pinafore, there's a song,

00:01:35.718 --> 00:01:39.334
"Fair moon, to thee I sing,
bright regent of the heavens."

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:40.167
It's the moon.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.000
The moon can't talk back.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.551
It's the moon.

00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:44.658
And from this figure of speech,

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.510
this is where we get the idea

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.790
that an apostrophe represents
something that is missing.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.630
That's how we come to get its main use,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.241
to represent that something,

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.658
that it's standing in for absent letters,

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:02.870
just like an apostrophe in rhetoric

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.857
would be delivered to absent friends.

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:07.193
Follow me over to the next screen.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.310
Let's do a little bit of history.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.660
So the apostrophe was introduced
to the French language

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.752
by an engraver and humanist
named Geoffroy Tory,

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:18.224
I think, is how you would say his name.

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:19.399
That's a guess.

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.889
And around the late 16th century,

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.406
I think it's around the 1580s,

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:26.446
Tory is the man who also introduced

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:30.549
a lot of diacritic or
accent marks into French.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.698
So, you know, instead of
like, "aime" meaning "loved,"

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:35.822
it would be "aime" like that.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:39.004
And he's the person that
used it originally in French

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.421
to start representing eliminated letters.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:47.107
So if you have an
expression like "la heure,"

00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:49.204
meaning "the hour,"

00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:52.303
Tory would have it "l'heure," like that.

00:02:52.303 --> 00:02:54.268
You know, and this
apostrophe in there, boom,

00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:58.016
represents this missing vowel sound.

00:02:58.016 --> 00:03:02.183
So, okay, so it's around this
time that this apostrophe

00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:05.476
starts making its way into English,

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:09.376
because remember, England
has been under French rule

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:11.678
for centuries at this point.

00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:13.954
The French invaded in the 11th century.

00:03:13.954 --> 00:03:16.671
We're talking about the
Norman Conquest of 1066.

00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:18.352
And since then, French culture has had

00:03:18.352 --> 00:03:23.063
a very profound impact on
the island of Great Britain.

00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:25.811
You know, so everyone
in a position of power

00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.512
speaks French or understands
and reads French.

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:30.906
So the nobility speaks and reads French.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:33.968
Anyone that's literate
speaks and reads French.

00:03:33.968 --> 00:03:35.755
And so you're gonna be, you know,

00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:38.550
this intelligentsia is going
to be coming into contact

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.596
with a lot of French,

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:42.258
see the apostrophe being
used this way and say,

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:44.434
"Oh, that's awfully convenient."

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:46.851
And so it's around this time,

00:03:47.836 --> 00:03:51.836
around the early 17th
century, late 16th century

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.024
that we're starting to see this
apostrophe usage in English.

00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:58.811
This is around the time when you first see

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:00.978
the contraction of "I am,"

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.107
"I'm," show up,

00:04:05.107 --> 00:04:07.455
is around this period.

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:10.103
Jake, does this square with
how apostrophes are used

00:04:10.103 --> 00:04:11.590
in other languages too?

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.272
- [Voiceover] Yeah, it's
the same in pretty much

00:04:13.272 --> 00:04:14.474
all the Romance languages.

00:04:14.474 --> 00:04:16.243
So anything derived from Latin,

00:04:16.243 --> 00:04:20.076
you have in Latin these
long definite articles

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:23.365
like "ille," i l l e,

00:04:26.318 --> 00:04:27.901
or "illa," i l l a.

00:04:30.317 --> 00:04:32.539
And all the definite articles
that come out of this

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.025
in all the Romance languages

00:04:34.025 --> 00:04:37.176
take some fraction of
the original from Latin

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:40.059
and omit some part with an apostrophe.

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:41.892
So "amico" in Italian,

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.453
to add a definite article
to make it "the friend,"

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.968
you can add just l apostrophe.

00:04:47.968 --> 00:04:48.810
"L'amico."

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.209
- [Voiceover] Cool.

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:53.419
So yeah, so during this time

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.720
of apostrophe expansion
across the continent,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.349
people are just going nuts, right?

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.478
There's no standardization
of usage for apostrophes.

00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:05.703
People are using it every
which way, but loose, you know.

00:05:05.703 --> 00:05:07.287
So they're using it like this.

00:05:07.287 --> 00:05:08.588
They're using it for contractions.

00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:10.609
They're using it for multiples of stuff,

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:13.740
like stuff that we would
consider incorrect today.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.341
Like "book's," like that.

00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.247
Wah, that looks terrible to me.

00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:21.414
And crucially, they're
using it for the possessive.

00:05:22.692 --> 00:05:24.192
So like, "Jake's."

00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:29.508
And the history of that usage
is another story entirely.

00:05:29.508 --> 00:05:31.731
But this, for now, is the history

00:05:31.731 --> 00:05:36.244
of the introduction of the
apostrophe into English.

00:05:36.244 --> 00:05:37.938
You can learn anything.

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:39.588
David and company out.
