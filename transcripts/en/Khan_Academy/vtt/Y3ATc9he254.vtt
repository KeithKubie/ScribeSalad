00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:02.490
- [Voiceover] If you
look at most substances,

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.985
so this is most things, right over here.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:08.353
As we go from a liquid state

00:00:08.353 --> 00:00:10.756
where things are literally fluid,

00:00:10.756 --> 00:00:12.819
the molecules are moving past each other,

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.778
to a solid state, where things
are rigid or more rigid,

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:19.379
you typically have something
getting more dense.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.583
So the liquid state would be less dense.

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:24.023
Less dense.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:27.808
And the solid state would be more dense.

00:00:27.808 --> 00:00:29.317
Would be more dense.

00:00:29.317 --> 00:00:31.546
Let's think about what
would happen if water

00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:34.193
were like most things here.

00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:36.632
So imagine a body of water.

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.284
So let's say that's the
land right over here,

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:41.154
this is a cross section of a body of,

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:44.625
I don't wanna draw brown
water, I wanna do blue water.

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:46.959
So this is a cross
section of body of water,

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:48.781
like say, we see in this picture here.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.787
Now let's say it is very cold.

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:53.785
That the air is extremely cold.

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.117
Let's say it's below the
freezing temperature of water.

00:00:57.117 --> 00:01:00.588
Well what would happen is the
water up here would freeze.

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:02.794
And this is actually what does happen.

00:01:02.794 --> 00:01:04.524
Water at the surface would freeze,

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:06.718
but if this ice were more dense,

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:09.319
the solid water were more
dense than the liquid water,

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.780
well then the ice would sink.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.069
The ice would sink and
collect at the bottom.

00:01:15.153 --> 00:01:18.926
The ice would collect at
the bottom right over here.

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:21.527
And then the water over
here would freeze again.

00:01:21.527 --> 00:01:22.688
It would freeze again.

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:24.789
But if that were more
dense, then it would sink

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.217
and collect at the bottom.

00:01:26.217 --> 00:01:29.015
And you keep going with this
process on and on and on,

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:31.221
and eventually the entire body of water,

00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:35.282
the entire lake would freeze solid.

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:37.289
Would freeze...

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.878
It would freeze solid.

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.371
Now you can imagine this
wouldn't be that good

00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:45.088
for the animals that
are living in the water.

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:47.085
If you imagine some fish in here.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:48.989
Those fish would then freeze.

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:51.589
And most living things, there
are a few simple organisms

00:01:51.589 --> 00:01:53.493
that can survive being frozen.

00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:55.397
But most living things would just die.

00:01:55.397 --> 00:01:57.255
And so this would not
be a good environment

00:01:57.255 --> 00:02:02.094
for animals to live in, or for
even biology to take place.

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:03.452
But what's neat about water,

00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:05.983
it does not follow this pattern.

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:07.901
When we're talking about water,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.083
when we're talking about water,

00:02:10.083 --> 00:02:13.090
when we go to the liquid state,

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.048
when we go from liquid water to solid ice,

00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:18.718
to solid ice, we actually get,

00:02:18.718 --> 00:02:20.692
we actually get less dense.

00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.316
So this right over here is less dense.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:26.691
This is why ice floats.

00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:29.628
This is more dense, more dense.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:30.917
And this is less dense.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:33.058
And to think about why
that is, it all goes back

00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:34.916
to the hydrogen bonding.

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.061
So we've seen in previous videos.

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:38.790
So, I'm gonna do it all in one color.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.786
Oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:43.454
Let's say this is the liquid
state that I'm drawing

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:44.221
right over here.

00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:47.176
This is liquid water.

00:02:48.075 --> 00:02:49.318
Liquid water.

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:52.359
So then you have oxygen,

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.621
and you have oxygen and hydrogen

00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:56.655
and hydrogen.

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:59.557
And you have oxygen and hydrogen

00:02:59.557 --> 00:03:00.660
and hydrogen.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.523
We've already talked multiple times

00:03:02.523 --> 00:03:03.858
about the fact that you have partial

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:07.585
negative charges at the side
away from the hydrogens.

00:03:07.585 --> 00:03:09.094
Partial negative, partial negative

00:03:09.094 --> 00:03:11.126
because oxygen is so electro-negative.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:12.728
And you have partial positive charges

00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:14.121
on the hydrogen ends.

00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:17.383
Partial positive charges at the hydrogens

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:19.740
and these partial negatives
and partial positives

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.689
attract each other and this
is called hydrogen bonding.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.325
Now the liquid state,
you have enough energy.

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:27.554
The temperature is just
really average kinetic energy

00:03:27.554 --> 00:03:29.551
that these molecules are
able to bounce around

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:30.689
and flow past each other.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.523
These hydrogen bonds get broken

00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:34.520
and get reformed over and over again.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.994
These things flow past each other

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:37.527
and also they have enough energy

00:03:37.527 --> 00:03:39.597
to kind of push even closer to each other

00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:41.184
than even the hydrogen
bonds would dictate.

00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:42.960
Sometimes they go closer,
sometimes they're further,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.621
sometimes they're pushing around.

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:45.828
But as we get--

00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:50.828
As we get cooler, as we get
cooler and we lose heat,

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.594
then they don't have the kinetic energy

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:53.256
to kind of--

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:55.392
They get closer and bump
up against each other

00:03:55.392 --> 00:03:58.619
and move right and flow
right past each other

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.185
and they form a lattice structure

00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:03.606
where it will look more like this.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.375
Where it will look like oxygen,

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:11.251
hydrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, hydrogen,

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:15.384
hydrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:17.056
And so you actually have the molecules

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:18.589
being further apart from each other

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.784
because they don't have
the kinetic energy,

00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:22.548
once again, to keep breaking and reforming

00:04:22.548 --> 00:04:24.510
these hydrogen bonds, or even to kind of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.284
have the kinetic energy to
push up against each other.

00:04:27.284 --> 00:04:29.061
And so you form this lattice structure.

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.756
You could even have another oxygen.

00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:32.985
And I'm obviously drawing
it in two dimensions,

00:04:32.985 --> 00:04:35.156
but ice, things in our universe,

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:36.755
in our reality are three dimensions.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:39.911
But hopefully this gives you the

00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:41.504
big picture of it.

00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:43.692
Oxygen, hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:04:43.692 --> 00:04:45.956
And so you have these hydrogen bonds.

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:47.825
I wanted to do those in white.

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:49.021
These hydrogen bonds.

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:50.484
And remember, these hydrogen bonds,

00:04:50.484 --> 00:04:52.190
they're still, it's still the case,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.117
electrons are still moving around,

00:04:54.117 --> 00:04:55.252
and so you still have a partial

00:04:55.252 --> 00:04:59.153
positive charge here and
partial negative charge there,

00:04:59.153 --> 00:05:00.953
but there's not enough
kinetic energy to push

00:05:00.953 --> 00:05:03.286
them close to each other
and flow past each other

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:05.936
and so you have ice right over here.

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.590
You have solid water.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.959
You have ice over here being less dense.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.153
And this is what keeps ice floating,

00:05:12.153 --> 00:05:13.593
this is what keeps icebergs floating,

00:05:13.593 --> 00:05:15.357
this is what keeps lakes like this

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.460
from freezing solid.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.318
This is why the surface freezes,

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.560
but you have water below it.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.648
In fact, that ice on the top protects

00:05:21.648 --> 00:05:23.121
the water below from...

00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:25.744
You can imagine, the ice, it protects it

00:05:25.744 --> 00:05:27.727
from getting even further frozen

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.135
and so you have animals

00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:34.060
able to just hang out.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.581
Hang out down here and

00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:36.754
go through the winter and then

00:05:36.754 --> 00:05:38.751
everything will thaw once you get to

00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:41.439
the spring and the summer.
