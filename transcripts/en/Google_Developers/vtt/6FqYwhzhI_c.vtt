00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.160
We wouldn’t be where we are at Google without
you, the developer community.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.850
Since 2005, we’ve made dozens of APIs and
tools available to you, then you went out

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.850
and built marvels.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.530
Now, with so many creations, we think there’s
a better way for them to work together, because...

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.129
there are a lot.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.980
So we did some spring cleaning, then asked
you how we could do it better.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.800
We used your ideas to begin building a single
place for all of the developer resources,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.000
tools, events, and community.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.559
And all of that together looks like this:
developers.google.com

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.730
But it’s more than just a logo.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.239
It’s a symbol for all the amazing work you
do in the world and how you work together.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.409
Soon you can find tools, get ideas, and connect
with others, all in one place.

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:47.550
Then, get down to business.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.840
Collaboration and coding power that creates
magical solutions with a universal language.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.179
So you can take that mass of code and blow
minds.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.309
For reals.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.210
So kick off your shoes and explore all the
ways you can connect.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.469
Because it’s not just about code, it’s
about you.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.350
Then, start building.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.400
Because together, there’s no telling what
we’ll create next.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.859
