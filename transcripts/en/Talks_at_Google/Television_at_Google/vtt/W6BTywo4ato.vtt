[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.229
SPEAKER: Hey, guys.

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:13.570
And as Tamron takes
the stage and joins us,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.590
I'll first just say that she
really needs no introduction.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.740
I know many of us have followed
your career as an award-winning

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.720
journalist, the
host of "Deadline--

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.900
Crime with Tamron Hall" on
Investigation Discovery,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.880
currently in its
fifth season, which

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.670
takes an in-depth look at
crimes that shocked the nation.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.550
But Tamron also was a part
of the NBC News team, co-host

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.200
of "NBC News Today," and is
the anchor of "MSNBC Live

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.000
with Tamron Hall."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.080
Is that all right?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.871
TAMRON HALL: I was.

00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:45.052
SPEAKER: Everything right?

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:46.010
TAMRON HALL: Google it.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.540
SPEAKER: Google it.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.280
But more than all of that,
she is truly a philanthropist.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.290
She's done so much
work in the community

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.340
and we'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.220
But she focuses her time on
homelessness, illiteracy,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.330
and the fight against domestic
abuse, a topic and subject

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.490
that I know is very
near and dear to you.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.140
So we'll uncover
all of those things,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.681
but first I just
want to say welcome.

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.530
TAMRON HALL: Thank you.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.360
SPEAKER: I am going
to first just begin

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.250
by saying that
for so many of us,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.840
I think I can say
in the audience,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.740
we have just been so inspired
by your work, by your journey.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.800
You've done it with grace,
integrity, and style.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.320
So first I just want to take
a moment to just salute you

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.820
and all of the
fabulousness that you

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.050
bring to television each day.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.690
So let's give her another
round of applause.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.648
TAMRON HALL: Thank you.

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:31.230
Thank you very much.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.620
I wrote that really
well for you.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.330
SPEAKER: No, no.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.637
She didn't pay me to--

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.595
TAMRON HALL: Delivered
it like an Oscar winner.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:37.030
Thank you.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.821
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:40.060
But I mean it, and I really do.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.530
And I think it's
not often that we

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.870
see someone that
just does what you

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.650
do so well and so gracefully,
so thank you so much.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.340
TAMRON HALL: Well, it's
not by design or plan.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.930
I wish I could say that
I had some life script

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:53.980
to work off of.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.190
People used to ask me all
the time, what's next?

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.610
And I recently started
answering that question

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.720
by saying, in my early
part of my career--

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.280
I've been on TV since I was 18.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.510
I'm now 46.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.460
In a few days I'll be 47.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.919
And I never truly stopped
to smell the roses

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.440
because I was always
looking for the next garden.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.210
And so when I got my first
TV job at 18, I was like,

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.150
whoa, $12,000, I've
got to get $24,000;

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.830
OK, $24,000, I've
got to get $48,000.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.950
And so I was always looking
for the what's next.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.060
And when I look back at the
early part of my career--

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.190
I can quickly tell you
this embarrassingly--

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.525
I was going through some
old pictures the other day,

00:02:31.525 --> 00:02:33.150
and I'm really close
to Harry Belafonte

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.640
now in this version of my life.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.130
I met him like 25 years ago
and I found a photo just a box.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.850
And I thought, I don't
even remember that moment.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.727
I remember I met him, but
all the context of it.

00:02:47.727 --> 00:02:50.310
And that's because it was what's
next, what's new, what's now,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.180
what's next?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.830
And so for me now, I really
at the old age of 46,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.830
it's like I'm stopping to
smell the flowers in the garden

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.710
and individually what
they need for my life.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.730
So if there's any grace or
class, it's all my family

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.750
and how I was raised and a
recognition that no matter

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.490
where you are in
your life, whatever

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.030
economic scale, wherever
you live, gender, race,

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.240
we all owe it to ourselves
ultimately to stop

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.600
and smell the roses.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.230
You don't have to savor it too
long because we're competitive,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.854
and we're in a
competitive environment,

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:26.130
but just that beat I
think is necessary.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.530
And that's what's
helped me at this point

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.270
in my rebirth of my career.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.860
SPEAKER: I think for so
many of us as Googlers

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.585
and just the busy time in our
lives, we don't do that enough.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.710
TAMRON HALL: I was rushing
before there was Google.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.950
I mean, it's like you guys have
a whole new set of problems.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.100
I was 18-- there was no Google,
and I still felt the rush of it

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.550
all and all these things.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.660
So yeah, it's even
more pressure now.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.900
It's exciting and
technology when people--

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.094
of course, they shrug off, oh,
I don't even use this or that.

00:03:58.094 --> 00:04:00.510
I'm like, oh, and where's your
brick phone and your pager?

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.920
I mean, I'm a tech person--

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.260
not to the degree that
obviously many of you are--

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.040
but embracing the fast
pace but not letting it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.450
control and rule you.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.460
I mean, here you are having a
beautiful baby in a few weeks.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.460
One of the things that
I've been very open about

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.790
is that I feel like I put my
career first in every aspect,

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.750
and then I woke up and
I'm like, oh, I'm 46

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.520
and I'd love to be a mom.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.250
And you have that
conflict over, was I

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.280
supposed to pause or what
was I supposed to do?

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.220
And so if I'm being
honest with you,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.734
and I will try to
always be that,

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.150
that's been a very
difficult road.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.740
I see beautiful
moms like yourself

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.530
and I think, wow, when I was
40 I missed this opportunity.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.080
I had other great opportunities,
but not that of being a mother.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.150
But this career, this show,
my work with young women,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.820
it's given me a
different opportunity

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.880
that I may not actually have
a child come from my body,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.690
but the influence that I hope
to have over young women--

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.460
black girls, white
girls, whatever,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.110
whatever your magic is--

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.400
if I can have a little piece
of my career influence it,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.500
that may have been
the gift that I was

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.210
meant to receive in exchange.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.540
SPEAKER: And I think that's
the thing, right, figuring out

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.270
what the path is for us.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.050
And I think so many of us figure
that out early and then many

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.337
of us figure that out later--

00:05:23.337 --> 00:05:24.670
TAMRON HALL: Or stumble into it.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.980
I'm convinced nothing is
figured out, by the way.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.289
I don't believe in closure.

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.330
I think that's overrated.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.350
SPEAKER: Oh, that's good.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.740
TAMRON HALL: When
people are like,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.721
oh, I want closure from this
breakup-- good luck with that.

00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:36.720
Until you see him with
somebody and you're like,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.030
I though it was closed.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.750
I don't believe in closure,
and I don't believe in plans.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.600
Because I just think that,
again, a lot of what's

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.640
happened in our lives--

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.490
this is what I buy into,
being ready for it.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.520
I think that if the
door in my career

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.300
has been opened
this much, I've been

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.940
willing to kick it
wide open and not

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.270
knock the door into someone.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.590
I'm ambitious but not
blind with ambition.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.300
So I wasn't willing
to kick the door open

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.860
so it would hurt
someone, but I was

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.109
willing to kick the door open.

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.400
So I think that less
planning and being

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.730
prepared for when
that moment comes,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.080
are you going to show up?

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.610
Are you ready?

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.370
And the little bit of
life that I've lived,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.329
I think that's what I've
learned over planning.

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:21.911
SPEAKER: So I've
heard a lot of people

00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:24.510
say that they don't believe in
luck, right, when preparation

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:25.950
meets opportunity.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.240
Do you kind of believe that?

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.380
TAMRON HALL: I believe in
it because OK, look, you

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.560
can't control your parents.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.810
You can't control who you're
born to or who adopts you

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.180
or whatever.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.490
Geography, where you're born--

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.800
I mean, depending on where
you're born in this country,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.620
you can be born where a high
rate of infant mortality

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.580
still exists.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.770
Education is at the lowest
level in this country,

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.190
and we're struggling
coast to coast

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.410
with getting our numbers up.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.870
Imagine being at the
bottom of the totem pole

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.320
in the United States, and you're
born in a county in Mississippi

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.420
that doesn't score as well.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.640
You had no control of
that in the fifth grade.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.785
And that sets the tone,
because then ultimately you

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:04.970
may be competing against
a kid from Manhattan whose

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.020
parents were able to
pay $40,000 a year--

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.190
and not to begrudge them,
I mean, that's geography.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.700
That's where you were born
and who you were born to.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.260
So I don't believe
that we can dismiss

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.230
these unknown variables,
whether you're religious or not.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.570
You cannot control
those factors.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.630
I was born to a single mom--

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.770
well, my mother and my father
married but divorced very soon.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.660
My grandfather had a
second grade education--

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.730
I've told this story many
times, Luling, Texas--

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.010
we didn't have paved
streets until the '80s.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:41.660
My grandfather's mother
forced him into farm labor

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.550
because he needed to
take care of the family,

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.890
and that's what
would happen then.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.400
But ultimately, a man with
a second grade education,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.170
a woman who was
divorced or separated

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.090
by the time she was 22, they are
the fabric of why I'm here now.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.900
So is it luck?

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.710
I don't know.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.610
I mean, I was born to what some
people might say hard luck.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:05.060
Well, that hard luck turned into
what I sure see as good luck.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.170
So I don't know
how to process it.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.510
But to just chuck it
up all to hard work,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.640
it's just not true
because you can't control

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.440
some of these variables.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.750
SPEAKER: Tell us a little
bit about your entry point

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.550
into journalism.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.300
I think about the time as a
young African-American woman

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.120
from Texas who believed.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.580
What was that moment for
you and what propelled

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.910
you to take that next step?

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.993
TAMRON HALL: I was always
raised in an environment

00:08:31.993 --> 00:08:35.274
where I was surrounded
by strong women--

00:08:35.274 --> 00:08:36.440
really, really strong women.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.179
And I had a grandfather
and ultimately

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:42.140
my stepfather, the dad that
God meant for me to have,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.540
they were just really
salt of the Earth people

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:51.050
who never let me believe that
winning wasn't an option.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.640
It was like oh,
you're going to win.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.292
I ran track.

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.250
My dad was like, you're
going to win this race.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.610
I decided I wanted
to play the clarinet,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.900
my dad's like, you're
going to be first chair.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.570
I'm like, I'm first chair, Dad.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:00.650
So they were very--

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.980
but they didn't do
it in this Dragon

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.480
Mom-- you remember
that book, and it

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.280
was so controversial--
it wasn't like that.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.030
It was more to build
my self-esteem.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.500
When I got into TV, it was one
of these things where I always

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.790
knew that I was going
to be a journalist.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.980
I didn't know what capacity.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.070
I remember trying to get a job
at the "Wall Street Journal"

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.660
right out of college and they
were like, get out of here.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:24.920
And then I was on TV
like in three weeks.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.710
I was like, what?

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.765
How did that happen?

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:29.210
I had gotten my first
TV offer actually

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.030
before graduating
college, Raleigh-Durham.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.850
But my dad said I had to
finish school, that I could not

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.340
take the job until I graduate.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.230
And I'm like, Dad, the
whole point of college

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.430
is to get a job.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:41.300
I got a job.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.820
He's like, but you need
the degree as a backup.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.940
So I ended up getting my
first job straight away out

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.540
of college.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.450
But it was after
sending a ton of resumes

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:56.300
and blind calls and ultimately
luck, as we call it.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.150
I went to a TV station
in Bryan-College Station

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.610
and this kid who was a
reporter, a young white male,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.520
he had done something
racially insensitive

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:09.890
and he was being terminated
and I got the spot.

00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.080
Some might say they
were under pressure

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.660
to hire a person of color and
a woman after this debacle.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.120
I can't answer that.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.647
I know I rose to
the occasion, and I

00:10:18.647 --> 00:10:19.730
know I worked my butt off.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.230
And I ultimately
ended up in Dallas.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.790
But I'll tell you
this funny story.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.980
I got my job in Dallas--

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.600
again, a crazy story
for another day,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.880
but it was straight up,
like it will be in my book--

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.240
but I get this job.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.660
And I walk in and I see
an African-American woman,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.100
one, reporter.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.326
We kind of look at each other,
and we knew it was going down.

00:10:39.326 --> 00:10:41.700
She was going to be out, and
I was likely going to be in.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.900
I was there for--

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.570
I didn't know I was there for
a job, but when I started out,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.600
it was a woman for a
woman, a black for a black.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.250
That's just how it was.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.660
Fast forward four years later,
I walk into this newsroom.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.560
I see her.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.770
It's going down, and
I replaced her again.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:05.490
I replaced the same woman two
times in a span of four years

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.590
at two different networks.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.740
One, there was a white
male news director.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.790
The other was two women.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.940
And I don't think they
saw it as a poker chip,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.440
but it was just like these
slots were available.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.380
They were quota spots,
if I can say that.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.450
She was an incredibly
talented reporter.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.800
I think I'm pretty
solid at what I do.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.960
But sometimes people see
it as a numbers game.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.810
Diversity is a numbers
game, which is unfortunate

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:41.920
because I believe she was
better than the A1 reporter who

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.690
was a white male.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:46.760
And if I can say, I think
I was better than him, too.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.950
But we were interchangeable.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.260
SPEAKER: So if we could pivot
for a moment, I think that--

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:58.700
well, we all just saw the new
episode coming out, right?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.650
Can we agree it's insane?

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.600
It was really good.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.280
I know I was on the
edge of my seat.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:04.910
TAMRON HALL: It's crazy.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:07.100
SPEAKER: And I think about
the way in your career

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.944
you've kind of leaned in, and
you can see it each episode.

00:12:10.944 --> 00:12:12.110
I certainly saw in that one.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.860
Would you guys agree that not
only is she always prepared,

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.510
well-researched,
and all those things

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.440
that journalists who are great
at their job do, but she cares.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.880
That's what really
was conveyed to me.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.730
TAMRON HALL: I think
most people do.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.861
I mean, we were in the green
room for a second and your

00:12:28.861 --> 00:12:29.360
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.480
I think most of us,
no matter what we do,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.560
you have to have
some caring about it,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.510
and hopefully a lot of
it for it to work out.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:38.500
But I think my home
state of Texas right now,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.250
you're seeing what's
happening in Houston.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.800
And we've seen natural
disasters around the world

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.929
and man-made disasters.

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:45.470
And think about how
that impacts you.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:48.470
Complete strangers, and you
see a mom carrying their baby

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.150
in waist-deep water.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.980
How do you not feel something?

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.030
I think most people--

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.840
I actually think society
and the generalization

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.410
of us being indifferent people,
it's just a bunch of crap

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.590
that's sold to us.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.920
I don't think we are as
divisive as people make us.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.990
I think our journeys give
us a certain perspective,

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.430
and in the wrong
hands, it can cause

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.110
us to turn on one another.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.740
But just because we are
pro bringing more women

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.410
into the tech world does
not mean we are saying,

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.900
remove more men out
of it in exchange.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.200
And I think that when people
prey on these concerns

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.290
and differences, that's
when the stereotype of us

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:29.370
being selfish or indifferent.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.350
But with the crime show,
going back to that,

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:36.110
it's impossible to sit
across from a mom who

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:40.460
has lost her son, they don't
know where his body is,

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:46.070
and she just needs that
peace and not feel that.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.070
It's like there was a movie,
I think Denzel Washington,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.716
where the person would touch
you and what they were feeling.

00:13:51.716 --> 00:13:53.090
With the "Deadline--
Crime" show,

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.454
it doesn't even require a touch.

00:13:54.454 --> 00:13:56.120
I mean, there have
been people I walk in

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.730
and as soon as I see their
face, I just lose it.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:03.560
Because that pain, it's just--

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.010
one of the things
that show did for me,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.960
it gave me the freedom
to cry on camera.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.390
Because when I first started,
journalist don't cry.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.670
I remember being
in Waco, Texas--

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.920
it had to be the late '90s--

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.100
horrible, horrible tornado
flattened this town

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.510
right outside of Waco.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.420
And this little baby was killed.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.370
And I remember having
to interview someone

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.320
in the neighborhood
and keep it together.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.460
And I'm like, there's a
baby that died in the storm

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.020
and everything is gone
that these people possessed

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.810
and a requirement of
my job is that I'm

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.900
supposed to stay stone-faced?

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.340
That's crazy to me.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.659
But I carried that
rule in my head.

00:14:45.659 --> 00:14:46.950
And I started doing "Deadline--

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.880
Crime," and so you're
doing it more frequently,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.820
meaning talking to people
who've lost loved ones,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.210
and it's at a more intimate
kind of environment.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:59.760
It's just the two of you and
maybe some camera people.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.480
And I just thought I was going
crazy by the second season.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.200
I was going home.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.180
I was drinking,
and I would binge

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.060
eat because I was
holding it all in.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.530
And when I finally started
crying with them and not making

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:16.020
them cry-- crying with them--

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:21.690
I felt not that it was better,
more comforting for my soul

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:24.150
because I knew I'd had a
human connection with someone

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.020
who lost a loved one, rather
than a reporter connection.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:30.540
SPEAKER: You said something
in the opening that struck me

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.180
at the core when you
said you not only want

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.620
to uncover how these
things happened,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.960
but why they happened.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.310
Is that like the--

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.500
TAMRON HALL: Some of it is
because OK, second season,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.340
I do the story this guy who
was married to this woman.

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.220
He was a video
game junkie, and he

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.961
played where you could connect
with someone from somewhere

00:15:49.961 --> 00:15:50.460
else.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.750
He meets another guy and says,
hey, visit me in Virginia.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:55.890
Let's be friends.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.090
OK, that works.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:57.747
Fine.

00:15:57.747 --> 00:15:58.330
The guy comes.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.440
Then he's like, kill
my wife with me.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.960
And the guy says, OK.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.175
And I'm like, what?

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.380
So I'm fascinated
by people who can

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.316
convince other people to kill
someone they don't even know.

00:16:14.316 --> 00:16:15.690
I'm like, she
didn't do anything.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.300
And the guy does it.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.050
And one of the reasons
also I did the show

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.970
wasn't for us to look
at someone else's life

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.320
and go, ah, that's messed up.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.750
It's a situation where
in a lot of these cases,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.380
it could be any of us and
they're not that far-fetched

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.310
where the parking lot situation
as women, as men, whatever

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.110
or a robbery goes bad.

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.140
And you happen to be-- as in
one of the cases this season,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:46.700
this guy was an aspiring
rapper, good kid, hanging out,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.780
and he and his buddy are in the
wrong place at the wrong time

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.670
and they get gunned down.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:56.930
And it caused his mother
to fight for justice

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.990
and ultimately, she becomes an
amazing politician in Florida.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.920
But he was just in
the wrong place.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.220
It's just crazy.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.099
SPEAKER: Talk to us a bit
about pop culture today

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:11.790
and the influence of it.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.060
I think about
Tyler Perry lending

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.160
his voice to the
episode and to the cause

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.609
more importantly and Reverend
Sharpton, who we work with here

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:21.290
at Google quite often.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:27.050
Do you think that their
ability to amplify that story

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.190
and to help give it a
platform of "Deadline--

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.850
Crime," how have you
seen that move the needle

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.230
to certain causes?

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.500
TAMRON HALL: I'm looking forward
to this episode, the premiere,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.600
because of Tyler's
involvement, not just

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.810
from a monetary
standpoint, but his voice.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.340
One of the
entertainment magazines

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.250
called him the most
powerful man in Hollywood.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:52.220
He basically turned Atlanta
into a Southern movie mecca

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.470
with his studio
and his influence.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.380
So that's his influence
he's had in the film world

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.110
and that he's willing to
translate that in some way.

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.280
And Tyler, he was watching
TV and saw this story

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.012
and was just outraged and called
the local television station.

00:18:08.012 --> 00:18:09.470
Can you imagine
being the reporter?

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.250
It's like, hi, it's
Tyler Perry on the phone.

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:11.750
No.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.590
Yeah, it's Me.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.630
What is going on
with this story?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.710
And he was moved in a way that
if any of us had called, maybe

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:18.440
I called--

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.970
of course, I'm a journalist,
but some of you called,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:20.970
they'd be like, oh yeah.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.825
This is the local news, and
we did the story about it.

00:18:23.825 --> 00:18:26.520
But his voice is important.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:30.440
I often shrug off when
people, whether it's politics,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.030
or in this case "Deadline--

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.090
Crime," or the issue
of domestic violence,

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.340
I think celebrity
voices are needed.

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.440
And I'm always
sometimes mystified

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.180
when people say, oh,
you're a celebrity.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:42.550
Shut up, you have no life.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.360
No, they're still a human being.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.120
And if your megaphone
is big and you

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.430
can spread the word about
something, why wouldn't we

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.180
celebrate that?

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.140
I get there are always going
to be people who go too far.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:54.020
I mean, there's
somebody in the office

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.436
right now I'm sure you're like,
she just needs to shut up.

00:18:56.436 --> 00:18:58.330
She's taking it too
far giving this idea.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:03.450
But for the most part, whatever
size your megaphone is,

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.430
it's needed.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.680
And that's why with
domestic violence,

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.320
when we started the fund
in honor of my sister,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.974
most of those donations
were people who followed me

00:19:11.974 --> 00:19:13.640
on social media, who
followed my career,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.420
and they were like $5 donations.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.430
They were just people who
wanted to use their megaphone

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.800
to spread the word, to
shine a light, which

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.750
is a part of the campaign
that I participated in.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:26.900
And we won an Edward
R. Murrow Award for it.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.130
But I think that this
notion that any voice--

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.550
whether it's George Clooney
or George Smith in South Oak

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.300
Cliff, Texas--

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:38.120
I mean, your voice
matters, and I

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:42.020
don't like this idea of shushing
someone because of whatever

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.630
reason.

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.390
SPEAKER: So I think for us, you
shared actually in the episode

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:51.120
and in the opening a lot
about your personal journey

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.880
and story, especially
with domestic violence.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.390
Can you share with us
as you do this work,

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.517
whether it's your philanthropy
or through the work

00:19:58.517 --> 00:19:59.100
of "Deadline--

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.505
Crime," is it emotionally
taxing for you at times?

00:20:02.505 --> 00:20:04.650
And how do you
practice self-care?

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.710
I think all of us have that
thing that we deal with,

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.750
so just curious to
know as you do the work

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.210
and you immerse yourself,
how do you protect

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.065
your spirit in the process?

00:20:14.065 --> 00:20:15.690
TAMRON HALL: Well,
I try to be healthy.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.347
I mean, like I said before, I
was putting a bottle of wine.

00:20:18.347 --> 00:20:20.430
And I was like, I've got
to go to the steak place.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:21.840
I'm like, I'll have a steak.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.844
The whole thing, the 18-ounce,
give me that, big baked potato,

00:20:24.844 --> 00:20:26.010
yeah, the chocolate souffle.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.220
I'll take that too.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.350
And I was like--

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.770
because you're just trying
to fill that something

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.850
that's painful inside you.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.739
I love cooking,
even though I live

00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:38.280
in New York in the
heart of the city.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.392
I love cooking.

00:20:39.392 --> 00:20:41.850
And so I often will have dinner
parties now with my friends

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:42.350
over.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:44.100
I'm the queen of Blue Apron now.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.930
I make a mean Blue Apron.

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.630
And so I have Blue
Apron weekdays

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.330
and then we have "Food and
Wine" Saturday and Sundays where

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.030
I peruse the "Food and Wine"
magazine, and I get a recipe.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.930
I practice, I fail, I
poison, I feed-- it depends.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:20:58.830
But I enjoy that.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.800
I'm very close to my
family, my mother.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.240
As I revealed, my father passed
away after my sister's murder.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.769
And so we're a very close
family, we've always been.

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:10.310
But I have three
nieces and a nephew.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.780
So I just surround myself
with great friends.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.460
I had a fight party
this Saturday,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.030
and I had 15 of my close
friends over from all walks

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:23.960
of life, truly a motley crew.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.850
I'm like, I feel like Noah
bringing two of everything

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:27.480
together.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.030
It's like my friends
are so different.

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:33.700
But yeah, I decompress
with friendship.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.330
It's critical for me to laugh.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.100
I like surrounding
myself with people

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.170
who don't take
themselves seriously

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.470
and we just yuk it up.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.590
But my friendships feed my soul.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.130
SPEAKER: What
about social media?

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.020
TAMRON HALL: I try not
to use the word hate.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.490
This is what I
dislike, and I think

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.650
the curve correction will come.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.280
One of those pivotal
moments for me,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.250
there was a Miss
Universe contestant

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:58.090
and she was a Muslim,
this was some years ago.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:59.830
And a couple of people
go on social media

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.200
and they say awful things.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.240
And I remember I
ended up on the show

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.660
that I was on at the time
doing a whole story on the five

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.300
losers who had said
something about her,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.000
not the other people
who celebrate.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.850
And so I think that
small groups of people

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.930
are able to dominate--

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.764
SPEAKER: The trolls?

00:22:17.764 --> 00:22:18.763
TAMRON HALL: The trolls.

00:22:18.763 --> 00:22:20.290
And so we end up
going, well, here's

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.300
what the troll said
about Katy Perry today.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.350
And I'm like, Katy
Perry doesn't care.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.140
She's got 90 million
people following her.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.344
So I mean, I'm like, so if
there are 330 million people

00:22:28.344 --> 00:22:29.260
in the United States--

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.093
I don't know the numbers
that are on Twitter

00:22:31.093 --> 00:22:32.900
or whatever-- but
the percentage,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.100
we don't look at the
ratio of mean comments.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:44.080
And so now shows like the one
I did and some others will then

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.850
put the tweet in an article
or put it up on air so now

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.690
[? Bud ?] [? Bud, ?] dot, dot is
now famous because his tweet is

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.920
shown on a morning show.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.810
And I don't even
know if he's real.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.610
I have no idea who you are.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:59.950
So I think the
anonymity is a problem,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:02.560
but it also protects our voice.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.940
But there seems to
be no verification

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.722
of some of these mean things.

00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:10.180
I mean, when think
about the impact

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.920
that we allow these
words to have.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.820
We call them trolls, but
we still let them in.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.516
And proportionately when
you look at the comments

00:23:19.516 --> 00:23:21.765
and then when people say,
oh, it's trending on Twitter

00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:24.490
or here's what people
are saying on Instagram,

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.160
we pull out the
three meanest things

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.210
and make these people
the star of the show.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.240
It's strange.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.869
SPEAKER: It is.

00:23:31.869 --> 00:23:32.910
TAMRON HALL: But I do it.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.805
Listen, I get give
17,000 great comments,

00:23:34.805 --> 00:23:37.055
and it's the one that goes,
your lipstick is terrible,

00:23:37.055 --> 00:23:38.650
and I'm like, really, what?

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.700
My lipstick is awful?

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.170
And it's sticks in your mind.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.128
Then I throw the lipstick
out three days later,

00:23:43.128 --> 00:23:44.440
and it sinks in, oh my god.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.100
We all do it.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.970
The negative sometimes attracts
us far easier than the light,

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.680
and we have to
reverse that if we're

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.590
going to continue to have
these social media platforms be

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.610
productive.

00:23:54.610 --> 00:24:01.206
We cannot, myself included, give
in so easily to these minority

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.950
of voices.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.470
SPEAKER: What was the aha
moment for you when you knew

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.120
you were on the right track?

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.870
TAMRON HALL: Ha, I'm
still waiting on it.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:09.010
I don't know.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.760
SPEAKER: I think
professionally, all of us

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.460
have those moments
where we wonder,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.470
are we really
following our passion?

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.030
Are we really doing
the right thing?

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.120
Are we living in
purpose and on purpose?

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.220
Was there a moment
for you when you knew

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.840
that this was right for you?

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.890
TAMRON HALL: This was
the only option for me.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.414
I was either going to do
this or deal cards in Vegas,

00:24:28.414 --> 00:24:29.830
and I don't know
how to play cards

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.038
and I'm horrible at counting.

00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:33.257
This was it.

00:24:33.257 --> 00:24:34.840
Going back to-- and
I'm thinking a lot

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.610
about what you said about luck.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.460
I did not know I would
be on television.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:44.080
I knew that I would
be in this field that

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.260
allowed me to interact, to
capture stories about people.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.410
I've always enjoyed-- as
much as I like to talk--

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.890
I do love hearing
about other people

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.170
and feeling their
texture of life.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.930
And maybe it is because
of how I was raised.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:05.730
And there was a show many
years ago I was watching--

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.980
it just talked about, of
course, who we are as people,

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.170
I don't know, I was like
maybe 10 years old I saw it--

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:14.350
and it's just we
have these shells

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:19.610
and they become our armor and
they become our defense unit.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.630
But then when you peel
them back on anyone,

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.264
you find these
interesting people.

00:25:24.264 --> 00:25:26.680
That's why I don't believe
that most people bad, I do not.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.300
Do I believe there are
some really evil people?

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:28.890
Yes.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.250
Are they a small group?

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.660
Yes.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:36.550
But just the idea of learning
that there's so much more.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:37.930
I mean, like
everyone knows, it's

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:42.470
no secret I love
fashion a little bit.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.670
But then I've had people go,
oh, well, Christian Louboutins?

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.175
I'm like, you don't
know anything about me.

00:25:48.175 --> 00:25:51.080
First of all, I've worked my
entire life since I was 14

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.380
and at one point in time,
I had five shows on.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.720
And if your total sum
of me is a pair of shoes

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.220
that I can't even
spell the name of,

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.410
either, then I
feel sorry for you

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.370
that you choose to ignore
my entire life's scope.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.420
And I don't say that I grew
up poor as a badge of honor.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.980
That's just my life.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.040
And we are all the same.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.520
We've all been in
situations where

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.940
people make that one thing
the total sum of who we are.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.010
And so for me, knowing that
that one experience, that one

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.100
thing that I see is
not the total sum

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.499
of that person or the story
is why I'm a journalist.

00:26:27.499 --> 00:26:28.790
And I've always been like that.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.520
I've always been curious.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.100
I mean, I had a midwife
named Mama Susie,

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.015
and she was like
100 when I was four.

00:26:36.015 --> 00:26:37.890
And she was still alive
when I was in my 20s.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.200
I was like, what
are you drinking?

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.996
But I preferred Mama Susie's
company over kids my age,

00:26:44.996 --> 00:26:47.120
because I would just sit
there and just talk to her

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.270
and listen to her.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.830
It was incredible.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.840
I can tell you exactly
if I close my eyes where

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.200
I would sit in her house
that's since been leveled

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.880
when I was seven years old.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.400
I can hear the
screech of her back--

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.440
she had one of those old school
screen doors, that wooden--

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.320
I can hear the door
because those are

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.906
the things that matter to me.

00:27:06.906 --> 00:27:08.530
SPEAKER: So we're
going to turn it over

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.580
to you guys for
questions in a moment.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.292
So if you'll just line up
at the microphones, please.

00:27:13.292 --> 00:27:15.000
TAMRON HALL: Don't
push anybody down, OK?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.970
Let's keep this civilized, OK?

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.070
SPEAKER: But we really
want to hear from you,

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:21.680
so please join us
at the microphones.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.841
But I will ask you,
as my last question,

00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:26.590
for you to share with
us a little bit more

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.060
about Safe Horizon, the fund
that you have with them called

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.470
Tamron Heart Renate Fund.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.680
TAMRON HALL: Yes, yes.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:37.180
Safe Horizon, I met counselors
and workers of Safe Horizon

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.240
about five years ago.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.590
They asked me to come and
speak for their convention.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:42.760
It was in Harlem.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.280
And their program just
really resonated with me.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:48.130
And I think we talk so
much about the services,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:50.997
and we forget about the people
who are preparing for battle.

00:27:50.997 --> 00:27:53.080
I mean, these are people
who have to go into homes

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.230
and help women, in
most cases mothers,

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:59.530
in most cases flee at the most
dangerous time in their life.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.090
One in four women is a
victim of domestic violence,

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:03.430
one in seven men.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:07.180
And people forget
that someone has

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.200
to go to that home in many
cases and help that woman leave.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.150
So I really became
connected with the stories

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:15.030
of the workers.

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.620
These are the warriors on the
front lines, the people who

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.160
imagine you picking up a
call five, six times a day

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.040
at the hotline, and
someone is begging

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:29.980
for help for their life, not
for some superficial thing,

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.270
your life.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:33.520
And you're having as the
worker to pick up that phone.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.290
So I teamed up with them, with
my family over at The Door PR.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.920
We came up with a plan
to launch this fund.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.020
And they also have
the Put the Nail in it

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.780
Campaign where you
paint your ring

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.000
finger on your left hand,
which I have these long cat

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.541
lady Beyonce Knowles
nails this week,

00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:54.190
I don't know what's going
on, but paint it purple

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.560
and it's in support.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.550
So whether it's being
able to paint your nail--

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.430
and we've had men do it,
kids do it in support

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.360
or give a donation.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.620
But the fund is to help
families like mine, who

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.380
did not know how to handle it.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.910
We knew my sister was in a
domestic violence relationship,

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.800
and she had been in others.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.780
But we had this thing
of stick our head

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:15.610
in the sand, kind of
mind our business.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:19.510
Protect her if she asked
us, but if she did didn't we

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.810
didn't do anything.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.680
And ultimately, it resulted
in a lot of regret and pain

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.180
within my own family.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.730
And I started to talk to other
friends of people and family

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.440
members who also said they
didn't know what to do.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.500
And survivors will
also say, I don't

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.500
want to bring my friends
and my family in my mess.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:41.680
And so we wanted to build
an avenue for people

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.570
to be able to get some advice.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.770
If you think your friend is
in a situation or a loved one

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.620
so you can say, what can I do?

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.240
How do I bring this up?

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.280
How can I help her or him
get out of the situation

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.380
without looking as if I'm
judging or I'm condemning?

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.120
Because sometimes if the victim
feels like everyone's judging,

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.440
they just retreat
back to the abuser.

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.600
So how do we approach it?

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.760
And that was through
my own pain, a feeling

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.480
that I had not done
enough for my sister.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.500
But to be honest, I
didn't know what to do.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.250
So we're just trying
to give as much support

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:19.550
across the platform for
families and survivors

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:20.460
of domestic violence.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.960
SPEAKER: I know we as Googlers
like to give, so where can we

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.240
go to support the fund?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.500
TAMRON HALL: Safehorizon.org.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.040
You'll see on the front page
the Tamron Heart Renate Fund.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.230
And if you want to paint
your finger purple,

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.540
that's awesome, for
the month of October.

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.280
And it'll be great support
and I appreciate it.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.960
Even if you just-- it
sparks a conversation.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.210
I spoke at the NFL headquarters
not terribly long ago

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.440
and several women shared with me
either they were in a situation

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:51.480
or they had had friends and they
didn't quite know what to say.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.120
And you see this
controlling behavior,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.300
but you don't want to
be that friend who's

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.930
hating, as they might say,
on someone's boyfriend.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:59.690
But you want to be supportive.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.630
So we had some very
candid conversations.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:05.050
And I would encourage amongst
yourselves with your friends,

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:06.700
have those candid conversations.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.880
And if you need help,
you can reach out to me--

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.430
DM me, seems like every
other crazy person does.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.910
I'd rather a DM.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.106
SPEAKER: Slide in my DMs.

00:31:15.106 --> 00:31:17.500
TAMRON HALL: Slide in my--
it goes down in the DM.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.420
But being able to reach out--

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.880
it does, trust me.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.620
It's insane.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.560
But of course, I would always
be available to offer advice

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:27.712
at any given time.

00:31:27.712 --> 00:31:28.420
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.440
Thank you.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.946
All right.

00:31:30.946 --> 00:31:31.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tamron.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:32.840
My name is Jenna Levy.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.380
I'm a recruiter here at
Google and I actually

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.399
met you very, very briefly
probably about three years ago.

00:31:38.399 --> 00:31:40.190
I used to work in
Discovery Communications,

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.770
and I met you at the
Discovery Upfronts.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.353
I was very impressed
with you and have

00:31:43.353 --> 00:31:46.810
followed your career
since and watched you

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:47.670
on the "Today Show."

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.860
I watch a lot of Investigation
Discovery, Discovery

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.910
Communications.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.389
I just wanted to know,
you mentioned some stories

00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:56.680
from your career that really
stood out to you as either

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.470
painful or really
impactful and kind of

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.300
how you've dealt with the
stress in some of the stories

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.350
that you've kind of seen.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.860
I wanted to know if there was a
particularly exciting or happy

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.940
memory that you've had from your
years of journalism that you--

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.690
TAMRON HALL: Oh my
god, they're countless.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.106
AUDIENCE: Any one
that sticks out?

00:32:15.106 --> 00:32:18.240
TAMRON HALL: Let me see,
the one that sticks out--

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:21.470
listen, I've done morning TV for
30 years so a lot of silliness.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:29.190
I mean once, Don King [LAUGHS]
was promoting a match,

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.749
two boxers--

00:32:29.749 --> 00:32:30.290
I don't know.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.915
They were like two
big guys that looked

00:32:31.915 --> 00:32:33.990
like the guy from
"Rocky" when he

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.850
fought the Russian,
these two big guys.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:41.800
And I walked out-- they
were in the studio live,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:46.030
and I walked out with a Don King
wig on with the real Don King

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.047
across from me.

00:32:47.047 --> 00:32:48.630
And I'm like, you're
going down, King.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:50.320
Only in America.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.906
He was not entertained by it.

00:32:52.906 --> 00:32:57.090
And I kept going, only in
America-- and these flags.

00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:00.050
And I had on a green and white
and Diane Von Furstenberg wrap

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:04.606
dress and the real Don King,
I kept going all in his face.

00:33:04.606 --> 00:33:06.400
I thought he would
appreciate it.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.680
He's kind of out there.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.064
He was in like an American
glitter flag jacket.

00:33:10.064 --> 00:33:11.980
I'm like, you're not
taking it that seriously.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:14.280
And then, the piece
de resistance,

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.790
I made him play Rock 'Em
Sock 'Em Robot with me

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.090
while I had a Don King wig on.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.542
Highlight of my career.

00:33:20.542 --> 00:33:24.030
[LAUGHS] God, I can't
believe I confessed to that.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.312
It's on tape somewhere.

00:33:25.312 --> 00:33:27.100
Oh, and I made
Christmas cards out

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.516
of my picture with Don King.

00:33:28.516 --> 00:33:30.790
That was my holiday card.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:31.480
Oh, gosh.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.260
Hi.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:33.134
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tamron.

00:33:33.134 --> 00:33:35.790
I don't know if I can top that.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.290
First of all, thank
you for not only

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:38.470
be here, but for
everything that you've

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:39.636
done throughout your career.

00:33:39.636 --> 00:33:41.290
You really have
been an inspiration.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.660
And throughout your career
and through the shows

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:45.940
that you've been on,
you've done a wonderful job

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.850
of giving voice to the
voiceless and keeping stories

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.800
that need to be told out there.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.760
My question for you
is as a journalist,

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.350
we see so many important things
and stories coming out day

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.230
after day and with the
nature of the news cycle,

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.774
it gets faster and
faster and faster.

00:34:01.774 --> 00:34:03.190
As a journalist,
what do you think

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:05.500
we need to do to keep some
of these important stories

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.500
out there and the stories that
need to be told, making sure

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:09.400
that they are told?

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.949
Because so much they say
is controlled by the trolls

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:15.604
or controlled by what is just
the new story of the day,

00:34:15.604 --> 00:34:17.020
but there's important
stories that

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.980
really need to be expounded
upon and really need to be told.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.730
TAMRON HALL: I have
to be honest with you,

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:25.420
I'm in conflict with
myself, as I have asked

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.400
myself that very question.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.949
Listen, ratings
equal money, so that

00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:32.350
means that the media
has been monetized.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.600
Anything that can be
monetized can be corrupted.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.770
It can be influenced.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.855
It can be a lot of things.

00:34:36.855 --> 00:34:38.230
Am I saying the
media is corrupt?

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.590
I'm not saying that.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.580
I am, though, saying it
can definitely be clouded.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.360
And so when I look at the media
with that same skepticism,

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.480
I have to also look
at us as viewers.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480
I'll give an example.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.020
When the Boko Haram,
the girls were missing,

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.250
everyone was on my
social media, you guys

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.840
aren't doing this
story, you suck.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.030
We do it every day.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.090
I had the only reporter
who was on the ground,

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:12.480
she was an AP global reporter,
phoning in every day.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.660
Every time we did it,
the number would dip--

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.660
every time.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.660
Now, one might say they
didn't like Tamron Hall.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.201
I don't know.

00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:21.210
But I know every time
we did that story.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.030
And the social media
traffic was heavier

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.040
than it seemed the TV interest.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:28.030
And so suddenly, if
you notice, everyone

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.030
stopped kind of doing
this story because I think

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:36.720
they saw the same result. So I'm
able to look at my profession

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.150
with a critical eye,
myself included in that.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.280
But we as viewers have
to look at ourselves.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.810
We get on our soap
boxes, and we'll

00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:45.540
be like, oh, yes, I
care about na-na-na.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.730
And then you look at
the ratings of that

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.630
compared to "Love and Hip Hop
LA"-- which I'm not hating,

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:52.340
I love it--

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.150
and sometimes it will
do a higher rating

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:55.570
than these things we care about.

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.750
But here's what I
think is empowering.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.071
TV is a la carte now.

00:36:00.071 --> 00:36:02.070
My nephew-- when I'm like,
you don't have cable?

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.210
He's like, cable, who
has cable anymore?

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.910
I say that as my life
is made on cable.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.630
But with our social media,
we can pick and choose

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.550
what we read and we know that
these clicks are monitored--

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.052
you know this better than I do.

00:36:14.052 --> 00:36:16.260
And I think that we don't
have to wait on Tamron Hall

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.200
to report it.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:18.607
We can seek out the information.

00:36:18.607 --> 00:36:20.690
So I don't have the answer,
to be honest with you.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:22.580
I'm as clouded--

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.966
I get so mad sometimes.

00:36:23.966 --> 00:36:26.340
The headline will say something,
and you click the story.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:28.029
And you're like,
I've been played.

00:36:28.029 --> 00:36:29.820
I do think people are
getting sick of being

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.520
played by clickbait.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.700
I think they are sick of these
inflammatory and incendiary

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.686
headlines on all sides.

00:36:38.686 --> 00:36:40.560
And I don't normally
like to say on all sides

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.726
because it's not always all.

00:36:41.726 --> 00:36:44.020
Some things are not equal,
let me be clear about that.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.880
But I think that we get
clickbaited into these things,

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.670
and then you don't know
truth from reality anymore.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:57.500
So I think we're just in a
very interesting point in media

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:58.130
consumption.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.570
But also as viewers,
because I see it firsthand.

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:05.290
People will just yell at us
for not covering stories,

00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.410
and then we would do the
story, and the response

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.720
from the viewer would be low.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:13.470
So I don't know.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.240
I don't know.

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.490
It's something that I think
we all should think about.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:18.220
But we have more power.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.700
Even though there
are more choices,

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.480
we have more power in
what we choose to consume.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.300
Google, you can pick and
find out what you want.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.131
So I don't know.

00:37:27.131 --> 00:37:28.130
I wish I had the answer.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.438
But it is a great question,
and I struggle with it a lot.

00:37:31.438 --> 00:37:32.230
Thank you.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.155
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:37:34.155 --> 00:37:35.030
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tamron.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.404
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:37:36.404 --> 00:37:37.440
TAMRON HALL: Thank you.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.898
AUDIENCE: As a
journalist, you have

00:37:38.898 --> 00:37:40.590
to ask some really
tough questions that

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.470
make everyone involved
uncomfortable sometimes,

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.210
even myself watching.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.450
What's your advice
on the best way

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.280
to do that without coming
across in a poor manner?

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:54.810
I think that
interestingly translates

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.074
to a lot of our careers
in a different way,

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:59.490
so that would be great to just
hear your thoughts on that.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.190
TAMRON HALL: I had a friend
many years ago give me--

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.652
I'm sure because he wasn't
the wisest of creatures,

00:38:04.652 --> 00:38:06.360
but I think he still
[INAUDIBLE] someone.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.150
He said, you have two pizzas
at the same pizza place.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.850
Pick your favorite
pizza, whatever you love.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:16.300
Someone brings it fresh and hot
in a pizza box, nice, lovely,

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.105
whatever.

00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:21.269
Same pizza fresh and hot, same
company on a garbage pail.

00:38:21.269 --> 00:38:22.560
Which one are you going to eat?

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.184
They're the same
pizza, both are clean,

00:38:24.184 --> 00:38:27.090
but one's on top of a garbage
pail, one's inside a nice box.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:28.590
You're going to go
for the nice box.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.070
You can ask someone
anything, and I believe that.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.770
It's how you approach them.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.290
And I do fight
sometimes, especially

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.290
in the political world--

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:37.350
I mean there are
a couple of videos

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.720
out there that I would love
to delete that were cheered

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.580
on by people but internally--

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:44.910
the Scott Baio
thing still bugs me.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:53.040
That moment I let me become a
distraction from that topic,

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.230
rather than just
handling it slightly.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.700
I wouldn't do it again.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.790
I wouldn't change how
I handled Scott Baio,

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.781
but did I leave
there going, yeah?

00:39:01.781 --> 00:39:02.280
No.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.750
Were other people like, yeah?

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.850
My feelings weren't
matching the moment.

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:10.030
I think you can ask
and present something

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.710
in the most
uncomfortable settings,

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.112
it's just how you do it.

00:39:14.112 --> 00:39:16.070
I'll give you a funny
and lighter note on this.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:20.180
Ben Affleck, that movie
"Gigli," I was in local news

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.630
and he was in these junkets
where they can't see you

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:24.540
but you can see them
and you're interviewing.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.900
And they had people say,
you can't ask Ben Affleck

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.840
about Jennifer Lopez.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.150
He will not answer the
question, blah, blah, blah.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:37.400
I'm a huge Ben Affleck fan,
and so I said, hey, Ben, I

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.930
paid to see "Gigli,"
so you kind of

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.880
owe me to be able to
answer what I want to ask.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.480
And he started laughing.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.090
And it's just how
you approach it.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.810
But I did an interview
with Winnie Mandela, which

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.150
remains one of the most
difficult interviews I've ever

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.900
done in my life, and it
was after her controversies

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:59.380
and a lot of tough things
were coming out about her.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:04.440
And it was hard because I've
always admired Winnie Mandela,

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.060
and I knew that there
were allegations

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.740
that were very serious,
that it resulted

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.590
in the deaths of some
people-- not by her hands,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.400
but it's all very complicated.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.370
Nevertheless, here I am
across from one of my heroes

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.760
and I'm having to ask her
these very tough questions.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.170
But that's my job.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:26.380
And that's why it's also wise
not to view people as heroes.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.980
I mean, we can learn
something from everyone.

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:33.060
I caution against putting
people on this pedestal

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.350
of being a hero.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.590
So I asked her.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.830
Sometimes you've
just got hit it.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.120
You've got to ask that
question, whether it's in work.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.830
They say women, we
have a hard time

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:44.990
asking for raises or our due.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.200
I've been there.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.870
I've been there where you kind
of like laugh and try to have

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:50.870
the humor and diffuse it.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.820
And oh, well, I--

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.647
I've been there.

00:40:54.647 --> 00:40:56.730
And I've been in other
situations where I've said,

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:00.570
this is what I'm doing, and
today's the day I'm doing it.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.750
And so it's life.

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.480
But I think you can
approach anything.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.780
I try-- because I think
I like to be funny,

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.220
and I like laughter.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.390
My thing is I try not to
deflect to humor because it's

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:15.590
uncomfortable.

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:19.820
I try to stay polite,
straight up, direct.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:24.330
And I think that you
can ask any question.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.680
There's not one that I'm
unwilling to ask someone

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:33.130
if it's, A, based in fact
and you know your intentions.

00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:35.330
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:35.870
All right.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.510
If not, let's give it
up for Tamron Hall.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.594
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:41.094 --> 00:41:44.020
Be sure to check out "Deadline--

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.680
Crime with Tamron
Hall" this Sunday--

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.440
TAMRON HALL: Yes,

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.380
SPEAKER: --on
Investigation Discovery.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:50.870
I know I'll be tuning in so
make sure that you do, too.

00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:53.570
And also a special thanks
to our Talks at Google team

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:57.059
and Black Googler Network for
making today's program happen.

00:41:57.059 --> 00:41:58.850
So let's give them a
big round of applause.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:03.327
Where can we follow you
on Instagram, Twitter,

00:42:03.327 --> 00:42:04.076
slide in your DMs?

00:42:04.076 --> 00:42:04.820
TAMRON HALL: Yes.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.100
Oh, slide in my-- oh gosh.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.039
I want to do a book just of DMs.

00:42:09.039 --> 00:42:10.080
That's what I want to do.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.805
Ugh!

00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:12.055
SPEAKER: Please don't do that.

00:42:12.055 --> 00:42:16.550
TAMRON HALL: It would be triple
X. No, Tamron Hall on Twitter,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:19.610
Tamron Hall on Instagram,
Tamron Hall on Facebook.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.790
That's the joy of
having an unusual name.

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:23.480
We can own our domains.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.040
Other than the
camera lens company,

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.820
I'm the only Tamron I know.

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.250
But yes, absolutely.

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.680
And always reach out and
I'd love hearing from you

00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.540
guys on social media, and
it's been a joy to be here.

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:34.790
I really appreciate it.

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:38.780
These kinds of
interactions do more for me

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.300
than you can ever imagine,
just to be able to be in a room

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.570
and talk civilized about
all kinds of things.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:45.190
It's a joy.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.540
So I really am grateful
that you invited me.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.530
Thank you so much.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:49.040
Thank you so much.

00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.490
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.480
TAMRON HALL: You
did a great job.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.216
Shout out.

00:42:51.216 --> 00:42:52.535
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:52.535 --> 00:42:54.410
You have our support
and we will be watching.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.368
TAMRON HALL: Thank you.

00:42:55.368 --> 00:42:56.930
Thank you, guys.
