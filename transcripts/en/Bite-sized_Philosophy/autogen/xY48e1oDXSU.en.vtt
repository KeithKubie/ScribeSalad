00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.847
 If you make people of their own accord they face their fears and the difficulties they avoid 

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:07.727
 Which they themselves know they must overcome in order to reach their goals 

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:11.519
 Or life that they would like if you could teach people that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.330
 That is to stand up to their problems and fears and confront them 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.691
 Then they will acquire maturity and strength that has no limit at it stop. For example, ask yourself if for ten years 

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:24.531
 You did not ignore the things you were supposed to do according to your perspective of life 

00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:29.432
 And your plans and plans that you planned for yourself, how will it be then? 

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:35.093
 Indeed, there are examples of great people who have come to this world and presented themselves as examples 

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:38.876
 Others have followed this approach for decades 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.926
 That is, for decades they have been walking according to a method they have set for themselves 

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:48.106
 The result is that they have made themselves mature and powerful 

00:00:49.068 --> 00:00:52.599
 They were growing stronger and more mature over time 

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.159
 There is no limit to this growth, ie growth on the level of self and personality 

00:00:56.419 --> 00:01:00.770
 You can even say in part that the cause of your suffering is unbearable and that in fact you can overcome it 

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:04.641
 It is because you do not arrive as an individual for all you can be of strength and maturity 

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.501
 You yourself are aware of this fact and it is a disturbing and difficult fact to recognize 

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.783
 Or considering them 

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:15.274
 But it is a fact that includes a gospel and a promise because the meaning of this is that there is another perspective to the world 

00:01:15.544 --> 00:01:20.093
 You can acquire it, and there are many ways to influence the world you can adopt 

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:24.096
 And make it so that the results of your adoption of this new vision better than before 

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:27.956
 The other point is to imagine if a number of people embrace this perspective and follow his approach 

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:31.656
 Because as human beings we have accomplished many great things 

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:36.875
 For example, more than 250,000 people will be uprooted from extreme poverty and around 300,000 people 

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:42.068
 The electricity will be delivered to them and that means saving large groups of extreme poverty 

00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:48.460
 With an unprecedented rate and speed of human history, and these achievements have been achieved 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.931
 For example, in 2000, the United Nations Organization 

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:59.753
 To reduce poverty between 2000 and 2015 and the targets were achieved by 2013 

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:03.103
 There is an escalation in the large disparity in income levels in many countries 

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:07.154
 This can be heard from sharp political debates but generally 

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:11.805
 The level of public income is rising and this is very great 

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:15.407
 In fact, we can achieve what we have achieved doubling times to an unknown extent 

00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:17.977
 If nations unite and unite their efforts to achieve and achieve a specific goal 

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:24.588
 Because in my experience we only use about one-fifty percent of our capabilities 

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:27.958
 You can deduce it yourself, so I asked what the university students were asking 

00:02:28.178 --> 00:02:32.459
 How many hours of your time are wasted in the day or the number of hours you lose per week 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:36.320
 The usual answer is about 4 to 6 hours a day 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.112
 These hours are lost between the useless study, watching videos 

00:02:40.112 --> 00:02:43.232
 On YouTube and the wonder watching videos is not just not a desire 

00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:46.745
 They watch them and do not even care about their content and that after seeing them feel 

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:50.118
 Regretfully because they saw her and in this story is lost about 4 hours 

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.665
 This total is about 20 to 25 hours a week 

00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:54.665
 About 100 hours per month 

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.225
 This is equivalent to two and a half working weeks, half a year of work per year 

00:02:57.726 --> 00:03:01.056
 Even if the working hour was estimated at $ 20 and is undoubtedly much more than that 

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:05.287
 Probably up to $ 50 if you consider deferred payment of salaries 

00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:10.498
 If you put 20 hours a week, you lose about $ 50,000 a year 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.319
 You are really doing it 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.119
 And because you are unemployed, you lose fifty thousand dollars a year 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.851
 You are a greater and greater disaster than I have done 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.016
 Because I will not stay on earth as much as you will stay 

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:25.032
 So if your life is not as good as it can be 

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.752
 Ask yourself then what will happen if you stop wasting time and opportunities 

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.082
 Then you will know how effective and accomplished it will be 

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.644
 Likely to double to ten 

00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:37.305
 Fold or more than twenty times what you are now 

00:03:37.528 --> 00:03:40.333
 On Pareto's principle, it is not possible to predict the ability and effectiveness that people will have 

00:03:40.544 --> 00:03:43.836
 Their ability and effectiveness will exceed the boundaries so that they are difficult to count 

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:48.016
 If we were to meet as a nation and unite our efforts, we would also stop spoiling things 

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:51.547
 Because this is something that people follow all the time 

00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:54.620
 That is, they are not only doing what needs to be done to improve things 

00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:56.876
 They deliberately seek to make things worse 

00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:00.998
 Whether it is because they are hateful, resentful, arrogant, deceptive, or 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:05.680
 Criminals or thugs or all of the above 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.190
 Mixed, mixed and interconnected 

00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.031
 If people really stop making things worse, then we do not know how much 

00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:17.153
 The great improvement we will see just by stopping corruption 

00:04:17.873 --> 00:04:21.183
 There is such a remarkable interdependence and congruence with our reality 

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:25.153
 Between both human weakness and society's imposed provisions and which as a whole are considered a cause 

00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:29.244
 President in the suffering and also the failure of the individual to assume responsibilities 

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:32.485
 Responsibilities that he himself is aware of must bear 

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:35.316
 There is something else that deserves our consideration and it is one of the things that have a stake in 

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:39.306
 The discussions I offer to university students 

00:04:40.897 --> 00:04:46.228
 As you know there is in our midst that thing called conscience and this conscience expresses 

00:04:46.938 --> 00:04:51.439
 About himself with a sense or whispering voice 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:56.240
 Who comes without timely introductions before offering a crap 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.340
 Advising you not to take this foolish act 

00:04:59.722 --> 00:05:02.522
 Then you can ignore his advice and choose to submit to your action 

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:06.883
 But what to do is what you have been warned to do 

00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:10.893
 Above your head are the consequences that your conscience warns you of and then feels foolish about what you have offered 

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:14.657
 The consequences will be less painful if these happen to you by accident 

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:17.625
 Because you are the one who caused harm to yourself because you were aware of the price of taking that foolishness 

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:20.036
 You have been alerted to the consequences 

00:05:20.086 --> 00:05:22.266
 But above all, she ignored everything and insisted on walking 

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:25.177
 The wonder is also in our complete ignorance of the source of conscience 

00:05:25.177 --> 00:05:27.649
 And its presence in our inner and our senses, and we have no idea about this 

00:05:28.207 --> 00:05:30.087
 And you may wonder if I have committed myself to the conscience of five 

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:32.848
 Or ten years what will happen to him at the time and what will be the status of the family 

00:05:32.948 --> 00:05:36.719
 Which I will be and how will my social relations be and you should consider 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:41.879
 The human relations that you make up on your own basis will be deeper and stronger 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.150
 Of the ones you pose as you wear the mask 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.983
 However, the person who is dealing with you and with you has a relationship 

00:05:53.983 --> 00:05:57.074
 Will deal with you on what you are, whether on the level of good or even catastrophic aspects 

00:05:57.074 --> 00:06:00.383
 This is a difficult amount but you can build a ground of understanding 

00:06:00.384 --> 00:06:04.755
 Because your relationship is based on your own truth, there is scope to create this ground, but it can build 

00:06:04.775 --> 00:06:08.475
 This means that you live on your truth and that you can create a healthy environment in your life and this in itself 

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:11.535
 A good foundation for a decision like having a child 

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:14.966
 Because then you can build a real and solid relationship with them instead of bringing them to cause them 

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:19.526
 Severe suffering Unfortunately, this is happening in many cases against children 

00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:27.033
 The truth is deeper than that, because that is what I will conclude with 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.388
 This is why I want to present some of what the nihilists wrote about sociology 

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:34.771
 Because, as you have seen, your destiny as the individual of your destiny is not only linked to you and what 

00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:40.221
 If you achieve your compatibility with yourself and work to fix it, it is not dependent on your destiny as an individual and only 

00:06:41.147 --> 00:06:45.599
 Your destiny is tied to the fate of those around you and those who are related to them and can say there 

00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:50.044
 Nine billion people in the world by the way we will reach the limits of this figure and then the population will decrease 

00:06:50.114 --> 00:06:54.614
 To return to seven billion people you will wonder who you are, you are just an atom 

00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:58.944
 Central dust is 7 billion people so that's why 

00:06:58.944 --> 00:07:02.756
 Which makes me see my decisions and actions very important but this perception and this concept is wrong 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:10.368
 Rather, the closest thing to the truth is that you are a meeting point in a network that is interconnected 

00:07:10.535 --> 00:07:13.488
 Of course, modern means of communication reinforce this 

00:07:13.718 --> 00:07:16.954
 For example, you know at least a thousand people throughout your life 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:19.419
 These people each know a thousand people 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:22.230
 It means that between you and a million people is just one person 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.211
 By connecting two people, you connect to a billion-person network of knowledge 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.302
 It follows that your actions are not isolated but rather extended 

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:31.351
 It is like falling gravel in a pond that results in successive waves 

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:33.922
 That is, what you do exceeds your surroundings and reach the orbits 

00:07:33.922 --> 00:07:36.298
 It is difficult for you to even absorb its consequences and effects 

00:07:36.298 --> 00:07:38.843
 This requires that what you do or even avoid doing 

00:07:38.844 --> 00:07:40.825
 All of them are of greater importance and consequences than you think 

00:07:41.962 --> 00:07:45.545
 Taking this into account and thinking about it sign the individual responsibility so that each 

00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:48.777
 An act of his actions must be weighed, and you can say, but there is a meaning in this perspective and that is better 

00:07:48.817 --> 00:07:52.392
 To live a life of worthlessness 

00:07:52.907 --> 00:07:55.852
 But ask yourself honestly if you had the option 

00:07:56.118 --> 00:07:59.938
 Between living a life where you have no responsibilities and having no value 

00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:04.280
 Or reflect the equation and live a life of the same 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.978
 Meaning and value and bear the responsibilities associated with everything 

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:11.131
 As a personal image it does not seem obvious to me that people will choose 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.211
 Life associated with the meaning, can say but the nihilists 

00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:17.623
 They live in misery because of the lack of meaning of life and they are suffering pain 

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:21.324
 Yes, but there are advantages that characterize the nihilistic life of the absence of any responsibilities and this is the price of suffering 

00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:24.253
 I imagine that it can also be motivated to choose nihilistic life 

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.713
 You can say that your adoption of nihilistic view is not a choice 

00:08:26.713 --> 00:08:28.651
 But as a result of the collapse of values ​​and cosmic view 

00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:33.115
 Which you believe in, and yes it is possible if you allow it to collapse because it is easier than resistance 

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.967
 And what the price is suffering is worthless and you can then develop sympathy and compassion of people 

00:08:37.217 --> 00:08:40.708
 You and you also have the option to live the role of the victim, a role if we look at him altogether 

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:45.239
 It is not a bad choice, especially since the alternative is confrontation by dealing with reality and its obligations 

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:49.380
 And to follow the dictates of conscience, and the truth Solzhenitsen 

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.423
 He and others predicted that even though it is one of the most important personalities of that people 

00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:01.793
 In the 20th century, if they had lived a life where conscience does not exist, they would poison society 

00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:05.615
 And if there were a large number going according to this corrupt approach then you will see hell 

00:09:05.615 --> 00:09:11.124
 You will see hell with your own eyes and you can read the Gulag Archipelago if you like 

00:09:11.124 --> 00:09:15.293
 And you'll see a time when hell embodies the earth, and you can 

00:09:15.293 --> 00:09:19.614
 Decide if you have the desire to visit so place 

00:09:19.614 --> 00:09:24.486
 Or even this is the most important place where your family and friends take it 

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:27.077
 Unfortunately, part of that transformation happens in the 20th century.
