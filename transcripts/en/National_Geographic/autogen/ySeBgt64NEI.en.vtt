00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:14.839
in the end one Bryant Park tower will
stand tall 365 meters high

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.480
 
when it is fully operational the tower

when it is fully operational the tower
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.800
when it is fully operational the tower
will be one of the greenest in the world

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810
will be one of the greenest in the world
 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.130
will be one of the greenest in the world
and it may be leading the way into our

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
and it may be leading the way into our
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.140
and it may be leading the way into our
urban future

its occupants will benefit as well they
will have a healthier environment they

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070
will have a healthier environment they
 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.479
will have a healthier environment they
will have clean air to breathe they will

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
will have clean air to breathe they will
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.340
will have clean air to breathe they will
be in an environment that they can feel

be in an environment that they can feel
not only proud about but we will be

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910
not only proud about but we will be

environment to be in and this is a good
 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.180

blueprint for the future but with the
 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.729
blueprint for the future but with the
high cost of building green and with

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739
high cost of building green and with
 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.240
high cost of building green and with
global temperatures rising can one

Bryant Park are finding their way into
 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.390
Bryant Park are finding their way into
other buildings already and in another

few years we'll see lots and lots of

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260
few years we'll see lots and lots of
 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.790

things like it I don't think there's any

question but that we're at a tipping
 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.240
question but that we're at a tipping
point maybe we've crossed it we're

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250
point maybe we've crossed it we're
 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.570
point maybe we've crossed it we're
already over the line the goal was to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580
already over the line the goal was to
 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.520
already over the line the goal was to
create the greenest building we possibly

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530
create the greenest building we possibly
 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.469

could so people are watching carefully

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479
could so people are watching carefully
 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.870

like gee how did the Bank of America

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880
like gee how did the Bank of America
 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.270
like gee how did the Bank of America
decide to spend the money to do a

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280
decide to spend the money to do a
 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.400
decide to spend the money to do a
seriously green building and in that

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410
seriously green building and in that
 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.440
seriously green building and in that
small way I hope that the building will

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450
small way I hope that the building will
 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.600
small way I hope that the building will
be a trigger for lots of other projects

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610
be a trigger for lots of other projects
 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.020
be a trigger for lots of other projects
around the country and around the world
