00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.190
So we have this equation
right over here.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.380
12 to the negative 2
power, times 1 over 72

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.520
to the fifth power, is equal
to 2 to the a power times 3

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.440
to the b power.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.760
And what I want you to do
now is pause this video

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.850
and find values of a and b that
satisfy this equation, where

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.520
a and b are two integers.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.360
And I encourage you to use
all of the exponent properties

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.780
that we have now learned
in order to tackle this.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.810
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.360
so now we can work
through this together.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.130
So what I'm going to try to do,
is get these numbers, like 12,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.640
and these numbers
like 72, I want

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.860
to express them as products
of powers of 2 and powers of 3

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.930
So 12, for example, is
equivalent to 3 times 4.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.980
So I could write
this as 3 times 4.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.050
And all of that is going to be
raised to the negative 2 power.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.670
Now, why am I
interested in 3 times 4?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.150
Well, 3 is clearly a power of 3,
and 4 is clearly a power of 2.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.610
This is 2 squared,
we're actually

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.120
going to write it as
2 squared in a second.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.090
So this is 3 times 4 to
the negative 2 power.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.750
And then 1 over 72
could be rewritten

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.850
as-- so it's going to be
times-- 1 over 8 times 9,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.110
72 is 8 times 9.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.220
8 is a power of 2,
9 is a power of 3

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.230
And, of course, we're going to
raise that, to the fifth power.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.950
And that's going to be equal to
2 to the a, times 3 to the b.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.350
I'm just going to keep trying
to simplify the left hand,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.710
in terms of powers
of 2 and 3, and then

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.510
see if we can match what a and
b need to actually be equal to.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.800
So let's look at
this right over here.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.180
So this, if we have the
product of two numbers raised

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.590
to an exponent, we know
from our exponent properties

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.930
that this is going to be
each of those numbers, raised

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.820
to the exponent,
the product of that.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.479
Or the product of each of those
numbers raised to the exponent.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.230
So it's going to be 3
to the negative 2 times

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.570
4 to the negative 2 power.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.596
And now this right
over here, before,

00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:20.970
let me just rewrite
it like this,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:31.100
this is going to be
the same thing, times 1

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.115
over 8 times 1 over 9.

00:02:35.115 --> 00:02:39.620
And we're going to raise
that to the fifth power.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.240
Now 3 to the negative 2,
we could just keep as 3

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.009
to the negative 2.

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.800
That seems like a nice
form to leave it in.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.460
So let me write that as 3
to the negative 2 power.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.440
Now what is 4 to the
negative 2 power?

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.850
Well, 4 is the same
thing as 2 squared.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.896
So it's going to be times
2 squared to the negative 2

00:03:00.896 --> 00:03:01.395
power.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.590
Now what is 1 over 8?

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.300
What is 1/8?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.160
You could view this as 8
to the negative 1 power.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.050
Or you could view
this as 1 over 2

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.790
to the third power, which
is the same thing as 2

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.449
to the negative 3 power.

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.240
And these are consistent,
because remember,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.640
8 is the same thing
as 2 to the third.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.730
So this is 2 to the
third to the negative 1

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.430
power, which is 2 to the
3 times negative 1, which

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.650
is 2 to the negative 3 power.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.640
So 1/8 is 2 to the
negative third power.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.430
And by that same logic,
1/9 is equal to 9

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.150
to the negative 1 power.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.850
Or you could view it as 1 over
3 squared, which is equal to 3

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.350
to the negative 2.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.510
And these, once again,
are consistent because 9

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.840
is 3 squared, and you're raising
it to the negative 1 power.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.530
So, once again, that's 3
to the 2 times negative 1,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.570
3 to the negative 2 power.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.290
So this is going to be equal
to-- we're raising everything

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.460
to the fifth power.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.940
So 1/8, we just established,
is the same thing.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.480
1/8 we just-- having trouble
changing colors-- established

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.970
is 2 to the negative 3 power.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.310
And 1/9-- I'm running
out of colors--

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.060
is 3 to the negative 2 power.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.470
So let's keep simplifying this.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.840
We have our 3 to the
negative 2 power.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.580
Now this part
right over here-- I

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.360
could introduce purple
again-- that part,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.520
that's 2 to the
second power, and then

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.020
that raised to the
negative 2 power.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.682
Well, we've already seen, that's
the same thing as taking 2

00:04:52.682 --> 00:04:55.090
to the product of
these two exponents.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.930
2 times negative 2
is negative 4 power.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.400
And then, we're going
to take each of these,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.700
we've already seen, taking
the product of two numbers

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.400
and raising it to
an exponent, that's

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.126
the same thing as
taking each of those,

00:05:08.126 --> 00:05:10.500
raising it to the exponent,
or taking the product of each

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.290
of those, raised
to the exponent.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.430
So it's going to be
times 2 to the negative 3

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.480
raised to the fifth power.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.510
Times, we're in the
home stretch, times 3

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.410
to the negative 2 raised
to the fifth power.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.230
So once again, this is going to
be 3 to the negative 2 times 2

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.830
to the negative 4, I
think you see the end now.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.800
And now what is this?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.604
2 to the negative 3
to the fifth, and then

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:40.020
that raised to the
fifth, well, we

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.230
multiply these two exponents.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.340
That's going to be 2 to
the negative 15, times 2

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.850
to the negative 15 power, and
then what is this going to be?

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.510
Negative 2 times
5 is negative 10.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.880
So this is going to be 3
to the negative 10th power.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.210
And so, what's this
going to be equal to?

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.500
Well if we multiply this one--
let me introduce a new color--

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.820
if we multiply 3 to the negative
2, times 3 to the negative 10,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.640
we have the same base, we
would add the exponents.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.930
So that's going to be 3 to the
negative 2 plus negative 10,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.300
which is the
negative 12th power.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.330
And then we have a 2
to the negative 4 times

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.710
2 to the negative 15.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.715
That's going to be 2 to
the negative 19th power.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.466
And we want that to be
equal to 2 to the a.

00:06:31.466 --> 00:06:33.840
Now, we go to the beginning,
moving back to our equation,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:46.280
we want that to be equal to
2 to the a times 3 to the b.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.440
Well, we have 2 to the
negative 19th power,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.220
so let's let a equal
to negative 19.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.850
And we have 3 to
the negative 12,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.050
so let's set b is
equal to negative 12.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.960
And we are done.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.280
So all we did, this was just
an aggressive application

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.154
of pretty much all of
the exponent properties

00:07:11.154 --> 00:07:12.820
that we actually know,
and it's actually

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.476
kind of a satisfying problem.
