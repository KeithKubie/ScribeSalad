00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.640
DC's live-action Suicide Squad split comic
fans down the middle, but no matter how people

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.219
felt about Jared Leto's Joker, nearly everyone
agreed: they wanted more - and apparently,

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:14.720
they were originally going to get it.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.210
With hours of Joker footage on the cutting
room floor, we've broken down some of the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.120
scrapped scenes that we think would have made
the movie better.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.710
Give the video a Like if you think these Joker
moments deserve to be seen, or should have

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.610
been included in the actual movie!

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.690
Here are 10 Deleted Suicide Squad Joker Scenes
That Would Have Changed Everything.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.030
Joker’s Jailbreak

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.329
Audiences never got to see the specifics of
Joker's breakout of Arkham Asylum, only when

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.390
he showed up to fry Harley's brain.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.500
But the sequence originally included Joker
killing someone offscreen with a baseball

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
bat.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.100
That explains how Harley got her signature
weapon, taking the bat for herself, and turning

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.309
every cracked skull into a love letter to
"Mr. J."

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.010
Joker’s Therapy

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.150
You might not get the impression that Dr.
Quinzel ("Quinn-zell") actually helped Joker

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.219
with her treatment, but a scene restored in
the Extended Cut says otherwise.

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.899
Joker actually gets his revenge for the "faded
memories" Harley brought back, leaving him

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:10.369
confused and angry.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.579
It explains how the electrocution is actually
payback, and shows THIS Joker is the product

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.990
of some past trauma.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:26.270
He has an origin story - and Harley's one
of the few who knows it.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.539
Letting Harley Live

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.789
The movie leaps from Harley getting shocked
to the pair's manic romance, but a separate

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.149
scene was filmed to show Joker leaving.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.479
Just as his trusted henchman pulls a gun to
kill Harley, Joker stops him with a wagging

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.479
finger.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.360
The moment reveals Joker feels SOMETHING for
Harley.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.349
At least, it explains why SHE thinks she's
someone special to the infamous gangster.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:53.799
Joker &amp; Monster T

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.349
Fans spun some wild theories about the DC
character played by Common, but his role turned

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.779
out to be a short one, killed after a single
scene with Joker.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.520
The original scene was filmed to include more
interaction between the two, showing an actual

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.060
bond being formed between the gangsters before
the wrong word spun Joker out of control.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.660
The longer scene made it clear Joker and Harley
were "playing with their food."

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.840
The watches of their previous victims can
even be seen on Harley's arm.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.120
A Killer Delivery

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.410
Audiences are as surprised as the Van Criss
security guard when a bomb blows up in his

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.610
face, but a longer version of the scene was
filmed in which Joker realize the guard is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.590
alive, and kills him with his bare hands and
a one-liner.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.840
Since the Joker doesn't actually kill anyone
for the fun of it in the movie, this scene

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:48.310
proves that just like the comics, he kills
when he pleases - or if there's a joke involved.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.650
Predator Becomes The Prey

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.220
Fans got plenty of looks at a stunt involving
actress Margot Robbie on a motorcycle, but

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.510
the scene was more than just added action.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.930
It showed Dr. Qinzel chasing Joker down, refusing
to give up on the love of her life.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.510
The Joker tries to get rid of her, claiming
he isn't someone to be loved - doubling down

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.750
on the idea that he rose above his past, imagining
himself as an idea, and not a man.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.600
His past is still a mystery, but he definitely
didn't FORCE Harley into becoming his sidekick,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.850
which some people claimed was the message
being sent.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.040
Harley Shot First

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.640
When the Joker tries to talk Harley out of
loving him, a trucker shows up to interrupt.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.650
Harley pulls the Joker's gun and kills the
bystander without a second's thought.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.490
Joker's usually the homicidal one of the pair,
but even he says it was a bad idea, proving

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.540
the point Amanda Waller makes when introducing
Harley, claiming she's every bit as dangerous

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.820
as the Joker, but loving him has made her
downright crazy.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.500
Joker’s Gang

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.200
The Joker's henchmen are predictably weird,
dressed in goat heads, baby masks, and of

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.000
course, a lovable Panda suit.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.170
But when the plan was to spend more time in
Joker and Harley's world, the infamous Panda

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.970
Man was actually a fully-developed character,
played by actor James McGowan.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.360
The white and black color scheme was even
going to be carried over to his wardrobe in

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.050
the form of real-world "dazzle camo," used
to confuse enemy ships during World War II

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.200
(Google it, crazy stuff).

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.410
Even when it came to his goons' clothing,
Joker was waging psychological warfare on

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.000
his own enemies.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.970
Harley’s Classic Costume

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.969
Batman fans held their breath hoping to see
Margot Robbie wearing Harley's classic Jester

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.520
costume in live-action, but it wasn't meant
to be.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.279
The filmmakers were clearly determined not
to disappoint the fans, since set photos show

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.350
the jester suit was going to appear on a mannequin
in Joker's apartment, explaining why Harley

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.789
couldn't wear it in the field.

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.249
The suit wasn't included in the scene, so
it wound up added into the couple's comic-accurate

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.810
introduction, and in Harley's personal effects
when suiting up for the mission as a consolation

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.880
prize.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.749
Joker’s Smoke Grenade

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:51.539
The audience knew something had changed when
the shots of Joker half-burned and pulling

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.490
the pin on a grenade from the trailers were
nowhere to be found.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.979
The shots are apparently pulled from the movie's
original ending, when Joker returned from

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.700
the helicopter crash to rescue Harley - who
chose to stay with her friends instead.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.610
We don't know WHY the change was made, but
it did give the movie a more surprising ending,

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.270
with Joker returning from the dead to break
Harley out of Belle Reve.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.169
Conclusion

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.830
Those are only the deleted Joker scenes that
have been revealed so far, but they're more

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.840
than enough to make Suicide Squad better.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.849
Are there any other scenes you can think of
that shouldn't have been cut?

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.909
