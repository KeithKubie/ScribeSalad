00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Using alpha min, I get a value of 57,400 kilometers.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I've done a little bit of rounding.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And using alpha max, I get a value of 38,700 kilometers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Remember the true value of the circumference is about 40,000 kilometers,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is between these 2 numbers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So actually, using this angular error, we can actually explain away

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
why Eratosthenes made the mistake that he did--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
maybe.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In reality, Syene is only about half a degree north of what's called the Tropic of Cancer.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the Tropic of Cancer is the location where the sun's rays truly are vertical

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
during the summer solstice.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Being half a degree off actually wouldn't be enough to account for Eratosthenes's error,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so we should keep doing our calculation.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Anyways, this was an estimate based on this toy model of a well.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And since I can't go back in time and look down the same well that Eratosthenes did,

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I have no idea of knowing if this estimate is correct.
