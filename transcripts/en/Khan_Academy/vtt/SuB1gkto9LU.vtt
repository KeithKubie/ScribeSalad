00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.740
So that we don't get stumped
by the Arbeglas in our life

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.600
and especially when we don't
have talking birds to help us,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.350
we should be able to
identify when things

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.280
get a little bit weird with
our systems of equations.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.210
When we have scenarios that have
an infinite number of solutions

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.810
or that have no
solutions at all.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.300
And just as a little bit of a
review of what could happen,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.630
these are the-- think
about the three scenarios.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.190
You have the first
scenario which

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.750
is kind of where we started off,
where you have two systems that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.470
just intersect in one place.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.300
And then you have
essentially one solution.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.150
So if you were to
graphically represent it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.650
you have one solution right
over there, one solution.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.580
And this means that the two
constraints are consistent

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.610
and the two constraints are
independent of each other.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.640
They're not the exact same line,
consistent and independent.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.712
Then you have the other scenario
where they're consistent,

00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:05.920
they intersect,but they're
essentially the same line.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.310
They intersect everywhere.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.312
So this is one of the
constraints for one

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:10.770
of the equations,
and the other one

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.440
if you look at it,
if you graph it,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.740
it is actually the
exact same one.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.650
So here you have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.820
It's consistent, you
do have solutions here,

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.810
but they're dependent equations.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.390
It's a dependent system.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.310
And then the last
scenario, and this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.190
is when you're dealing
in two dimensions,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.910
the last scenario is where
your two constraints just

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.670
don't intersect with each other.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.830
One might look like
this, and then the other

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.550
might look like this.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.620
They have the exact
same slope but they

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.440
have different intercepts.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.650
So this there is no solution,
they never intersect.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.125
And we call this an
inconsistent system.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.700
And if you wanted to think
about what would happen just

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.640
think about what's
going on here.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.715
Here you have different slopes.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.640
And if you think about
it, two different lines

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.520
with different
slopes are definitely

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.120
going to intersect
in exactly one place.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:28.270
Here they have the same
slope and same y-intercept,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.250
so you have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.670
Here you have the same slope
but different y-intercepts,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.520
and you get no solutions.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.260
So the times when
you're solving systems

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.260
where things are going
to get a little bit weird

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.820
are when you have
the same slope.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.100
And if you think about it,
what defines the slope,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.830
and I encourage you to test this
out with different equations,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.281
is when you have-- if you
have your x's and y's, or you

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.280
have your a's and b's or
you have your variables

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.810
on the same side of
an equation, where

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.600
they have the same ratio
with respect to each other.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.800
So with that, kind of
keeping that in mind,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.350
let's see if we can think
about what types of solutions

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.740
we might find.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.720
So let's take this down.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.430
So they say determine
how many solutions

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.120
exist for the
system of equations.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.610
So you have 10x minus
2y is equal to 4,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.770
and 10x minus 2y is equal to 16.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.190
So just based on what we
just talked about the x's

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.550
and the y's are on the
same side of the equation

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.480
and the ratio is
10 to negative 2.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.270
Same ratio.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.730
So something strange is
going to happen here.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.930
But when we have the
same kind of combination

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.980
of x's and y's in the first one
we get 4, and on the second one

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.950
we get 16.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.915
So that seems a
little bit bizarre.

00:03:43.915 --> 00:03:45.290
Another way to
think about it, we

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.670
have the same number of
x's, the same number of y's

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.997
but we got a different number
on the right hand side.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.080
So if you were to simplify
this, and we could even

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.550
look at the hints
to see what it says,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.133
you'll see that
you're going to end up

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:59.370
with the same slope but
different y-intercepts.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.080
So we convert both the slope
intercept form right over here

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.630
and you see one, the blue one
is y is equal to 5x minus 2,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.630
and the green one is y
is equal to 5x minus 8.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.050
Same slope, same ratio
between the x's and the Y's,

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.290
but you have different
values right over here.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.170
You have different y-intercepts.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.670
So here you have no solutions.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.710
That is this scenario right over
here if you were to graph it.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.610
So no solutions,
check our answer.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.900
Let's go to the next question.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.380
So let's look at this
one right over here.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.600
So we have negative 5 times
x and negative 1 times y.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.400
We have 4 times x and 1 times y.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.329
So it looks like the
ratio if then we're

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:47.620
looking at the x's and y's
always on the left hand side

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.660
right over here, it looks like
the ratios of x's and y's are

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.380
different.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.330
You have essentially
5 x's for every one y,

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.170
or you could say negative 5
x's for every negative 1 y,

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.170
and here you have 4
x's for every 1 y.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.080
So this is fundamentally
a different ratio.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.140
So right off the bat
you could say well these

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.430
are going to intersect
in exactly one place.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.920
If you were to put this
into slope intercept form,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.520
you will see that they
have different slopes.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.380
So you could say
this has one solution

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.960
and you can check your answer.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.040
And you could look at the
solution just to verify.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.780
And I encourage you to do this.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.740
So you see the blue one if you
put in the slope intercept form

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.580
negative 5x plus 10 and
you take the green one

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.040
into slope intercept
form negative 4x minus 8.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.970
So different slopes,
they're definitely

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.310
going to intersect
in exactly one place.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.070
You're going to
have one solution.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.940
Let's try another one.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.180
So here we have 2x plus
y is equal to negative 3.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.160
And this is pretty
clear, you have

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.576
2x plus y is equal
to negative 3.

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:43.890
These are the exact
same equations.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.531
So it's consistent information,
there's definitely solutions.

00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:49.030
But there's an infinite number
of solutions right over here.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.340
This is a dependent system.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.285
So there are infinite
number of solutions here

00:05:53.285 --> 00:05:54.451
and we can check our answer.

00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:56.880
Let's do one more because that
was a little bit too easy.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.629
OK so this is interesting
right over here,

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.560
we have it in different forms.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.580
2x plus y is equal
to negative 4,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.650
y is equal to
negative 2x minus 4.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.260
So let's take this
first blue equation

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.250
and put it into
slope intercept form.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.210
If we did that you would
get, if you just subtract 2x

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.810
from both sides you get y is
equal to negative 2x minus 4,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.980
which is the exact same thing as
this equation right over here.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.510
So once again they're
the exact same equation.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.550
You have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.270
Check our answer, and you can
look at the solution right

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.020
here.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.895
You convert the blue
one into slope intercept

00:06:29.895 --> 00:06:32.100
and you get the exact
same thing as what

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.074
you saw in the green one.
