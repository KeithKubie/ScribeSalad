00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:07.173
Okay, excuse me miss.
I gotta commandeer this vehicle.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.407
Yep.

00:00:08.407 --> 00:00:09.642
I gotta commandeer this vehicle
right now.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.010
I gotta commandeer
this vehicle, alright?

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.144
Y'all have to get out.
Y'all gotta get out.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:13.813
No.
I don't-

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:14.847 align:start position:0%
Y'all gotta get out. Y'all gotta
get out of the car right now.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.315
You know what?

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:17.983
But look. But look. But look.
But look. But look. But look.

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:19.318
Look at it, okay? Look at that.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:20.519
Sir, based on that-

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.454
FBI. FBI. FBI. FBI.
Okay.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:23.823
So y'all gotta get
out of the vehicle.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.057
Let me have the vehicle.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.226
So what is the situation?
Yeah, what-

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.493
Okay, m'am. [crosstalk 00:00:27]
Okay.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.028
Okay, well, let me just ...
Okay.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.396
You don't need to know all
the details of the situation.

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.265
Let me just put a hypothetical
to you though, okay?

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.533
Okay. Alright.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.802
Hypothetically,
there was a dude, okay?

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.137
And perhaps that dude
was in the middle of robbing

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.605
a liquor store, right?

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.975
And maybe he found a safe
and he was like, wow, finally.

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.943
Jackpot. Six liquor stores,
couldn't find the safe.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.079
Finally found a safe. Right?
And he found a safe,

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.514
and the dude was cooperative
and he got the money, right?

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.783
And now that dude
is fleeing the scene

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.151
as fast
as he possibly can, okay?

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.419
And you're trying
to apprehend him?

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:54.820
I gotta catch that dude.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.955
I gotta catch that dude.
I gotta catch that dude.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.189
Okay, what I would say is,

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:58.924
is that that is not
an FBI situation.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.894
That's a police
or a sheriff situation,

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.295
and we have not
gotten that call.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.863
Let me take this one
off your hands.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.131
Well, you know what? I'm gonna
say thank you for the tip ...

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.532
Mm-hmm.
Right, right.

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:07.733
So that we can do our job.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.935
Oh, no, no, no.
Thank you, sir.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.136
That is real good of you.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.504
But did I mention this?

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:13.873
Did I mention this
about said gentleman, okay?

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.142
I don't know
if I had mentioned this.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.478
He is from ...
He's from Kenya.

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:20.813
Sure.
Okay?

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.081
Oh.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.017
Which makes it
an international matter, okay?

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.085
Alright?
He's a Kenyan refugee, alright?

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.653
Okay.

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:30.056
He's gonna take that money
and turn it into Kenyan notes

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.824
and go back to Kenya and take
a bunch of little babies

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:33.026
and bring them back here
and sell them.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:34.294
Okay.
I can't have that.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.561
Alright, you know what?

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.929
Y'all ladies come on out
the vehicle.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.330
No, you know what?
I'm gonna let you come-

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.999
Y'all can move out the vehicle
like this. Here we go.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.300
I'm gonna let you commandeer
this vehicle.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.568
Yeah. I live it.
But in the backseat.

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:43.936
Okay. Alright.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:45.171
Okay? That's fine.
Why don't we just go?

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:46.405
And I'm gonna tell you where we-

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:47.874
You can come down to the station
with us

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.375
and tell us
all about everything.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.543
But before we go to the station,
how about we get as close

00:01:51.543 --> 00:01:53.079
to the state line
as we possibly can?

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.546
I'm gonna say why don't you
give me that again?

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:55.848
Take a look at it.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:57.516
And I'm just gonna hang onto it.

00:01:57.516 --> 00:01:58.851
Okay. Alright. That's fine.
I'm just gonna hang onto it.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:00.953
But I believe I still have
jurisdiction over you

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:04.124
as a member of department
of the treasury.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:10.329
Okay. Yes. Thank the lord. Okay.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.998
Hey baby. What's going on?

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:13.599
Bravo. Thank you
so much for coming.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.702 align:start position:0%
So here's what I wanna make sure
you all understand right now,

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:21.307
right off the top.
I called you to report a crime

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.476
that I don't have nothing
to do with, okay?

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.111
Oh, this is a first.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.548
I'm not involved in the crime.
I didn't perpetrate the crime.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.782
I didn't do anything, okay?
I was-

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.250
Can we get to the crime?

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.052
Yes ma'am. Yes. We can.
I was minding my own ...

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.954
I was walking down
the street, okay?

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.224
And I was indeed, I'm not
gonna lie, I'm a vagabond a bit.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.558
I'm a little bit of a vagabond.

00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:42.361
I was looking for shelter.
I found this vehicle.

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.963
The window was open,
and I climbed in.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.464
I climbed into the car.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.733
Okay, so you called us to tell
us that you climbed into a car?

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.035
Yes. I looked in the trunk,

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.302
and there's something
in the trunk

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.804
that I think may be
of interest to you

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.273
so I made sure
that I called immediately.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.540
Okay.
What's in the trunk?

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.008
What's in the trunk?

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.242
There's a head.
There's a head in the trunk.

00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.512
There's a head.
23-year-old male head.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:02.147
Hypothetically, if I had
severed the head ...

00:03:02.147 --> 00:03:03.349
Yeah, let's get to that.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.583
If I had done it ...

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:05.985
Okay.
Okay?

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.219
Then?

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.921
What would the repercussions be?

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.357
Hypothetically?
Hypothetically?

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.825
Just hypothetically
speaking, let's say I did.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.327
If you had done it?
Let's say I was not me.

00:03:14.327 --> 00:03:15.661
Let's say I was
a different person.

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:17.096
Let's do role ...
Let's play role play.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.364
You be you.
You'll be ... We'll be cops.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.265
I'll be me.
We're gonna be us.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.533
Okay.
Okay.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.767
I'll be me, okay?
Okay.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.269
We would be like, uh, hold on.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.503
Hey, I just cut-

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:26.372
Stop. Freeze.
Stop in the name of the law.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.840
Don't move.
Get them damn guns out my way.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.075
Don't move. Freeze.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.309
I'm crazy. I'm crazy.

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.544
And then we would go, boom!

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:32.745
Boom!
Boom!

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.079
There's a head in that trunk!

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.281
Oh, lord!
That's a head in that trunk!

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.515
And now I'm like, oh,
I'm bleeding.

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:37.750
I'm bleeding.
Oh, there's a head.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.884
I hate you, Jerome.
Why did you betray me?

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.152
Okay, you just said Jerome.

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:41.354
Why did you-

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.855
Stop.
We're not role playing anymore.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.890
We're playing real life.
Why did you say Jerome?

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.960
That's my cousin's name that
had just come to me right now.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.294
Is your cousin living
or is he dead?

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:49.529
Well, when you have handle ...

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.064
Is your cousin living
or is he dead?

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.566
He's living. He is alive.
He is alive with the lord.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:54.834
Alive with the lord.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.536
Get your ass in the car.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.471
Hypothetically speaking,

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.141
you're about to get your salad
tossed in prison.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:07.680
Oh, okay. Well, thank God
it's hypothetical. Okay.

00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.383
I figure if they
call it superman XL,

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:13.052
that's gonna make you
some XL, right?

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:15.254
This (bleep) it's like ...
I don't know what it is.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.424
It doesn't do (bleep)
Oh. What the (bleep).

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:19.726
Pat me down right now. For real.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.093
Pat you down right now?

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:22.728
Pat me down right now.
No, for real. Do this, man.

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:24.029
What?
Pat me down.

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.264
Pat you down right now?
You got to do it, man.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:26.865
Why do I not ...
I don't like ...

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:27.800
There's something about
this I don't like one bit.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.168
Sir, step away
from the car.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.703
Step away from vehicle Okay.
Okay. You want me ...

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:31.937
Step away from the vehicle.
No, no, no. Put your hands down.

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:33.206
Put your hands down
like a normal person.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:34.274
Okay. Alright, I'm gonna
take my hands

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:35.140
out of my pocket
right quick.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.376
Real, real, real slow.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.610
Okay.
Real slow.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.112
Real slow, alright? Okay?

00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:42.148
Y'all understand?
Okay, now look here.

00:04:42.148 --> 00:04:44.083
Now, I wanted to ask you
both a question.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.417
Alright.
Alright.

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.253
About the contents
of my pockets, okay?

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:49.555
Our first question was gonna be,

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.090
do you have any
illicit substances on you?

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.424
Substances in your pockets.
All the sudden this is like

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:53.593
Jeopardy where the question
gets put to us,

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:54.894
and then we have a ...
What the hell?

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:56.195
Now, okay just-
Throw it down. Set these down.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.263
Alright. I'm gonna put this
on the ground.

00:04:57.263 --> 00:04:58.464
Just set them all down.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.665
Set them all down.
Set them all down.

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.100
Should I put my hands back
in my pocket?

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.334
No. This time now let's keep
them up at our sides.

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:03.870
Okay. Alright.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.672
Okay, let me just set up
a scenario for y'all, okay?

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:08.741
A scene, a setting, an example.

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:10.543
He's gonna tell us something.
Yes. Mm-hmm.

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:14.914
A gentleman was careening
down the streets, okay?

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.148
And bumped into me.

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.749
Moving very quickly.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.219
Now listen, man. I don't know
if y'all believe in God,

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.788
but I believe in God, okay?

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.288
And I'm gonna tell you
what happen.

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:27.092
Every one of them bottles
have flown up into the air,

00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:30.162
and they had flown
into my pockets.

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:32.297
And that was God knowing
that I was having ...

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:35.501
I was feeling a little down,
a little blue last week, okay?

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.169
And he provided you
with five Oxycontin bottles.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:38.437
So the lord ...

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:39.706
Provided for me.

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:40.973
Hey, you wanna
throw those on for me?

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.208
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.542
That'd be great. Thanks.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.644
I'll take a half too.
I'll take a half too.

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.378
Nobody in Reno's in Jeopardy.

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:47.847
Oh, you want half?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.348
Oh, you took a whole one?
How much you supposed to take?

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:50.616
Half.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:51.817
Oh.
I'll drive.

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:53.052
Yeah, maybe you should drive.

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:54.253
I'll drive.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:55.520
I'd be more than happy to drive.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.223
You're good. You're good.

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:00.726
Okay, excuse me officers, okay?

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:03.362
I just need to tell you
right now, alright?

00:06:03.362 --> 00:06:04.864
That this is not
what it looks like.

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.866
I came here to ask you
a couple of questions.

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:08.166
Well, go ahead.
Okay.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.869
Okay, yeah,
so hypothetically speaking ...

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.537
Yes?
Hypothetically speaking, okay?

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.839
Make believe.
Make believe, right?

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.073
Okay.
Make believe.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.574
Make believe.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:18.711
If one were to come across a
wheel barrel like this, okay?

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:19.979
Yeah.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.815
And this wheel barrel
may have been involved

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.950
in some kind
of illicit activity

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.053
that may involve two
or three people wearing masks

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:31.190
and one of them may happen
to work at the Metro Casino.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.825
That's neither here nor there.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:35.361
I came diligently
looking for you.

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.896
Thank God I ...
I won't touch you officer,

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:41.534
but if I could I would hug you.
Looking for you just to show you

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:45.171
that this could indeed
be contraband involving people.

00:06:46.138 --> 00:06:47.407
Let me ask you this.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:49.074
If indeed this
was contraband ...

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:50.309
Yes.

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:52.244
And it were involving people ...

00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:53.546
Yes.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.581
Would all of the people
he involved,

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:56.982
would they all get in trouble?

00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:58.684
Yes.

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.424
That's what they're born to do.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:12.531
Yeah, I'm sorry. Them windows
don't roll down back there.

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.966
Let me guess now. Let me guess.

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:17.269
Is that muskrat?
Muskrat? Is that ...

00:07:17.903 --> 00:07:20.039
Damn. You done this before?
That is muskrat.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.273
I think I might have ...

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:24.577
It might be some
subtle hints of elk.

00:07:25.878 --> 00:07:27.814
Uh, Damn. You should
join the carnival, boy.

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.181
Yeah, I mean,
you know sometime ...

00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:30.682
You got elk in the trunk.
You got two muskrat.

00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:31.917
Two muskrat? Okay.

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.118
You got a couple of beaver,

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:34.420
and I think it used
to be possum,

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.621
but honestly
I can't tell no more.

00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:38.090
There's a little bit
of possum in there.

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.826
I can smell the possum,
just a touch, a touch of possum.

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.895
Playful, but robust,
you know what I mean?

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:44.263
Yeah.
I'll get the air conditioning.

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:45.664
Oh, no. Yeah.
Air conditioner's busted.

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:47.033
Make sure ...
Don't put it on recycle.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.567
Put it on the air
that's coming in.

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.835
Oh, it's busted anyway.
Okay.

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:51.169
Sorry about that.

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.272
Alright. Well, maybe
that's for the better.

00:07:56.975 --> 00:07:58.343
You got him, Jim?

00:07:58.343 --> 00:07:59.544
Son of a bitch.

00:07:59.544 --> 00:08:01.079
You got him?

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.782
I lost him.

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:04.917
Hey guys. How you doing?

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.385
Hey, hold on! Freeze! Freeze!
Freeze!

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.553
Hey!
Freeze!

00:08:07.553 --> 00:08:08.854
Freeze!
Hold on right there.

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:10.055
Good God.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.790
Other hand where I can see it.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.892
Step out of the boat.
Step out of the boat.

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.227
Why were you running?

00:08:15.227 --> 00:08:16.395
I wasn't running.
I wasn't running.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:18.597
I was relaxing.
I was taking a repose.

00:08:18.597 --> 00:08:19.965
You were taking a repose?

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:21.800
In the boat. Yeah.
That's all I was doing.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.536
You guys think that I was
running from you?

00:08:23.536 --> 00:08:24.870
Yes.
Yes.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.372
You were running from us.
Why were you running?

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:27.606
And we were chasing you.

00:08:27.606 --> 00:08:29.642
No. No, no. Okay, let me ...
Can I ask ...

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:31.410
May I make an inquiry?
May I make a ...

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.045
Can I ask a question?
I'm not gonna ... (bleep)

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.580
You know what? I wish you would
so I can catch my breath.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.814
Hands on your head.
Hands on your head.

00:08:35.814 --> 00:08:37.049
Okay, hypothetically
speaking ...

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.317
Yes.
Yes.

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:40.953
Alright? If you did indeed
see me ...

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.454
Yes?

00:08:42.454 --> 00:08:45.124
Are you sure that I was not
running with you behind me

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:47.493
in the intention
of showing you a crime scene?

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:49.060
Is that what ...
Was that your intention?

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.529
That is exactly what I was
doing because ...

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:51.997
What would-

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:53.532
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You were running from us.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:54.866
We said, Freeze.

00:08:54.866 --> 00:08:56.568
Stop. Get on the ground.
Get on the ground,"

00:08:56.568 --> 00:08:58.870
and you didn't because
you were leading us ...

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.239
Leading us to a crime scene?

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:01.473
Quickly to a crime scene?

00:09:01.473 --> 00:09:03.475
Right. And I figured
if I continued to run

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:05.011
at the pace
I was running,

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.679
you guys would get there before
said crime was perpetrated.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.082
But you got so far ahead of us
that you thought

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:12.050
you'd take a rest,
so you jumped in the boat?

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.486
In the boat?

00:09:13.486 --> 00:09:14.954
That's my 380 right there.
This is yours? Mm-hmm.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:16.422
This is your Beretta 380?
Correct.

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:18.924
So you're saying right now
to me this is yours?

00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:20.592
That's your gun?
That is indeed my weapon.

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:22.460
So you were running? Mm-hmm.
We were chasing you ...

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.795
I said, "Put it down,
put it down, put it down."

00:09:23.795 --> 00:09:25.063
And you did throw a weapon down?

00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:26.565
And you threw it?
Right.

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:29.368
Because I felt that the chase
was not spicy enough, you know?

00:09:29.368 --> 00:09:30.836
I felt like I really needed
you guys

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.504
to step it up in pursuit of me.
I'll tell you what

00:09:32.504 --> 00:09:34.139
So that we could get to
the crime when it's happening?

00:09:34.139 --> 00:09:35.540
Absolutely.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.376
If this is spicy enough for you,
I literally (bleep)

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:38.644
my pants
about a mile ago.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:40.012
Perfect. See?

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:43.715
Once again, would you
rather have me in a pronated

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:45.384
or a supinated
position?
