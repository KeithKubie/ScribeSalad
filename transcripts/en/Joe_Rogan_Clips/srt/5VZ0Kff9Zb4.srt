1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,600
Pocket damage. We were terrified. Jamie,

2
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:07,590
you were telling me about w w what was
the rap concert where the girl got on

3
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:12,240
stage and she was saying, yeah, the
Kendrick Lamar concert, which uh,

4
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:14,310
so I guess this was a
song that happens a lot.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,490
You can see lots of videos of
the crowds singing all the words,

6
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:21,900
which has a lot of N words
in it, including white
people in the crowd. Correct.

7
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:24,330
Yeah, lots of, well that's the
way. Mainly white. Yeah. So, uh,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,730
it has videos of Alabama.
Yeah, I'll, I'll pull one up.

9
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,750
I was never talking about cops in
Alabama. The hangout Fest, right.

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,440
Little girl up on a stage.
She was obviously drunk.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,960
I like kind of almost
set her up to, to do it.

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,150
And as soon as she said like
two or three times he stopped,

13
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:39,720
it stopped the whole thing. Well,
what, what did she say reference to?

14
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,040
It's in the song. So she sits on
[inaudible], she was doing like karaoke,

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,060
like a song lyric. I'll pull up the
videos and then he turned on her.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,450
Oh no, no, no, no. That's not for you.
That's only for me. Oh wait, wait, wait,

17
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,930
wait, wait. Yeah. That's
meme having her up.

18
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,990
I had a bit from 2009 yeah.

19
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:05,580
My a spike TV special. Hold on
here. A woman gets on stage.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,073
You ready?

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,810
Oh, she's going to do it. Oh my God.
She's just, he set her up. Yeah.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,823
It's terrible.

23
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,720
He's mocking her already. Yeah.

24
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,530
Wow. She must be so now

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,240
we play in this. Get pulled.

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,800
Jesus Christ. Wait, wait, wait.

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,070
That's terrible. It's crazy,

28
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,720
bro. You have to park. You got a
bleak one. Single word. Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,160
I'm stuck. Sorry.

30
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,570
His ass get off there. They're
all of the thumbs down. Get off.

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,310
You said the noise and he says that
we love, you can't say the noise.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,820
That's mostly it. Meme

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,040
in hilarious and preposterous
times. I mean that

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,900
is so strange. That is his song. Yeah.
He wrote his song. He wrote the words.

35
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,130
She loves him. She loves him. She's at
his concert. He gave her the microphone,

36
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,180
played the song.

37
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,220
She's singing the song that
he loves that he wrote.

38
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,390
Now audience loves and everybody's
like, you did the wrong thing.

39
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,140
You made the noise. So wow

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,850
man. [inaudible] crowd doing it though.

41
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,730
This whole crowd is looks
mostly white girls screaming.

42
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,410
Okay, so how's that word? Got
a double standard. I don't,

43
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:43,500
this is why I stay at home. Wait
a minute. How does that work?

44
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:48,060
So there's a lot of people
there. Yeah, you can do it.

45
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,760
You can do it if there's a
bunch of people there. Yeah,

46
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,190
but you can't do it if
you're by yourself. No.

47
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,400
Onstage by herself in front of
those people. You can't do it.

48
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,300
But if you're in with them you could
do it. Yes. And that was mostly white.

49
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:02,730
That was a lot of white there.
And of course in that one,

50
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:07,020
white people were ridiculous. So
confused. So confused. I mean,

51
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,810
this is a strange time. I
was going to say I did this,

52
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:12,330
a spike TV special in
2009 and there was a,

53
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,290
do you remember that old
commercial with a, the girl,

54
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,530
the girl comes home and her dog
started talking to her like Lindsey,

55
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,340
I really wish you wouldn't smoke pot.
You're not the senior. You smoke pot in a,

56
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,350
I miss my friend. I had this
whole thing where I was like,

57
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,820
I was like, first of all, whatever
that chick's on, she's not on pot.

58
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,530
Cause if you were on pot, you'd be like,
wait a minute, my fucking dog can talk.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,260
All right, how long have you
been able to talk to God?

60
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,830
You my whole fucking life. Your whole
life. This is the first shit you said,

61
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,881
right? You know,

62
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:49,881
and I went through this whole thing and
I called my dog a faggot and I'm this

63
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,700
guy. This was like in the beginning
of political correctness, right?

64
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,320
Cause it was 2009 he, this is
a gay guy said to me, he goes,

65
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,120
you can't say that word. That's
our n****r. That's our word. Right?

66
00:05:03,121 --> 00:05:05,820
That's what he said. Right. He
literally said, I go, wait a minute.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,690
What did you just say? And he said
it again. He said, it's our n****r.

68
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,360
We're allowed to say it.
You can't say it. I go,

69
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,130
that's the gay shit I've ever heard.
And he started laughing. I go,

70
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:21,740
that's so crazy. I go, I'm
talking to a dog. I'm talking,

71
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,380
I'm angry at a dog because I've
had this dog my whole life.

72
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,380
His first words out of his mouth. I
tell you I love you every day and,

73
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:33,540
and what do you say? You say, I wish you
wouldn't smoke weed. Fuck you stupid.

74
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,410
I smoke weed and I go to work and I
pay for your food faggot. That was,

75
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,600
that was the joke and he
got, he got like, I'm like,

76
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,940
these rules are preposterous,

77
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,660
isn't it supposed to be about intent
of kids and it's supposed to be a bike.

78
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,930
I'm supposed to be conveying how I feel
and the words are supposed to mirror my

79
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:59,240
thoughts. Right? Like when you
have magic that you can't say,

80
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,190
and in this case with the N word,

81
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:04,370
it's even crazier because it's
like some people could say it,

82
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:09,050
you could say it sometimes. Sometimes
you can't say it, it's too heavy.

83
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,870
But black people could
say it, why people can't.

84
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,810
But why people can say it if we're in
the crowd and they're yelling it out,

85
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,700
but as long as it's an a on the end of it.

86
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,110
Yeah, right, exactly. The ER
is what gets you in trouble.

87
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,010
Well look, racism is
disgusting. All racism,

88
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,570
racism against Chinese people,
racism against white people.

89
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:31,300
Racism against every, of
course against black people,

90
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:35,080
of course against everyone judging
someone on something that they have no

91
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,590
control over. That's
what it is like you are,

92
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,770
well you're born whenever you're
born, Irish, German, Italian, African,

93
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,850
you're born, it's not you. You
are just who you are. Right?

94
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,660
So racism is disgusting. But is that,

95
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,920
is it racism?

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,000
When you have that girl on stage and she's
singing that song that she loves that

97
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:59,110
you sing, it's your song. Like
that's not really racism. No.

98
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,090
So when she's singing along and
everybody's [inaudible] you racist,

99
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,330
you fucking Nazi. Like
what are we doing? Right?

100
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:10,300
Cause this is what we're
doing here is we're we,

101
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,620
we've gone into some
ridiculous zone where it's not,

102
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,870
it doesn't make any sense cause
we know that's not her intent.

103
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,300
No, exactly right. This is the,
becomes an intellectual exercise.

104
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,130
It becomes like a word game.

105
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,950
It's a little puzzle kind of thing
that we're doing to trap this person.

106
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,030
You could say she's very innocent up
there. They all know she's a little drunk.

107
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:33,230
It's kind of like setting someone up to
do something. Yeah, it's pretty gross.

108
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,110
Weird. But it's weird
that it's so universal.

109
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,520
Like that crowd that was
probably 20,000 people. No,

110
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,100
I had a weird thing on,
uh, you know, I'm, I, I'm,

111
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm on the show live from here,

112
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:49,800
the prayer old Prairie home
companion show and uh, you know,

113
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm the writer for it and stuff, had right
around it and appear on it and stuff.

114
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,320
Anyway, uh, I'm very involved
with the show. Uh, Chris,

115
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,540
who's this bluegrass guy who
plays a mandolin, who's a amazing,

116
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:08,100
kindest person you'd ever
meet, like super, super sweet,

117
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,120
sweet person, like, like
Mr. Rogers in a way.

118
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:17,100
Like it's to that level of kindness and
he sings everybody's birthdays and stuff

119
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:20,430
and he sings different songs. And
uh, as a tribute to everything,

120
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:24,930
he loves all music. He loves everything.
He sang a Kendrick Lamar song,

121
00:08:24,931 --> 00:08:27,510
he sang a little bit of it, uh, in like,

122
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:32,160
cause it was his birthday that week and
he got so much hate online that a white

123
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:36,580
person can't be singing that song.
What is the song about? It's a,

124
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,900
I don't know, but it wasn't, that
wasn't the thing. It was the word.

125
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,460
It was that he was, um,

126
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,240
what's the thing that you take
some cultural appropriation
that he's not allowed

127
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:50,330
to sing and meanwhile he's
singing bluegrass Indian music.

128
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,520
I mean the from all around the world.

129
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:56,040
This is a kind soul celebrating and it

130
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,930
really freaked him out
cause he is so nice.

131
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,350
He couldn't believe the hate that he got
from it that now he's super sensitive

132
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:04,080
about singing that music
at all. It's not logical.

133
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,260
It's not when you have to put your
foot down and you consider the source

134
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,500
culturally we have to put our foot
down because we're going down this very

135
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,040
strange,

136
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,090
illogical road where you can just
decide what's evil and what's bad and it

137
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:19,530
doesn't have any bearing on the thought
or the intent behind it is, look,

138
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,580
they went after Bruno
Mars. Like get in the,

139
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,350
just get the fuck outta here. Yeah.

140
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,430
They accused Bruno Mars of cultural
appropriation. What culture.

141
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:32,610
He's everything. He's
everything. Meanwhile,

142
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:35,880
what is he doing where anybody would
accuse him of cultural appropriation.

143
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:39,780
He sings these beautiful fucking
songs. Oh, he's a lightless world.

144
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:41,700
He's amazing. Yes. I love that guy.

145
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:45,960
The guy's amazing voice is fantastic
and his songs are fun and they're catchy

146
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,890
and the, I love listening to them.
I saw him in Vegas in concert.

147
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,990
It was just the most
uplifting, bright thing.

148
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,020
You know what made me happy though is
that a bunch of black artists said,

149
00:09:57,241 --> 00:10:00,540
fuck you. He's great. Like
what was the original charge?

150
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,700
Just fucking social justice warriors.

151
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,680
We're going after him for
cultural appropriation.

152
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,850
All these like super progressive, angry
fuck heads. We decide culture, whatever,

153
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,430
man. It doesn't have to make
sense. This is the thing.

154
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,050
They're just looking for targets. It
doesn't have to make sense. This is not a,

155
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,310
it's not like a logical progression.
Like, Oh, Bruno Mars is steep.

156
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,300
It's not like, Oh,

157
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:25,650
he's stealing from these old blues
singers and he's not crediting them.

158
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,960
And he's, Oh, come on,
white guy from Kentucky.

159
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,460
That's not what we're
dealing with you. Right?

160
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,660
We're dealing with a multiracial guy who
sings these beautiful songs that they

161
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:37,950
don't, they're not cultural appropriation.
Even if he was white and yet, no,

162
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,610
exactly. It's just a joy of music
and music is a mix of everything.

163
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:44,220
It's a mix of all of us of
everything that is good. Right.

164
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,810
Coming out saying like his style. But
if that's the case then here's the case.

165
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm a fucking huge fan of the
black keys. The black keys.

166
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,210
Oh a lot of their shit is blues.
A lot of that is old blues.

167
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:01,440
Like it sounds so similar to
some great old blues. Sure.

168
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,830
Is that cultural appropriation?
I mean I love them.

169
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,130
I mean you saying they should stop
doing what I what? I love to hear.

170
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,760
No come on. I mean what are we doing?
Yeah, that's crazy. But what is,

171
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,980
what did you know what
the other part of it is?

172
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,340
How many people are really
complaining about that stuff?

173
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,970
It's a very small amount but it's so small
but it's enough where your friend got

174
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:25,230
scared. He did get scared and it literally
amounts to probably three tweets.

175
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,080
You know what I mean? It's like, but
those people, that's the only noise.

176
00:11:28,081 --> 00:11:30,660
People aren't saying
wow I love that version.

177
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,460
Cause they just like it
in the normal people.

178
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,570
It's these haters that just want to do
it and but the people in control of it

179
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:41,571
have to calm him and make him realize
we've got your back days wrong.

180
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,790
They'll fucking fire him
if it gets loud enough.

181
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,000
It doesn't have to make any sense.
That's where it squirrely too.

182
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:51,600
They fired speaking to Prairie home
companion. They fired Garrison Keillor.

183
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,950
I know they fired him,

184
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,860
removed his name for everything because
he hugged a lady and her his hand went

185
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,090
down her back and then he apologized,
sent her an email. She said it's fine.

186
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,970
They went back and forth with
it. Didn't do anything else.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,260
No history of sexual harassment,
sexual assault, no history of anything.

188
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:12,580
Terrible. Years later when all
this me too stuff comes out,

189
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:16,210
she comes out with that. Yeah, it was
dirty business. Yeah, it was dirty.

190
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,060
It's dirty, but it's
doesn't, it's not logical.

191
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,980
It's like there's this fever feeding
frenzy that goes on with these things.

192
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,270
It's a mob mentality.

193
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,820
Yeah. It just want to tear people
down. They want to tear up.

194
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,780
I really believe that you have to in
all these situations is consider the

195
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,730
source. Like you really have to consider,

196
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,160
it's like when the
steroid thing went down,

197
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,910
there were like people came at Barry bonds
harder than everybody else because he

198
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:41,560
had a rap for not being a good guy.

199
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,060
He people did not like him regardless
of that. So when it happens,

200
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,780
people kind of come after him harder
than they came after Sammy Sosa. Uh,

201
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,580
yes and yeah. And much harder than
like Andy Pettitte or you know,

202
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,330
these letters.

203
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,390
He's a pitcher for the Yankees and it's
just like a nice guy and they don't

204
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,120
care, you know. But if
somebody is a problem,

205
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,840
Jose Conseco Jose can say it was a
problem cause he ratted everybody out.

206
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,900
Oh yeah, that's right. That
book called Joost. Yeah. Boy.

207
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,910
Everything that can made him persona non
grata. Like he just kinda disappeared.

208
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,810
He got written off from that book. Yeah.
Like people just decided, fuck you.

209
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,270
Yeah. That's interesting.
Right? It is. It is.

210
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Yeah. Too much of a
snitch, I guess. Yeah man.

211
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,590
People just didn't respect him after that
because there was so many people that

212
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:30,070
were also doing it and he was the one
that ratted everybody out and profited off

213
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:34,180
of it. Yeah. There's some, there's some
justice, some street justice in that.

214
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,730
I just think that there's, we have
to be really careful with call,

215
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,773
but it's just,

216
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,290
there's also an issue that everyone has
access to social media and everyone has

217
00:13:47,081 --> 00:13:51,850
the ability to complain about things.
Yeah. So there's a world, right.

218
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,740
So there's a lot of noise. Yeah.
You get the real sound like,

219
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,220
like there are things that
happen that are really bad,

220
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,660
and when something happens, it's really
bad. Yeah. The Twitter mob and the,

221
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,230
all the people that go after these
people for something that's legitimately

222
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:12,550
awful. Sure. It makes sense. Yeah. I mean
it's, there's, there's justice to it,

223
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,750
but there's also like this
constant looking for targets.

224
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,460
Yes. That it seems like there, that's
kind of like a hobby of some people. Yeah.

225
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,540
Like that is the thing.
