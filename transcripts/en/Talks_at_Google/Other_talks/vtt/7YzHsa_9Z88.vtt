&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Good afternoon and welcome
to YouTube Headquarters in San Bruno, California,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.530
if you're joining us from somewhere on the
internet.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.370
Our guest today at YouTube is an actor who
has appeared in some of the comedies that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.949
defined the last decade.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.420
I'm talking about movies like 40-Year-Old
Virgin and Superbad, Forgetting Sarah Marshall,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.620
Get Him to the Greek, Funny People and more,
but he's here today to share with us some

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.980
of his experiences working in a dramatic role
on a movie that opens this weekend.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.489
The movie is Moneyball.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.649
Please welcome me or please join me in welcoming
to YouTube, Jonah Hill.

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.480
[applause]

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.970
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Hello.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.839
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: How're you doing?

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:51.839
How're you doing?

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:52.839
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I'm well.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:53.839
How are you?

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:54.839
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Good, good.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.420
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Thanks for joining internet
if you're watching this.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.280
Haven't seen you in awhile.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.550
I hope your hair still looks as good as last
time I saw it, internet, and why'd you break

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.550
up with me?

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.550
That wasn't nice.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.550
OK.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.550
How are you guys doing?

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.850
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.180
So Jonah, I, I could explain what, what Moneyball
is as a movie, but I'm sure people would rather

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.970
hear you tell 'em about it.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.910
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Moneyball is a drama about baseball,
but, you know, it's about the 2002 Oakland

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:34.570
A's and Billy Beane and my character, Peter
Brand, using this technique called sabermetrics

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.610
or moneyball as they call it.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.610
And they use this technique of a different
way of finding value in players to, to build

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.350
a team with very little money that ends up
winning 20 straight games in a row, which

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.990
breaks a lot of records.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.460
Now on paper this sounds like the most boring
movie ever made.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.460
[laughter]

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.350
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: About, a movie about baseball
statistics.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.770
But Aaron Sorkin, who wrote The Social Network,
and Steve Zaillian, who wrote Schindler's

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.120
List, wrote, wrote this movie.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.819
And Aaron Sorkin, and I'm paraphrasing here,
said about it, just as how The Social Network

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.310
on paper sounds very boring, you know a movie
about someone inventing a website, maybe not

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.030
to the people in this room, [chuckles] [audience
laughs] but to me that sounded very boring.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.230
And, and, and you know you watch that film
and it's riveting and really groundbreaking

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.040
and cool and a great drama, and it's the same
thing about Moneyball because the filmmakers

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.590
really use baseball as a really beautiful
aesthetic backdrop to tell a really moving

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.980
story about underdogs and being undervalued.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.260
And that's the story I connected to and also
it stars Brad Pitt and myself and Philip Seymour

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.190
Hoffman, so the three most handsome guys in
the world, obviously they, they found us all

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.140
and paired us together finally.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.140
[laughter]

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.459
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And for me it's exciting because
it's you know you're used to seeing me in

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.930
comedies and this is, you know I love comedy
movies and dramatic movies, and for me it's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.990
a really big opportunity to show you guys
what I could do in a dramatic role and I hope

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.600
you like it, that'd be nice, yeah, sure.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600
[laughter]

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.349
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Now it's not as if you only
done kind of one particular style of comedy

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.730
over the years, I mean, The Invention of Lying
had a very kind of specific tone to it.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.850
And then even Funny People was a very kind
of naturalistic movie, but still this is a

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.360
big step up for you, kind of being head to
head with Brad Pitt?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.720
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well, I made um, I made a movie
last year called Cyrus, which was a smaller

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.240
movie that not a lot of people saw.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.739
And it was myself and John C. Reilly and Marisa
Tomei, and that was kind of good, like it

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.230
was a good bridge way in between some of the
comedies I made and, and, and dramatic work

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.280
because it was funny and it was a drama, it
had both things in it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:03.810
And yeah I mean the thing about the comedies
I've done is to me at the time when, when

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.640
I had met Judd Apatow and all these guys you
know like and we all started working together,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.430
it did feel very punk rock and different than
what was going on in comedy.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.780
It felt like a different thing that was happening
and we all kind of have the same energy and,

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.760
and, and take on what we wanted to do, led
by Judd obviously.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.520
And you know but now it's years later and
those movies have been copied now to death

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.650
and you know in my mind I'm always like, what's
next, how do I evolve and how do you evolve

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.840
and then you watch the way that Judd is evolving
as a filmmaker and Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberger

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.260
evolving as filmmakers, and now my evolution
involves doing movies like Cyrus and Moneyball

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.480
and that's stuff I'm really psyched about,
you know, so hopefully I could get to do both

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.800
of those things, the comedy and drama.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Now, I've, I've heard some
actors say that it's very intimidating to

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.680
work opposite someone like Robert De Niro
because it's Robert De Niro and obviously

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.910
Brad Pitt is just so damn handsome.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.730
Do you have to just like stay around for 20
minutes to see if it goes away?

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.730
Or how does that work?

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.020
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: No, you know, honestly, like

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.020
[laughter]

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.020
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: To what?

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.520
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: To just, you know, get past
the initial shock?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.200
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: This guy.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.200
[laughter]

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.300
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Calm down.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I have more questions like
this, so.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.060
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.729
It's the accent mixed with the tattoos mixed
with the stare mixed with the smile, it's,

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:29.729
it's.

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.729
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: We'll be fine.

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:31.729
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Alright.

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:41.460
If anything happens to me, um, I'm in northern
California, in a really weird professor auditorium?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.460
[laughter]

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.570
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I don't know where I am.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:53.900
But, no, I mean you know obviously I was intimidated
when I got this part because it was myself,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.870
you know I'm the second lead in this movie
with Brad Pitt and Philip Seymour Hoffman's

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.241
in the movie and you know Bennett Miller's
directing it who directed Capote, and Aaron

00:06:03.241 --> 00:06:07.550
Sorkin wrote Social Network, and Steve Zaillian,
who wrote Schindler's List, and it just is

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.730
this really surreal dream-like experience
from day one and so you know the first day

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:18.750
of rehearsals I was really nervous, but I
was like, I can either be really freaked out

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.180
or I can kick my nerves to the curb for a
second and try and deliver for these people

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.190
who took a chance on giving me an opportunity
to do something truly different, so.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.410
I just wanted to come through for them and
if I was sitting around being nervous about

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.730
how talented everyone was, I probably would
of just thought about that as opposed to doing

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.000
a good job.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.270
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.040
Now obviously Moneyball really is a, it's
a number of things.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.580
It's a human interest story, it's the story
of Billy Beane, but I don't want to underplay

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.090
the role of statistics, obviously we probably
have some you know programmers and engineers.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.341
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well you guys are nerds, so
it's like

00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:53.341
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yes, exactly.

00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:54.380
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: really exciting for you.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.090
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: There are some people here
I'm sure

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.360
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Wrong crowd, wrong room, wrong

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.360
room.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.330
The internet liked that more than this room.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.360
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: They don't like being called
nerds.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.800
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I'm leaving, no.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.940
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: But I mean how did you deal
with, did you method act your way through

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.600
the, the statistical stuff?

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.440
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: No, well, honestly, I, you know,
I realized I had never played a character

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.389
with a skill before, of any kind.

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:22.389
[laughter]

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:28.699
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And now the character I was
playing had to be a brilliant statistician

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.990
and mathematician, so I had a statistics tutor
and a mathematics tutor and I think that was

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:39.790
probably the hardest job on Moneyball was
teaching me how to count past 10 probably,

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.310
because I'm very poor at math and science,
I was always really good at history and English

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.500
and acting and stuff like that in school.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Now I did read somewhere that
apparently you were kind of suggest, it was

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:54.039
suggested that you should deal with statistics
the same way that you, you kind of talk about

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.780
other actors in Hollywood and their strengths
and weaknesses, so.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.200
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Or filmmakers or.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, movies themselves.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.389
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So I was kind of wondering,
could you maybe give us an example and maybe

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:05.520
give us like two of Seth Rogen's strengths
and one weakness.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.440
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: [laughing] I'm not gonna do
that.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440
[laughter]

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: He'll never know.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.389
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Why would I want to?

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:14.389
Next question.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:15.389
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, what's his strength?

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:16.980
What is a strength that you gained from working
with him?

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.980
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Ask him.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.980
I don't know.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.980
What the hell.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.980
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Alright.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.980
I'll, I'll ask him.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.980
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I flew down to northern California.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.980
Don't ask me about Seth.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.980
He's great.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.860
He's getting married in a couple of weeks,
I'm gonna go to his wedding.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:27.860
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.819
OK now, Brad is obviously playing very much
the character of Billy Beane, I mean he, there's

00:08:32.819 --> 00:08:36.680
a lot of Billy in the book, it's a really
interesting read.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.490
You're playing maybe more of a composite character
and maybe a bigger character that

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.620
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Do you work for YouTube?

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.620
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.450
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I thought this was for people
who were on YouTube to ask questions.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.161
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well I, we're gonna get to
that.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:53.730
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: [laughing] I wanna hear your
guys' questions, right?

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.090
We should hear the people's questions.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.090
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Alright.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.090
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.130
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I thought we were gonna do
some Moneyball questions.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.340
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, we can do it, keep going.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.170
But I wanna hear the, I wanna hear the kids
that are on the computer, that's exciting

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.170
to me.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.170
Right?

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.170
Yeah.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: OK.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:07.170
Sure.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK, cool.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Shall we skip to the questions
that we got from the internet?

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: No, no, keep going.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Well, I was just kind of interested
in

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.430
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: obviously Billy, as I say Billy
is a real character, you're playing more of

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:19.440
a composite character maybe and it's a bigger
part perhaps than it is in the book.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.130
Because in the book you know the character
of the statistician isn't drawn out as much

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.700
and I maybe thought that would have been an
interesting opportunity to have that a little

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.050
bit grounded in reality, but then you get
Aaron Sorkin writing out the role?

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.560
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well I think, you know, my character
in this movie is a guy who would blend into

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.240
a wall, right?

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.790
So he's never had a light shined on him before.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.270
He's never had someone empower him in any
way.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:50.120
He's someone who is doing the busy work on
a computer, no offense, [audience chuckles]

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.160
and you don't usually see that person's story
is what I'm saying so for me I found it really

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.961
unique to get to play a character where you're
getting to play someone who you're, you're

00:09:58.961 --> 00:10:01.060
hearing their story who you don't usually
get to see.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.060
And a guy like Billy, like Brad Pitt's character,
is the guy's character who you always see

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.080
in a movie, the main protagonist, but the
cool thing is Brad's character was overvalued.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.100
He was told he was gonna be this big sports
star because he was handsome and he was good

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:21.180
at baseball and he turned down going to Stanford
and he turned down getting an education and

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.920
he fizzled out and he didn't become this big
sports star.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.149
And my character is undervalued.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:30.950
He's taken at face value, taken as a guy who
can just do busy work on a computer, but he

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.779
has these really brilliant radical ideas and
Billy's the first person, Brad's character,

00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:41.019
Billy, is the first person who sees him and
goes, you're, you're, you're something special,

00:10:41.019 --> 00:10:42.800
you have something special to offer.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.490
And it's really cool to see that guy's story.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.060
So that's what I found really interesting.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.530
And it's kind of like seeing a baby use his
legs for the first time, you know, because

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:55.630
he's never been empowered before, so he's
metaphorically wobbling around, you know,

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:02.710
trying to learn how to walk, or trying to
learn how to deal with some sort of power,

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.710
and that's exciting.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.710
Yeah.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.710
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And obviously a lot of this
was filmed at the Coliseum in Oakland.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.710
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.620
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And again, that's a little
bit of a character in the book.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.930
You read about the video room and just the
atmosphere, it's certainly not the most palatial

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:14.930
stadium in sports.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.930
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Right.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.410
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Did that help to kind of soak
up that atmosphere?

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:18.820
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.209
I mean honestly, when we shot there, I mean
there's no more really place you could actually

00:11:24.209 --> 00:11:29.899
go than where you're shooting is where it
took place.

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:33.970
And then when you walk out on the field, it's
just the coolest thing ever, because it's

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:38.850
empty and then you know you can run around
the bases and throw the ball around and stuff

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.520
and then when we shot a lot of the games that
are really factual about what actually took

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.510
place, there were real A's fans in the stadium,
some of whom were at those actual games and

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:53.600
that was really cool, you know, that was really
exciting.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.670
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So if you were to kind of apply
the theories of Moneyball to the kind of movie

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.140
roles that you take and you know Moneyball
being kind of looking for things that are

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.300
maybe undervalued or people don't put enough
emphasis on and really kind of leveraging

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.399
them, is, is that something that you look
for in roles?

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:10.910
Or you like name big on the poster and a lot
of lines?

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:16.350
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I just look for name biggest
on the poster.

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.080
Most amount of free stuff I can get.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:25.220
No, I've, that's silly, I mean the only thing
I care about, you know, the only thing I care

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.589
about is when I'm older and I have grandkids
and I've spent my life doing this, if I'm

00:12:30.589 --> 00:12:37.910
lucky to keep getting to spend my life doing
this, that I'll have a few DVDs or whatever

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:42.230
that will be then, it'll be like watched on
your palm or something, I have a few movie

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.720
cartridges I can implant into my grandchildren's
brain space.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.480
And say you know this is what I spent my life
doing and I'm really proud of these few things.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:57.360
And that's, that's all how I look at it because
if you're gonna go away for a few months and

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.970
you're gonna go dedicate your life to something,
I mean you guys know, you, everyone in this

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:06.370
room is someone clearly really special and
smart or you wouldn't be working here.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.269
And you could be doing anything with that
intelligence, but it has to be something you're

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:15.430
incredibly passionate about if you're gonna
dedicate not sleeping and working really hard

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.140
at it and we're all lucky enough to get to
work on stuff we really care about, if we're

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.680
lucky, but the only thing that could be the
impetus of that is thinking it could become

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.920
something really special.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:34.030
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So obviously you know comedy,
some of the films you've been on, could be

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.000
described as about ensemble casts

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Right.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.149
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: a bit of a team sport kind
of thing.

00:13:38.149 --> 00:13:41.950
How different is working with Judd to the
kind of the Billy Beane character, I presume

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.060
Judd's not throwing chairs around to get you
to, to work.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:51.920
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Uh, well, um, no I mean Judd
has been, you know, there have been four really

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.680
major Billy Beane figures in my life, people
that shined a light on me and gave me the

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.230
opportunity to get where I'm at now, which
is YouTube.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.230
[laughter]

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.149
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I feel like I've worked my way
backwards from movies to YouTube.

00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:11.380
Aren't you supposed to start at YouTube and
then get a movie deal or something when you

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.089
make a video of yourself like getting hit
in the nuts with the Frisbee or something,

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.540
right?

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.829
But no, Dustin Hoffman was the first person
who encouraged me to become an actor and got

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:27.320
me my first audition in what ended up being
my first movie, which is I Heart Huckabees,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.860
and then after that I met Judd, who, you know,
gave me countless opportunities in things

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.800
you know to show what I had to offer.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:44.731
And the next person would be the Duplass brothers,
who gave me Cyrus, which is a movie that I

00:14:44.731 --> 00:14:48.589
was able to show a little bit more of a different
side and then finally Brad Pitt and Bennett

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:55.410
Miller, who made Moneyball to give me this
big opportunity and then fifth would be YouTube,

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.890
who gave me the opportunity to be here, which
is really cool.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.890
Yeah.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:00.890
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:01.890
[whoops from the audience]

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.890
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I'm here.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:03.890
I'm at YouTube.

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.430
I'm in, while you guys are watching YouTube,
I'm in YouTube, in

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.430
[laughter]

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.620
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: It's just like a giant tube
filled with, like, kids after the dentist

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.540
that like have had too much Vicodin or whatever
and

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.550
[laughter]

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:22.889
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: like, you know women stomping
on grapes and falling down and screaming.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.100
[clapping and laughter]

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.100
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.770
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: It's a, it's a weird place.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.770
[laughter]

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.019
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: It's just this giant tube with
weird internet characters.

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:32.209
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:33.209
So, um

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:34.490
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Excellent.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.490
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.130
So again to get a, to beat this baseball metaphor
to death,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.130
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.130
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: as I plan to.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.550
I mean one of the things about Moneyball is
it's inherently a kind of conservative strategy

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:52.130
to, of playing baseball, it's you know take
the walk, don't try and steal the base, get

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.130
on base.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:58.200
It's the opposite of kind of improvisation
and obviously anybody who's seen the DVD extras

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.519
and a lot of Judd's movies will know that
you know you've worked in a lot of films where

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:04.620
there's a lot of improvisation.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:08.120
Is that something that you kind of now look
for as an actor, or?

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.300
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: No, I just, like I said, you
know, I just I wanna make good movies, whether

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:18.880
they're dramas or comedies, whether they're
improvised or scripted, it, it, it, the process

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.370
is not what you're looking for, what, what
will be the finished result being something

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.370
that you care about.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.820
I don't want to tread over the same answer
again,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.820
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.510
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: which I feel like that kind
of is, but, is, yeah, you just gotta be really

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.490
proud of what you're working on or there's
no point in doing it.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.019
So you can't say like, oh, I'm gonna do this
movie because I think it's gonna make a lot

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:43.209
of money, or I wanna do this movie 'cause
it'll get me this or I'm gonna do this because

00:16:43.209 --> 00:16:50.199
I'm gonna improvise a lot, like that's all,
you know, no matter how joyous the spirit

00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:54.279
of what you're doing is or how annoying it
was to make it or how hard it was to make

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:59.550
or how fun it was to make it, those will always
shift, but if, your goal has to be the product

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.550
being good.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.550
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.740
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: You know?

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.419
If you start doing movies for reasons like
oh, they're gonna be a lot of fun, the work

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:08.419
might suffer

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:09.419
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:10.419
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: and the product might suffer.

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:14.559
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So Philip Seymour Hoffman,
a lot of people would say, an actor's actor?

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:17.089
What did you kind of experience specifically
with him?

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:21.600
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I think, I you know, I was most
intimidated to work with him out of everyone

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:29.309
involved in the movie, because he, you know,
I don't know, because, because he does come

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:36.691
off as this really intense dude from his movies
and, and he's such a gifted actor and I didn't

00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:39.409
know what his process would be like at all.

00:17:39.409 --> 00:17:40.520
And he was fantastic.

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:47.799
I mean, super fun and funny, but when he's
working, he's very, very, you know, involved

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:53.200
in what he's doing, it's not like joke around
with him before you do a dramatic scene or

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.919
something like that, it's pretty intense and
so and the interesting thing is his character

00:17:57.919 --> 00:18:02.359
doesn't like my character in the movie and
he doesn't like Brad Pitt's character in the

00:18:02.359 --> 00:18:06.539
movie, so we would do these scenes and I would
look at the call sheet and see that Phil was

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:11.240
there that day and I would go, God, this sucks,
because you knew you were gonna get yelled

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.520
at all day and he's such a good actor that
it feels like he's really mad at you all the

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.149
time, so I'd have to be like, you're not mad
at me or anything, right?

00:18:18.149 --> 00:18:22.100
And he's like, no I'm just acting, you know?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.580
So sometimes you felt like as if he was really
upset with you, because he's such a good actor.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.700
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.580
So just to go back a little bit to Superbad,
which obviously had a lot of people kind of

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:34.970
really, you broke through with that.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:40.379
When you were working on it, was it obvious
at the time that this was you know something

00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:41.379
special?

00:18:41.379 --> 00:18:50.279
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I think that it was the most
fun movie I've ever made, I'd say.

00:18:50.279 --> 00:18:53.869
That and Forgetting Sarah Marshall 'cause
I worked like two days and I was in Hawaii

00:18:53.869 --> 00:18:55.909
for like a month.

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:56.909
[laughter]

00:18:56.909 --> 00:19:03.859
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: But Superbad was the most, it
was like my college experience, because I

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:08.220
wasn't, I had dropped out of school, Michael
Cera was doing that instead of going to college,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.730
and Seth and Evan didn't go, or Evan went
to a little college, but there was just, from

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.519
the crew to the cast everyone it was all people
we hung out with in real life.

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:20.549
It was, it was the youngest energy I've ever
felt on a set because everyone was, you know,

00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:26.629
like 18 to 25 years old, including the crew
and everyone, you know, except for Judd and

00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:27.980
Greg Mottola.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.770
Greg the director and Judd the producer.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:36.159
And we would, you know, have big parties after
work or on the weekends.

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:42.860
We really all loved each other, so it was
an incredibly, as fun as the movie looks to

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.070
make, it actually, sometimes, they look really
fun to make and they're not as fun as that

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:52.609
to make, that one looked really fun to make
and was insanely fun to make.

00:19:52.609 --> 00:19:57.669
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And you were kind of playing
a character that Seth Rogen wrote more or

00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:59.410
less himself as a younger person, could you
say

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.399
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I think you want to date Seth
Rogen, I'm pretty sure.

00:20:01.399 --> 00:20:02.470
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: He's a handsome man.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.279
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: He's getting married, but I
think I can.

00:20:04.279 --> 00:20:06.289
You seem to be very fascinated by him.

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:08.749
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I only have four more Seth
questions, we'll get through them quickly.

00:20:08.749 --> 00:20:11.350
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I think you should interview
him, man.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.409
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: If he's watching, Seth, if
you're out there, I'm married, but I'll see

00:20:16.409 --> 00:20:17.490
what I can do.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.139
I was just really gonna ask, I mean could
you see a point where you were kind of writing

00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:26.320
a script based around your own earlier life,
you know would that be an interesting thing

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.320
to do?

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.320
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I don't know.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.109
I don't know if I ever would.

00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:35.759
I've written one script that's autobiographical
that has not been produced into a film and

00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:42.879
to me, you know, Superbad was Seth and Evan's
high school experiences and then when Michael

00:20:42.879 --> 00:20:46.190
and I came on and then obviously Judd who
worked on it and people, everyone who worked

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:50.200
on it contributed their experiences in what
they felt, you know.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.929
And for me, that, you know, 21 Jump Street
is a movie that I was one of the writers on

00:20:55.929 --> 00:20:59.919
and that to me is riffing on making Superbad.

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:04.889
That whole movie to me because I'm playing
a 25-year-old who goes back to high school

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:08.539
in 21 Jump Street as a cop.

00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:13.479
But in, when I was making Superbad I was a
20-something-year-old pretending, going back

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:18.409
to high school again, so I got to use a lot
of the experiences that I did to pretend to

00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:23.460
be a high school student while making Superbad
in 21 Jump Street as a 25-year-old pretending

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.070
to be a high school student again.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:30.570
Like for example, in Superbad I moved back
in with my parents into my childhood room

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:35.349
while we made the movie because I wanted to
feel like I felt like I was in high school.

00:21:35.349 --> 00:21:41.229
And when in 21 Jump Street when our characters
go back to high school, we move in with my

00:21:41.229 --> 00:21:45.749
parents again, and so all the funny things,
like your being in your 20s and having your

00:21:45.749 --> 00:21:46.869
mom go, what are you doing tonight?

00:21:46.869 --> 00:21:52.929
You go, mom, shut up, like, you know, like
you're past that but you have to go back to

00:21:52.929 --> 00:21:53.929
that.

00:21:53.929 --> 00:21:54.929
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:21:54.929 --> 00:21:58.109
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And so 21 Jump Street has a
lot of stuff like that from, from that's riffing

00:21:58.109 --> 00:21:59.989
on when I was making Superbad.

00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:01.210
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.409
Now speaking as a parent, I always say to
people that you have to be very careful when

00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:08.809
you bring a kid's movie into the house, 'cause
you're gonna end up watching it a lot.

00:22:08.809 --> 00:22:09.809
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:12.419
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And from that perspective,
I kind of have to say like How to Train Your

00:22:12.419 --> 00:22:18.139
Dragon was, to beat the baseball metaphor
to death, a home run, in every respect.

00:22:18.139 --> 00:22:20.070
What was it like to be a part of something
like that?

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.070
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well, thanks.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.480
I mean, that, I will be totally honest with
you guys.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.010
I did not know if that was gonna be a good
movie or not.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.010
[laughter]

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.629
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: When you do those animated movies,
you're in a booth, they don't show you anything

00:22:31.629 --> 00:22:36.860
really and you're just kind of like screaming
and stuff and saying stuff and then you, I

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:42.899
saw it and I was like this is a beautiful
movie, it really is like a beautiful movie

00:22:42.899 --> 00:22:44.659
and I was totally surprised.

00:22:44.659 --> 00:22:50.679
I had no idea it would be as good as it was
and those directors, they're really beautiful

00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:56.999
people and smart, articulate and aesthetically
gifted people and when I watched that movie

00:22:56.999 --> 00:23:00.309
I was very surprised at how good and moving
it was.

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:03.414
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah, I mean it has plot and
action and it's very watchable.

00:23:03.414 --> 00:23:04.414
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:23:04.414 --> 00:23:05.414
And dragons are cool.

00:23:05.414 --> 00:23:06.414
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And dragons.

00:23:06.414 --> 00:23:07.414
And there's a sequel?

00:23:07.414 --> 00:23:08.414
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:23:08.414 --> 00:23:11.409
Another one that I'm just rollin' the dice
on, I just hope it, again.

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:15.340
I mean it's the same guy so, so I think it'll
be great, you know.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:22.409
But, but, yeah, I, I mean you're just literally
in a booth, there's like no one else around

00:23:22.409 --> 00:23:25.809
and they give you some lines and it's like,
watch out for that dragon.

00:23:25.809 --> 00:23:29.710
And you're like this could be terrible, I
have no idea, I have no idea what this is

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.599
gonna be like, you know?

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:34.379
And then it turned out to be something I'm
really proud of, you know?

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:36.389
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And you have been in other
animation stuff.

00:23:36.389 --> 00:23:37.389
You were, I guess.

00:23:37.389 --> 00:23:38.399
in Horton Sees a Hears a Who!?

00:23:38.399 --> 00:23:39.399
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:23:39.399 --> 00:23:40.399
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You were in Megamind.

00:23:40.399 --> 00:23:41.399
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:23:41.399 --> 00:23:42.859
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And you have your own animated
series coming up on Fox?

00:23:42.859 --> 00:23:43.859
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yes.

00:23:43.859 --> 00:23:44.859
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: World domination?

00:23:44.859 --> 00:23:45.859
Is this the plan?

00:23:45.859 --> 00:23:48.649
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I, I don't know, I don't know,
just YouTube domination.

00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:49.649
I just want.

00:23:49.649 --> 00:23:50.710
Do you guys have a bed here?

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.809
I wanna live in this tube forever with you
guys.

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:54.210
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: We have some comfortable couches.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:55.210
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK Cool.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.210
You had great hummus.

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.210
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.210
[laughter]

00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.210
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I had some hummus.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.009
Have you guys tried the hummus here at YouTube?

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:03.649
It's fantastic.

00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:04.649
Great hummus.

00:24:04.649 --> 00:24:09.509
Yeah, I created an animated show called Allen
Gregory, with my two friends Jarrad Paul and

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:15.960
Andy Mogel and it's about the world's most
pretentious 7-year-old named Allen Gregory.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.229
And he has two dads and one of the dads is
an heiress.

00:24:20.229 --> 00:24:25.799
And he loses the money and so Allen Gregory
has to go to public school for the first time

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:27.739
with normal kids and he finds this disgusting.

00:24:27.739 --> 00:24:29.330
He doesn't wanna be around normal kids.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.749
And I do the voice of Allen Gregory.

00:24:30.749 --> 00:24:37.659
And let me tell you when I was growing up,
the Simpsons were my total, when my parents

00:24:37.659 --> 00:24:42.134
asked me what I wanted to do when I was young,
they'd say what do you want to do when you

00:24:42.134 --> 00:24:43.134
grow up?

00:24:43.134 --> 00:24:44.489
And I said I wanna live in Springfield.

00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:49.599
I was like 6 or 7 and with the Simpsons and
my parents said well that's, the Simpsons

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:55.309
is a show and there are animators who draw
Homer, there are people who, there's a guy

00:24:55.309 --> 00:24:59.879
who does Homer's voice and there are people
who write what Homer says.

00:24:59.879 --> 00:25:03.929
And I was like, I wanna be one of the people
who writes what Homer says.

00:25:03.929 --> 00:25:07.880
So that was a bizarre dream, 'cause most kids
just answer like fireman, but I would be in

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.889
school and say I wanna write for an animated
prime-time sitcom and that was weird.

00:25:12.889 --> 00:25:13.889
[laughter]

00:25:13.889 --> 00:25:17.999
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And you know then years later
you know Superbad had come out and I had done

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:22.719
some of these comedies that had been successful
and Fox had luckily asked me, they said do

00:25:22.719 --> 00:25:28.529
you want to do the voice of an animated character
on one of our new shows and I said well if

00:25:28.529 --> 00:25:34.690
I'm on one of your shows, you probably wouldn't
let me create my own show ever because you

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.659
already have me on your network, and they
were like, yeah, probably, but you don't have

00:25:37.659 --> 00:25:38.659
a show.

00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:40.599
And I was like, OK, hold on a second.

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:45.139
So I went Jarrad, one of the co-creators,
lived in my building and I went in there with

00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:51.009
him and his partner Andy, his writing partner
and we stayed in a room for a few weeks and

00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:55.950
after a few weeks we emerged with a pilot
for Allen Gregory and now October 30, after

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.970
the Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episode,
we premier on Fox right after the Simpsons.

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:00.970
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Awesome.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.359
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: So that dream has come very
full circle to me.

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:06.830
I'm very overjoyed and overwhelmed by that,
you know.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.049
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Nice.

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:09.049
Now

00:26:09.049 --> 00:26:10.049
[applause]

00:26:10.049 --> 00:26:13.529
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: That's cool, yeah, very cool.

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:14.529
Thanks.

00:26:14.529 --> 00:26:16.450
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And you also have The Sitter
coming up later this year.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.669
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, The Sitter, if you liked,
like, Superbad and stuff like that, you're

00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:21.700
gonna like The Sitter.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.480
It's a, it's a really hard core R-rated babysitting
comedy.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.480
[chuckles]

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480
[laughter]

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.289
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And you know, you know those
movies, the idea behind that is you know those

00:26:31.289 --> 00:26:36.159
movies where they're like you don't want this
guy watching your kids and it's like some

00:26:36.159 --> 00:26:39.210
really cheesy Disney movie?

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.529
You really don't want this guy watching your
kids.

00:26:41.529 --> 00:26:42.529
[laughter]

00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:48.679
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: The plot of that movie revolves
around me going to buy drugs for my girlfriend

00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:53.259
while babysitting these kids as a favor to
my mom and one of the kids steals drugs from

00:26:53.259 --> 00:26:54.320
Sam Rockwell and J.B.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.049
Smoove, who are drug dealers, and chase us
around New York City.

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.049
And it's hysterical.

00:26:59.049 --> 00:27:04.519
And David Gordon Green directed, who directed
Pineapple Express and it's a really crazy

00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:08.341
fun one night in New York City kind of movie
with me and a bunch of kids.

00:27:08.341 --> 00:27:09.580
And that comes out December 9.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:14.340
And there's a cell phone, the poster, there's
a cell phone with a phone number like need

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:18.629
a sitter and there's a phone number on it
and they're like, we want you to leave a voice

00:27:18.629 --> 00:27:24.059
mail so when people call this number, you,
you'll, they'll hear your voice.

00:27:24.059 --> 00:27:25.210
And I go, well who has the phone?

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.510
And they're like, it's a hotline.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.059
And I'm like, well why don't you just make
it a cell phone and give it to me and I'll

00:27:31.059 --> 00:27:32.059
answer it.

00:27:32.059 --> 00:27:37.929
'Cause you know Mike Jones, the rapper, he
did that, and so I was like just make it a

00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:39.669
real number and I'll answer it.

00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:43.649
And so they gave me a phone and I have the
phone, so if you call the number a few hours

00:27:43.649 --> 00:27:45.809
a day I try and answer it as much as possible.

00:27:45.809 --> 00:27:49.140
It's actually really fun so I can talk to
fans and stuff.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.140
It's been really fun.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.370
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do people believe it's you?

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:52.599
Do you get a lot of that?

00:27:52.599 --> 00:27:55.369
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Sometimes they don't initially
and then I'm like no, seriously me.

00:27:55.369 --> 00:27:57.460
And then they're like, what are you doing?

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.159
And I'm like, brushing my teeth.

00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:00.580
And they're like, you're boring.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.710
I'm like, OK, sorry.

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:02.710
[laughter]

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.639
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And then sometimes people don't
get that I, that I can't stay on the phone

00:28:05.639 --> 00:28:06.639
like all day.

00:28:06.639 --> 00:28:07.639
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:28:07.639 --> 00:28:08.639
[laughter]

00:28:08.639 --> 00:28:10.860
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: They're like, oh hang on let
me get this friend, hold on, he'll be here

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.729
in like 10 minutes, just hang on the phone.

00:28:12.729 --> 00:28:17.019
I'm like, well I gotta, OK.

00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:18.019
[laughter]

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:21.499
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I was gonna say from the trailer
of The Sitter it really, it really feels like

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:27.100
a character who is kind of a dick at the start
but presumably you have to root for by the

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.769
end of the movie and I was gonna say David
Gordon Green has worked on Eastbound and Down,

00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:31.769
which is

00:28:31.769 --> 00:28:32.769
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Eastbound and Down's one of
the best shows ever.

00:28:32.769 --> 00:28:36.039
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I was kind of, was he a good
collaborator to just push you into that?

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:40.779
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Dave is one of the greatest
people I've ever met in my entire life.

00:28:40.779 --> 00:28:43.529
He's so inspirational.

00:28:43.529 --> 00:28:49.059
He's so funny and weird and interesting and
you know him and Jody Hill and Danny McBride

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:53.019
have this collective, they went to school
together at North Carolina School for the

00:28:53.019 --> 00:28:56.169
Arts or South Carolina School for the Arts,
I can't remember which one.

00:28:56.169 --> 00:29:04.750
North Carolina School for the Arts and they,
they are just so unique and twisted and weird

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:09.440
and messed up and Eastbound and Down is such
a beautiful for me, just I've never, I have

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.870
nothing to do with it, I'm just a fan of it.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.669
I think it's like some of the strongest work
being done right now.

00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:14.669
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sure.

00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:15.669
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:20.389
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And just back to Moneyball
before we get to those internet questions.

00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:22.960
You're obviously in the bay area this weekend,
you're not throwing out the opening pitch

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:23.960
this weekend or anything are you?

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:24.960
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I am.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You are?

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: In Oakland, yeah.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Awesome, nice.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.960
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, I'm very excited.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:29.960
[applause and cheering]

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, it's gonna be really cool.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.960
Thanks for letting me do that.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960
Are you guys A's fans?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960
&gt;&gt;someone in audience: hooo

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.879
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK Got, got weird for a second.

00:29:35.879 --> 00:29:36.879
[laughter]

00:29:36.879 --> 00:29:37.999
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yikes.

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:40.110
OK That's my time.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.789
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I mean how do you spend like
opening weekend for a movie like this?

00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:45.789
How are you gonna?

00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:47.889
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well that's a, well I'm throwing
out the A's game this Sunday and then the

00:29:47.889 --> 00:29:51.240
premier's Monday and then it doesn't come
out until the following Friday, so September

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.059
23, is when Moneyball opens, but I'm excited
to throw the first pitch out.

00:29:55.059 --> 00:29:56.440
That's gonna be really exciting.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.119
And how do I spend the opening weekend?

00:29:58.119 --> 00:29:59.119
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:05.049
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Freaking out until I know how
if I'll be able to work again, financially

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:06.610
based on how the movie did.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:12.880
Hollywood has this really bananas system that
is so different than what you guys at home

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.559
would know about and what I knew about when
I was in high school knowing movies and I

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:24.289
think it's so bizarre, like the first weekend
financial numbers that the movie makes is

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:26.399
so important to these people, you know.

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:32.139
It's like you almost immediately forget about
if you liked the movie or not.

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:35.830
So everyone gets real freaked out and worried
and I just kind of pace around until someone

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.379
calls me and tells me I get to do another
movie again or not.

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:43.629
But I'm so proud of this movie, it's like
I know it will, I know it will live on that

00:30:43.629 --> 00:30:47.820
I don't need to stress, you know, and especially
because Brad Pitt's such a big movie star

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.089
that hopefully that helps in some way.

00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:51.089
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Nice.

00:30:51.089 --> 00:30:52.619
I'm sure you'll do fine.

00:30:52.619 --> 00:30:56.419
So because we're at YouTube one of our standard
questions is really, you know, if and when

00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:59.389
you ever sing in front of a computer looking
at YouTube, what are you looking at?

00:30:59.389 --> 00:31:03.739
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well you know YouTube, not to
blow smoke or whatever, but it's such a big

00:31:03.739 --> 00:31:07.779
part of a writer's room.

00:31:07.779 --> 00:31:12.719
So obviously on movie sets, every movie set
I've been on as an actor, you know during

00:31:12.719 --> 00:31:16.519
'Cyrus', John C. Reilly, like one of the main
ways we bonded was trading YouTube videos

00:31:16.519 --> 00:31:23.149
and you know in the writers' room for Allen
Gregory, the animated show, you know it's

00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:29.049
a bunch of people writing comedy for a TV
show and you know trying to think of things

00:31:29.049 --> 00:31:34.289
that are funny sometimes you need to be inspired
and you need to take breaks, constant, constant

00:31:34.289 --> 00:31:40.589
breaks and procrastination and a lot of it
is just needing, needing a laugh and needing

00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:46.960
something to entertain us in, in, in our writer's
internet, our writer's assistant, he controls

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:54.479
the internet in the room and it's, the home
page is YouTube because it's like, we'll say,

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:58.989
hey, alright, we're not writing anything good,
we haven't, we been stuck on this scene for

00:31:58.989 --> 00:32:00.679
the past hour.

00:32:00.679 --> 00:32:03.609
Pull up blah, blah, blah video and let's laugh
for a second.

00:32:03.609 --> 00:32:08.550
So you know, it's a constant part of my day,
a constant part of the creative process, for

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:14.419
at least my creative process, because you
need breaks in the day that are short, 'cause

00:32:14.419 --> 00:32:17.249
you don't have all the time in the world and
you need short breaks in the day that are

00:32:17.249 --> 00:32:18.950
punchy and can make you entertained.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:24.549
And that's really for me the service that
you guys provide that is really beneficial

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:25.740
to my creative process.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.080
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Cool.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:32.179
So we have some questions that people asked
through the @Google Talks channel.

00:32:32.179 --> 00:32:34.359
One of them is from a guy called Burgers Taste
Good.

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:37.119
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well, that's a great name.

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:38.119
Yes.

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.119
[laughter]

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:40.119
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: He's not wrong there.

00:32:40.119 --> 00:32:44.659
He likes the the game dude channel on YouTube
and he thinks you're great and wants to know

00:32:44.659 --> 00:32:45.659
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Thanks.

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:46.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: would you ever do a video with
the game dude?

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.159
I'm not sure if the game dude is also Burgers
Taste Good.

00:32:49.159 --> 00:32:50.499
He may be asking on behalf of himself.

00:32:50.499 --> 00:32:51.499
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, really?

00:32:51.499 --> 00:33:00.549
I don't know what the game dude is, but burgers
do taste good and I wish him the best in his

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:02.960
hamburger consumption and life.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.960
[laughter]

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:10.039
So Brugger Chick from Seoul in Korea asked
what are your favorite movies, both of your

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:11.489
own and just in general?

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:13.989
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, OK.

00:33:13.989 --> 00:33:17.580
My favorite movies, I mean I'm, I'm a big
cinephile.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.239
Some of my favorite movies of all time.

00:33:20.239 --> 00:33:25.450
My favorite movie is Goodfellas, that's my
favorite movie.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:36.169
Rushmore, Election, Big Lebowski, Groundhog
Day, Midnight Cowboy, Tootsie, The Graduate,

00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:39.259
I mean, all Paul Thomas Anderson's movies,
Adaptation.

00:33:39.259 --> 00:33:46.009
I mean I could go on for a long time and I
won't bore you guys, but I guess some of my

00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:53.500
favorite movies of my own is a very egomaniacal
question to answer and self-centered question

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.159
to answer, but I guess the ones I'm most proud
of, you know I'm really proud of all of them,

00:33:58.159 --> 00:34:04.970
but I guess if I was like going to a space,
country, or like a different planet or something

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:10.669
and I had to say like here's like what I did,
I would probably give them Superbad and Cyrus

00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:11.929
and Moneyball.

00:34:11.929 --> 00:34:13.190
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Nice.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.079
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:20.129
And my one scene in 40-Year-Old Virgin 'cause
I really liked that e-bay store guy.

00:34:20.129 --> 00:34:23.470
I always wondered what happened to that guy.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:24.470
[laughter]

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.470
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:26.470
I was gonna ask you, though, there is a Superbad
question

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:27.940
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: He's wearing those boots, somewhere.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.669
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Where do you think the characters
from Superbad are now?

00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:35.169
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I, well we always talked about
that like if we-, if there was ever gonna

00:34:35.169 --> 00:34:43.389
be another one, and I think the, well, Seth
and Evan wrote that and I guess it's Seth,

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:47.599
so maybe that guy is Seth now.

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:52.220
But we always talked about it like my character
would be living a depressing life in that

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.580
same town and Michael's character [chuckles]
would be like working here, successful and

00:34:56.580 --> 00:35:01.119
happy and my guy would still be like at home
living with his parents.

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:04.930
So that's why we didn't make another one,
because we felt it would be more depressing.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.059
[laughing]

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:07.190
[laughter]

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:14.619
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So Ryan Sescomb from Boomer
in Texas asks, Jonah, you lost some weight

00:35:14.619 --> 00:35:15.789
recently.

00:35:15.789 --> 00:35:19.310
What was the hardest thing to give up and
any advice for anybody else?

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:27.220
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well, the hardest thing to give
up would be burgers, 'cause they taste good.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.519
And any advice?

00:35:29.519 --> 00:35:30.519
I don't know.

00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:34.220
It's just like anything you're gonna do, like
you know when I wanted to become an actor

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:39.200
and start making movies, it was the same kind
of determination, the same kind of thing where

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.401
you're like, you make a decision and you're
like I know this is gonna be difficult, I

00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:47.930
know it's not gonna be the easiest thing in
the world, but I'm determined to do it and

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:52.230
I really care, I'm really caring about this
decision.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.700
So you just make it a priority and, and you
know when anyone's starting out in any business

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.490
or any sort of life endeavor or any sort of
relationship, you're, you're, you're starting

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:06.869
out with the intention to go all the way and
to me it was just a decision and I just made

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:08.349
a commitment to sticking to it.

00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:09.349
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Cool.

00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:10.349
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:11.349
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So.

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:13.230
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Except for all the hummus I
just ate backstage which was

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:14.289
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Delicious and healthy.

00:36:14.289 --> 00:36:16.930
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Hummus, yeah, it was great.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:22.099
Eat a lot of hummus at YouTube, that's my
advice, if you're ever, move to YouTube and

00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:24.690
eat their hummus, that's how you'll stay healthy.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:25.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:26.690
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Right?

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:27.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Absolutely.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:28.690
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Great.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.690
[laughter]

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Elaine Baseball from New York
said

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.250
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: No, seriously, can all of them
move here and eat your hummus all day?

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.470
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: We just opened the second floor,
so yeah, there's more space than there was.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.010
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK, great, wonderful.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.410
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So Elaine Baseball from New
York says, Jonah.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.140
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Seriously, though how much hummus
do you have?

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.140
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Um.

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.380
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Do you have enough for everyone

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.470
on the internet or no?

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.519
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Almost infinity, infinity hummus.

00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.519
[laughter]

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:55.510
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Is it true that there's a whole
'nother YouTube filled with hummus?

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:59.130
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: There is, it comes in a giant
tube every morning and they park it outside.

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.130
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And it's yours?

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:01.130
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: They pipe it in.

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.230
There was a swimming pool downstairs, but
now it's just filled with delicious, delicious

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.230
hummus.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.230
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Hummus.

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:09.760
OK Do you put chlorine in the hummus so you
can swim in it still?

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: [Sigh]

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.740
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: So when people urinate in the
hummus it's not hazardous?

00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.910
[laughter]

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.289
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's why it tasted the way
it did.

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:19.980
I had no idea.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:20.980
[laughter]

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.349
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: So Elaine Baseball from New
York wants to know, Jonah, I want

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:24.451
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Do you like hummus?

00:37:24.451 --> 00:37:25.550
Yes, I do like hummus.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:26.550
[laughter]

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:28.500
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Do you have a favorite flavor
of hummus?

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.500
Just generic?

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.500
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Just YouTube flavor.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: YouTube.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.500
[laughter]

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.970
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: With all those little dogs
on skateboards through it.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:40.910
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Is it true they grind up all
the videos that have stopped gotting getting

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:43.220
hits and they make the hummus out of it?

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.091
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: That's exactly how it's made.

00:37:46.091 --> 00:37:47.890
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: It's made from forgotten YouTube
videos?

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:48.890
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.220
They're, they're not forgotten, they're just
recycled.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:52.580
[laughter]

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.464
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Matter can be created and destroyed.

00:37:54.464 --> 00:37:56.019
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Hummus is cool you guys.

00:37:56.019 --> 00:37:58.869
I love hummus.

00:37:58.869 --> 00:38:00.769
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:01.769
From hummus to hip hop.

00:38:01.769 --> 00:38:02.769
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK Yeah.

00:38:02.769 --> 00:38:03.769
What's the question?

00:38:03.769 --> 00:38:07.540
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: The question from Elaine Baseball
in New York, apparently at one time you were

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.490
talking about being a hip hop producer, was
there some, I don't know if that's true.

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:13.559
You know what happened with that?

00:38:13.559 --> 00:38:15.049
And maybe is that a safe question for myself.

00:38:15.049 --> 00:38:17.200
You have Method Man in this set or so maybe
there was some

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.200
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:24.510
Well when I was in high school I had an MPC
and I would make hip hop beats for fun, but,

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:31.349
and I thought that might have been some sort
of job opportunity, but then I realized I,

00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:42.320
that seemed a lot harder as a 16-year-old
white dude without any like hip hop experience

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.609
at all.

00:38:44.609 --> 00:38:48.770
And I just, you know honestly, I, I grew up
as worshiping hip hop.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.210
I love it.

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:55.380
I love all kinds of music, I'm an audiophile
too, and I just love all different kinds of

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:01.750
music, but I'm a huge hip hop fan and that
was something that I was really interested

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.440
in, but then movies kind of pushed that out
of the way at a certain point.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.829
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And did you have any interactions
with Method Man on the pieces?

00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:11.319
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, yeah, yeah, tons, he's great.

00:39:11.319 --> 00:39:12.319
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah.

00:39:12.319 --> 00:39:13.710
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: He told such cool stories.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:19.920
I mean, for like I mean if my 16-year-old
self or 10-year-old self knew what I was doing

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.910
now and who I would be making movies with
and having experiences with, it would just

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:31.190
be too overwhelming or mind blowing for little
Jonah to understand, you know?

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:36.130
I would sit in my room and listen to Wu Tang
records every night when I got home from school

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:41.970
and, and watch movies and you know to be around
these people it's really inspiring and I just

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.559
try and learn as much as I can from them.

00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:47.119
You know he had so many cool stories about
when they were starting out and what that

00:39:47.119 --> 00:39:50.790
was like and for me that's like heaven to
hear about all that stuff.

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:57.109
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: And kind of connected to that,
Eso, I can't even pronounce it, E-S-O-E-Z-T-V

00:39:57.109 --> 00:40:02.371
said like you developed a stand-up act when
you were working on Funny People, which I

00:40:02.371 --> 00:40:05.490
guess is a similar kind of an on-stage microphone
kind of thing.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.369
Is that something you're gonna go back to,
or was that

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:08.369
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Never, never,

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:09.369
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Never, no?

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:10.369
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: never, never, no.

00:40:10.369 --> 00:40:15.130
I'm an actor [laughing] and stand-up is a
whole different art form and I think it's

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:21.180
arrogant, it would be arrogant of me to assume
like I can just go do stand-up, you know,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.300
because I've been in some funny movies, or
whatever, you know.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.260
Like guys like Chris Rock and Louis C.K.,
they're, they're brilliant at what they do

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.720
and it's just a different art form, you know.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.839
And I'm was an actor playing a stand-up in
Funny People and I had to develop a stand-up

00:40:34.839 --> 00:40:39.700
act and it was to this day probably the hardest
thing I'd ever had to do to prepare for a

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:44.410
movie because I went out for six months and
you know it takes people, honestly it takes

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:50.040
years to get great at being a stand-up comedian
and for me I love bouncing off of people,

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.880
whether it's in a dramatic scene or a comedic
scene, and in stand-up you're alone on stage

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.450
with a microphone saying, please laugh at
me.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.069
And it's terrifying, you know?

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:01.530
[chuckles] It's really terrifying.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:08.690
So I, it was such a courage, it gave me a
lot of courage as a performer, like practicing

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:13.040
for that, but I, I'll leave that to the guys
and women that are, that are brilliant at

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.040
it.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Cool.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.609
We have a couple more internet questions but
we also have a couple of mics here on either

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:23.740
side, so if anybody has a question maybe you
could start making your way to the mic.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:27.510
I Love Mostly Anything Two says have you ever
been stung by a bee?

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.740
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: What was the first part of the
question?

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:34.730
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I, no the person who asked
the question is I Love Mostly Anything Two,

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.450
'cause mostly anything one was taken obviously.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:37.450
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.730
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Have you ever been stung by
a bee?

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.009
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I have been stung by a bee.

00:41:41.009 --> 00:41:42.019
[laughter]

00:41:42.019 --> 00:41:45.029
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yep.

00:41:45.029 --> 00:41:47.039
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:41:47.039 --> 00:41:49.170
Mongo Man One from Michigan wants to know
if

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:50.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I know him.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.170
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You do?

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.010
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: He apparently couldn't ask
you this in person and decided to ask you

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.010
this via the internet.

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.010
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:58.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Have you ever considered being
a song and dance man?

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.329
Could you see yourself in a musical opposite
Hugh Jackman?

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:08.869
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I don't know about opposite
Hugh Jackman, but I'd love to be in a musical.

00:42:08.869 --> 00:42:14.810
I love to, you know John C. Reilly in Chicago
or something like that or maybe like Little

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.460
Shop of Horrors, you know something, something
like that.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:21.420
They've actually talked to me about some musical
stuff and I would never like be one of those

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:26.060
actors who releases an album or anything stupid
like that, but I would, I would love to be

00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.250
in like a musical movie or maybe a play sometime,
it would be really fun.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.250
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:34.970
Your final internet question, also from Mongo
Man One, he left several, do you have an opinion

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:36.740
on the designated batter rule?

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.930
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I'm OK with it.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You're OK with it?

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.930
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:41.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:42.930
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I don't lose sleep over it.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:43.930
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: You don't lose sleep, fair
enough.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:45.700
Do you want to start taking some questions?

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Sure.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.700
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.700
Thanks for coming.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.700
I, we saw Moneyball the other night and thought
it was great.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.960
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Thanks.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:56.020
&gt;&gt;female #1: I too am a fan of the hummus,
so I'm gonna bring it back, actually had it

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.020
for snack time today.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.529
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I love hummus-based questions.

00:42:58.529 --> 00:42:59.529
[laughter]

00:42:59.529 --> 00:43:03.589
&gt;&gt;female #1: So, since there's plain and spicy,
I'm wondering which one you had.

00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:04.790
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I had plain.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.310
&gt;&gt;female audience member #1: OK

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:10.210
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: You know my feelings on it,
but I imagine that there's also a place in

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:11.319
my heart for spicy hummus.

00:43:11.319 --> 00:43:14.589
&gt;&gt;female #1: And did you have the carrots
or chips or what was your dipper?

00:43:14.589 --> 00:43:18.859
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Well, what I did was, now I'm
gonna throw a real curve ball at you right

00:43:18.859 --> 00:43:19.859
now.

00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:22.319
I didn't dip anything into the hummus.

00:43:22.319 --> 00:43:23.319
[laughter]

00:43:23.319 --> 00:43:24.319
&gt;&gt;female audience member #1: OK

00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:25.319
[laughter]

00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:26.319
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And, I didn't eat the hummus
plain.

00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:31.789
What I did was, was there was a salad there
that had like garbanzo beans and tomatoes

00:43:31.789 --> 00:43:39.430
and onions and I put the hummus on top of
it and smushed it all around and ate that

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.430
and it was so cool.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.430
[laughter]

00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:42.430
&gt;&gt;female #1: Alright, thank you.

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:44.500
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Isn't that why you guys are
watching this, right now?

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.500
[laughter]

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.650
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: So that's my recommendation
is mix your hummus with stuff, mix it up,

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.599
get crazy out there, internet, you know.

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:55.250
Don't, don't just dip stuff in your hummus,
make your hummus what you want it to be.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.250
Swim in it.

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.250
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Nice.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.250
Do you want to kind of go back and forth,
take both sides?

00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:59.250
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, sure, yeah.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.250
&gt;&gt;male #1: How's it going?

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.250
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Hey.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:03.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: I'd like to start off by saying
you should mix the spicy and regular hummus.

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:04.630
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:05.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: That's the way to go.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:06.630
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Mild.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.630
Make your own mild hummus.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.630
[laughter]

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:09.630
&gt;&gt;male #1: Exactly.

00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:10.630
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Right.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:12.240
&gt;&gt;male #1: So I heard a rumor that there was
a lot of prank pulling on the set of Moneyball?

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yes.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.670
&gt;&gt;male #1: And I heard a lot of that was on
Brad Pitt's side.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.769
I was wondering if you got him back at all?

00:44:17.769 --> 00:44:21.960
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: They, OK, so there were a lot
of pranks on the Moneyball set.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.599
Ninety-four percent of them were Brad directed
at me.

00:44:25.599 --> 00:44:26.599
[laughter]

00:44:26.599 --> 00:44:30.599
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: He got me really good.

00:44:30.599 --> 00:44:35.339
I had this golf cart that I was really excited
about because I felt that it was a symbol

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:39.619
that I had finally become successful that
they gave me my own golf cart.

00:44:39.619 --> 00:44:44.349
So just him and I had our own golf carts to
drive around the set and stuff, so we would

00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:47.539
race and smash into each other and it was
really fun.

00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:52.089
And he knew how much I cared about this golf
cart, and so we would go do like a really

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:56.171
serious scene and then I'd walk out and like
the golf cart would have no wheels on it,

00:44:56.171 --> 00:44:57.220
it would be on cinder blocks.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.220
[laughter]

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.319
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And he would just walk outside
and smile and he was in the scene with me,

00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:03.210
which means he has little prank elves that
like

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:04.210
[laughter]

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:06.270
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: do this stuff while you're working.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:10.599
And then I'd walk out another time and it'd
be completely upside down.

00:45:10.599 --> 00:45:15.250
And then I'd walk out another time and there'd
be male genitalia, fake male genitalia hanging

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:16.980
from the back of it.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.730
And then one time I was driving my actual
car home and my friend was driving behind

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:25.069
me and called me and said, hey, I'm driving
behind you, there's pink male genitalia hanging

00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:26.490
from the back of your car.

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:27.490
[laughter]

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:33.019
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And then I got an e-mail from
him, saying, how was the drive home?

00:45:33.019 --> 00:45:38.769
And then eventually he became obsessed with
me being obsessed with the band Wham, which

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:43.400
he just, made it, made it clear that he thought
I liked the band Wham.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.400
[laughter]

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.519
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: And so I'd walk into my character's
office and there'd be a framed Wham poster

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:53.190
in there instead of a framed Oakland poster
and then my golf cart got wrapped in all pink,

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:54.570
you know like car wraps?

00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:00.710
And then there was the time when there was
a Photoshop picture of me and him as the two

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:06.510
members of Wham on the front and it said,
Jonah Hill #1 Wham Fan and then on the side

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.069
it said Wham Mobile.

00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:14.680
And then the final prank was every time I
turned on the engine, he had it rigged so

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.000
it blasted Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
[laughter]

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.290
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: At full volume on a loop anytime
I had an engine on.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:26.539
So if I had a meeting with an executive at
Sony or something, I would have to drive over

00:46:26.539 --> 00:46:29.329
there in this, this golf cart.

00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:30.329
[laughter]

00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:31.799
&gt;&gt;male #1: But you never got him back?

00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:35.940
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I did but I'm gonna be on Letterman
on Tuesday and I'm waiting to show my pranks

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.490
back on him there, no offense.

00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:38.650
&gt;&gt;male #1: I respect that.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.650
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:40.730
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Moving on, question over here.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:41.730
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yes.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.819
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hey, so big fan.

00:46:42.819 --> 00:46:46.470
One of the things that I love about your movies
is that you seem to have this like really

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:50.900
great relationship with a lot of the other
comedians, you know, and I'm just wondering

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.369
is that just great acting or you know is there
something [inaudible]

00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:55.800
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yes, I hated all, all of them.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.950
They're all terrible people.

00:46:56.950 --> 00:47:00.309
&gt;&gt;male audience member #2: So how is it working
with like you know it seems like a tight-knit

00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:01.309
group of [inaudible]

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:05.540
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, you know like Paul Rudd
and Michael Cera and Seth Rogen and Jason

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:11.579
Segel and Danny McBride and all these guys,
and Franko, and all, all these people you

00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:19.670
know a lot of us came up together, you know,
started together and it was a lot of us became

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.089
successful at the same time and with each
other.

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:26.499
So what I liked about that a lot and we're
all still friends, but it's been interesting

00:47:26.499 --> 00:47:31.220
because now we've all, we're all doing our
own movies kind of thing, so it's not as much

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:36.730
as like a gang, and not because we don't still
love each other and wanna make movies together

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.630
all the time, which we do, but everyone's
kind of following their dream that they had

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.859
independently before.

00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:49.630
And now it's kind of hard since we all became
actually employable, before we were unemployable,

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:51.599
so it's like, hey you guys wanna all be in
a movie together?

00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:53.240
We're like, hell yeah.

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.270
But now we're all employable, so we'll take
a movie and then someone else will take a

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:01.569
movie and the schedules, the schedules are
really hard to align and have all the planets

00:48:01.569 --> 00:48:03.250
align all at once.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:07.549
But they're, all those guys, are the greatest
group of guys ever.

00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:09.109
I mean they're all so funny.

00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:13.890
And if we're ever somewhere and one of us
sees the other one, it does feel like we gravitate

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:18.999
towards one another, and hang out with each
other at that party or whatever it would be.

00:48:18.999 --> 00:48:24.231
And I don't know, I really look at that time
as my college experience, you know, because

00:48:24.231 --> 00:48:29.490
my early 20s were spent with this really fun
group of guys making each other laugh.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:30.950
Yeah.

00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:33.109
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Any more takers?

00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:34.180
&gt;&gt;female #2: [inaudible]

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:35.180
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.789
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I'm not gonna twist your arm,
you know.

00:48:37.789 --> 00:48:38.789
&gt;&gt;female #2: Alright, fine, OK.

00:48:38.789 --> 00:48:39.789
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yes the hummus was great.

00:48:39.789 --> 00:48:40.789
&gt;&gt;female #2: I'm also a huge Wham fan.

00:48:40.789 --> 00:48:41.789
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK, yeah.

00:48:41.789 --> 00:48:42.789
&gt;&gt;female #2: What's your favorite song?

00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:43.789
That's not my question, but I'm just curious.

00:48:43.789 --> 00:48:44.789
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, I'm not actually a Wham
fan.

00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:45.789
&gt;&gt;female #2: Oh, that's the whole point then.

00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:46.789
Oh I am, a card-carrying

00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:50.160
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: That was the joke was that he
decided I was a Wham fan.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:55.900
I have nothing, I don't even understand, I
think Wham is probably awesome.

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:57.700
I only know that one song.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.510
I know like the big T-shirt with the sayings
on it.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:02.060
&gt;&gt;female #2: You know there's a song where
they rap, it's really good.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.060
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, really?

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.060
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yeah, you should check it out.

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.259
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Alright, well I gotta get on
that.

00:49:05.259 --> 00:49:09.480
&gt;&gt;female #2: Well I was, I saw the movie Get
Him to the Greek which I'm a big fan of because

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, thanks.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.700
&gt;&gt;female #2: because I used to be an assistant
to a minor English musical celebrity.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.700
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:19.210
&gt;&gt;female #2: And so it reminded me a lot of
myself, your character.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.990
Do you have any tips for, I'm an assistant
here, but it's not the same, it's not as bad.

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:24.480
Do you have tips for

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.529
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: They don't make you shove heroin
up your bum?

00:49:26.529 --> 00:49:27.529
[laughter]

00:49:27.529 --> 00:49:30.410
&gt;&gt;female #2: No comment.

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:31.410
[laughter]

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:33.519
&gt;&gt;female #2: I plead the fifth.

00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:38.499
Would you have any tips for anything you learned
on set when you were filming that for someone

00:49:38.499 --> 00:49:40.690
who has to take care of a celebrity?

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.930
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Are you calling your boss a
crazy person?

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:46.589
&gt;&gt;female #2: No, not my boss here, but you
know maybe in the past.

00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:47.589
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Sure.

00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:49.799
&gt;&gt;female #2: Any tips for dealing with a minor
celebrity?

00:49:49.799 --> 00:49:52.170
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah, I don't know, somewhere
else man.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:53.170
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yeah.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.170
Just winky face, winky face.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:59.430
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: It was at WhoWhube, another
company you worked at right before this?

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.430
I don't know.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.809
I guess you'd have to ask these guys who work
with me.

00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:05.170
&gt;&gt;female #2: How was it working with Seth?

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:10.910
I mean Seth, oh Jonah, sorry, oh I guess I
just got in my head earlier.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:11.910
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:12.910
No, it's OK.

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.109
I don't know, I think working with me's probably
pretty easy.

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:20.670
I think Russell Brand's character was probably
a really big exaggeration of, of what that

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:21.670
was like.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:25.240
I've never worked for a rock star, so I don't,
I don't really know, but I imagine that's

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.819
a really arduous task.

00:50:27.819 --> 00:50:28.819
&gt;&gt;female #2: Alright.

00:50:28.819 --> 00:50:29.819
Thank you.

00:50:29.819 --> 00:50:30.819
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Thank you.

00:50:30.819 --> 00:50:31.819
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: OK, Jonah.

00:50:31.819 --> 00:50:34.890
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Oh, wait, this girl was about
to stand up.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:36.119
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Sorry, my apologies.

00:50:36.119 --> 00:50:40.859
&gt;&gt;female #3: Do you have a girlfriend and
if so does she like hummus as much as you?

00:50:40.859 --> 00:50:44.839
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I am dating hummus currently.

00:50:44.839 --> 00:50:51.670
It's a giant gelatinous hummus person that
I've carved out of hummus and we're engaged,

00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:52.670
so.

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:58.740
No, you know, I try not to talk about like
my family or friends or stuff like that because,

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:07.289
because you know I signed up to be doing this
and it's crazy if you are pulled into something

00:51:07.289 --> 00:51:09.999
that you didn't sign up for, you know what
I mean?

00:51:09.999 --> 00:51:15.260
But I am dating someone, yes, and she's made
of hummus

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.260
[laughter]

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.690
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: and she's great.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:19.690
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: She's delicious, I'm sure.

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:20.690
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: She's frozen hummus.

00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:21.690
I mean what's not to love?

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:25.089
It's hummus but it's freezing cold.

00:51:25.089 --> 00:51:27.269
Why did this become the centerpiece of this
interview?

00:51:27.269 --> 00:51:29.940
Why do I regret doing this? [laughing]

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.940
[laughter]

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.440
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I think there's more back there.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:34.450
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK, cool, I'm looking forward
to it.

00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:36.410
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: As we've established there's
infinite hummus.

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.630
So to wrap up, Jonah, do you have any final
thoughts about Moneyball that you want to

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:41.630
share?

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:47.609
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: I just think it's a really wonderful
moving movie and it's, it's a rare treat for

00:51:47.609 --> 00:51:53.349
me to get to be a part of a movie like this
and I'm just really, really proud of it and

00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:57.540
thank you guys for watching or coming to this
and if you want to see a good movie September

00:51:57.540 --> 00:52:00.509
23, go see Moneyball, it won't let you down.

00:52:00.509 --> 00:52:01.509
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Excellent, well

00:52:01.509 --> 00:52:02.509
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Yeah.

00:52:02.509 --> 00:52:04.820
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: I just ask everybody then to
thank me in or join me in thanking you for

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:05.820
being here Jonah.

00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:06.820
[laughter]

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:07.820
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: OK cool.

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.820
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: Yeah, could you also thank
me for that?

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.820
No.

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:10.820
&gt;&gt;Jonah Hill: Awesome.
