00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:13.090
Hiii, Mmmm… what was your name again?

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.139
Hi guys, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.789
It’s happened to all of us - we’re at
the sandwich shop and run into an acquaintance

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.419
that we met once before at a dinner party
- and we know we know them, but can’t remember

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.419
their name.

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.400
As embarrassed as you might feel, you should
perhaps instead marvel at the fact that you

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.420
remember them at all - having seen their face
only once before.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
Humans are phenomenal at remembering faces.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.730
Face processing is super-fast, efficient,
and incredibly useful.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.750
We use it to recognize people, but also to
identify their emotional states, communicate

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.059
with them, and figure out where they’re
looking.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.030
These are all evolutionarily advantageous
because they help us determine how to behave

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.309
towards other people as well as how to respond
to our surroundings.

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.149
And scientists have found that processing
faces, specifically, works differently than

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:00.820
processing other things we see.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.580
When we look at something, our eyes take in
visual information through the retina and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.200
then send it to the occipital cortex.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.369
Where it goes from there, depends on what
you’re looking at.

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.070
With faces, there are multiple areas that
seem to be responsible for processing: primarily

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.369
the inferotemporal cortex, fusiform face area,
occipital face area, and the superior temporal

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.369
sulcus.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.840
They’re each involved in slightly different
functions, that together, help us process

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
faces.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.600
The occipital face area seems to be involved
in recognizing parts of faces - like a nose,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.469
eyes, or mouth - whereas the fusiform face
area seems to configure these parts to help

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.170
us figure out it if it’s a face or just
some lonely Mr.Potato part leftover from your

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.840
little cousins play session.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.409
We know this because of studies - like this
one conducted by neuroscientists from the

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.390
University of Louvain, Belgium.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.040
They used FMRI technology to compare activity
of different brain regions as they respond

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.000
to images of either facial features or full
faces...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.870
And, as one would predict, found that the
occipital face area lit up more with individual

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.260
features than with full faces.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.500
Once we know it’s a face we’re looking
at, the superior temporal sulcus seems to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.550
help us determine its emotions - whether the
person is sad, angry, happy - It also seems

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.570
to help us read lips to help determine what’s
being said.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.090
Think of being in a loud crowded bar - our
STS is super helpful with that.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.680
One main way researchers have been able to
figure this out is by studying people who

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.840
have suffered brain injury - like a stroke
- and who have lost their ability to perceive

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.700
faces - a condition called prosopagnosia.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.150
By looking at which areas are damaged, scientists
get clues about what those areas are responsible

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.150
for.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.670
But, more recently, a team at Stanford was
able to specifically induce the loss of facial

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.530
recognition by stimulating the brain.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.780
In their study published in the Journal of
Neuroscience, researchers implanted electrodes

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.280
on a patient’s brain - he was suffering
from epilepsy so this was medically necessary

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.350
for his treatment - it wasn’t just a case
of hey let’s cut you open to find out more

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.780
about face perception.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.890
But it did present the opportunity to learn
more about it.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.650
The researchers found that when they interrupted
normal activity by sending low grade electrical

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.280
pulses to two specific nerve clusters in the
fusiform gyrus, the patient lost his ability

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.560
to see faces.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.280
He explained that the doctor’s face warped,
was unrecognizable, and his features seemed

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280
to melt.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.130
But he could still see everything else clearly.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.310
So it’s pretty clear that our brains have
specialized tools for facial recognition.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.050
But this doesn’t mean this system is perfect.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.610
We’re much better at recognizing faces that
are familiar versus unfamiliar.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.520
Anthony runs down the many reasons why your
memory is flawed, in this episode here.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:52.100
What do you 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.470
do when you know you know someone but can’t
their name?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.470
Do you have any tips you’d like to share
with us?
