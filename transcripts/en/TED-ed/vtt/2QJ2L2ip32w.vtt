00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.771
One of the kingdom’s
most prosperous merchants

00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:13.391
has been exposed for his corrupt dealings.

00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:14.941
Nearly all of his riches

00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:16.601
are invested in a collection

00:00:16.601 --> 00:00:19.501
of 30 exquisite Burmese rubies,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.191
and the crowd in the square

00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:23.261
is clamoring for their confiscation

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:25.561
to reimburse his victims.

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.131
But the scoundrel and his allies at court

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:29.741
have made a convincing case

00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:31.451
that at least some of his wealth

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.191
was obtained legitimately,

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.891
and through good service to the crown.

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:37.580
The king ponders for a minute

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.300
and announces his judgment.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.920
Because there’s no way to know

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.530
which portion of the rubies 
were bought with ill-gotten wealth,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.740
the fine will be determined through 
a game of wits between the merchant

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.390
and the king’s most clever advisor – you.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.660
You’re both told the rules in advance.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.890
The merchant will be allowed to
discreetly divide his rubies

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.530
among three boxes, which
will then be placed in front of you.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.380
You will be given three cards,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.520
and must write a number 
between 1 and 30 on each,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.080
before putting a card in
front of each of the boxes.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.060
The boxes will then all be opened.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.460
For each box, you will receive exactly

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.430
as many rubies as the number written
on the corresponding card,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.830
if the box has that many.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.790
But if your number is greater than 
the number of rubies actually there,

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.910
the scoundrel gets to keep the entire box.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.840
The king puts just two constraints on how
the scoundrel distributes his rubies.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.341
Each box must contain at least two rubies

00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:45.321
and one of the boxes must contain 
exactly six more rubies than another—

00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.641
but you won’t know which boxes those are.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.647
After a few minutes of deliberation,

00:01:50.647 --> 00:01:54.767
the merchant hides the gems, 
and the boxes are brought in front of you.

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:56.608
Which numbers should you choose

00:01:56.608 --> 00:02:00.482
in order to guarantee the largest possible
fine for the scoundrel

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:03.130
and the greatest compensation 
for his victims?

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.560
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.497
Answer in 3

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:09.641
Answer in 2

00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:11.431
Answer in 1

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:14.486
You don’t want to overshoot
by being too greedy.

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.636
But there is a way you can guarantee

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:20.006
to get more than half of the scoundrel’s 
stash.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.026
The situation resembles an 
adversarial game like chess –

00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:27.676
only here you can’t see the 
opponent’s position.

00:02:27.676 --> 00:02:31.356
To figure out the minimum number of rubies
you’re guaranteed to win,

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:34.086
you need to look for the worst case
scenario,

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.506
as if the merchant already knew your move

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:40.346
and could arrange the rubies 
to minimize your winnings.

00:02:40.346 --> 00:02:44.796
Because you have no way of knowing which
boxes will have more or fewer rubies,

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:47.636
you should pick the same number for each.

00:02:47.636 --> 00:02:49.726
Suppose you write three 9’s.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:54.436
The scoundrel might have allocated the
rubies as 8, 14 and 8.

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:59.246
In that case, you’d receive 9 from the
middle box and no others.

00:02:59.246 --> 00:03:02.616
On the other hand, you can be
sure that at least two boxes

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.747
have a minimum of 8 rubies.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:05.867
Here’s why.

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:08.174
We’ll start by assuming the opposite,

00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:10.884
that two boxes have 7 or fewer.

00:03:10.884 --> 00:03:13.394
Those could not be the two that 
differ by 6,

00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:16.794
because every box must have 
at least 2 rubies.

00:03:16.794 --> 00:03:23.672
In that case, the third box would have at
most 13 rubies—that’s 7 plus 6.

00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:25.842
Add up all three of those boxes,

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.742
and the most that could equal is 27.

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:30.476
Since that’s less than 30,

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.386
this scenario isn’t possible.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:35.696
You now know, by what’s called
a proof by contradiction,

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:39.356
that two of the boxes have 
8 or more rubies.

00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:42.073
If you ask for 8 from all three boxes

00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:44.383
you’ll receive at least 16—

00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:46.583
and that’s the best you can guarantee,

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:51.743
as you can see by thinking again
about the 8, 14, 8 scenario.

00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:54.503
You’ve recovered more than half the 
scoundrel’s fortune

00:03:54.503 --> 00:03:56.633
as restitution for the public.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:59.903
And though he’s managed to hold
on to some of his rubies,

00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:03.723
his fortune has definitely 
lost some of its shine.
