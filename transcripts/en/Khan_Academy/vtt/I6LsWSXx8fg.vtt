00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.640
In the last video we saw that
the two chair shapes, or the

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.080
two chair configurations
of just plain vanilla

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.370
cyclohexane, were
equally stable.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.560
There was nothing that would
imply that this is more stable

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.190
than that or vice versa.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.610
What we want to do in this video
is address what happens

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.090
if, instead of just a pure
cyclohexane, what if we added

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.290
a methyl group to it?

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.290
And so instead of just a
cyclohexane, let's think about

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.740
a methylcyclohexane, so we know
what to do when we're

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.520
naming things.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.720
So methylcyclohexane will
look like that.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.340
We'll have a hexagon here.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.990
This is the way we've been
drawing it historically.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.860
We've been drawing it
just like that.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.180
And then we'll have
a methyl group.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.040
And you could literally just
draw a methyl group like this

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.120
or maybe like this.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.030
And by implication, you have a
carbon here, essentially a CH3

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.950
group here, and, of course,
you have another hydrogen

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.070
bonded here.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.360
Now, if you were to draw this
methyl group in three

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.350
dimensions like this, it would
look just like our different

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.980
chair positions before, but
instead of this H being just

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.220
an H, we could make this entire
methyl group, so we

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.200
could turn this CH3 right here,
so this-- let me draw it

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.010
out in a different color.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.850
We could make this carbon that
implicitly has three hydrogens

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.360
on it, so this is a CH3 group
that is a methyl group that's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.170
right there.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.670
We could substitute one of these
hydrogens with it, and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.250
then this would be one
of the shapes of this

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.250
methylcyclohexane, CH3.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.410
Let me write it down, just
to practice our naming.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.660
So this is methylcyclohexane.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.660
Now, this is one of their chair
positions, and then if

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.880
this were to flip down and the
other side were to flip up,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.120
the other chair position would
take this methyl group from

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.690
being in an axial position,
and it would put it in an

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.950
equatorial position.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.700
So this is the same
group right here.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.740
Let me put a circle around it.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.230
It's a whole group.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.840
That's the CH3.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.880
Now, the question we want to
answer in this video, is one

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.610
of these two configurations
going to be more stable?

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.960
Now, you might just be able to
eyeball it looking at this

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.620
diagram, and say, hey, when
we're in the position where

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.780
the methyl group is in the axial
position, it's going to

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.300
be closer to all of these
other carbons over here,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.920
closer to their electron
clouds.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.710
Maybe it has higher
potential energy.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.080
Maybe it'll want
to spring away.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.470
And if that was what you're
guessing or what you're kind

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.560
of eyeballing, you'd be right,
because in this position, this

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.220
methyl is much further away
from all of the stuff out

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.620
here, so there'll be less, I
guess you can consider it,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.680
electron cloud crowding,
if you will.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.420
Now, to see that a little bit
more clear, I want to do what

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.590
we call a double
Newman diagram.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.420
And really, that's the whole
motivation of this video is to

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.540
kind of expose you to that.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.260
A Newman diagram isn't just
useful for simple things like

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.790
a butane or an ethane.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.810
You can actually do it
with cyclical rings.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.110
And to do the Newman diagram,
let me number these carbons.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.430
So we could number
them like this.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.020
So this is carbon one, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.960
And you don't have to call this
one methylcyclohexane,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.370
because whenever you have only
one group attached to the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.760
ring, you implicitly start
numbering at the carbon that

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.820
the group is attached.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.570
So that is the one
carbon over here.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.030
This is the one carbon, two,
three, four, five, six.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.740
And over here, once again, is
the one carbon, two, three,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.850
four, five, six.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.580
Now, what I want to do is draw
two Newman projections, and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.070
both of them will involve--
well, actually, I'll draw

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.240
four, but you'll see what I'm
talking about in a second.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.030
So the first Newman projection,
I'm going to start

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.610
at that carbon right
over there.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.220
So let's think about what
that would look like.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.230
So we're at the front.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.100
We're staring straight
on to that carbon.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.280
So this carbon's in the front,
this carbon over here.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.610
This carbon, carbon number
two, is in the back.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.470
So let me label this.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.550
This is carbon number one that
we're looking head on.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.150
Now, right in the axial
position you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.170
have that methyl group.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.800
So let me draw that.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.910
So in the axial position you
have that methyl group right

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.810
over there.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.630
And then in the equatorial
position right here, you have

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.626
this hydrogen.

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:16.190
Let me draw that.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.700
So you have this hydrogen.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.709
And then over here, this bond
right over here, this gets us

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.520
to another CH2 group.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.450
Let me draw that like this.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.240
So that gets us to
another CH2.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.800
That's a CH2 right
there, right?

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.280
Or maybe I should circle
it like this.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.580
This whole thing is a CH2.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.660
So it's bonded to the carbon,
but the carbon has two

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.700
hydrogens on it.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.540
And this is actually
carbon number six.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.460
So this is the front.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.260
Now, if we're staring straight
and carbon number two is right

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.460
behind it-- let me draw
carbon number two.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.050
I'll do it in this blue color.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.040
So carbon number two,
that bigger circle.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.200
Now carbon number two, what's
going on over there?

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.990
It has a hydrogen in the axial
position going straight down.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.660
This hydrogen right
over there.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.680
And it has another hydrogen
going equatorial.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.440
So this green hydrogen right
here is going equatorial.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.970
It looks like that.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.920
And then it connects to
carbon number three,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.060
which is another CH2.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.060
It has two hydrogens branching
off of it.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.340
In front, we have carbon
number one.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.692
In the back, we have
carbon number two.

00:05:27.692 --> 00:05:30.040
Let me color code it
a little better.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.670
Carbon number two.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.710
And then carbon number two
branches off to-- so if you

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.850
think of this branch right here,
that's carbon number two

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.440
branching off to carbon number
three, or CH3 right there.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.200
Let me do that in a new color.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.400
So this is actually
a CH2 group.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.130
That's a CH2.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.350
This is a carbon, and it has
two hydrogens, right?

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.430
So this is a CH2.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.170
This is carbon number
three right there.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.920
And then that goes-- and
actually, I'll pause there.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.230
What I'll do now is I'll draw
another Newman projection, but

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.190
for this Newman projection,
we'll be looking straight on

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.830
our carbon number five.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.540
We're going to see we're going
to form a ring because the

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.130
first Newman projection
we just did

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.430
essentially covers this bond.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.010
This bond is sitting straight
into the screen the way I did

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.410
it right now.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.870
Carbon number two is directly
behind carbon number one.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.670
So I guess the opposite side of
the ring is five to four.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.070
If you look at, here, one to two
is there, and then five to

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.110
four is just like that.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.230
So you can imagine when we're
doing the Newman projections,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.920
we're looking straight on here
on the left Newman projection.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.370
We're going to look straight in
that direction on the right

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.370
Newman projection.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.400
So if we have carbon number five
in front, what are its

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.880
bonds going to look like?

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.650
Well, it's going to bond to
carbon number six over here.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.070
So we can make this right--
let me do that

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.450
in a different color.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.180
This right here, this bond right
here is this bond right

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.190
here to that same CH2 that
our first Newman

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.760
projection bonded to.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.070
And then he's going to
have two hydrogens.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.030
I haven't drawn them here.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.760
Let me draw them, just
so you can see them.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.420
It's going to have two
hydrogens, one in an axial

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.310
position and one in an
equatorial position.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.425
It's hard to see now, but he's
going to have one hydrogen in

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:28.260
an axial and one in an
equatorial position.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.740
And then in the back
we're going to draw

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.710
carbon number four.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.570
And carbon number four, I will
do in this green color.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.140
So carbon number four--
actually, , well, yeah I'll do

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.580
carbon number four in
that green color.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.720
This is really just an exercise
in visualization.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.990
That's why I wanted
to do it with you.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.480
So carbon number four has an
axial hydrogen, so it has a

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.790
hydrogen pointing
straight down.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.470
That hydrogen is
that hydrogen.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.240
It has an equatorial hydrogen
going out like that.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.890
And then it bonds to carbon
number three.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:08:01.110
So this bond right here is
this bond just like that.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.580
So what do we see immediately
when we

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.050
draw this chair position?

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.070
When our methyl group
is in the axial

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.140
position, what do we see?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.810
Methyl in axial position.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.930
We see that it's gauche,
or gowche.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.490
I don't know the best
way to pronounce it.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.810
It's only 60 degrees away from
carbon number three.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.010
This is only 60 degrees,
or a dihedral angle.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.130
When you use the Newman
projection, this is only a

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.580
60-degree angle.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:38.309
It is gauche to carbon
number three.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.880
So maybe they're crowding
each other a little bit.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.070
Let's compare it to the
situation where our methyl

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:48.010
group is equatorial, where the
carbon that it's attached to

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.490
is on the down part
of the chair.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.920
Let's see what that Newman
projection looks like.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.300
So same thing.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.480
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.570
So this is this configuration
and it's in equilibrium with

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.670
this configuration right here.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.200
We'll do the exact
same exercise.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.050
Carbon number one.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.080
But now carbon number one, in
carbon number one right here,

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:15.250
the hydrogen is now axial and
it's pointing straight down.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.570
Let me draw that.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.830
So we have a hydrogen pointing
straight down now.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:27.490
Hydrogen's pointing down and
now the CH3 is in an

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.910
equatorial position, which you
can see more clearly on this

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.520
than over here.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.010
So you have a CH3.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.140
The methyl group
is right there.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.930
And now this bond to
carbon number six

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.180
will look like this.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.890
So you have a CH2.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.260
This is number six
right over there.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.510
And now if we were to go to
the back, if we were go to

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.490
carbon number two in the back,
which we had done in the blue

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.130
color before, so I'll do it
in the blue color again.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.600
Carbon number two in black, it
has a hydrogen in the axial

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.460
position going straight up.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.650
That's that hydrogen
right there.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.740
It has a hydrogen going
straight up.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.420
It has another hydrogen over
here, and then it bonds to

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:17.390
carbon number three in the
back, so CH2 over here.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:19.340
So this guy's the same thing
as this guy, but now we've

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.940
flipped configurations, so he
bonds to that guy in the back.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.840
And now we do the Newman diagram
looking straight on to

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.870
carbon number five, or looking,
actually, straight on

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.310
to-- right, carbon
number five.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.180
So we're looking straight in
this direction for this Newman

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.650
projection.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.100
Now we're going to look straight
in this direction for

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.670
our other Newman projection.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:46.200
So carbon number five, if we
draw it in the front-- I

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.890
haven't drawn it here, but it
has a hydrogen at the axial

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:50.785
position, and it has
a hydrogen in

00:10:50.785 --> 00:10:52.400
the equatorial position.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.430
So carbon number five, if we
look at this, and this is

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.800
really-- if you're getting a
little stressed out about this

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.490
because it's a little hard
to understand, you

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.360
might want to rewatch.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.590
This is really just an example
of visualizations.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.480
I really hope this isn't
confusing you.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.950
If you find this really
daunting, this isn't going to

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.130
really trip you up in the rest
of organic chemistry, but if

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:15.200
you can get it, it's
even better.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.030
You'll be that much better
at visualizing

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.720
some of these molecules.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.240
So if we look straight on at
carbon number five, we have a

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.820
hydrogen in the axial position
coming straight down.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.000
It is bonded.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.180
Carbon number five is bonded to
carbon number six, which is

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.150
right over there.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:42.450
So let me make it very clear.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.880
So this bond right here,
I want to do it

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.070
in a different color.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.330
This bond it right here is the
same thing as this one.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.990
This is a really good way to--
if you can do this, then your

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.490
brain is pretty good at
translating between Newman

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.090
projections and these kind
of seat diagrams

00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:59.290
that we have up here.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.500
So this is this bond.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.750
This axial hydrogen is
this axial hydrogen.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.130
And then we have another
hydrogen.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.580
We have this hydrogen right
here, which would

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.550
be that like that.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.030
And then behind it, you have
carbon number four.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:20.050
Carbon number four is like that,
so carbon number four,

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.290
draw a circle.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:25.050
It has a hydrogen in its axial
position, another hydrogen

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.900
like that, and then it bonds
to carbon number three.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:29.770
So this was number
three right here.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.120
So just like that.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.610
So what do we see about this
methyl group here?

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.880
In this situation, this
methyl group is anti-.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.200
There's two ways to
think about it.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.270
It's dihedral angle versus
carbon number

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.850
three is now 180 degrees.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.240
Over here it was gauche.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.080
Its dihedral angle to carbon
number three was 60 degrees.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.870
Now, it's 180 degrees.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.260
So it's much further.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.340
And now its dihedral angle
to carbon number

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.000
six is also 120 degrees.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.550
So in this situation, where
our methyl group is

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.820
equatorial, it's axial here.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.650
It's equatorial here when we
jumped back down because

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.700
notice, it's parallel.

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.060
The bond is parallel to
parts of the ring.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.730
In this situation, we are
farther away from the other

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:15.570
methyl groups.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.490
There's less crowding,
and so this is

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.230
a more stable situation.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:33.230
So you could say it is
anti-configuration relative to

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:37.490
carbon number three, while over
here, it was gauche to

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.650
carbon number three.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.390
I don't know if I'm saying it.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.270
Is it gowche, gauche?

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.610
I don't know the best
way to pronounce it.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.330
So in this case, there's
less crowding.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.610
This is more stable, lower
potential energy.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.860
So hopefully you found
that interesting.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:54.670
This was really a way, just an
exercise in being able to go

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.320
from this visualization
to kind of this

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.040
double Newman diagram.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.550
And if it makes it any easier,
the way you could think about

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.550
it is we're kind of viewing in
this Newman diagram right

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.480
here, where this carbon number
six is this carbon number six.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.450
This CH2 is this
one back there.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.750
So when we're looking at it
from this, we're kind of

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:15.940
looking at this hexane ring
from this direction.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.350
We see this in front.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.830
This is this, and we
see that in back.

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.090
That is that.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.670
Over here, same thing.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:29.650
We're looking at it directly
from this direction.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.660
We see this guy on top is over
here, and this guy on the

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.910
bottom is over here.
