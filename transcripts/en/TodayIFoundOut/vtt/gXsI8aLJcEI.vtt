00:00:01.109 --> 00:00:11.389
Was One of the Bond Girls Really Formerly
a Man?

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.219
That depends on how you define “man” and
“Bond girl”.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.830
If you define “man” as a person who was
born with a penis and “Bond girl” as any

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.670
eye candy female that appeared in a Bond movie
at any point, then yes- one of the Bond girls,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.780
or at least one of the women shown in a Bond
movie (not a main character by any stretch),

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.930
was born a man.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.000
If you define “man” as someone born with
an XY chromosome pattern, rather than XX,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.990
like a typical woman, then no.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.160
You see, the woman in question, actress and
model Caroline Cossey, born Barry Kenneth

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.530
Cossey, was born with something known as Klinefelter
Syndrome, which means she has an XXY chromosome

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
pattern with 47 chromosomes, instead of 46.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.460
This is a condition that occurs in about 1
in every 500-1000 male births (and significantly

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.559
more rarely occurs in females).

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.860
This makes it one of the most common chromosome
abnormalities known to man.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.360
Some of the common side effects of this are
low testosterone levels compared to most males,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.290
wider hips, less muscle mass, possible breasts
(in about 1/3 of the cases), generally infertile,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.799
and significantly less body and facial hair,
among other things.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.100
Now, traditionally those with Klinefelter
Syndrome have been called “XXY males”,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.150
to distinguish them from “normal” XY males.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.909
However, in the International Journal of Andrology
published in 2011,various researchers from

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.410
several Australian medical institutes proposed
in a paper, Thinking Outside the Square: Considering

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.619
Gender in Klinefelter Syndrome, that some
XXY “males” should actually be called

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.549
XXY “females” and others simply intersex.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.600
The specific point of the paper was that perhaps
Klinefelter Syndrome should be detached from

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.990
“XXY”.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.950
Most with this condition are clearly male
and identify as such, but a small percentage

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.259
seem to be female, and thus typical treatment
for Klinefelter Syndrome, including being

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.119
given testosterone starting during puberty,
may be damaging psychologically as it would

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.590
make the person’s body more male-like, when
in fact they were female.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.841
As these treatments preferably start at a
very young age, the child may not be in a

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.239
position to assert this one way or the other.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.540
(In another study, there was even a case where
the researchers came across a rare XXY female

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.090
(born with a vagina), who since childhood
had always thought of herself as a male and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.099
demonstrated stereotypical male-like tendencies
from the beginning.)

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.739
While Cossey was indeed born with a penis,
throughout her youth she was extremely feminine

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.940
in personality, looks, and personal preference
tendencies, which often resulted in her getting

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.180
bullied at school.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.970
She was also frequently mistaken for a girl
by those who didn’t know her.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.629
(You can see in the picture to the right just
how feminine she looked as a teen.)

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.489
From this, if you buy into the medical researchers’
argument proposed in their paper, we’d perhaps

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.700
say that Cossey was one of those XXY’ers
who, while born with a penis, was actually

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.660
an XXY female.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.129
In her late teens, after dropping out of school
and working a few odd jobs, she became friends

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.540
with a transsexual and at that point, at the
age of 17, started hormone therapy.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.530
She also started working as a showgirl and
later, after breast surgery, as a topless

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.530
dancer.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.599
Once she’d saved up enough to be able to
pay for sex reassignment surgery, she had

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.160
that done too with her final surgery in 1974.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.239
She started modeling before her reassignment
surgery and continued under the name “Tula”

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.070
after with a lot of success, appearing in
numerous magazines, including some adult magazines

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.819
where she’d pose topless.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.240
She later even appeared in a 1981 edition
of Playboy.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.000
She also would have started a role as a model
in a game show in 1978, but she quit the show

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.349
when a journalist discovered she was born
with a penis and was going to break the story.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.909
Unfortunately, her career was severely stunted
from this as she had to try to keep a low

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.550
profile to keep her secret from being published.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.060
This all ended in 1981 when she appeared in
the Bond, For Your Eyes Only, film and the

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.300
story broke, for a time being front page news.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.780
The aftermath of this was initially devastating
to Cossey who was sure her career as a model

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.319
was over, but eventually she moved on and
continued modeling, as well as writing two

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:21.650
autobiographies, the second of which, My Story
was written in 1992.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:42.039
She’s today married to Canadian David Finch;
the two recently 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.729
celebrated their 20th anniversary.
