00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.390
- [Instructor] Betty's Bakery calculates

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.080
the total price D in
dollars for C cupcakes

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.080
using the equation D is
equal to two times C.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.170
What does two mean in this situation?

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.370
So pause this video and
see if you can answer that.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.030
Alright, before I even
look at the choices,

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.150
let me just interpret this.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.880
This says D equals 2C tells us

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.830
that however many cupcakes someone buys,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.440
we multiply that times two
to get the amount of dollars,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.950
the price that they need to pay.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.420
So this must mean that each
cupcake is two dollars.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.220
Or that it's two dollars per cupcake.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.030
Because however many cupcakes we get,

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.810
we multiply that by two dollars

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.010
per cupcake to get the actual price.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.150
So let's see, choice A says

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.800
the bakery charges two
dollars for each cupcake.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.910
Yeah, that's pretty close
to what I just said.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.620
So I'll go with that one.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
The bakery sells two
cupcakes for a dollar.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.190
No, that would not be the case.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.890
And you could even try it out.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.590
If we had one cupcake.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.430
So if C is one, what is D going to be?

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.960
And actually, let me just do that for you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.030
'cause it's interesting.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.350
C and D.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.240
So if you get one cupcake,
you're gonna multiply it by two.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.870
It's going to be two dollars.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.410
Two cupcakes, we're gonna multiply

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.330
it by two and be four dollars.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.400
It's consistent with this first choice,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.690
but to sell two cupcakes,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.880
it's not gonna be four dollars,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.140
it's gonna be for four dollars.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.150
The bakery sells two types of cupcakes.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.410
Well, they don't say anything about that,

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.350
so I'll rule that out, as well.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.400
Let's do another one.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.410
Here, we are told, select the store with

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.840
the least expensive ice cream per scoop.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.640
There's definitely a dessert
theme going on over here.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.960
Alright, so pause this video
and see if you can work it out.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.173
Is it choice A, choice B or choice C.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.940
Alright, now let's go
through these together.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.360
Choice A calculates the total price D

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.750
in dollars of ice cream
with S scoops using

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.393
the equation D is equal to 0.75S.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.210
So whatever the number of scoops are,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.420
we're gonna multiply that times 75 cents

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.950
or 75 hundredth of a
dollar to get the price.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.780
And so based on the logic we
just used in that last example,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.100
in store A, it is 75 cents,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.780
75 cents per, per scoop.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.190
So we know the price there.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.629
And anything like this,
when you're comparing,

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.450
you wanna put it all in the same terms.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.230
Okay, here it's 75 cents per scoop.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.550
Let's think about how many,
how much per scoop it is at B.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.040
And how many, how much
per scoop it is for C.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.270
Alright, now store B.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.640
So, when I get three scoops,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.820
I multiply that times
one to get three dollars.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.800
When I get eight scoops,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.450
I multiply it times one
to get eight dollars.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.530
When I have 12 scoops,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.440
I multiply it by one to get 12 dollars.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.940
So the equation that store B must use

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.900
is that the dollar is D.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.810
That's going to be equal to
one times the number of scoops.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.930
Or you could view this as, hey,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.220
it's a dollar per scoop at store B.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.230
So one dollar,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.620
one dollar per scoop.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.880
So we already know that store
A is cheaper than store B.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.690
'Cause 75 cents per scoop is cheaper

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.550
than one dollar per scoop.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.960
Store C, alright, so here this,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.950
this relationship is
described with a graph but we

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.690
can put it in the same
forms that we saw before.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.770
So for store C.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.530
Make a little table here.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.790
And so if I have the scoops
and I have the dollars.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.780
So let's see.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.970
When I get two scoops, it looks like,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.390
and I'm just picking values where it looks

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.330
like I can read the graph easily.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.050
Two scoops looks like three dollars.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.130
Two scoops, three dollars.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.850
Four scoops, it is six dollars.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.650
Four scoops, it's six dollars.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.602
So it looks like I'm multiplying
times one point half,

00:03:59.602 --> 00:04:02.130
one and a half, I was
gonna say one point half.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.120
1.5 or one and a half to
go from scoops to dollars.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.000
Or another way you can think about it is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the dollars is equal to
1.5 times the scoops.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.860
Or another way to think about it,

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.860
at store C, they're charging
a 1.50, 1.50 per, per scoop.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.910
So store C is the most expensive followed

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.130
by B and then store A is the cheapest

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.080
and that's what they're asking us.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.653
The least expensive ice
cream per scoop is store A.
