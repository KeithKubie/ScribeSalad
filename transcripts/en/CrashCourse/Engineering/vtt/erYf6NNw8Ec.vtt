00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
The need to get from A to B is something we’re
all familiar with.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.240
In the US, most people spend about an hour
traveling to and from work – not to mention
all the other sorts of traveling we do.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.680
But despite all the work engineers put into making
those journeys go smoothly, it seems like things go
wrong more often than they should.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.160
Maybe you’ve been delayed at the airport,
encountered signaling issues on the subway,
or got caught in a traffic jam.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.920
While the weather often plays a role, one of the biggest reasons that transportation systems run into issues is that they have to deal with another persistent, difficult, unavoidable element: us.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.900
If you want to design a good transportation
system, you have to understand the people
who are going to use it.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:45.060
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.340
Transportation engineering is one of the largest
disciplines of civil engineering.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.640
Every highway, railroad, shipping lane, and
airline route relies on transportation engineers
to guide the way.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.680
Suppose you were tasked with setting up a
subway system for a city.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.940
You’ll need to plan, design and construct
every last element before it can function.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.580
What’s more, transportation systems are,
almost by definition, heavily connected – every
piece needs to support all the others.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.320
It’s no use having state-of-the-art trains
on brand new tracks if the stations aren’t
built where people need them.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.940
And once a system is up and running, you’ll
need to constantly monitor how it copes with
demand.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.880
That will help you make decisions like how
to improve access to stations and how often
to run trains.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.920
The same kind of thinking applies to plane routes
and shipping systems, although roads and highways
have some extra considerations.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.660
The physical aspects of engineering we’ve
learned about so far play a big part of the
design work.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.579
You need to build components out of the right
materials and put in the right safety features.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.640
For example, you’ll want to build the subway’s
tracks with enough mechanical strength to avoid
buckling because of an overloaded train.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.080
And the key element in transportation engineering
is people.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.640
We’re a core part of the system.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.930
Unlike other disciplines we’ve looked at, this kind
of engineering isn’t about processing inanimate
materials into something that we use or consume.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.000
It’s about moving people in a way that’s
safe, convenient, and comfortable.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.439
That means considering social requirements
in addition to physical ones.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.900
For instance, how do you decide where to build
tracks, and which locations they should connect?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.480
Ideally, you’d build enough infrastructure
to support every journey that anyone would
want to take.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.740
But, like everything else in engineering,
cost is one of the biggest constraints you
have to work with.

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.120
Since you probably have a fixed budget for
setting up the system, you need to prioritize
what what gets built and where.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.540
And to do that, you have to understand what
kinds of journeys are going to be made.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.660
So with a subway, some people will want
to visit their friends or go shopping, while
others are just trying to get to work.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.460
The layout needs to support those different
needs, while making enough from the passenger
fares to keep the system up and running.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.580
So the social and economic goals of your city
have a big role in the design of the network!

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.700
In general, transportation engineering is often about
taking a bunch of different priorities and combining
them in the best – but rarely perfect – way.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.420
And that applies on every scale!

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:58.340
Your new subway system, for example, might have a
point where two lines merge into one, taking passengers
from different starting locations to the same stop.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.159
But if two trains approach at the same time,
how do they both pass through?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.860
Obviously, no one wants a collision.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.940
So your job as an engineer is to design a
system where the odds of that happening are
as small as possible.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:16.140
Since we’re dealing with heavy objects travelling
at high velocities, the routes need to be designed to
allow changes to those velocities well in advance.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.300
While a car traveling at highway speeds can
safely stop over a distance of a hundred meters
by applying the brakes,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.260
a passenger train travelling at the same rate
needs over a kilometer before it comes to a halt.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.440
That’s also why air traffic controllers have to
constantly monitor and communicate with planes
that are flying at similar altitudes.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.160
Because a passenger plane can’t be maneuvered quickly, the flight paths need to be designed to ensure that flights from different locations overlap as little as possible.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.340
Schedules need to keep them out of each other’s
way, while also avoiding turbulent weather.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.960
But to avoid collisions at your train junction,
you’ll need signaling.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.580
To give each train enough notice when it
has to stop, you’ll need regular signals at
intervals along the track.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.460
Those intervals are also known as block sections.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.980
Signals give useful information about what’s happening
on the tracks several sections ahead, like whether there’s
another train or if it’s safe to travel at full speed.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.330
To allow enough time for the train to respond
and stop, block sections tend to be no shorter
than the necessary stopping distance.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.620
Older signaling systems rely on a set of lights
above or beside the tracks that a driver can
interpret and respond to.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:26.540
For your brand-new subway, you’d probably build in wireless signaling capabilities to relay information straight to the train cabin, to the driver or an automated system.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:34.500
If two trains are approaching the same junction, signaling would tell one of them to slow down several block sections ahead while allowing the other to pass through.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.700
And that choice can be made in a few different
ways.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.680
If one train is slightly closer to the junction,
it might make sense to give it priority while
the other is told to wait.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.800
But if the other train was delayed earlier on its route,
you might want the signals to give it priority, even if it’s
farther away, to help get it back on schedule.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:58.360
Or, if you want to get as many people to their destinations as quickly as possible, you might let the train likeliest to be carrying more passengers through first.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.360
The details will depend on the particulars
of the routes and the needs of your system.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.300
Railway signaling involves managing a whole
network!

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.390
Modern approaches are also sophisticated enough
that safety mechanisms, like electronic sensors,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.160
will automatically stop a train if the signals
indicate danger ahead.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.780
When they’re working, the combination of
signals and tracks give trains a big advantage:

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.479
they go where they’re supposed to, when
they’re supposed to.

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.270
But many people mainly get around with vehicles
like cars, trucks and motorbikes.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.900
In Britain, for example, about two thirds
of all journeys are taken in an automobile.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.220
With every driver free to move independently,
roads lose much of the predictability that
railroads enjoy.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.500
Potential collisions aren’t confined to
known junctions – they could happen every
time someone changes lanes!

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:47.390
And even if accidents don’t happen, all
that switching back and forth causes something
we’re probably all familiar with: traffic jams.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.800
To understand why, it actually helps to think
back to fluid dynamics.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:58.040
In general, a highway system is well-designed
if as many cars as possible are flowing through
the system as fast as safely possible.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.740
So, on a given stretch of highway, you can think of
the “efficiency” of the system as the flow rate of cars.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.240
The flow will be the product of the density
of cars passing through and their average speed –
much like the flow of water through a pipe.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.819
Except the driving force here isn’t water
pressure.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.470
Instead, it’s every driver’s individual
desire to get to where they’re going.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.260
If there’s only a few vehicles on the road,
it’s not a problem.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.960
The cars don’t have to fight for lane space
or slow down because of other drivers.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.540
Everyone cruises along at roughly the speed
limit.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.720
That’s what engineers call “normal flow”.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.980
In normal flow, you can increase the total
flow rate just by adding additional cars.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.240
In other words, more people move through the
system and the highway is doing its job.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.060
Add too many cars, though, and the problems
start.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.270
In normal flow, the extra cars don’t affect
the average speed of each vehicle.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:49.000
But once the density of cars reaches what’s
called a critical point, the lack of space between
cars starts causing restrictions.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.400
Everyone drives a little slower to accommodate
the other cars around them.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.600
Add even more cars, and you start getting
stoppages.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.180
When one car slows down or stops, the others
behind it have to slow down too, and so on.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.020
This brings down the average speed of all
the cars on the road.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:09.240
Even though there are more cars, the flow rate
actually decreases past the critical point because
their average speed has dropped so low.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.180
That’s what engineers call forced flow.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.320
Everyone’s desire to get ahead actually
makes the problem worse.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.970
Each car trying to desperately squeeze through
every opening makes it harder for the jam to ease
up and for the cars to flow steadily again.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.540
There might be other routes drivers can use
to get to their location, but in general,

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.960
every driver wants to take the shortest route,
which seems pretty sensible on the face of it.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.200
But when everyone uses the same route, forced
flow occurs.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.240
You might think that building another road
or adding more lanes would improve things.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.680
In practice, though, most people still take
the route they think will be fastest, which
only makes things worse!

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.920
So highway engineers tackle problems like
this in sometimes unusual-sounding ways.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.180
One solution comes from German mathematician
Dietrich Braess.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.720
Instead of adding more roads, you can actually
improve traffic flow by taking them away.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.340
That might seem counterintuitive, which is
why it’s called Braess’ Paradox.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.540
After all, how can the flow be improved by
removing a highway?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:07.500
Braess’ Paradox works because when the
seemingly-fastest route is taken away, drivers end
up using several alternative routes instead.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.940
Even if those alternate routes are longer,
they only take a fraction of the cars each.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.060
That keeps speeds higher and the flow rate
closer to normal.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.980
On average, people will even get to where
they’re going faster on the longer route.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.080
Of course, that’s just one solution that
only works for some highways.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.560
In general, you need to accurately model
the flow of traffic and develop sophisticated
ways to keep it flowing.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.300
Many of the the same principles used for signaling
on railroads carry over to programming traffic lights
and even the design of roads themselves.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.660
The way roads merge and connect has a big
impact on how drivers act and the eventual
flow patterns.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:48.690
In the future, if fleets of driverless cars take to the road,
it could require whole new principles of highway design
– much like automatic train networks did for railways.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.000
But even if humans won’t be behind the wheel,
transportation engineers will still be there,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.520
ensuring that those journeys are designed
to be safe, fast, and convenient.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.240
In this episode we looked at transportation
engineering.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:06.220
We saw how transport systems are designed
from the outset, what decisions need to be made,
and how to operate them with the help of signaling.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.380
We learned how systems like highways are built
around the behaviors of their users,

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:17.800
how considering traffic flow lets us assess
a highway’s efficiency, and ideas transportation
engineers can use to improve it.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.980
Next time we’ll explore how engineers create
communication systems like the one you’re
using right now.
