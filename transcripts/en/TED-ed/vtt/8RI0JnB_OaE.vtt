00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:11.916
There are few places on Earth 
less hospitable to life

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.787
than the bone-dry Sahara Desert.

00:00:14.787 --> 00:00:17.547
Yet it wasn't always this way.

00:00:17.547 --> 00:00:22.117
100 million years ago, during a period
known as the Mid-Cretaceous,

00:00:22.117 --> 00:00:25.536
a gargantuan river system flowed
across the region

00:00:25.536 --> 00:00:28.647
from modern day Egypt to Morocco.

00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:32.317
The whole world at that time
would look rather different to us.

00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:35.618
The continents had yet to assume
their current positions.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.628
Extreme temperatures were common

00:00:37.628 --> 00:00:41.297
and fierce storms made life unpredictable.

00:00:41.297 --> 00:00:43.799
Dinosaurs flourished on land,

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:45.907
pterosaurs roamed the skies,

00:00:45.907 --> 00:00:51.368
and giant marine reptiles and sharks
swam in warm seas.

00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:56.458
Small mammals, our ancestors,
lived quite literally in the shadow

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:59.948
of these extraordinary creatures.

00:00:59.948 --> 00:01:02.169
In this world of huge predators,

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:03.803
the River of Giants,

00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:07.758
which is what some call this region
of what is now northern Africa,

00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:10.809
stood out as particularly dangerous.

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:14.748
In most ecosystems, it's lonely at
the top of the food chain.

00:01:14.748 --> 00:01:18.438
There usually isn't enough prey
to sustain many predators.

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:23.920
Yet an incredible variety of aquatic
prey species in the river-based ecosystem

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.599
may have allowed a large and diverse
population of apex predators to coexist.

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.079
We know this thanks to a wealth of fossils
we found in an area

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.429
called the Kem Kem Beds.

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.919
Many of the predators we've discovered
had head and body shapes

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:44.270
that made them uniquely adapted
to hunt the different types and sizes

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.791
of aquatic prey.

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.950
This allowed many Kem Kem predators to
take full advantage

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.489
of the one abundant food source
in this environment: fish.

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:58.462
This also allowed them 
to avoid direct competition

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:03.110
with the predators going after
land-loving animals.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.098
Prey species in the river system had to
contend with attacks from all sides,

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:10.431
including from above.

00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:13.052
Flying reptiles dominated the skies.

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:17.232
Alanqa Saharica had a wingspan of
up to nine meters,

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:20.709
and long slender jaws that helped it
snatch fish

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.661
and small terrestrial animals.

00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.950
At least seven different types 
of crocodile-like predators

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.851
patrolled the waterways,

00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:33.411
including the roughly 
ten-meter-long Elosuchus.

00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:38.982
And multiple species of T-rex-sized
carnivorous dinosaurs called theropods,

00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:41.882
lived side by side.

00:02:41.882 --> 00:02:45.661
In the River of Giants,
Spinosaurus was king.

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.542
This 15-meter-long dinosaur was even
longer than T-rex,

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.732
with short muscular hind legs,

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:53.132
a flexible tail,

00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:54.992
and broad feet.

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:59.612
It's two-meter-high sail warned
other creatures of its fearsome size

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:03.012
and may have also been 
used to attract mates.

00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:07.912
Spinosaurus' long slender jaws were spiked
with conical teeth,

00:03:07.912 --> 00:03:13.793
perfect for swiftly clamping down
on slippery aquatic prey.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:16.870
This apex predator, 
as well as its ecosystem,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.710
is unparalleled in the history
of life on Earth.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.337
All that's left of these 
fearsome predators are fossils.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:28.852
About 93 million years ago, 
sea levels rose,

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:32.663
submerging the Kem Kem region
in a shallow sea.

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:34.543
Tens of millions of years later,

00:03:34.543 --> 00:03:36.023
an asteroid impact,

00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:37.744
volcanic eruptions,

00:03:37.744 --> 00:03:40.303
and associated changes in climate

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:45.983
wiped out the dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and
many other groups of animals and plants,

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:49.192
including their unique ecoysystems.

00:03:49.192 --> 00:03:53.455
That mass extinction paved the way
for the rise of new kinds of birds,

00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:54.824
larger mammals,

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:57.015
and eventually us.
