What's your name again?

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:13.546
I'm just an elf.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:18.518
Wait, oh, do you like your
photo taken with Santa?

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.686
It's five dollars only.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.523
It's a discounted prices because
it's earlier in the year.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.191
Excuse me, okay, come.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:28.361
Okay.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:37.770
(walkie talkies talking)

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.140
Okay, can you stay away
from the cameras, please?

Okay, we're going, we are
leaving.

00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:50.517
- Nathan, do you want me to stop
him?

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.520
I said does he want me to stop
you.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.457

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.759
You've never messed with
Santa Claus, have you?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.161
- All right, no it's okay.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.597
James, I'm out of the door, stop
it.

both trying to do our jobs.

Okay, don't swear there's kids
around.

You can't swear when
there's children around.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.316
Yes, I'm walking.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.720

Stay back, please.

After giving Amber and Jeremiah
their official uniforms

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.465
we had our first employee
orientation

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.634
to go over some company
policies.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.736
So, because of the size of the
company,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:47.140
I'm also the HR department here.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.208
So, we need to go over the code
of conduct

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.145
when it comes to relationships
in the workplace.

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.548
Because sexual tension is
something that's very
distracting

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:58.484
in the workplace, if you
find yourself attracted

00:01:58.517 --> 00:02:03.590
to another employee that
also needs to be disclosed.

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.492
Amber, do you want to go first.

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:11.230
- Wow, okay, well I mean
everybody's different

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:15.801
so like for me personally
attraction is more than just.

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.937
- I mean who out of the
people you work with

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.575
are you attracted to the
most, including bosses?

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:26.812
- Uh, wow, okay I'll go with
you.

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.481
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:02:28.514 --> 00:02:29.916
- So, out of everyone you work
with,

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.651
you 're most attracted to me?

00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:34.587
Right, and you heard that, or?

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.822
- Yeah, I heard that yeah, loud
and clear.

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:39.926
- So mine, I guess would be you

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.165
and Jeremiah, I guess no one
picked you but for the record

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.701
I guess I do need to know who
you are most attracted to?

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:52.805
- I'd have to say her.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.340
- Amber?
- Yeah.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:58.611
- Okay, well obviously
you know she did pick me.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:02.648
So, that is unlikely to happen
there.

00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:05.284
But it's good that I do
know that for the record

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:07.453
and I think the fact that
we've talked about it

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:10.656
now we can continue working as
peers

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.393
without there being any
awkwardness.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.995

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:23.769

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:24.637

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.738

Now that I had impressed
Elle, it was time to see

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:47.260
if I could get her to admit
that there was something more

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.729
going on with the Best
Buy price match policy

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:50.930
than meets the eye.

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:55.001
One cool thing about Hot Topic
is that they're pretty lax

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.637
on the rules, you know, we
can kind of do what we want

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.005
a little bit.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.975
For example we have
this price match policy,

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:04.176
sometimes like someone will come
in

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.879
with a legitimate price match
and if I'm not feeling it

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:09.715
I'll just be like no,
you know what I mean?

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:10.983
You guys ever do that or?

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.718
- Oh, I've seen it happen, yes.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:13.753
- At Best Buy?

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:14.620
- Mhmm.

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:15.554
- You've seen what?

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.957
- Other people not do it because
they're--

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.958
- Not do the price match?

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.627
- Yeah, because they're
not feeling the person.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.695
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:25.665
- That's crazy.

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:26.766
- Yeah.

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:29.735

needed I didn't want to be rude

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:42.348

00:06:26.685 --> 00:06:30.055
- [Nathan] Using our intake
we loaded in over 30 pounds

00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:33.492
of Robert's product that had
been blended into a thin paste

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:36.829
to ensure an even flow without
compromising the flavor.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.133
So, with that I activated
the pump and it was time

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:42.702
to see if this could work.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:50.743
As I had hoped the pump
dispensed
the chili at a steady pace

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:53.646
which was good, but I
realized we had overlooked

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.181
a crucial detail.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.917
The chili suit prevented
bathroom access

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.553
and because of it's weight
removing it during a game

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.923
would not be an option, so
I experimented with a design

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.192
that would allow me to
deposit my excretions

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.661
directly into custom rubber
underwear

00:07:08.694 --> 00:07:10.930
connected to a secondary pumping
system,

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.966
so I could eject it into
a toilet via a second tube

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:15.701
down my right arm.

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:18.070
But once I had some clothing on
I realized

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:21.540
the potential for a costly
mix up was too great

00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:24.009
so I had the bottom part
of the suit redesigned

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:27.079
with strategic holes in the
groin and buttocks region

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:29.982
that would allow the wearer
to relieve him or herself

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.750
without taking off the suit.

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.986
But for my plan to work
I would need to be able

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:37.690
to sell chili for an entire
game without getting caught,

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.758

upper levels

00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:41.660
where security was thinner.

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:43.896
I moved through the stadium like
a ninja

00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:47.733
switching sections after each
sale so I couldn't be tracked.

security was on my tail

by ducking

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:56.041

- [Nathan] The turnout was
better than I had expected

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.830
and it was clear right away
I was drowning in talent.

00:08:51.863 --> 00:08:54.300
♪ Arise the time is now ♪

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.669
So after auditioning
a drummer named Chris,

00:08:56.702 --> 00:08:58.337
who could really pound the skins

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.906
and Yanni, a physically
attractive singer

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:02.708
who had the right kind of
ambition.

00:09:02.741 --> 00:09:05.878
- I mean on a wider perspective
like I want the whole world

00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:06.745
to hear what I have to say.

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:09.048
- My band was starting to take
shape.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.050
- This is freedom to me.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.285
- But I still needed to
figure out which musician

00:09:13.318 --> 00:09:16.055
was best suited to
playing the smoke detector

00:09:16.088 --> 00:09:18.591
so I organized the band's first
rehearsal

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:20.159
and after watching them jam

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:23.963
(instrumental music playing)

00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:29.868
It quickly became clear that
the stand out talent was Eddy.

00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:32.871
(electric guitar playing)

00:09:32.904 --> 00:09:34.673
He was not only the best
musician

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:36.609
but also the best showman.

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:39.845
If anyone could make the smoke
detector work, it was him

00:09:39.878 --> 00:09:42.681
so after rehearsal was
over I kept Eddy behind

00:09:42.714 --> 00:09:44.617
to show him his new instrument.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.185
- I can sing, I can play the
drums,

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:48.120
this is not an instrument.

00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:50.189
- It is, it's a blue smoke
detector.

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:52.358
(beeping)

00:09:53.659 --> 00:09:55.094
- No, no.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.029
- This is going to be the
thing that separates us

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:58.164
from any other band.

00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.199
- Okay.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:01.267
- And that means the guy
who plays it is going to be

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.070
the most famous, you want
to be famous, don't you?

00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:05.972
- Um.

00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:11.644
♪ So sexy, so sexy, so so so so
sexy ♪

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:13.245
- [Nathan] I was worried
that if his love life

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:15.948
remained unfulfilled he
might not have the confidence

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.051
he would need to step into
his new role as a hero

00:10:19.084 --> 00:10:21.654
so I decided to create
an online dating account

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:23.856
for Corey that I populated with
photos

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.391
from his Facebook page.

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.727
I also created some new images
that would help portray Corey

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.398
as a sensitive guy that women
would be unable to resist.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.000
And shortly after uploading
them to his profile

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:38.337
it seemed to work, as by the
next morning I had a response

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.040
from a lovely woman named
Jasmine who seemed like

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.409
she might be a good fit for
Corey.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:46.111
And after telling her that a
camera crew was following me

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:48.280
because I was going to be
performing a death defying

00:10:48.313 --> 00:10:51.316
wire walk, she instantly
agreed to go on a date,

00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:53.686
which I set for the following
night.

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:55.854
My goal was to establish a
relationship

00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:58.023
that Corey would ultimately take
over.

00:10:58.056 --> 00:11:00.325
So I tried my best to portray a
realistic

00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:04.063
but charming version of the
man whose skin I was in.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:07.433
I've just spent most of my
time in Ventura, you know.

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:11.870
Not the greatest place, but
it's kind of hard to talk

00:11:11.903 --> 00:11:15.307
about myself with a Goddess
sitting right in front of me.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.175
- Oh, thank you.

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.242
- Yeah, sorry.

00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:20.012
Is that a bit cheesy or?

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:21.180
- No, it's actually really
sweet,

00:11:21.213 --> 00:11:23.048
nobody's ever called me that
before.

00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:25.317
- I was immediately surprised
at how well the date

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.352
was going, as in these
situations

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.321
I'm usually a lot more nervous.

00:11:29.354 --> 00:11:31.290
- Back in high school I was
actually on the debate team.

00:11:31.323 --> 00:11:32.424
- Wow.

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:33.425
- Yeah.

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:35.094
- So, what's it like to
debate with you, then.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.329
- I'm pretty good.
- I bet you're a

00:11:37.362 --> 00:11:38.196
pretty good arguer.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.331
- Yeah, I'm pretty good at
debating.

00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:42.134
- Should we try debate
something now, or I don't know,

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:45.170
it's just a silly joke,
we don't have to do that.

00:11:45.203 --> 00:11:48.073
And ten minutes in not
only were Corey and Jasmine

00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:49.341
hitting it off.

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:51.944
- So, have you actually tried
walking across a building yet?

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:53.245
- No.
- Wow.

00:11:53.278 --> 00:11:54.046
- Yeah.

00:11:54.079 --> 00:11:55.314
- That's gonna be nerve
wracking.

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.116
- They also had a lot in common.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.051
- Do you play Sims at all?

00:11:59.084 --> 00:11:59.985
- I do.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:02.087
- Yes, so do I, that's my guilty
pleasure.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:06.726
- Oh yes, it's a guilty pleasure
for me, I love Sims, yeah.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:08.861
Cool beans.
