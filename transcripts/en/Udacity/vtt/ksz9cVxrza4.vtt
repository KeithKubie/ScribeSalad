00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is we need to return two things.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We want the outputs to be the value of "url" and the value of "end_quote"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so we know both the "string" that was foundÃ¢Â€Â”that's the target of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the linkÃ¢Â€Â”as well as the value of "end_quote."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We can do that by just returning those two values.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We're going to have returning "url," followed by a comma,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
followed by "end_quote."

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That means that the two outputs from our procedure are the two

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
values of "url" and the value of "end_quote."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
[Drawing smiley face.]

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Congratulations! You've defined your first procedure.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This deserves a big smiley face.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Procedures are really important ideas in computer science.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to find lots more proceduresÃ¢Â€Â”both today

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and through the rest of the course.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Almost everything we do "in terms of building programs" is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
about building procedures.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Those are the main things that we use to break down problems

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
into things that we can solve.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We're going to have some more quizzes about procedures soon,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but first I want to give you an idea of how rich inputs and outputs can be

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
when we do computations.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We'll do that by looking at what happens when you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
build a self-driving car.
