00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.440
Whether you have an IQ of 50 or 150, we all
like to feel smart. After all, the minds of

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.280
intelligent people like Einstein, Tesla or
Stephen Hawking have no doubt helped shape

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.410
the world we live in. So is it feasible that
we could genetically improve the intelligence

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.950
of our entire species?

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.480
DNA is the basic code of life found in every
living organism. And this DNA is made up of

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.819
genes, which, in turn, are made up 4 smaller
parts called nucleobases, represented by the

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:30.019
letters A, T, G and C. In humans, these bases
are arranged as 3 billion pairs, which essentially

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.000
act as a blueprint for everything the cells
in your body need to do. Literally all that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.230
you are - from the way you look and act - is defined

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.500
by the organization of these 4 biological
compounds. 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.010
And scientists have been able to find connections between the way genes are organized, and certain traits

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.390
you exhibit - from your sex, to your eye colour
and even diseases you may develop.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.720
It was actually the Human Genome Project which
first began to analyze and map all the genes

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.579
in the human body. The initial project took
over a decade and 3 billion dollars to complete,

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.690
with teams across the entire globe working
together. Today, with a much smaller team,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.119
the same could be accomplished in a few days...for
only $4000.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.359
And the more sequenced genomes we accumulate
- whether it be from plants, microbes or humans

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:16.729
- the more we have to compare and contrast
the traits we see on the outside, with the

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.850
gene combinations we find on the inside. And that is exactly what the Cognitive Genomics

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.500
Project hopes to achieve. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.800
By using over 2000
people with IQs over 150, and plans to bring

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:32.479
on 20,000 more subjects, researchers at the
BGI institute in China are looking at the

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.979
genetic basis for intelligence. In other words,
they are scanning through the DNA of thousands

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.780
of intelligent people, to look for patterns
that may be responsible for making them smart

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.909
in the first place.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.090
Of course, this is a much more complicated
task than looking for, say, a disease pattern.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.569
Tay-Sachs and Huntington's disease are both
caused by a single gene-mutation, and are

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.979
easily recognized. Hair and eye colour, on
the other hand, depend on multiple genes interacting

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.229
- though, with proper analysis it can still
be predicted. But traits like personality

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.599
or intelligence are almost certainly the result
of thousands of genes interacting in unique

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.050
ways - a pattern which scientists have yet
to discover. And the truth is, they may never

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.130
find one.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:15.450
But what happens if they do? I mean, it could mean a future of genius babies! With the advent of in vitro

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.080
fertilization, you might be able to create
multiple embryos, and scan their DNA. Scientists

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.130
would then be able to identify which traits
are most likely in each embryo, based on their

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.670
genes, allowing parents to essentially choose
which baby they most desire. 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.380
For example, this embryo has a 50% chance of being exceptionally
musical, or this one has a 58% chance of having

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.520
an IQ over 150. In this way, without actually
changing the genetic information, but rather

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.990
screening it, we may actually be able to increase
the intelligence of future generations.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.100
But what about you? Could you ever change
your genetic makeup to make you smarter, faster, 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.500
or stronger right now? 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.100
