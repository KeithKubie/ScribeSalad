00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.400
<v 1>the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

3
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.460
<v 0>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night.</v>

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.983
<v 2>Boom.</v>

5
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.820
We are live in a hotel room in the middle of Melbourne,

6
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:20.821
Australia and next door to us is some sort of a religious institution,

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.180
Cathedral type scenario,

8
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.930
some fucking bunk ass bullshit.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.200
Old World Voodoo House that's got their fucking bells ringing constantly.

10
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.701
They get to do that.

11
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:40.600
Imagine if you live next door to those assholes and it's like they decided today

12
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.520
cause a special time to bring the Gong so we don't know what's going on.

13
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:47.490
We thought it was like baby for,

14
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.130
for Paris because as we're doing this,
uh,

15
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.300
Tony and I just found out maybe an hour or so ago,

16
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.700
um,
that uh,
the,
uh,

17
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:01.330
the Paris attacks had gone on more than a hundred people are dead.

18
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.690
It was inside some,
some rock and roll

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.090
<v 1>show,
some death metal death metal show.</v>

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.020
One more reason it never go see a death metal concert hall ready.

21
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.790
That's an interesting place to attack.
Yeah,
it's pretty fucked up.

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.680
The whole thing is pretty fucked up.

23
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.750
I didn't know they had death metal than Paris.

24
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:23.780
It seems like it just wouldn't even exist.
They're like,

25
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.030
there'd be no base for that.
It turns out there was hundreds of people there.

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.680
<v 3>I think more than that,
I think there's thousands.
I think it's a big,</v>

27
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
I don't know.

28
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.900
Why would you think that death metal wouldn't be popular in parents?

29
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.770
<v 1>Paris just seems like they're a little bit too like Prim and proper for a,</v>

30
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.310
<v 3>yeah.
No,
that's metal.</v>

31
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.620
I think on paper they do like if we look at it from the past.
Yeah.

32
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.150
I don't think they're that Prim and proper.

33
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:53.151
I think Paris has a lot of like drinking and fucking and Gerard de Pardot like

34
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.270
almost almost thought it stopped.
It did stop.

35
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.700
Now they're just slowly gonging one,
two,
three.
How long have you been to do that?

36
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.220
<v 1>I don't know.
This is like the biggest cathedral I've ever seen.
That right.</v>

37
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.360
Things huge over.
It ended.
Yeah.
It's pretty big but something,

38
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.460
but they're the ones in New York City,
I think you're probably bigger.

39
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.020
They're really old.
Them.

40
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.270
Those old were saying before the started that those old religious houses,

41
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:21.850
those old buildings,
so like they don't make them like that anymore.

42
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.860
I wish they did.
That stuff's so cool with game of Thrones getting more popular,

43
00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:30.280
you would think like there'd be more of that type of architecture happening.

44
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.300
Keep people wanting to create their own kingdoms and stuff.

45
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.480
I bet we do see more of it.
It's hard to create a kingdom today.

46
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.810
People are too hip.
Yeah,
they're aware.
We try and do.
Yeah.

47
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.810
<v 2>Have you tried to make a religion today?
We're all your leaders</v>

48
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.530
<v 1>sex like,
like the Catholics have,
they'd be like,
wait,</v>

49
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.490
what the Fuck Outta here?
Nobody would want to be the leader of that.

50
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.940
They're like,
I'll follow,
but I'm not going to lead.
Like,
what are the laws?

51
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.980
Like Scientology

52
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.070
<v 3>is like the most recent of all the religions.
Right?</v>

53
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.620
Cause that was started in the fifties or sixties.
Like whenever I forget,

54
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.870
I'm reading the middle of this book.
I can't even,
I can't finish it.

55
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.510
I agreed it and then I put it down.
So Lawrence Wright book going clear that a,

56
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.930
they started that.
Um,
it was the beginning of that,
uh,
Hbo Documentary.

57
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:21.760
That's how it started.
And,
uh,
I've,

58
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.730
I've watched the documentary and I keep getting into this book,

59
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:29.731
but it's so crazy that guy over on Harvard was sell fucking crazy.

60
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.520
That the idea that this guy could start this global movement that has,

61
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.970
who knows how many fucking thousands of people in it and then how many fucking

62
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:44.140
millions if not billions of dollars they've earned in real estate and how much

63
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.870
they pilfered from all these people that are inside of it.
It's,
it's crazy.
It

64
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.230
<v 1>really is.
I think it really preys upon the people that like are the weakest,</v>

65
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.910
I mean,
how do you believe that guy was a science fiction author?
Yeah,

66
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.010
that should be enough right there.

67
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.830
First thing at the top of this guy's resume is that he was a big science fiction

68
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.980
author.
I mean,
if George Lucas started a religion,

69
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.980
I guess maybe I'd probably be pretty correlated and join so many doors and be

70
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:19.360
like,
oh man,
fuck it.
I'm in.
And that's really the crazy part is I don't know.

71
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:21.130
Like,
I don't,
I mean,
I don't think I'll,

72
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.820
Ron Hubbard really got that famous off of like his science fiction.
Maybe.

73
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.330
Maybe I'm wrong.
Like I don't know.
But he was definitely no star wars.

74
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.020
Like you would think that,
and maybe that's why he did this.
Like he's like,

75
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.360
I haven't come up with a hit.
Maybe I'll just start a relationship.

76
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.260
<v 2>No.
Well he is the most prolific author ever.</v>

77
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.930
He wrote more books than anybody that's ever lived.

78
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.400
<v 1>Yeah.
Which is another thing.</v>

79
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.470
And that would be at the top of his resume that proves that he's full of

80
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:49.670
bullshit.
Just so much stuff.
He just kept writing.
Yeah.

81
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.350
<v 2>Yeah.
Well he's the most prolific bullshit artist ever.
And the,
the,</v>

82
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.240
the other thing you said,
his work was like all first drafts.

83
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.240
It seems like he never did a second draft ever.
He just,

84
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.900
whatever he thought he wrote down and just slobbered through the whole thing.

85
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.260
It's all like terrible,
terrible,
terrible writing.
It's all like,

86
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:15.180
and then the fetus is dropped,
the frozen volcano,
the people in the volcano.

87
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.670
And that's where your anxiety comes from.

88
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.670
The going clear is about releasing all of it.

89
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.680
Like all of his ideas and principles of the idea,

90
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:28.260
like the ideals of Scientology.

91
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.440
He outlined in the science fiction stories before he ever put him down as like

92
00:05:33.721 --> 00:05:36.030
the actual reality of Scientology here.

93
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.210
Like you could see like if you go back over his older stuff,

94
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.890
you see him making this stuff up

95
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.940
<v 1>[inaudible] and you know,
it's like on top of all that,</v>

96
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.440
on top of it being wild,
they take so much money from these people.

97
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.290
10% right.
Is it a 10% thing?

98
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.880
And then it like if you do anything bad they like punish you and make you give

99
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:59.300
them money and stuff.
No,
it's true.

100
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:04.080
Like I was reading this article about that actress.
Uh,
she wasn't like Mike,

101
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.920
not Mike and Caroline Ray,
I think her name is.

102
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:09.860
She was in like some show with like Mike or Molly,
one of those

103
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.860
<v 3>you talking about Leah Remini.
Yeah,
that's what I'm shooting the king and Queens.</v>

104
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.790
Yeah,
she's in with Kevin Jane's show.
Kevin James.
That's what I always get.
Kevin,

105
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.770
James and Mike from Mike and Molly
big thick.

106
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.680
On.
Um,
but I guess like,

107
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.210
<v 1>I guess she went to Tom and Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes wedding and like said</v>

108
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:34.260
some stuff and everybody got mad at her and they charged her like a hundred

109
00:06:34.261 --> 00:06:37.310
thousand bucks for it.
Like something crazy like that.

110
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.800
<v 3>Well,
they didn't just charge her,</v>

111
00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:43.000
they made her go through hours and hours of retraining and auditing.
You know,

112
00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:45.620
they go,
you go through this auditing thing where you have to sit down,

113
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.260
you go through every single last detail of everything you said and what you did

114
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:51.011
during the wedding.

115
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:55.670
And she had to apologize to Katie Holmes for ruining her special day.
And Oh,

116
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.890
I can see Lee Romney fucking it up though.
She's,
you know,
she's a bold woman.

117
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.320
Yeah.
She seems like a little party machine.
She gets a few champagnes center.

118
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.380
Sounds like she seems like she drinks and just starts auditing out loud,

119
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:08.740
you know.

120
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.370
Do you think this podcast is going to get fucked up by those gongs in the

121
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.040
background?
I think maybe it sort of gives it like a vibe,

122
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:20.041
like sort of a town knowing though like if you're listening to this right now

123
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:22.020
you'd be like,
are they fucking really good?

124
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:24.920
I like to do this with the gongs and their background.

125
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.100
There's a way in this room we could get away from it.

126
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:32.950
I think that's like the reality of where we are.
Yeah,

127
00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:37.951
you're on the is unbelievably annoying that if I lived here I'd be so pissed if

128
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:43.000
I was trying to take my afternoon nap and this shit is going off.
Gung Gung,
Gung,

129
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:47.710
Gung Gung Jesus Christ.
Once upon a time walked upon the water,

130
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.240
gone,
gone,
gone,
gone,
gone.

131
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.060
<v 1>I think it's because of the France thing,</v>

132
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.900
<v 3>but this people going in there,
it looks like a wedding.</v>

133
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.340
<v 1>You know what I was just thinking about,</v>

134
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.880
cause I was reading all these tweets on Twitter about the Paris France thing,

135
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:03.340
like as it's happening and so many people are tweeting the same thing and

136
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.290
they're all going like,
you know,
pray for France,
pray for France.

137
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.730
And I'm just thinking of myself,

138
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:11.860
like I started thinking about prayer and what it is and it's,

139
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.760
and it's,

140
00:08:13.761 --> 00:08:17.420
it just seems like it's something that people do to make themselves feel better.

141
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.720
<v 3>Well,
it's definitely something people do to make themselves feel better,</v>

142
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.040
but the ideas of positive thinking can correct things.
Yeah.

143
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.050
Can you imagine if there was like a,

144
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:35.180
<v 1>can you imagine if there was studies that showed that praying did something,</v>

145
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.780
<v 3>what would happen?
Well,
what is the placebo effect?
Right?</v>

146
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:42.680
The placebo effect is you believing that something is happening even though

147
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:46.760
there's no real chemical that you're like you're taking a sugar pill and just

148
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:49.700
believing that that sugar pill,
some Miracle Pill,

149
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.850
you can somehow or another enact a physical effect on your body.

150
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:56.520
I like the power of the mind.
Yeah.
It's,
it's real.

151
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:01.521
Like there is this real healing powers of the mind and if you apply that to

152
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.740
prayer,
like if you think that prayer really does help,

153
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.030
if you actually believe it,
it probably would have a similar effect,

154
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.930
at least physically to placebo effect on the person praying on the person who

155
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:18.000
believes.
Like,
if somebody prayed for you,

156
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.800
if you had something wrong with you on some unplayed prayed for you,
you might,

157
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.860
it might have a physical effect on you if you actually believe that they could

158
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:26.694
do it.
Like if you were,

159
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.150
if you had some Gandalf motherfucker hang around with you.

160
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.761
<v 4>I see.</v>

161
00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:35.200
So if you believe that prayers work and somebody prays for you and you're like,

162
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.090
Oh man,
these people are praying for me.

163
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.560
<v 3>Yeah.
Okay.
It could,
it could have an effect.
Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:46.130
I think that there's probably all these untapped ways that we can help our body,

165
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.480
that we can like power up our immune system or overcome like certain,

166
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.360
certain things that are happening to our physical body just because our mind

167
00:10:00.361 --> 00:10:02.580
believes it.
You know,
this is,

168
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.760
they've shown it with the placebo effect that it's a real effect that there is

169
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:06.900
really something going on,

170
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.370
but we don't know how to like voluntarily use that without tricking ourselves

171
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.600
for the most part.
Yeah.
You know how this guy,
Wim Hoff on my podcast,

172
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.640
fascinating fucking dude and he's,
um,
he holds like 26 world records.

173
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:21.830
He um,

174
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.990
summited Everest in his shorts with a like sandals on the fucking,

175
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.300
the ice ice cleats under the sandals and a,

176
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:35.360
he ran a half marathon in minus 40 degree weather with shorts on and no shirt

177
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:43.740
barefoot.
He's,
yeah,
he swam a hundred yards.

178
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:47.580
It was supposed to be 50,
but he couldn't figure out how to go under the ice.
Uh,

179
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.550
he swam under the ice and was supposed to be 50 yards,

180
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:54.810
but his retinas froze because the water was so fucking cold,

181
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:56.430
so he couldn't see where he was going.

182
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.890
So we wound up going twice as far with one breath.

183
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:03.150
He wound up swimming a hundred yards under the ice for the pull them out.

184
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.470
I couldn't find the hole in the ice.
He's,
he's,

185
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.530
he got 26 world records and a big part of his,

186
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.460
like his methodologies about breathing and about,
uh,

187
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.380
over oxygenating like,
uh,
like oxygen loading on your lungs,

188
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.090
but he's able to achieve these crazy states like that.
He uh,
had a,

189
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:32.091
a Dutch university or a hospital or university hospital inject him with a

190
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.820
Mycotoxin,
mycotoxin,
a biotoxin,

191
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.420
and in this a biotoxin that he like,

192
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.480
he showed that he can activate his immune system with his own mind.

193
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.340
Things that we thought were only autonomous sort of a

194
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.480
systems like your immune system.

195
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:58.840
Like he's able to actually physically activate it with his own mind.

196
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.530
So I think there's all sorts of different areas of the,

197
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.850
the human body that are,
we haven't really tapped into the full potential of,

198
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.510
that's probably what the,
the,
that's probably what the placebo effect shows.

199
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:14.440
It shows that we just don't know how to stimulate.

200
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.400
Like the average person doesn't know how to stimulate those,
those systems,

201
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.750
but it is possible.
We just don't know how to do it.
Yeah.
You know?
Hmm.

202
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.100
That's an interesting stuff.
Well,

203
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:30.820
it's interesting because we know that certain states are bad for your immune

204
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:31.540
system,

205
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.010
like being depressed and being stressed out or being fucked up or you can get

206
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.100
sick.
Like people get sick,
they get stressed,
they get worn out.

207
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.390
Like in that if you're calm and relaxed,
you can handle things better.

208
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:48.610
So we know that there's certain states of mind that are more beneficial for your

209
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:50.140
body.
Yeah.

210
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.260
We just don't know how like most people don't know how to achieve those certain

211
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:56.220
states.
A water over here,
it's interesting but

212
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.770
we also know like exercise,

213
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:04.771
like if you exercise that's pretty profound effect on your body.

214
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.060
Exercise a profound effect on your stress levels and that that effect in your

215
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:13.720
stress levels can change your health.

216
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.610
<v 4>Yeah.
It was crazy.
Like I,</v>

217
00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:19.290
my whole clock and everything was all messed up yesterday cause we just flew to

218
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:24.150
Australia and I was waking up from a nap so I'm normally messed up after a nap

219
00:13:24.151 --> 00:13:27.750
anyway.
But I was double messed up [inaudible] and I went down to the gym,

220
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:33.410
hit the steam room and it was unbelievable how I went from like 24% to 100%

221
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.130
yeah.
In an hour.
Yeah.

222
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:43.370
Just from sweating and sweating and sweating and like just getting some of the

223
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:44.724
blood flowing.

224
00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.820
<v 3>Yeah.
Get the blood flowing,
fire up the machine,
get all the systems working.</v>

225
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.530
Yeah.
Well,

226
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:54.490
that's why I have always have a hard time trusting people that don't exercise.

227
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.500
Yeah,
try it.

228
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.050
Especially people that are like really emotional or overreact and they don't

229
00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:00.430
exercise.
I'm like,
God damn it.

230
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.210
You don't have like a a mitigation process like it give you,
if you do,

231
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.210
it doesn't evolve,
you know,
like it has to be all mental.

232
00:14:07.211 --> 00:14:10.600
It they don't have anything like physical.
When I was growing stress relief,

233
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.240
<v 4>and I think it's like a Midwest thing,
I feel like it's,</v>

234
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.610
maybe it's an east coast thing,

235
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:20.890
but I feel like I feel like maybe they have more,

236
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.290
maybe they're better at this now,
but I feel like they were,

237
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.510
they would just make it look like exercising.

238
00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:29.380
They would tell you to exercise to lose weight.
There was never really,

239
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.440
I feel like nobody was really outgoing.

240
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:36.570
Lee saying that workout to make your mind stronger,
you know?

241
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.800
And I feel like maybe it's just California or maybe I just hang out with smarter

242
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:43.750
people now.
Maybe it's all of that.

243
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.080
But like now it's very clear to me why working out is important and it doesn't

244
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.430
matter how much you weigh,
but in a,

245
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:56.420
in Ohio I felt like that was that like you would never see someone with my build

246
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:01.130
running.
I feel like where I'm from really?
Yeah.
Skinny people don't run.

247
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.390
Yeah.
It nobody exercises there.
It's very bizarre.

248
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.080
People don't exercise in the middle of the country,
man.
It's creepy.

249
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.110
Are you sure it's creepy?
I mean,
and you survey not,

250
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.930
I mean I'm saying not everybody does an exercise,

251
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.200
but they definitely don't exercise like successful people exercise like

252
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:22.310
Californians exercise.

253
00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:26.570
I mean there's obviously not everybody in California exercises,
but I don't know.

254
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:27.530
I just feel like,

255
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.230
I feel like big food companies and soda pop companies also don't want people to

256
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:34.064
know that.
Okay,

257
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.651
<v 5>do you wear anything?</v>

258
00:15:34.651 --> 00:15:37.040
They don't want people to know that or people are just ignorant.

259
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.480
I think they don't even have to work hard at not having people know that.

260
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.300
I think we're just pretty ignorant.
Yeah,
I agree with that.

261
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.940
I think where there's also as time goes on,

262
00:15:46.941 --> 00:15:51.941
people just getting more and more aware of the effect that your body has on your

263
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:54.620
mind.
These are the thing that was pretty separate,

264
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.060
like especially when I was growing up,

265
00:15:56.061 --> 00:16:00.110
like I think people often look very intelligent.

266
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:04.220
People would look down upon physical exercise because they thought that physical

267
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:08.500
exercise was a vanity thing and then you had two schools of thought or twos,

268
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.440
two types of people.

269
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:13.310
You had people that were bringing people that we're concentrating on thinking

270
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:15.500
and they were concerned with the deeper,

271
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.880
more intellectual aspects of life and then yet people that were like more

272
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:23.690
physical people that were just trying to look good for the gym,

273
00:16:23.691 --> 00:16:25.760
pumped their biceps up and you know,

274
00:16:25.761 --> 00:16:30.410
and go fuck with my six pack.
But there were dummies.

275
00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.740
Yeah.
I think now people realize that there is,

276
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.750
there's a connection between the mind and the body and also there's a discipline

277
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:42.920
aspect to exercise.
Nobody wants to exercise for the most part.

278
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.060
You want the results,

279
00:16:44.061 --> 00:16:49.061
but it's difficult to get yourself to exert energy and that that discipline that

280
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:54.280
allows you to exert energy.
It's,

281
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:59.490
it's hard to like muster up and it is a part of your mental makeup to be able to

282
00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:01.994
muster it up,

283
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:06.080
to be able to discipline yourself to work out on a regular basis actually

284
00:17:06.081 --> 00:17:10.640
strengthens the mind because it,
it,
it exercises the discipline.

285
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:14.480
I don't think many people considered that in the past.

286
00:17:14.481 --> 00:17:18.800
I don't think they thought of the discipline of,
you know,
activating your body,

287
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:22.430
like using your mind to activate your body that you're actually exercising

288
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.860
almost like a muscle.
And discipline is like a muscle.

289
00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.160
<v 4>And I think that the,
a lot of things correlate.
You know what I mean?</v>

290
00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:33.240
Like so many people are like fat and depressed.
Oh yeah.
But,

291
00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.020
and they're depressed because they're fat and they're fat because they're not

292
00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:40.050
working out and they're depressed because they're not working out.
Yeah.

293
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:45.110
Like w w one of the most natural cures for depression is like going for a walk

294
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.190
or going for a jog.
Just literally doing anything

295
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.780
<v 1>other than sitting in one spot.</v>

296
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:52.651
<v 5>Well,</v>

297
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:55.860
they've done studies that show that regular exercise is just as effective at

298
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:59.130
treating depression as pills cause ssrs.

299
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:04.280
<v 1>Oh yeah.
I totally believe that.
That's another thing that I noticed back in Ohio.</v>

300
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:09.340
It's like everybody's depressed and they're all just getting these pills and no

301
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:10.813
working out

302
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.350
<v 5>and it's a place for pills.
There's a place for those pills for some,</v>

303
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.820
I think some people have a legit imbalance.
Yeah,
but I think there's also like,

304
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.690
or I should fear is a perfect example.
Our,
he used to be on pills,

305
00:18:22.691 --> 00:18:25.660
like he was like legitimately depressed,
got on pills,

306
00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.470
got his life back in order,
like became a much happier person.

307
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.280
Then got off the pills like his life.

308
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:35.890
He got his life and track became much more successful.

309
00:18:35.891 --> 00:18:39.190
Now he's just killing it out there in the world,

310
00:18:39.191 --> 00:18:44.140
like doing fantastic with a stand up.
Like we were at the club last night,

311
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.760
the comics lounge in Melbourne,

312
00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.430
there's all these Ari Shaffir posters on the wall there.

313
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.670
He was in town just a little while ago killing it and he's just doing great and

314
00:18:53.981 --> 00:18:58.210
now now he's happy.
Like he doesn't need it.
He all says mushrooms.

315
00:18:58.211 --> 00:18:58.980
Mushrooms helped him

316
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.360
<v 1>do mushrooms help a lot.
Anytime I do mushrooms,</v>

317
00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.400
I come back and feel good for two or three months,
two,
three,
four months.

318
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:10.350
<v 5>They should do it every two,
three,
four months then probably a good all the time.</v>

319
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:14.770
<v 1>It's true for some reason I doubt and I let the thing reload and live that</v>

320
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:17.770
stress.
I feel like it almost probably sort of helps,
I don't know,

321
00:19:17.771 --> 00:19:18.760
but maybe I'm wrong,

322
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.320
but I feel like it's like you make the muscles tense and then massage amount

323
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.270
rather than just get a massage.

324
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.640
But I probably should do them once every four months.

325
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.630
<v 5>When I was young,
I used to think that like the whole idea of being enlightened,</v>

326
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.930
uh,
being enlightened or gauge sheaving like a more balanced,

327
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:37.180
more relaxed view of the world.

328
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:41.710
I used to think it would fuck up my comedy and if I did that it would ruin me.

329
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.730
Like I would stop being funny because a lot of comedy is kind of mean.
Yeah.

330
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.010
You know,
and a lot of comedies like what you,

331
00:19:48.011 --> 00:19:52.660
what you're creating with comedies shitting on something.
And I used to think,

332
00:19:52.661 --> 00:19:54.370
well,
if I just achieved peace,

333
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.630
then I won't want to shit on things and if I don't want to shit on things and

334
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:01.720
I'll be shit out of luck as far as like my standup go,
so fuck this.

335
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.510
Then as I got older I realized that that's just a crutch.

336
00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.530
<v 1>Yeah,
it's definitely crossed my mind that like,</v>

337
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.460
well I,
I,
I do want to do mushrooms to feel better,

338
00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:15.910
but I don't want to do mushrooms because I want to be able to connect with that

339
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:20.940
audience that's in the room if I'm too far ahead of them.

340
00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:26.320
I literally,
you know,
I think of everything that when it comes to my comedy,

341
00:20:26.321 --> 00:20:27.640
I'm always trying to protect it.

342
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.680
<v 5>Yeah.
If you were to Koombaya yeah,
you might,
you know,</v>

343
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.360
you might lose your edge because your edge too is a lot of like you're,

344
00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:41.420
you're a great roast writer and a lot of roast writing is being fucking mean.

345
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:46.200
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's hard to do that if you're,

346
00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:47.940
if you're all Koombaya by

347
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:53.020
<v 1>out,
if it's true,
but it helps.
I mean,</v>

348
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.771
it's crazy.

349
00:20:53.771 --> 00:20:57.670
Like my favorite stuff is always the stuff that I write when I come back a week,

350
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:01.690
a week to three after those trips to the desert that we take.

351
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.350
<v 6>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.740
You can write some amazing shit like post psychedelic experiences.

353
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.470
Add clears the gutters,
man.
Makes everything flow better.

354
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.610
Yeah.
I think the writing is,
uh,

355
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.120
I think there's all sorts of different states that you should write under.

356
00:21:19.121 --> 00:21:21.040
I think you should write a little,
when you're drinking,

357
00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:23.680
I think you should write a little sober.
You should write a little,

358
00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:25.330
when you're high off pot,
you could ride,

359
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:28.210
she'd write post psychedelic writing while you're on.

360
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.650
Psychedelics was kind of pointless.

361
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:32.530
Like you could write to say things into a tape recorder maybe,

362
00:21:32.531 --> 00:21:35.500
but sitting down trying to write things down while you're tripping.

363
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.950
<v 1>Yeah.
And even then you forget what you felt like when you were taking the note.</v>

364
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:44.360
Yeah.
Yeah.
So it's like just a code and you can't really crack it anyway,

365
00:21:44.361 --> 00:21:45.650
even though the words are there.

366
00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.870
It's hard to go back to that feeling of clarity that sometimes you see like I

367
00:21:50.871 --> 00:21:51.740
know for a fact.

368
00:21:51.741 --> 00:21:55.880
There's been times where I'm out in that desert looking up at the stars and all

369
00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:59.360
of a sudden like I figure out the trick to everything.

370
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.400
You know that feeling clicks then where it's like,
oh,
oh shit,
I just did it.

371
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.590
I just beat the game.
But then you,

372
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.700
it just like can't exactly put your finger on what it was.

373
00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:14.900
Cause the to describe those feelings that happen in words.
It's impossible.

374
00:22:14.901 --> 00:22:19.460
The words haven't been created yet to describe what goes on in that zone.

375
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.080
<v 6>Well,
describing DMT is like that,
right?
Like you're describing it,</v>

376
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:26.300
describing a DMT experience.
You're just spinning your wheels.
Yeah.

377
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.230
It's wasting time.

378
00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.800
I've read like my own descriptions of a DMT trip and I'm might be shut up.
Dot.

379
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:37.010
It sounds so stupid.
Yeah,
because the words,
they don't exist.

380
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.530
The reference points don't exist like you can.

381
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.710
There's no way you could possibly know what the fuck you're talking about.

382
00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.500
You're saying something that you're,
you're using these noises to describe like,

383
00:22:48.501 --> 00:22:51.620
you,
like you were describing some shit like we were at the airport.
Oh,

384
00:22:51.621 --> 00:22:54.980
I should probably say we're,
we're not,
um,
we're not on the plane.

385
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.940
And I said that we were going to do one of these a plane and somewhere along the

386
00:22:58.941 --> 00:23:01.220
line while we're flying,
I was like,
yeah,

387
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.540
fucking do it on the hotel room and probably be better.
Yeah.
You know,

388
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.260
I slept most of the time on the plane,

389
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.370
but when we were at the airport going through that security guy and you were

390
00:23:10.371 --> 00:23:11.990
talking about the pope hats,

391
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.080
the guys at the Po paths you saw when you were doing DMT,

392
00:23:15.081 --> 00:23:18.620
like I kind of can kind of get that.
Yeah.
You know,

393
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.850
like I kind of see,
but if I didn't,
if I've never done it and I heard that,

394
00:23:22.851 --> 00:23:24.110
I'd be like,
what are you talking about?

395
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.780
<v 1>Right.
Like I had no idea.
Oh,
great.
The,
the fucking gone.</v>

396
00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:34.220
Jesus doesn't like us talking about Po path.
You bring up pope pads,

397
00:23:34.221 --> 00:23:38.850
the cathedral starts banging their bells.
Um,
but yeah,
no,
I,
I,

398
00:23:38.851 --> 00:23:39.830
I remember,

399
00:23:39.831 --> 00:23:44.240
I think you said something about fractals or something or somebody did,

400
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.670
maybe it,
um,

401
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.310
somebody that we were with then I remember hearing that word and I didn't put,

402
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.390
I didn't even know what that really was at the time until afterwards.

403
00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:01.220
Like,
oh yeah,
fractals,
like reposition,
like kaleidoscope,
like,
yeah.

404
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.580
And that's exactly what it was like.

405
00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.310
It was like a Kaleida a kaleidoscope of pope.

406
00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.790
<v 2>Have you ever seen some of those?
Uh,
three d renditions,</v>

407
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.810
like computer renditions of fractals.
[inaudible] it's pretty fucking amazing.

408
00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:16.531
Like a,

409
00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:21.180
there's a zoo and amazing fractal called the Mandelbrot set and there's this,

410
00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:25.170
uh,
there's some three d renditions where they show,
you know,

411
00:24:25.171 --> 00:24:29.910
the closer you get to these various points on this,
this,

412
00:24:29.911 --> 00:24:34.290
uh,
this fractal,
the more the same patterns repeat themselves.

413
00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:37.780
Like you looks like you're getting close to a small point,
but the,

414
00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.760
as you get closer,

415
00:24:38.761 --> 00:24:43.761
it just reveals a deeper and deeper level and layer of this fractal where it

416
00:24:45.421 --> 00:24:48.960
just,
it's,
it's infinite.
It keeps going on and on and on and on.

417
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.950
And as you get closer,
it just shows you it's the same thing in a smaller form.

418
00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:55.200
Then it goes on and on and on,
and that's,

419
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.560
that's the impression that you get when you do DMT,

420
00:24:58.561 --> 00:25:03.120
that there's this like infinite series of fractals that are going on all around

421
00:25:03.121 --> 00:25:06.300
you and that there's no end.
You can't find an end.
You just look,

422
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.430
the deeper you look,
the deeper it goes.

423
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And that's sort of what they've found about the whole universe.

424
00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:16.520
I mean,
they've,
the,
they believe that,
you know,

425
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:21.390
as you look deeper and deeper into life and you look deeper and deeper into the

426
00:25:21.391 --> 00:25:23.670
cellular level,
cellular level,

427
00:25:23.671 --> 00:25:26.550
deeply or deeper and deeper into the atomic level,

428
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
then you get into subatomic particles and you get into this weird world of space

429
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.100
where did,
it's mostly just empty air.

430
00:25:35.101 --> 00:25:38.910
And then there's some atomic particles that are blinking in and out of
existence.

431
00:25:38.911 --> 00:25:42.850
And then there's,
there's things that are,
they have things that they've observed,

432
00:25:42.851 --> 00:25:44.700
but they called her in a super position,

433
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:49.440
which means they're both moving and still at the same time.
And it's like,
yeah.

434
00:25:49.441 --> 00:25:52.830
And as,
as you go deeper and deeper into the subatomic level,

435
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.290
things become more and more like magic,

436
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.870
more and more like just science fiction and craziness.

437
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:04.250
Like most of what an atom is it just empty space and it's where,

438
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.040
which they're trying to understand it the deeper and deeper they go with this

439
00:26:08.041 --> 00:26:08.551
kind of stuff.

440
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:13.551
But many people theorize that what we're seeing in the universe itself,

441
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.550
like when you look at the universe and you see like the empty space,

442
00:26:17.551 --> 00:26:21.630
it's in the galaxies and space out in the,
the,
you know,

443
00:26:21.631 --> 00:26:26.610
the infinite cosmos that what you're seeing sort of mirrors itself inside are

444
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.440
very Adams and that,

445
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.050
<v 1>can you imagine if they just kept digging,</v>

446
00:26:31.051 --> 00:26:34.410
digging with a microscope and they kept going through everything and through

447
00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:38.440
everything.
And at the very end of it all,
there was just l Ron Hubbard's face

448
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.270
<v 2>and it was him all along.</v>

449
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.850
I am God wants to mysterious ways.

450
00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:47.940
What you imagine if we,

451
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.920
what we got deeper and deeper into sub atomic level and we found universes,

452
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:57.150
that's what would be the ultimate trip if we got so like if they figured out

453
00:26:57.151 --> 00:26:57.571
some way.

454
00:26:57.571 --> 00:27:01.350
I mean if you look at what they can observe today as opposed to work they could

455
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:04.980
observe a few hundred years ago,
it's no comparison.
They have so many,

456
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:06.930
so many new,

457
00:27:06.931 --> 00:27:11.931
much more sensitive methods of detecting energy and detecting and recognizing

458
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.870
structures and Adams and all this different shit.

459
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:20.460
What if it got to the point where they could detect deeper and deeper and deeper

460
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:25.461
layers and they actually really did find that inside a atomic particles that as

461
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:27.360
you go deeper and deeper,

462
00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:32.361
you can actually find completely independent universes that operate on a scale

463
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.950
so minute that we can't even comprehend.
But if you could,

464
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.380
could you got deeper and deeper into them.

465
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:39.750
You would find like little tiny miniature black holes,

466
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:42.990
a little miniature at galaxies,
miniature planets and the,
the,
the,

467
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.690
the whole thing is fractal.
And as you went into them,

468
00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.720
like they believe that inside every black hole,

469
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:52.380
they think that every galaxy is,
uh,

470
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.270
there's a supermassive black hole.

471
00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:59.340
The center of that galaxy and that supermassive black holes is one half of 1% of

472
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:03.480
the mass of the entire galaxy.
So the larger the galaxy,
the,

473
00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:07.110
the larger the black hole is,
and they theorize it.

474
00:28:07.111 --> 00:28:11.430
If you go into that black hole,
you will find another universe.

475
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.120
So each galaxy has a black hole in it.

476
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:20.370
Inside each black hole is a totally different universe filled with hundreds of

477
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.580
billions of galaxies,
each with black holes in the center of them.

478
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.260
Each one of them has hundreds of billions of galaxies inside of it.

479
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.920
Have you go through that?
There's more universe is more black holes and it's,

480
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.950
that's the real fractal nature of the universe that every time you hit a galaxy,

481
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.940
which is it in our mind,
we can't even imagine how big a galaxy

482
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.470
<v 1>generations from now,
what it feels like.
It's like generations,</v>

483
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.800
tens and tens,
maybe a hundred generations from now,

484
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.250
they're going to be flying through these things in little machines.

485
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:54.510
We can't fathom it now,

486
00:28:54.511 --> 00:28:58.800
but we're like the pirates that were coming over here on wooden ships compared

487
00:28:58.801 --> 00:29:02.280
to what generations,
and I'm talking a lot of generations ahead of us.

488
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.830
They're going to be flying through it.

489
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.860
Look at who's going to be sports race from one black hold of the other.
Like,

490
00:29:07.861 --> 00:29:12.490
I mean we are in the wrong age.
We were born too early.
No,
we're

491
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.790
<v 2>born perfect.
This is a great time.
It was a great time.
Yeah.</v>

492
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.700
You don't want to be like in the future there'll be no need for comedy.

493
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.760
Everybody's going to be reading minds will be fucked.
Right.
You know,

494
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.120
they're all be enlightened in.
They'll do be no the hypocrisy.

495
00:29:25.121 --> 00:29:28.960
So no contradiction.
So like comedy won't won't exist.

496
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.270
If we achieve up to a new state of enlightenment where humor is out the window,

497
00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.980
we would be fucked.
Like we're reaping the benefits of an unenlightened public.

498
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.110
Well,
that's like what,

499
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:43.780
what standup is like we're pointing out shit that everybody should be able to

500
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.530
see.
Right.

501
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.310
Or pointing out things that everybody should know and then we're mocking things

502
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:53.140
that existed.
A ridiculous,
well,
if people evolve past the state,
there are now,

503
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:54.730
they are now like if,

504
00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.240
if you look at like primate behavior,

505
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:05.550
you look at the savagery of nature when just tooth and claw on animals is

506
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.110
struggling to survive.

507
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.300
And then you'd look at the more civilized nature of our culture today,

508
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:17.230
the best aspects when everything is working at its smoothest,

509
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.310
usually in small groups,
but in small groups,
in small communities,

510
00:30:21.311 --> 00:30:24.550
you can find some pretty peaceful existences,
you know,

511
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.150
that will ultimately be the whole world.

512
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.290
And then it'll get more and more peaceful,
more and more civilized,
more,

513
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.410
more adapted,
more cultured,
more connected,

514
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:40.530
more enlightened to the point where mocking things like won't exist anymore.

515
00:30:40.691 --> 00:30:41.860
There'll be nothing to mock.

516
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:45.820
People will be so advanced mentally that there will be no more of a need for

517
00:30:45.821 --> 00:30:50.410
comedy.
So I think right now for you and I,
this is a perfect time.

518
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.010
If we're in the future and everything was all perfect,
enlightened,

519
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:57.390
we'd be fucked and it wouldn't be fun.
And now we're in this,
this,

520
00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:02.490
we're in this golden stage where there's just enough retarded shit,

521
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.780
right?
Like this Paris thing,

522
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.960
there's just enough chaos in the world where it makes you appreciate all the,

523
00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.730
the cool aspects of the world.
Like if everything was cool,

524
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.250
I don't think we'd appreciate the cool parts is much.

525
00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.920
<v 4>You think there's a way to combat these terrorists attacks?</v>

526
00:31:21.921 --> 00:31:26.480
Like you know like it seems like if you draw Muhammad like that they get really

527
00:31:26.481 --> 00:31:30.170
upset,
right?
That that's like their big like oh no,
don't do that thing.

528
00:31:30.171 --> 00:31:32.060
Like so like I don't know,
I'm just pitching here.

529
00:31:32.061 --> 00:31:37.061
Like what if every time they did something like this as a defense mechanism,

530
00:31:38.061 --> 00:31:42.080
like CNN just put out like the Mohammed cartoon.

531
00:31:42.081 --> 00:31:47.000
Like if they just like they called in South Park South Park's guys and we're

532
00:31:47.001 --> 00:31:48.890
like guys let's do this.

533
00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.920
Let's bring in our nuclear warfare and you make a hilarious Mohammad thing.

534
00:31:54.591 --> 00:31:58.820
Have him just getting whatever,
you know,
bud raped or whatever.

535
00:31:58.821 --> 00:32:03.350
Like I don't know,
like something crazy.

536
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:07.880
Do you really think that would fix it and mocking it if as a defensive
mechanism,

537
00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:12.380
if they kill people,
that's the only way.
Every listen terrorists,
it's me,

538
00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:16.880
Prime Minister Tony Hinchcliffe from now on.
If you do an attack,

539
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.780
if somebody said this,
if you do an attack and you kill innocent people,

540
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.570
every innocent person that you kill,

541
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:28.190
it's going to be another two minutes or another five minutes of the Mohammed

542
00:32:28.191 --> 00:32:29.024
cartoon.

543
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.080
<v 2>That might be one of the dumbest ideas I've ever heard.</v>

544
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:32.860
They hate the Mohamad things,

545
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:36.180
so don't you think there's a big difference from killing people and drawing

546
00:32:36.181 --> 00:32:39.980
cartoons?
Like what does worse?
These terrorists don't

547
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.360
<v 1>seem to think so though,
right?</v>

548
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.150
<v 5>Can only put all these people in Paris because of a cartoon.</v>

549
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:47.690
They killed a few people that were doing those Charlie Hebdo cartoons.
Yeah.

550
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:53.020
I think the real problem is when people get their mind in a pattern,

551
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:58.430
you get your mind in some sort of a radical ideology like Islam or radical
Islam.

552
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:03.140
It's super difficult to get people out of that radical ideology.
It's very,

553
00:33:03.141 --> 00:33:07.870
very difficult.
Very difficult to get them to rethink to,
to,

554
00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.500
to change these patterns in their mind where they go.
Yeah.
Actually,

555
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.150
it doesn't make any sense to just go to some random death metal concert and gun

556
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:21.770
people down.
I can yell.
God is great.
Yeah.
It doesn't make sense.
It's crazy.

557
00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:23.530
That's chaos,
right?
That,

558
00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:28.640
that that is an evil thing to do and that doing this evil thing for religion,

559
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.120
like saying you're doing it for religion,
does it make any sense at all?

560
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.380
But in their mind it's justified.
Their mind is a holy war going on.

561
00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.620
These people that are completely radicalized,
like in their mind,

562
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.960
this is a good thing to do in their mind.

563
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:46.961
This is like what you have to do to get back at the infidels and attack this

564
00:33:47.961 --> 00:33:52.640
evil empire that's invading countries are supporting this or you know,

565
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:53.474
whatever.

566
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.750
Whatever crazy war is going on in the world as far as uh,

567
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.720
the ideologies as far as like invading certain holy lands and what's liquor

568
00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.050
would isis is doing,

569
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:10.700
they're blowing up old monuments and there's so much crazy shit that's going on

570
00:34:10.701 --> 00:34:13.640
in the world that's related to radical ideologies.

571
00:34:13.641 --> 00:34:15.920
You'd have to figure out how to rewire their brains.

572
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.490
<v 1>Can I tell you what another thing I think we should do?
I think we should take,</v>

573
00:34:21.910 --> 00:34:26.910
I think we should take guys on death row and put bombs on them and have them go

574
00:34:29.171 --> 00:34:32.110
into the places.
But the terrorists,

575
00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.270
<v 6>you might be the worst foreign policy advisor ever.</v>

576
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:41.650
I want to sit you down with all these five star generals that are in these

577
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.830
fucking smoky rooms plugging in the future.
What do you want to do?
Well,

578
00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:47.080
I want to take Jared from subway

579
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.100
strapped bombs doing them and send them over to,
well,
why would he do that?
Uh,

580
00:34:54.101 --> 00:34:58.540
I didn't think of that.
Why would Jared keep walking?
Why would he detonate?

581
00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.080
I you,
is he going to know he's going to blow up?
He's not going to tell them

582
00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.480
<v 1>all right.
Maybe we put them in.
We'd take these guys and we put them in uh,</v>

583
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:12.190
on the cars that are like controls or Google cars.
Drones.
Yeah,

584
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.200
<v 6>yeah,
yeah.
There you go.
Yeah.
They just killed that Jihadi John Guy.</v>

585
00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.240
They killed that guy with a drone.

586
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:23.120
He's that guy that was a rapper who's a rapper in England and joined isis and

587
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:26.190
he's been killing people and be heading them.
Sure.
Allegedly,

588
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.490
you know there's the black helicopter squad that believed that this is all

589
00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:30.140
bullshit.

590
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.440
<v 1>There was a rapper and isis.
Yeah.
Then ally says,</v>

591
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.010
oh Geez,
I'm going to get,
that's the thing that

592
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.900
<v 4>I'll end up getting death threats for out of this.</v>

593
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:42.690
You can't help yourself with that.
Kenyon puns.

594
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:46.230
Now when I hear a funny word and it's a right set up and I think there's just

595
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:47.190
one chance for,

596
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.540
the funny thing is I never do them on like I'm known for them but I never do

597
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:55.050
them on stage with my standup.
Like I would never do that.

598
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.370
That I love making them in person.
I just love comedy.
You know what I mean?

599
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:03.780
I'm terrible that impressions but God did,
they crack me up.

600
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:08.781
Like there's nothing that I don't love about comedy and I,

601
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.080
a lot of comedians are like,
Oh fuck upon.
You know,
I hate puns but it's like

602
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.290
<v 6>you liked puns even though you don't use them on stage.
Right?
Like,</v>

603
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.210
and I think everybody does.
I think there's a war on puns,
right?

604
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.360
<v 4>Oh Lauren pond.
Cause everybody wants to complain about puns,</v>

605
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:30.780
but it's like everybody laughs so hard,

606
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.710
like a good pun hits harder than almost any.

607
00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.300
<v 6>I laugh at puns.
I laugh at your puns cause they're so ridiculous.</v>

608
00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.990
But it's almost like a reluctant laugh.
Like oh you son of a bitch.
Yeah.

609
00:36:40.991 --> 00:36:43.580
But sometimes they're like,
you know Jed I punks,

610
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.430
you know and I mean that are just like how though?

611
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:47.680
Fuck did you think of that that quick.

612
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.670
Will you like take pride in grabbing them as quickly as they can?

613
00:36:51.671 --> 00:36:54.100
Like the ponds come out of the event?
Yeah.

614
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.500
And you just grasp it as quick as you can.
Right.

615
00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.050
My brain does not think in ponds at all.

616
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.720
<v 4>It's definitely a different muscle.</v>

617
00:37:00.721 --> 00:37:05.721
Like it's hard for me to think of a pun and be intellectual at the same time.

618
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:07.050
Like it's definitely like,

619
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.890
it's like a that thing where like rubbing your head and your stomach at the same

620
00:37:10.891 --> 00:37:14.520
time but going different directions.
Yeah.
People can't do it because I have,

621
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.960
I have,
I,

622
00:37:15.961 --> 00:37:20.961
I've noticed that because you have to like listen to do that thing and you sort

623
00:37:21.711 --> 00:37:25.170
of have to be add at the same time to do a pun.

624
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:30.270
Is it,
since this isn't a video podcast,

625
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:33.750
that's how you chose trying to do the hand on the head.
I did

626
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:38.110
<v 6>get the of the rubbing my head in two different directions and my stomach to get</v>

627
00:37:38.111 --> 00:37:42.770
dirty.
I go back and forth and back and forth.
Yeah.
Yeah.

628
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:46.220
It's a different muscle.
The pine muscles definitely a different muscle.
Yeah.

629
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.210
But it's also like a different comedic instantly we were talking about guys who

630
00:37:50.211 --> 00:37:53.330
get trapped in certain patterns of comedy.

631
00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.340
Like you get trapped in an act.
I'm like,
all you do is like this style of comedy.

632
00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:02.780
And then when that,
when you have that sort of trap,
um,
you can,

633
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.120
you can get it kind of kind of fuck you out.

634
00:38:05.121 --> 00:38:10.121
We were talking about guys who like only do like evil type comedy or the only do

635
00:38:13.461 --> 00:38:16.160
this type calm or they only have like they have a,

636
00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:19.430
an act they do where it's a persona they adopt.
Right.

637
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.880
Like a Larry the cable guy or an emo Phillips or something like that.

638
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.120
Like a one liner guy.
Yeah.
Go slow and like,
yeah.

639
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.850
And you get stuck in those are like when,

640
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.260
when it's done right.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
Like,

641
00:38:33.261 --> 00:38:36.010
like a Steven ride or something like that or uh,
you know,

642
00:38:36.011 --> 00:38:40.880
the best one ever and I'm,
I think was Mitch Hedberg was the best.
Yeah.

643
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:45.760
Because he was so prolific.
Yeah.
Like his mind worked in that way.

644
00:38:45.761 --> 00:38:50.761
Like his style of comedy worked in these nonsequitor one liners where he could

645
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:56.350
just one after another.
I have these like totally unrelated things.

646
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.560
<v 4>Unbelievable.
You know,
I was thinking of him,</v>

647
00:38:58.561 --> 00:39:02.760
I just told you about that Amy Winehouse documentary that blew my mind to shreds

648
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.250
and I was thinking about him during it because heroin,

649
00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.440
heroin and the art,

650
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:14.310
the Amy wine that she was always like very genuine,

651
00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:18.450
like a real artist and always wrote all only your own stuff and like you can

652
00:39:18.451 --> 00:39:19.710
tell like through her work,

653
00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:23.400
like it was really actually amazing and they show you to this documentary and

654
00:39:23.401 --> 00:39:26.010
then something happens.
She was always a heavy drinker,

655
00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:28.620
always quite the party or like a rock star,
you know what I mean?

656
00:39:28.621 --> 00:39:30.360
But then when she started doing heroin,

657
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.490
because this guy that she was with was into heroin,

658
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.080
the lyrics in the songs were a whole nother level.

659
00:39:37.081 --> 00:39:40.740
I mean we've seen it a bunch of times but I mean it really went to another level

660
00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:46.130
and it made me think of Mitch Hedberg because there's something with that drug

661
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.911
or I mean,

662
00:39:47.911 --> 00:39:51.450
I mean I'm not taking anything away from Mitch cause he's the one that did it,

663
00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:56.451
but it just can't be coincidence that these people on heroin are able to tap

664
00:39:56.611 --> 00:40:00.850
into some super,
super mechanism.
Yeah.

665
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.920
Because who would have guessed that anybody would come out better than Stephen

666
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:08.670
Right at that thing.
Like you watch Steven Wright and 10 minutes in,

667
00:40:08.671 --> 00:40:12.840
I'm like how is he going to fill an hour with this?
It seems impossible.

668
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:17.180
And then I agree with you completely that Mitch came in over the top and how's

669
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:21.930
that possible?
How could Mitch Hedberg not just the Steven Wright and go,

670
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.530
ah,
I've got to figure out something different to do cause there was no way I'm

671
00:40:25.531 --> 00:40:27.730
going to be able to do that better than that guy.
Right.

672
00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:30.810
I mean Steven Wright was the man,
but my goodness,

673
00:40:30.811 --> 00:40:33.180
if he didn't do it and there's something about those jokes,

674
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:34.740
if you just look at him just written out,

675
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:38.820
like sometimes I'll see like a meme with Mitch Hedberg on it and I'll end up

676
00:40:38.821 --> 00:40:40.650
staring at that.
And I'm not a meme guy at all,

677
00:40:40.651 --> 00:40:43.590
but I'll end up staring at that little tiny thing,

678
00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.470
which were all the original tweets by the way.
Mitch.

679
00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:51.510
Mitch Hedberg was the original Twitter guy.
Yeah.
I mean and like

680
00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.940
<v 6>think of that banana joke that I love so much.
Which one is that?
Um,
it goes,</v>

681
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.690
somebody asked me if I want a frozen banana.
I said no,

682
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.600
but I want her regular banana later.
So yes,

683
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.830
it's like a perfect,
it's a perfect Twitter joke,
but it's so ridiculous.

684
00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.070
It's also a joke that if you looked at it on paper,

685
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:17.750
maybe it wouldn't be a good Twitter joke unless you knew Mitch Hedberg voice.

686
00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.730
Maybe then it would be a good Twitter joke cause you knew how he does.
Joe,

687
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:24.230
<v 4>I still think it'd be great on Twitter,
but that's a,
that is another thing.</v>

688
00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:27.860
You have a great point there is like when you factor in his timing and beats,

689
00:41:27.861 --> 00:41:30.470
which also I think plays into the heroin thing.

690
00:41:30.471 --> 00:41:35.471
You look at all the Rock Stars and all that and most of them I it's seeming more

691
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:40.400
like,
I feel like it's more of like an acoustic type of drug,

692
00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:41.750
if that makes sense to me.

693
00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:45.110
Like more like nirvana and wine house who was very jazzy,

694
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:49.820
you know those types of towns and I just feel like there's a direct crossover.

695
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:54.890
I feel like Hedberg really was like God was he dialed in cause that voice and

696
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:58.310
that timing,
really timing and pacing is the trick.

697
00:41:58.311 --> 00:42:00.950
He could have had any accent in any voice.

698
00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.580
You know when you decide to start that next line after a period like in between

699
00:42:07.461 --> 00:42:10.430
spaces is so important in comedy.

700
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:12.710
I think like people really don't know that.

701
00:42:12.711 --> 00:42:17.150
I think they think that you could say joking anyway,
but it's really like,

702
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:18.260
you know,

703
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.260
there's just guys like look at Joey Diaz and Sebastian Maniscalco mean everybody

704
00:42:23.571 --> 00:42:26.510
really.
It's all done to timing,
but sometimes you can really see it

705
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:30.390
<v 6>summarizing what you're saying.
Is that they find their,
their voice,</v>

706
00:42:30.391 --> 00:42:33.150
they find their rhythm and then their comedy.

707
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.300
Like even though like maybe you and I would look at it on paper,

708
00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.420
the premise on paper and go,
how is that fucking funny?

709
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.600
But like Sebastian has such a way with being Sebastian that he makes things

710
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:49.260
right.
It's hard to figure out like what is the unfathered,

711
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:54.910
what is the ungraspable quality of what he's talking about that's uniquely funny

712
00:42:55.141 --> 00:42:59.380
in his voice.
Right.
You find that whatever it is.
Yeah,
that's through practice.

713
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.120
<v 4>Just like,
I mean,
like if you talking about,</v>

714
00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:03.640
since we're talking about the on paper thing,

715
00:43:03.641 --> 00:43:08.110
like you said the Hedberg thing and like that's pretty funny on paper,

716
00:43:08.111 --> 00:43:12.450
but now if you really like broke down,
like if you were reading a Joey Diaz,

717
00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:17.020
like on paper,
what's up?
You cock suckers.
Yeah.
It's like

718
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:20.590
<v 6>you gotta eat the Yolk,
you got eat,
you can eat the lines,</v>

719
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:25.000
<v 4>eat the yolk.
You cannot eat the whites.
Like,
it's like it wouldn't make,</v>

720
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.180
it wouldn't be funny at all on paper,
but you give him the,
you've gotta,
Ooh,

721
00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.250
I'm not fucking,
you know what I mean?
It's so passionate and it's all,

722
00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.510
it's all timing there.
I mean,
and so when there is a something on paper,

723
00:43:37.511 --> 00:43:41.530
when he does hit one of those written things,
it's just boom.
Isn't

724
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.520
<v 6>that also a weird thing about comedy is like you've got to figure out what is</v>

725
00:43:44.521 --> 00:43:46.920
funny in your mind.

726
00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:52.160
Like how was it funny through your voice and the only way you figure that out is

727
00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:55.950
by doing comedy over and over and over and over and over and over and over
again.

728
00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:01.010
Yeah.
You got to get to this point where kind of makes sense to you,
but you,

729
00:44:01.011 --> 00:44:03.390
you figure out how to do it.
That's,

730
00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.200
that's so hard to figure.

731
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.630
Like you could never look at a guy like Mitch Hedberg before he ever did stand

732
00:44:09.631 --> 00:44:13.890
up and go,
I know what you should do.
Like you can't write,

733
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.880
you'll never get it.
You'll never get it like that.

734
00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:19.240
It is not like anything else you,

735
00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:23.910
it has to be this unique combination of his personality,
his insight,

736
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.200
his timing,

737
00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:30.090
his experience on stage and his willingness to sit down and write shit out as

738
00:44:30.091 --> 00:44:33.840
much as possible.
Like his act is all writing.
It's all writing.

739
00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.880
Whereas like a guy like Sebastian,
it's all performing.

740
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:44.070
It's all things there,
you know,
both very funny,
but it's figuring out what,

741
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:48.420
what is about the way you're sitting around looking at the world?

742
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.970
How is it funny coming out of your head?

743
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.080
<v 4>Yeah,
it's interesting.
The more and more that I do this,</v>

744
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.260
the more and more that I do stand up and it's been,
uh,
in May,

745
00:44:58.261 --> 00:45:00.840
it'll be nine years.
Um,

746
00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.880
the more and more that I do at the more and more that my newest material,

747
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:09.480
my most recent stuff is always the best stuff.
And I'm writing,

748
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.470
I'm not writing as much as I was years ago because I'm just writing more good

749
00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:18.780
stuff,
if that makes sense.

750
00:45:18.781 --> 00:45:23.781
I'm writing less extra stuff and like I guess I'm writing the same amount of

751
00:45:23.911 --> 00:45:24.360
stuff,

752
00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:28.980
but I'm having more good stuff because I'm writing more in that voice.

753
00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.480
I'm starting to figure out what that is.
Yeah.

754
00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:34.590
Even down to like the physicalities for example that I do,

755
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:36.510
cause I barely move on stage.

756
00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:41.340
I'm pretty stabilized and sort of pretty stationary.
Right?
Huh.

757
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:44.850
Yeah,
very stationary.
Sometimes I'll tuck my arm behind my back.

758
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.840
Maybe I'll switch my shoulder levels to the left to the right to the middle.

759
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:50.430
I'll move that around a little bit.

760
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:55.910
But I'm very station at an ordinarily stationary I feel like and however,

761
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:56.581
you know,

762
00:45:56.581 --> 00:46:00.090
one of the things that I do is sometimes I'll rattle off things and I'll count

763
00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:04.230
on my fingers and I'll point some way.
Just nothing too crazy.

764
00:46:04.231 --> 00:46:09.180
But little things.
And those are always,
you know,
when I use that device,
lovely.

765
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.530
It has to work.

766
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:15.270
So I have their brains sort of train now and it's just something that happened

767
00:46:15.271 --> 00:46:18.590
naturally because I don't really talk with my hands a lot and stuff.

768
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:22.890
But when I do talk with my hands,
I want it to be like thunder.
Yeah.

769
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.390
<v 6>You know what I mean?</v>

770
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.670
Have you ever noticed that Joey never takes a mic out of his down?
It's amazing.

771
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.320
He puts them like in the stem,

772
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:31.560
the leaves in the stand and I think part of that is you want both of his hands

773
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:34.200
free because he talks with his hands so much.
Yeah.

774
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.380
He doesn't want to be trapped holding that microphone.
Yeah.

775
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:40.910
And it is physical stuff like involves the mic stand,

776
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:45.150
like you'll hang onto the mic stand during his physical stuff.
Yeah.
I love it.

777
00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:47.700
And when he lifts it up and slams it down real quick,

778
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:50.590
it's just like even know he's killed one,
if that sounds okay.

779
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:51.990
He's kind of always done that too.

780
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:56.310
He's always for the longest time at least not taking the Mick out of the stand.

781
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:57.060
Yeah.

782
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.530
<v 4>I've always,
I always have a respected that tremendously.</v>

783
00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:06.490
I always take the Mick out of the stand,
but I love,
love,

784
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.730
love the fact that,
you know,

785
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.750
that's that it's possible to just have that kind of,

786
00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:15.950
<v 6>did Rodney take the my Johnstown.
I don't think so.
No,</v>

787
00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:20.890
I can't picture him holding a microphone,
Huh?
Yeah,

788
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.550
I kind of like see like a similarity there.
You know,
using the hands.

789
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.110
Joey did [inaudible]

790
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:32.080
but everybody else does like you do you take it out Stan?
I do already.

791
00:47:32.081 --> 00:47:35.020
Does Dunkin does.
We all have our own way.
Yeah.

792
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.120
If I had to do a whole set with the mic in the stand,
I'd feel so weird.
Yeah.

793
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:46.850
<v 4>I always think it's weird like I didn't notice this until recently,</v>

794
00:47:46.851 --> 00:47:49.460
but like there's a lot of those late nights sets.

795
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.440
They don't have a microphone or at all.
I'm like,

796
00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.210
have you ever done any of those had to go no hands?
I don't think so.

797
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.990
Maybe I'll have you keep the mic and the mic stand or no,

798
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.010
you take them on trauma.
I take it out but I'm trying to think.

799
00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.160
<v 6>Yeah.
Have I ever done that?</v>

800
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:07.970
Have I ever done a late night show or I didn't use a mic?

801
00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.760
I don't know.
That's a good if I did it was so long ago,

802
00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:15.330
but

803
00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.220
<v 4>I dunno what I do.
I mean what am I going to do?</v>

804
00:48:17.221 --> 00:48:20.910
Stand there with my hands on my hips and like just like arms crossed.

805
00:48:20.911 --> 00:48:23.310
You can't do that.
Like oh,
hello everybody.

806
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:24.500
<v 6>Yeah,
we'll also,</v>

807
00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:29.501
you can't modulate your voice in the microphone the way you can when you're

808
00:48:30.441 --> 00:48:33.380
holding a microphone or if it's in a stand,

809
00:48:33.381 --> 00:48:37.220
like you could like talk closer to it to get louder.

810
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:41.210
You pull away to get softer.
You can modulate,

811
00:48:41.211 --> 00:48:45.200
you can change it and adjust it on the fly.
Yeah.

812
00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:49.610
Do you ever see a Chris Titus?
You still,
I don't know if he still does it,

813
00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.540
but he has one of them Bobby Brown setups where he's like a teleconference sir.

814
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.710
That's a little little microphone that comes,

815
00:48:57.711 --> 00:49:02.150
get a like a headset and the microphone comes down to the corner of his mouth

816
00:49:02.151 --> 00:49:06.650
and he talks like that shit creeps me out.
That's a weird choice.
Yeah.

817
00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:09.230
So weird choice for a comedy club.
I mean,

818
00:49:09.231 --> 00:49:14.231
why would you want to have the same headset is like a ted talks are like,

819
00:49:14.811 --> 00:49:19.640
yeah.
You know,
it's just to like tell a telecommunication.

820
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.870
Well his thing is different.
Like his style of comedy is different.

821
00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.550
He started comedy is more like a performance piece,
you know,

822
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.560
everything is like tight.
Like he told me,

823
00:49:30.561 --> 00:49:35.240
I asked him like how he writes and he writes all of it out before he ever does

824
00:49:35.241 --> 00:49:36.860
it.
He has like a theme,

825
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:41.000
like this is his theme and he writes his whole set.

826
00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:45.800
He writes this theme out and then he performs it almost like a one man show more

827
00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:47.300
than like a standup comedy show.

828
00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.960
And maybe having one of those headsets makes people feel like they're at a

829
00:49:50.961 --> 00:49:54.680
different sort of thing.
Like,
oh,
he doesn't even have a microphone in his hand.

830
00:49:54.681 --> 00:49:55.910
Like a regular comedian.

831
00:49:56.090 --> 00:50:00.140
He's got this whole thing where he's got a little headset on with a loop that

832
00:50:00.141 --> 00:50:05.141
comes down by his face and I see that little loop and oh and it might maybe kind

833
00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:08.480
of puts you in a different mindset as a person watching it.

834
00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:13.490
I'm watching a theatrical presentation as much as I'm watching stand up.
Yeah,

835
00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.360
<v 4>I know that when I see that headset to grab the remote and change the channel,</v>

836
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.080
that's the headset tells me psychologically.
What do you think?

837
00:50:22.081 --> 00:50:25.740
Do you think pretentious,
like w w the yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh yeah,
totally.

838
00:50:25.741 --> 00:50:30.290
I think we're like,
whoa,
who's trying to like reinvent you know you,

839
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:31.130
you,

840
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.630
I think there's something so cool about taking the Mick out of the mic stand the

841
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:40.040
same way Eddie Murphy did and raw and Richard Pryor live on the sunset strip and

842
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.900
all that stuff.
That's a magic.

843
00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:46.220
That's what's amazing that Mike and that Mike stand is all we need that stool.

844
00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.940
That is it.
That is it.
Maybe there's a bottle of water out there.

845
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:51.200
Maybe there's a towel.

846
00:50:51.201 --> 00:50:55.220
Maybe there's nuts about it and that's it and that's what I love about it.

847
00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.390
You take that away.

848
00:50:56.391 --> 00:51:00.410
Then you have the same stage that's there in the middle of the day when no

849
00:51:00.411 --> 00:51:04.460
crowds there,
there's no magic.
I always loved that.
Feel that vibe.

850
00:51:04.461 --> 00:51:06.470
I even like sound check sound checks.

851
00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:09.380
Give me the chills when there's nobody out there and you just see the mic and

852
00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:11.390
the mic stand that's going to be used that night.

853
00:51:11.391 --> 00:51:14.030
Like that instrument of death just standing there.

854
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.170
But an empty stage is sorta just sad to me and MTM and do.

855
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:21.140
Then he just has the stool or something like,
I don't even know.

856
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.400
It's just not into that.

857
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:26.530
It seems like the kind of guy that would up like wacky backgrounds two and

858
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.473
especially

859
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.820
like maybe his name and giant block letter.
Right.

860
00:51:33.821 --> 00:51:38.070
And like memories from his childhood or back there and though kid pictures.

861
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:39.240
Oh No.

862
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.000
And then he moves over towards that section where he's talking about certain

863
00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:47.310
things.
Yeah.
Well when you have that headset on,

864
00:51:47.311 --> 00:51:50.640
I expect you to be giving some sort of a motivational Anthony Robbins type

865
00:51:50.641 --> 00:51:54.330
speech.
Right.
How do I invigorated?
Yeah,
my staff.

866
00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.800
How do I get my employees as enthusiastic as I am?
Well,

867
00:51:58.801 --> 00:52:00.480
that's a good question.
You pacing.
Yeah.

868
00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.960
<v 6>Right.
Yeah.</v>

869
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.080
<v 4>I didn't even know.
I don't know anything about Christopher Titus.</v>

870
00:52:07.081 --> 00:52:07.920
That's what's crazy.

871
00:52:07.921 --> 00:52:11.970
It's like I've made friends with so many comedians and worked with so many

872
00:52:11.971 --> 00:52:13.600
people and met in this and that.

873
00:52:13.601 --> 00:52:17.460
I don't know anything about them and I attribute a lot of that to the headset

874
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:18.540
style that he has.

875
00:52:18.541 --> 00:52:21.390
I think we come from two totally different sides of the spectrum.

876
00:52:21.391 --> 00:52:25.650
I'm just guessing.
I don't even know what he talks about or anything about him,

877
00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:28.980
but I'm guessing him and I are like two different schools.

878
00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:30.810
<v 6>I don't know.
You'd probably have to go see him.</v>

879
00:52:30.811 --> 00:52:33.060
I haven't seen him live in a long fucking time.

880
00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.340
I feel like Gallagher used one of those,
right?
I think so.
Yeah.
Yeah.

881
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:40.230
He had to smashing shit with a watermelon with a hammer,
rather.

882
00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.980
If you're using that giant sledge hammer,
you have two hands on a sledge hammer.

883
00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.500
You have to have a headset.
Right?
Yeah.

884
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:50.820
I wonder if he had wires because when he was doing it,
man.
Yeah.

885
00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:55.650
Dean del Ray was telling me about the guy who invented the wireless headset or

886
00:52:55.651 --> 00:52:57.270
the guy who invented a wireless microphone.

887
00:52:57.271 --> 00:53:02.090
He had him on his podcast and Dean knows the guy and apparently it took the guy

888
00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.540
like a decade or more to figure out how to do it right.

889
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:11.440
<v 4>Do having still,
almost never right.
I think he should sell good.</v>

890
00:53:11.441 --> 00:53:15.160
Back to the drawing board on.
It always gives out.

891
00:53:15.161 --> 00:53:19.810
I hate wireless mikes.
They're just not as much fun as the ones with chords.
Dame,

892
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:22.300
they work pretty flawlessly.
I had to do one today.

893
00:53:22.301 --> 00:53:26.080
I use one today at the Wayans that wasn't wireless,
Mike.
Yeah,
but those are

894
00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.250
<v 1>really,
that's a,
that's a big,
big top.</v>

895
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:33.560
You're at the top level of production.
They're like,
they end plus that Mike,

896
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:37.140
they have enough battery in that thing.
And the thing you did wasn't that long,

897
00:53:37.141 --> 00:53:41.710
you know,
and they have that all juiced up with a double backup and five,

898
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:44.350
they have one shot at it.
Every channel

899
00:53:44.830 --> 00:53:48.190
<v 6>when we're doing a six hour show,
they changed my battery for my,
uh,</v>

900
00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:52.960
my battery pack because I have a wireless battery pack.
I have a wireless,
um,

901
00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:56.200
Mike that is in my ear.
So when I am,

902
00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.650
I'm going onto the,
uh,
into the octagon.

903
00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:03.680
I have a backup,
like a,
um,
a,

904
00:54:03.681 --> 00:54:05.500
a battery that's in the microphone.

905
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:10.120
And then I also have batteries that are in the receiver where there's an

906
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.750
earpiece so the production can talk into my ear.

907
00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.190
Like they'll say things like,
uh,
uh,

908
00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:19.960
we have a replay for you if you want to go to that,

909
00:54:19.961 --> 00:54:23.500
let us know or we'll follow your lead.
They'll say things like that.

910
00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.470
Like maybe I'm talking to someone about something particularly interesting that

911
00:54:26.471 --> 00:54:30.610
happened during the fight and uh,
they'll tell me like we're about to show it.

912
00:54:30.611 --> 00:54:35.611
Or like a lot of times fighters are rambling about their sponsors and thanking

913
00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.300
all are fucking Moses or whatever.
They'll like say to cut them off,
cut them off,

914
00:54:40.301 --> 00:54:43.390
cut them off,
cut them off,
which I can only do so much I kind of right.

915
00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:44.770
But those batteries,

916
00:54:44.771 --> 00:54:48.790
they changed those batteries at least once during the course of the UFC.

917
00:54:48.791 --> 00:54:52.300
Like they put a freshman at the beginning and it change it halfway through.
Yeah.

918
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:56.500
<v 1>There's just simply never as many problems with wires is there are with
wireless.</v>

919
00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:59.110
<v 6>Yeah.
Except the comedy store though.</v>

920
00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:03.640
The microphone the other day was fucking wire was fallen out.
That's awesome.

921
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.430
<v 1>The comedy store once every few months that happens cause so many comedians are</v>

922
00:55:07.431 --> 00:55:11.660
dropping the Mike and trying to yeah.
Trying to use it as a prop and yeah,

923
00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:14.810
it's craziness there.
People are so desperate.

924
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.341
<v 6>Well,</v>

925
00:55:18.341 --> 00:55:23.341
it's also that that Mike gets used by all the open miker is doing potluck too.

926
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:25.360
So get used by,
you know,

927
00:55:25.361 --> 00:55:30.100
20 people that have maybe never even held a micro for every Monday,
you know?

928
00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:33.430
Where were you saying though about the guy that invented the wireless?
Oh,

929
00:55:33.431 --> 00:55:37.510
Dean del Ray had him on his podcast and dean was explaining to me how long this

930
00:55:37.511 --> 00:55:40.990
guy worked to develop that and how fucking rich this guy is now.

931
00:55:41.170 --> 00:55:44.590
This guy owns like the most expensive house in San Francisco.

932
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:49.720
He has some crazy castle that he built just from the money that he made from the

933
00:55:49.721 --> 00:55:53.920
wireless Mike and yeah,
I will let dean explain it.

934
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:57.790
I wish I could remember if you just Google Dean del Rey's,

935
00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:01.960
let there be rock or let there be talk that,
that's his podcast,
right?

936
00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:07.740
He's got an episode somewhere in there where he talks to the guy who invented

937
00:56:08.921 --> 00:56:12.850
the wireless Mike and the guy explains it,
but what a freak out that is.

938
00:56:12.851 --> 00:56:17.200
Like I figured out how to make a frequency that you can tune into in a building.

939
00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:20.560
I think you said the rolling stones were the first ones to use it,

940
00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:24.100
but then once they started using it,
everybody wanted to use like,
wait,
what?

941
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:28.870
Like the guitar is not connected to wires.
What the fuck?
Yeah.
You know,

942
00:56:28.871 --> 00:56:32.170
and then they have to have a different frequency obviously for the guitar than

943
00:56:32.171 --> 00:56:34.600
they do for the other shit that's going on.
Wow.

944
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:38.410
A few different frequencies that are floating around the air.

945
00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:39.580
I like radio signals.

946
00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:41.080
<v 4>I like her wires,
man.</v>

947
00:56:41.081 --> 00:56:45.990
I think it gives us a feeling of stability and connection and like,

948
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:51.070
I don't know,
there's something about losing the particles of art in the air.

949
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.510
That's just seems risky to me.
It really does.
Like,

950
00:56:55.511 --> 00:57:00.511
I mean there's just so few problems with the wired mic in this,

951
00:57:02.021 --> 00:57:05.170
that on off switch and there's a button there and sometimes when you're

952
00:57:05.171 --> 00:57:07.840
performing you feel it against your thumb.
Like Whoa,

953
00:57:07.841 --> 00:57:09.580
that's close and you've got to like turn it.

954
00:57:09.581 --> 00:57:12.390
That's like one more problem that we need up there.
Yeah.

955
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.930
That is just like a little,
you know,
sometimes it is off by the way,

956
00:57:16.931 --> 00:57:20.230
cause I go out there first sometimes and every once in awhile there's nothing

957
00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:23.920
crazier than you on this side.
Mike on Melbourne card,

958
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.230
what the fuck is up?
And the place just goes,
yeah,

959
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:27.383
<v 7>yeah.</v>

960
00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.960
<v 4>And You bring me up the Golden Pony,
Tony Hinchcliffe it</v>

961
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.370
and I walk up and then it's like a 1520 second walk to the mic sometimes in

962
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:41.810
these big venues and you grabbed the mic and you're like,
what's up Melbourne?

963
00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.390
And you realize that the flowers and not on and then you have to hit the button.

964
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.600
Dude,
it happens like five or 10% of the time.

965
00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:51.270
I don't make a deal about it or complain about it,

966
00:57:51.271 --> 00:57:54.750
but when there's a wireless mic,
five to 10% of the time,

967
00:57:54.751 --> 00:57:57.690
that's the ratio I'm getting for this.
There's a problem.

968
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.000
Normally they're not turned on in the beginning.

969
00:58:00.001 --> 00:58:04.350
Like it's like the easiest thing that everybody forgets to do and then I'm
stuck.

970
00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.890
I know how to turn all those on.
By the way from that,
I never took,

971
00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:10.200
I never owned one of these mikes.
I took her class.

972
00:58:10.201 --> 00:58:14.130
You might end up finding out where every button is on everything like yeah.
With,

973
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:19.320
with,
with three,
four,
5,000 people watching and they don't even realize,

974
00:58:19.321 --> 00:58:22.350
they're like,
oh,
he's taking his time saying hello to us.
It's like,
no,

975
00:58:22.351 --> 00:58:23.340
I already tried.

976
00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:28.800
<v 6>Well they used to be the old ones had the antennas in the bottom and if you got</v>

977
00:58:28.801 --> 00:58:30.420
too close to the antenna would cut off.

978
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:33.810
I'll give you to hold it too close to the bottom.
They'd tell me,

979
00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:37.050
even in the early days of the UFC when I would do post fight interviews,

980
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:41.400
don't grab the bottom of the Mike you had to grab like or towards the top.

981
00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:45.360
And I would grab it like with my index finger and my,
um,

982
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:49.620
my thumb and sort of let my other fingers relaxed that I want to grip it too

983
00:58:49.621 --> 00:58:53.370
tight at the bottom because I worried that it would cut off the signal somehow.

984
00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:54.660
Like if you grab it low,

985
00:58:54.661 --> 00:58:57.780
like a fight or sometimes they would take the mic from me or are they would hold

986
00:58:57.781 --> 00:59:00.090
onto the mic as well and they would touch the bottom of it.

987
00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:03.630
It would cut off the signal.
Yeah,
they're,

988
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:08.010
they're more problematic.
It's something you could use cords to,
you know,

989
00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:10.830
use them as props as part of like the cord.
Yeah.

990
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.840
Like I had a a bit that I used to do about having a girl jerk you off.

991
00:59:15.841 --> 00:59:18.360
So I tried to brush your teeth with your left hand.
Like they don't,

992
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:23.390
they don't have the type of coordination that's developed over years and years

993
00:59:23.391 --> 00:59:26.110
of jerking off.
Right.
You know,
like when a girl says a,

994
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.020
I'll just do it with my hand.

995
00:59:27.021 --> 00:59:31.700
Like what would make you think that you could possibly be as good at that as me?

996
00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:31.990
Right.

997
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:36.410
And I would do this bit or I would hold the cord with my left hand and I'd be

998
00:59:36.411 --> 00:59:39.050
jerking it off like a girl with a tired arm.
Like,
oh my God,

999
00:59:39.051 --> 00:59:43.370
I have to switch hands.
And like I needed the cord if I didn't have the cord.

1000
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.150
It wouldn't work as well.
Yeah.

1001
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.080
I need a physical thing in my hand that I was tugging on.

1002
00:59:48.081 --> 00:59:51.140
It made more sense then I was just,
if I was doing it,
the air,

1003
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.500
the bit would be like 10% less effective.

1004
00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:56.060
<v 4>And plus I feel like there's just something fun,</v>

1005
00:59:56.061 --> 00:59:59.180
especially when we're doing like big theaters and big stages.

1006
00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.850
There's something fun about that whip.
You know what I mean?

1007
01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:03.470
Like just like getting out of the way.

1008
01:00:03.471 --> 01:00:05.390
Cause I think it sort of tells the audience,

1009
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.550
I'm going to get this out of the way cause I've stuffed to do,

1010
01:00:07.551 --> 01:00:09.650
I've stuffed to share with you.
You know what I mean?

1011
01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:11.450
Like get this shit and like moving it.

1012
01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:15.710
I feel like that's all sort of like training the audience to sort of be like,

1013
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:17.840
oh he knows what he's doing.
You know what I mean?

1014
01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:20.820
Like he's getting that out of the way.
Something's about to happen.
Like I dunno,

1015
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:24.680
I feel like there's something,
I'm just pro cord all the way.

1016
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:28.700
<v 6>How many clubs have you performed at in New York City?
Um,</v>

1017
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.240
pretty much all of them.
Have you ever noticed that?

1018
01:00:32.241 --> 01:00:37.010
Like a lot of the clubs in New York in particular,
they have really small stages,

1019
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.830
really small.
The craziest was Caroline's.

1020
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:42.170
Caroline's would have two different stages.

1021
01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:45.350
They'd have the regular stage and then you have to sell out stage where they

1022
01:00:45.351 --> 01:00:50.210
would take the wings off the side and you would be in a sold out room of 300

1023
01:00:50.211 --> 01:00:53.420
people and they would be fucking on top of you.

1024
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:56.360
I mean literally they could touch your Dick,

1025
01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:00.350
they could reach out and just touch you.
You're so close to the audience.

1026
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.560
Their tables are so small and everybody's stuffed in there.

1027
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:06.350
And I think that that style of calm,

1028
01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:10.160
like there's a certain type of intimacy in those clubs,

1029
01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:12.800
like a stand up New York is like that.

1030
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.950
There's a certain type of intimacy in those clubs because you can't move around

1031
01:01:15.951 --> 01:01:16.720
very much.

1032
01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.600
You can't get very physical and you almost have to talk to the audience.

1033
01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:23.610
You almost have to address them.
Right.
Cause they're right in front of you.

1034
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:27.030
<v 4>Yeah.
It's so small.
Like I don't think people realize when they're watching.</v>

1035
01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:30.510
Like Louie how small that stages at the cellar.
Oh,
it's tiny.

1036
01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:35.070
There's enough in there.
It's like a shoe box.
Yeah.
It's like really,
really,

1037
01:01:35.071 --> 01:01:39.390
really crazy small where it's like,
um,
even the belly room's bigger than that.

1038
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.260
Oh yeah.
Oh definitely.
Yeah.
Ever.
Oh ours arms bigger than that.
Oh yeah.

1039
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:44.940
<v 6>I think the ors the perfect room.</v>

1040
01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.410
I think the original room at the comedy store is literally the private room.

1041
01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.810
I think Bella Room almost might be too small,
but it's a good,

1042
01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:55.040
it's a good proving ground.
It's a good place to fuck around.

1043
01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.130
<v 4>It's a good room to get good for the LR.</v>

1044
01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:01.420
<v 6>Yeah.
And then the main room was like the big show.</v>

1045
01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:05.390
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
But the main room still,</v>

1046
01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:10.840
if I would take a sold out hot.
Oh our crowd over a sold out main room crowd.

1047
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:15.770
Yeah.
Cause it's our wallets harder.
It's more fun to kill him.
I'm telling you,

1048
01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:19.380
I had this set the other night and it's because of Joey Diaz Cause Joey Diaz

1049
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:23.060
made them believe that miracles can happen.
So what happened?

1050
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:28.500
Joey d is made this audience think that they were at the greatest thing ever.

1051
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:31.530
And I was on,
I was there too.
I was in the back of the room watching him.

1052
01:02:31.531 --> 01:02:35.850
My hands hurting from clapping in a fucking pumped me up man.

1053
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:40.140
And I had more fun in the,
or the other day at the comedy store.
They should,

1054
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.800
you know,
I feel like it's not supposed to be that way.

1055
01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:48.390
I've should have had more fun in Atlanta,
headlining my own shows or like,

1056
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.790
you know,
at odd ball or whatever.

1057
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:54.300
But it's like there's something about that or it's probably cause it's the first

1058
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:55.290
place I ever went up.

1059
01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:59.760
<v 6>Well I forgot what it was like when I was not there for seven years.</v>

1060
01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.890
I forgot I didn't in the kind of new,
there's something cool about it,

1061
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:06.900
but going back like when I want what's,

1062
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:08.700
it's been a year now since I've been back,

1063
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:12.270
because I went back last November and when I went back I was like,
whoa,

1064
01:03:12.271 --> 01:03:15.600
this place is crazy.
I forgot,
I forgot.
I forgot.

1065
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:20.780
There's like a unique feeling in that room because that was Ciro's nightclub and

1066
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:26.091
because of how many people died there and how much crazy shit has gone on that

1067
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:30.180
room.
Think about how much performing has been in that building.

1068
01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.573
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1069
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:36.670
There's nothing like it anywhere because it's been every day of the year from

1070
01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:41.240
nine till two in the morning.
Every day of the year.
Yeah.

1071
01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.620
Every day of the year.
Like unless there's some crazy thing that's going on,

1072
01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:51.170
they only closed for one day after that shooting.
Yeah.
And even,

1073
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:53.700
oh,
I guess they stopped that show.

1074
01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:58.720
<v 6>It happened.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I mean,
Christmas,</v>

1075
01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:03.160
new years,
Hanukkah,
those are big days.
Shashauna big days for them.

1076
01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:08.020
Every day,
every day,
seven days a week during 65 days a year.

1077
01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.380
And so like he used to call it the home from misfit toys,

1078
01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.930
the island of misfit toys is,
she used to call it.

1079
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.500
<v 4>I think about that a lot.
You know,</v>

1080
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:19.890
we were just talking about the hauntings last night at the comedy store and
yeah,

1081
01:04:19.891 --> 01:04:23.400
I think that it could have to do with all the people that have gotten killed

1082
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:23.970
there,

1083
01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:28.020
but I think there's also something to be said about that being a building in

1084
01:04:28.021 --> 01:04:33.021
which every night there's this burst of energy for five or six hours and then

1085
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:41.630
back down to complete silence to where you can hear a roach on the other side of

1086
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:45.510
the building walking across the main room stage.
You know what I mean?

1087
01:04:45.511 --> 01:04:49.050
Like it gets so quiet there and then what,

1088
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.510
16 hours later,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1089
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:56.220
Every room filled to the gullets with human beings for five or six hours and

1090
01:04:56.221 --> 01:04:56.420
then yeah,

1091
01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:00.780
<v 6>boom.
Like that doesn't happen anywhere.
You know what I mean?</v>

1092
01:05:00.781 --> 01:05:05.670
Like yeah,
that fucking gone again.
Yeah.
Ding Dong,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding,
Ding Dong.

1093
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.360
It's a shitty non melodic tune to hear that.

1094
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.050
<v 4>Yeah.
The Easter really like fucking music used to suck.</v>

1095
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:18.010
Oh they add or these six church bells.

1096
01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:18.561
<v 6>You know,</v>

1097
01:05:18.561 --> 01:05:22.070
what's amazing is that they figured out how to write music down and you could

1098
01:05:22.071 --> 01:05:24.980
recreate it like Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1099
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.970
Like they figured out how to write that down and you could,

1100
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:31.490
you look at sheet music,
I can't read,
but people who can read it,

1101
01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.700
they look at that and they can perform something that was written down way

1102
01:05:37.131 --> 01:05:40.400
before things were ever recorded.
Like music was ever,
like,

1103
01:05:40.401 --> 01:05:43.300
they didn't figure out how to record music until like,
what was it,

1104
01:05:43.301 --> 01:05:46.760
like the 18 hundreds or the 19 whatever they figured out the first photographic

1105
01:05:46.761 --> 01:05:50.540
record.
It's probably like the early 19 hundreds or the late 18 hundreds,

1106
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:54.950
whatever the fuck it was.
Whenever they figured out how to record an album,

1107
01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:57.020
you know,
uh,
on wax.

1108
01:05:57.770 --> 01:06:02.060
Think about how long they wrote stuff down that you could recreate.

1109
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:06.230
Like you couldn't recreate like songs,

1110
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:09.020
like as far as like how someone could sing.

1111
01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:12.380
Like if you think about the difference between the way Amy Winehouse sayings and

1112
01:06:12.381 --> 01:06:16.460
the way,
you know,
fill in the blank,
you know?
Yeah.
Any other,

1113
01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:22.100
you know,
Barbara Streisand sings or Risa Franklin sings,

1114
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.770
you know,
we looked at Aretha Franklin.

1115
01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:29.690
Like how could you ever recreate that on paper where you can understand,

1116
01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:34.910
we've got to say to me,
you never could ever,

1117
01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:39.010
you know,
he never nail James Brown.
Oh,

1118
01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:41.930
get up,
get on up.

1119
01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:46.610
You can never figure out how to relay that to people without them actually

1120
01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:49.640
hearing it makes you wonder what we missed.
Oh yeah.

1121
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.050
Singing and all that stuff.
We know.
That's,
uh,
one of the things,

1122
01:06:54.051 --> 01:06:58.670
I'm listening to this Dan Dan Carlin hardcore history podcast and it's a part of

1123
01:06:58.671 --> 01:07:01.670
it.
It's about Hurghada at us and how,
uh,

1124
01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:06.860
Herata just the way he would write history was so theatrical and so there was so

1125
01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:11.861
much flavor to the way he wrote things that they think that part of it was what

1126
01:07:12.951 --> 01:07:16.070
he wrote was meant to be performed.
That it was,

1127
01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.310
it was not just a written thing that was meant to be read,

1128
01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:24.580
but it was meant to be performed in like these theatrical presentations.

1129
01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.740
And that's how they used to relay history,

1130
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:31.450
which was why it had so much flavor to it.
It like,

1131
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:34.330
it was designed to rope people in that room watching it.

1132
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:39.310
It would probably fucked up on homemade wine and you know,
yeah.

1133
01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.860
And those amphitheaters,
those,

1134
01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:46.880
those places that they had developed or they would have like a flat surface on

1135
01:07:46.881 --> 01:07:47.720
the ground in this,

1136
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:52.280
these like tiered stairs all around them.

1137
01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:55.280
And they would have to project their words.

1138
01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:01.420
Like all that style of acting was all based on having to project so that people

1139
01:08:02.691 --> 01:08:03.524
could hear you.

1140
01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:08.590
That's sort of flavored how early acting was a lot of early acting was very over

1141
01:08:10.701 --> 01:08:12.050
the top.
Yeah.

1142
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:15.500
And a big part of that was because they had to hear you in the back.
The room

1143
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.960
<v 8>didn't have microphones.
Yeah.</v>

1144
01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.670
<v 4>And now a lot of the best stuff is the opposite.</v>

1145
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:26.230
Like I feel like a lot of my favorite actors are like very,
very,
very chill.

1146
01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.700
Very,
very mellow.

1147
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:28.311
<v 8>Oh yeah.</v>

1148
01:08:28.311 --> 01:08:32.810
Well you think about what you can get done with like a quiet voice now that you

1149
01:08:32.811 --> 01:08:37.400
could never do before.
Yeah.
You know,
with the smoldering,

1150
01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:38.780
which you could do now

1151
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.070
<v 4>in the d like you can really see their face and the way that they,</v>

1152
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:48.650
if they're upset or they're sad or anything.
And now acting I feel like has been,

1153
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:50.780
you know,
so amplified.

1154
01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.070
<v 8>Yeah.
It's um,
it's,</v>

1155
01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:59.100
it's really interesting what they've been able to do as far as broadcasting and

1156
01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:03.970
recording people's movements and people's talking and well,

1157
01:09:03.971 --> 01:09:07.330
even in like martial arts,
like we're going to go see the UFC tomorrow.

1158
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.250
I'll tell you,
man,
when I was young,

1159
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:14.440
like watching people much better than me fight and watching them kick and

1160
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:19.060
watching them perform techniques made me understand how to do them correctly

1161
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:22.630
because I could watch them.
But you had to be around these guys to wash them.

1162
01:09:22.631 --> 01:09:27.160
Like when I was a kid,
I used to study tapes at the time was like VHS tapes,

1163
01:09:27.490 --> 01:09:28.450
but it was like the whole,

1164
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:33.340
one of the first times that people had VHS tapes to study was in the 80s because

1165
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:35.500
before that you had to have like a projector.

1166
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:40.700
You had to get like a projection and like Mike Tyson used to watch old films at

1167
01:09:41.621 --> 01:09:43.930
custom models house.
He would go down,

1168
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:48.670
he would operate one of those real to real projectors and watch old films of

1169
01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:53.020
people fighting and he learned from their movements like how to mimic and and

1170
01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:56.350
how to imitate those movements and how to learn from those movements.

1171
01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:59.380
And now you can just go to youtube.

1172
01:09:59.381 --> 01:10:04.240
You can find something like fighters today in the UFC to have such a massive

1173
01:10:04.241 --> 01:10:07.960
advantage of like being able to mirror and imitate and,

1174
01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:11.920
and sort of recreate the movements of like great fighters.

1175
01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.720
Cause you could see how they do it.

1176
01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:16.720
You could watch every Anderson Silva fight that he ever had in the UFC.

1177
01:10:16.721 --> 01:10:17.940
Anybody could watch him.
Yeah.

1178
01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.140
And you could see what he was able to do and how he moved.

1179
01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:24.440
<v 4>It almost seems like we're at the point almost where like,
I don't know,</v>

1180
01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:25.580
decades from now,

1181
01:10:25.581 --> 01:10:30.581
fighters will be able to like spar 3-d with their opponent coming up that

1182
01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:34.910
they're actually going against in the octagon.
Oh yeah,
definitely.

1183
01:10:34.911 --> 01:10:38.030
You know that they're going to get their real effects in real moves.

1184
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:39.470
Like when they do the kicks,

1185
01:10:39.471 --> 01:10:43.180
the angles that you could just practice with that stuff and can't hollowed

1186
01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.240
grounds.
Yeah,

1187
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.680
<v 8>you'll have holograms.</v>

1188
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:50.660
Maybe you could wear a suit and when that person hits you in the Hologram,

1189
01:10:50.661 --> 01:10:52.700
like you'll feel some sort of an impact,

1190
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:54.770
like not to the point where it will hurt,

1191
01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:58.050
but you'll be aware of where that when they connected on you.
Yeah,

1192
01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:00.320
and maybe when they connect on you,

1193
01:11:00.321 --> 01:11:04.100
like they're holographic image will respond as if they actually hit you.

1194
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:05.660
Like they won't kick through you.

1195
01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:08.660
They'll kick up into the point where it touches you and you'll feel it on your

1196
01:11:08.661 --> 01:11:10.640
chest like you'll have some service suit on.

1197
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.300
That's totally within the realm of possibility for the future when technology

1198
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:18.750
advances.
Yeah,
virtual reality to men,

1199
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.600
virtual reality is going to be so fascinating what they're going to be able to

1200
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:22.740
do with movies.

1201
01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:25.740
You're going to be able to watch three d movies where you put a virtual reality

1202
01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:28.410
headset on and you're going to be immersed in the movie.

1203
01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:32.940
You'll be able to go through like a crime scene and look down at the body and

1204
01:11:32.941 --> 01:11:36.570
looked down at the person is trying to cover up the evidence and look,
look,

1205
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:39.570
look out the window and see the cops pull up on their holy shit.

1206
01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:44.070
You're going to like be a part in the,
in the actual movie itself.
Yeah.

1207
01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.840
All these different ways to experience it.

1208
01:11:46.020 --> 01:11:49.500
Instead of being able to experience a movie in a flat sort of a two dimensional

1209
01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:53.160
way where you're forced to watch the scene as it director and laid it out,

1210
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:56.100
you're going to be able to change and alter the senior yourself by your own

1211
01:11:56.101 --> 01:12:00.840
perspective.
You could just tied to stand on a chair in the scene,
you know,

1212
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:05.460
and look at it from up above or get down on your knees and like look down at the

1213
01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:08.900
body,
looked down at the murder weapon or look down at the grass.

1214
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.320
These people are playing in.

1215
01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:15.500
You're going to be able to manipulate your perspective and it'll change how you

1216
01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:17.700
enjoy a film.
Yeah.

1217
01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.060
<v 1>It makes me want to start writing one like that.
Yeah man.
I like that thing.</v>

1218
01:12:22.061 --> 01:12:23.410
You just start it like it's like

1219
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:27.980
<v 8>you know it on this.
Yeah,
well like a three dimensional game.</v>

1220
01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:31.490
Like if you play a game like quake or unreal or you know some,

1221
01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:35.180
some three d shooter or you're going down these hallways,

1222
01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.550
you can pause at any time and look at the ground,

1223
01:12:37.551 --> 01:12:42.551
look at the walls and it becomes like an interactive thing and instead of,

1224
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:47.510
and it's still obviously a work of art.
It's still,
when you're playing a game,

1225
01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:48.680
like it was not a,

1226
01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:53.150
if it's not an interactive game or if it's not rather a multiplayer game where

1227
01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:56.780
you're playing against another person,
if it's just you versus the computer,

1228
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.700
you're,

1229
01:12:57.700 --> 01:13:01.640
you're still choosing how to approach it and how to interface with the game.

1230
01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.380
You could pause if you like,

1231
01:13:03.381 --> 01:13:07.270
you could stop and not move forward or you can run or you could go laughter.

1232
01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:07.881
You go right.

1233
01:13:07.881 --> 01:13:12.881
Like you choose and you're choosing to how you interact with this piece of art.

1234
01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:15.080
Like a video game is really a piece of art.

1235
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:19.520
You're kind of choosing how you connect to it,
you know?
I think that's,

1236
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:23.930
that's very likely going to be the way we experience movies.

1237
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:27.530
Like you gotta be able to choose how you interact with it,

1238
01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:31.520
but then the problem with that is then it won't be like a film won't be

1239
01:13:31.521 --> 01:13:35.960
something that you really necessarily would enjoy watching it with other people.

1240
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:38.370
Right?
Like at a movie theater.
Yeah.

1241
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:42.270
It's going to be so different if you have a virtual reality headset on.
It's

1242
01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.110
<v 1>true,
but I think watching the lease of people's way overrated.
Yeah.</v>

1243
01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.660
When's the last time you went to a movie theater by yourself?

1244
01:13:49.661 --> 01:13:52.210
I bet it's been a while,
right?
Long time.
Long time.

1245
01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:56.200
I never even thought about it again.

1246
01:13:56.201 --> 01:14:00.610
Maybe it's just a Midwest thing where it's like,
yeah,
I'm be by yourself.

1247
01:14:00.611 --> 01:14:04.650
Like I feel like that freak crazy.
Yeah,
exactly.
What are you gonna?

1248
01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:09.310
What are you a school shooter?
You don't go on a movie by yourself,
but man,

1249
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:12.430
when there's any know,
I love my girlfriend.

1250
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.880
She's amazing and she loves movies and we'd go and we see movies.

1251
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:21.630
Is there something about going by yourself and you just have both armrests and

1252
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:27.010
there's just no distractions touching you and asking you a question.

1253
01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:30.250
When's the last time somebody whispered something in your ear at the movie

1254
01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:32.830
theater and you said,
thank you for that in from like,

1255
01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:34.630
I'm really grateful for that information.

1256
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:37.810
I wouldn't have known that or notice that and you're not,
you know,

1257
01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:43.120
a movie is supposed to like,
you're supposed to have your own take on it.

1258
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:44.381
You know what I mean?

1259
01:14:44.381 --> 01:14:49.381
Like Quentin Tarantino said with pulp fiction that he wanted everybody that saw

1260
01:14:49.901 --> 01:14:53.140
that movie to have it,
to have seen a different movie,

1261
01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:57.970
to think that something else happened and miss apart and like have everybody

1262
01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:00.610
almost have like a different DNA for that movie.

1263
01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:04.960
Like that he didn't want to people to see the same thing and it makes sense

1264
01:15:04.961 --> 01:15:09.280
completely that,
that,
that,
that for that movie.
Um,

1265
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:12.220
and like,
um,
uh,

1266
01:15:13.150 --> 01:15:16.000
I don't even like anybody else in the movie theater,

1267
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:20.330
not to mention somebody next to me.
The worst is people talking.
Well,

1268
01:15:20.331 --> 01:15:24.340
the worst to me,
I mean,
I hate talking.
That's way out of line.

1269
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.720
But there's something about putting your feet on the chair in front of you.

1270
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.910
You only do that if that chair's empty.
Right?
Somebody sitting,

1271
01:15:31.911 --> 01:15:33.820
sending that chair in front of you can't put your feet on.

1272
01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:35.380
It's like the same thing with an airplane.

1273
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.820
<v 4>So do you do,
you're an asshole.</v>

1274
01:15:36.850 --> 01:15:39.790
There's some people that do put their feet on other people's chairs.
Yeah.

1275
01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.130
And it's super rude.

1276
01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.020
<v 1>Well you can feel that in a movie theater.</v>

1277
01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.880
They give you that two inch push that you know to where you could sorta like

1278
01:15:47.881 --> 01:15:51.660
lean back.
But so you feel it every time,
like big times.

1279
01:15:51.661 --> 01:15:55.410
Then you're watching a movie and shit serious and all of a sudden now you're

1280
01:15:55.411 --> 01:15:59.220
thinking about what kind of shoes the person behind you is wearing or like if

1281
01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:02.430
they're even wearing shoes and this and that and how out of line that is to do

1282
01:16:02.431 --> 01:16:07.140
that at a movie theater.
Like it's so out of line.
And by the way,
popcorn.

1283
01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:09.270
How did that become the thing at the movie theater?

1284
01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.730
I know it sounds like a hacky like premise,

1285
01:16:11.731 --> 01:16:16.731
but how did that become the theater food cause delicious and it's a good snack.

1286
01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.460
It's a good snack.
I Dunno if I give it delicious

1287
01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.430
<v 4>with butter and salt.
Yeah.</v>

1288
01:16:22.431 --> 01:16:26.260
I mean the first few bites they can get you with that dude.

1289
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:30.100
Popcorns only good for about 10 bites and then it's just a workout and it's
there

1290
01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:36.160
and it's the loudest thing out of everything.
It's not the lab.
It is loud.
Yeah.

1291
01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:40.610
Crunch crunch so loud and you guys not as chips and every time somebody opens

1292
01:16:40.611 --> 01:16:44.960
the door you can hear it popping in the lobby too.
Like it's like loud to make.

1293
01:16:44.961 --> 01:16:47.870
It's allowed to eat.
You can hear it when people drop it.
You can eat.

1294
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.420
Some of you heard it pop in the lobby.
Where are you going to the movie?

1295
01:16:50.421 --> 01:16:55.040
The new Beverly cinema on Beverly and Labrea.
Quentin Tarantino's theater.

1296
01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:58.730
They show like oil westerns.
Oh,
do you go there dude?
I watch the good,
the bad,

1297
01:16:58.731 --> 01:17:02.600
the ugly.
A few weeks ago.
Really with the crowd going crazy.

1298
01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:07.910
Crazy dude.
We need to go laughing at the funny scenes,

1299
01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:12.800
gasping at the ones like they show real movies.
October,
they just had Halloween,

1300
01:17:12.801 --> 01:17:15.320
they showed like beetle juice night of the living dead.

1301
01:17:15.321 --> 01:17:19.490
Like cool newbies chips would be worse though,
wouldn't they?
Yeah,

1302
01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.740
<v 6>that'd be the worst.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1303
01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.880
And the bag of chips here,
right.
Chips would be terrible.
Shitty fucking church.

1304
01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.990
Yeah.
Keeps te te letting us think.
It's like a dog next door.

1305
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.470
There's a guy named Frank Center.
Really?
It was a funny comic from Boston.

1306
01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.330
He used to,
he was in the Sopranos.
He had a scene as probably as a bartender,

1307
01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:43.060
his promise.
And he had this bit about a dog barking next door.

1308
01:17:43.061 --> 01:17:45.800
Right when you think it's gonna stop,
like Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah blah.

1309
01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.020
[inaudible]

1310
01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:49.890
<v 9>Marc by Marc.
My mark.
Okay.</v>

1311
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:51.590
<v 6>Like right when you would think it would stop</v>

1312
01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.810
<v 9>mark,
mark,
mark,
mark,</v>

1313
01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.680
<v 6>Barack Obama,
mark again.
That,
that it's like this fucking stupid church.
Yeah.</v>

1314
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:06.930
Some asshole is next door.
Just climbing on those bells.
Yeah.

1315
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:10.800
Some hunchback,
some freak.
Um,

1316
01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:13.500
did you hear about what's going on with Quentin Tarantino where the cops are

1317
01:18:13.501 --> 01:18:14.670
boycotting him?
Yeah.

1318
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.820
They don't want to work as movies cause he called them killers.
Yeah.

1319
01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.580
Kind of interesting.
Yeah.

1320
01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.150
<v 4>Yeah.
Well I'm pretty sure,
uh,</v>

1321
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:25.830
I'm pretty sure that uh,
you know,

1322
01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:31.010
first of all they're drawing more attention to it then would have been had they

1323
01:18:31.051 --> 01:18:33.240
not boycotted his movies.
Yeah.

1324
01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.690
They wouldn't be talking about Quentin Tarantino doing that.
The whole,

1325
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:40.520
the only thing that they're talking about is New York police boycott,

1326
01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:45.180
Quentin Tarantino's movies,
la coming out at the end of December,
by the way.

1327
01:18:45.181 --> 01:18:45.841
You know what I mean?

1328
01:18:45.841 --> 01:18:50.400
Like it's like such a promo and these things backfire when these people try to

1329
01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:51.234
do this stuff.

1330
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:54.660
<v 6>But it also makes people aware that what he's saying is you're responsible,</v>

1331
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.640
you know,
to call cops killers.

1332
01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:00.240
You think about how many cops and how many interactions with cops have all day

1333
01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.470
long.
I mean,
yeah,

1334
01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:05.910
it is terrible when like something like Sandra bland or all these different

1335
01:19:05.911 --> 01:19:10.620
scenarios take place where where people do wind up dying at the hands of cops.

1336
01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:12.810
It's absolutely horrific.
But to how many,

1337
01:19:12.930 --> 01:19:16.320
you look at the actual numbers of how many cops there are and how many

1338
01:19:16.321 --> 01:19:20.640
interactions these cops have with human beings and how many different

1339
01:19:20.641 --> 01:19:25.140
interactions happen during the day and how many times it leads to a real

1340
01:19:25.141 --> 01:19:29.820
problem.
Those problems for sure are horrific and the real issues.

1341
01:19:29.821 --> 01:19:31.590
But overall,

1342
01:19:31.591 --> 01:19:36.591
I mean to label all cops killers or all cops are murderers are all kinds of like

1343
01:19:36.841 --> 01:19:40.530
that.
It's,
it is in a way irresponsible and it's easy to do.

1344
01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:44.570
<v 4>Did he say all cops?
I don't know what his words were.
I don't even think he did.</v>

1345
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:49.070
I think he said something to the effect of cops or cops have been murdering

1346
01:19:49.071 --> 01:19:52.700
innocent people,
you know,
something like that and you know,

1347
01:19:52.701 --> 01:19:57.410
for them to run with it.
I mean,
okay guys,
so wait,
wait,
what an imprint.

1348
01:19:57.411 --> 01:20:00.620
You're going to leave on this brand new,
you know,
hateful eight movie.

1349
01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:05.510
That's going to be the shit like the movie's supposed to be about.
God.
God,

1350
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.640
what is she?
It's going to be so good.
Um,

1351
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:12.810
<v 1>it's about,
basically the gist is sorta like civil war.</v>

1352
01:20:12.811 --> 01:20:16.350
It's sort of like Django meets inglorious bastards.

1353
01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:20.610
Like it's like civil war,
but like really bad ass.

1354
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:23.430
Kurt Russell Civil War,
Huh?
Yeah.

1355
01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:27.930
Civil war mixed with like assassins and they kidnapped someone.

1356
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:31.560
I was in the late 1800.
That's what I'm supposed to be two.
Yeah.
Dude.

1357
01:20:31.561 --> 01:20:36.400
Kurt Russell has this huge beard and this huge mustache.

1358
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.440
<v 8>So was he growing it for the movie or is it fake?</v>

1359
01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.030
<v 1>Oh,
it's real.
He fucking did it.
When,</v>

1360
01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.350
how long you took him to gross on a long time.
They all do that.
Should they go?

1361
01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:49.280
They make them fucking work.
You Know Quentin,
you've seen Kel Bell.
Yeah.

1362
01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:54.260
He sent them all to Japan to train in the art of the Samurai Sword.

1363
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:58.430
That entire assassination squad.
Deadly vipers.

1364
01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:03.410
David Carradine dedicate a Fox,
Michael Madsen,
Uma Thurman,

1365
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:06.290
and um,
they're all Hannah.

1366
01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:11.380
They all went to fucking Japan and stayed in cool little Japanese fucking,

1367
01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:16.730
you know,
condos with like sliding jet.
Every,
everything was like super culture.

1368
01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.130
Wow.
For them to really get in the zone and they,
and you can see,

1369
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:23.390
you can tell that they know what they're doing when they're doing their crazy

1370
01:21:23.391 --> 01:21:26.690
shit.
Like you can feel it in that movie.
I feel like at least.

1371
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:31.730
Um,
but anyway,
yeah,
I mean like,

1372
01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.700
you know those cops are gonna see that movie.

1373
01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:36.770
They can say they're going to boycott at,
what are they,

1374
01:21:36.771 --> 01:21:39.590
I mean I would say they'd put on a fake mustache,

1375
01:21:39.591 --> 01:21:43.850
but they probably already have muscles dashes are going to shape their mustaches

1376
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:47.320
to go sneak in.
Like,
Oh,
I'm not going to see this movie my ass.

1377
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.940
You're going miss it.

1378
01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:52.140
Kurt Russell within all out beard in a civil war assassin saga.

1379
01:21:52.170 --> 01:21:56.060
Okay officer,
you're a locks.
You might as well,

1380
01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.110
you might as well just go kill innocent people.
You're going to,
so

1381
01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:06.100
I don't know what's it worth missing that movie are killing innocent people,

1382
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.900
<v 8>but I'm just are huge Terentino's nerd fan.</v>

1383
01:22:12.901 --> 01:22:15.880
So I think everybody should take a,

1384
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.030
he's definitely made some fucking awesome movies.

1385
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:21.570
Paul Fisher was such a game changer.
You were watching on the way up here.

1386
01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.600
I looked over and I saw that,
uh,

1387
01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:28.050
that image of the girl and the guy at the diner at the beginning of the movie,

1388
01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:30.570
but they're talking to each other right when they kissed before they robbed the

1389
01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:34.860
place.
I'm like,
wow.
That's like the beginning of the stitch at ties.

1390
01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:39.180
That whole crazy movie together.
Yeah.
It's unbelievable.
Yeah.

1391
01:22:39.210 --> 01:22:41.520
Different timeframes of all that.
Okay.

1392
01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:45.660
<v 1>You mean like when they come back to that at the end and they're robbing the</v>

1393
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:50.220
place and Travolta in Samuel hollers sitting there at [inaudible].

1394
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:53.550
By the time that that happens at the end,

1395
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:57.890
we know Travolta gets killed by Bruce Willis three,
well,
you know,

1396
01:22:57.930 --> 01:23:02.930
10 15 1520 minutes before that that Samuel l ends up retiring from the game

1397
01:23:04.501 --> 01:23:09.501
because of the holes in the wall where it's like all just like crazy.

1398
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.580
I haven't seen that moving along.
Income,
I need to go watch it again.

1399
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:15.400
Fun fact is I was watching it without the sound on.

1400
01:23:15.401 --> 01:23:19.960
I was listening to music and just had my headphones off because I know every

1401
01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:24.190
single inch of that movie so well that I don't even need to have the sound like

1402
01:23:24.191 --> 01:23:25.240
it's fun to have the sound,

1403
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:29.080
but it's also fun to like see their lips moving and knowing exactly what's going

1404
01:23:29.081 --> 01:23:29.530
on.

1405
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:33.010
<v 6>Yeah.
Yeah.
I was doing the same thing with the Lord of the rings.</v>

1406
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:36.850
<v 1>Did you end up watching that new mission?
Impossible.
No.
Oh God.</v>

1407
01:23:36.851 --> 01:23:39.340
It was really good.
I was really surprised.

1408
01:23:39.341 --> 01:23:41.080
I'm not a mission impossible guy at all.

1409
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:44.800
But this new one's great until some movies are so stupid.
I know.

1410
01:23:44.801 --> 01:23:47.200
But this song was like so good.
It was like funny.

1411
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:50.140
There was really you times where I laughed out loud like I was like this is

1412
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:54.460
fucking impressive.
Like I think all those are crap,
all of them.

1413
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.410
But this one is like really well written.

1414
01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.780
<v 6>Those movies.
It's,</v>

1415
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:02.200
it's hard to get me to sign up for like a bond movie or like a mission

1416
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:05.350
impossible movie.
Cause like,
you know the Tom Cruise is going to be okay.

1417
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:07.750
You know,
Daniel,
Craig's going to make it to the end of the movie.

1418
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:11.770
Whatever bad guys he's facing is gonna wind up killing woe is almost going to

1419
01:24:11.771 --> 01:24:16.120
die.
But it knows in like,
right.
Like you know,
no matter what.
But

1420
01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:16.801
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1421
01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:20.610
there's always one of those scenes where they're dead and then like all of a

1422
01:24:20.611 --> 01:24:23.460
sudden somebody has the paddles and they jolt them back to life.

1423
01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.300
<v 6>Yeah.
And what did I see recently that was like that?</v>

1424
01:24:26.301 --> 01:24:30.740
Then I had a really hard time getting into,
cause I knew that,
oh the Martian,

1425
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:35.730
I knew he was going to live like Lou,
my goal,

1426
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.280
these rooms going right,
but there's not,
yeah,
it was no drama.

1427
01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.920
Like when they were talking about coming back to get them,
I'm like,

1428
01:24:42.921 --> 01:24:45.890
they're going to get them,
they're going to get him.
He's going to live like,

1429
01:24:45.891 --> 01:24:47.300
oh my God,
he's floating in space.

1430
01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.910
He's got to figure out how to get to them so they can grab them and bring them

1431
01:24:49.911 --> 01:24:54.560
on board.
They're going to figure it out.
Like there was no drama.
It was.
So it's,

1432
01:24:54.650 --> 01:24:59.650
it's so problematic when you have like a star and one individual star that is

1433
01:25:00.741 --> 01:25:02.700
responsible for driving the whole movie.

1434
01:25:02.701 --> 01:25:06.110
And the whole movie was based on Matt Damon getting off Mars.

1435
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:08.570
He got trapped on Mars and they had to go back and get them.

1436
01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.670
So because of the fact that it was based on that,

1437
01:25:10.671 --> 01:25:12.260
like you knew he was gonna make it,

1438
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:17.270
you knew there was no real suspense and one of the end of the movie was kind of

1439
01:25:17.271 --> 01:25:20.240
anticlimactic because you knew it.
Whereas

1440
01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:26.270
even a movie like alien,
like the original alien with Sigourney weaver,

1441
01:25:26.570 --> 01:25:29.330
you kind of knew that Sigourney weaver nurse was going to make it.

1442
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:34.220
But the way they did it was so clever and they fucking killed off everybody but

1443
01:25:34.221 --> 01:25:38.420
her that it was okay.
It was okay cause it was so chaotic.

1444
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:42.740
<v 1>I've been on a movie rampage lately and I did purposefully didn't go see the</v>

1445
01:25:42.741 --> 01:25:45.560
Martian.
Really?
Yeah.
I'm like allergic to Matt Damon.

1446
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.810
<v 6>Why are you allergic to bad date?</v>

1447
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:53.870
<v 1>Oh,
there's just something about him.
I just think he's like the most overworked.</v>

1448
01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:57.050
Overrated,
like just bland,
boring.

1449
01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:59.520
I think rounders would have been better without them.

1450
01:25:59.710 --> 01:26:04.310
I think Malcovich buried and in that movie he couldn't anything Malcovich

1451
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.710
<v 4>was doing with his Oreos and all that stuff.</v>

1452
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:11.270
I think Ben Affleck's the same thing and I think they're like this duo of dog

1453
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:15.290
shit that just do
that.

1454
01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:19.530
Just like somehow they got this like goodwill hunting momentum and like

1455
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:22.700
everybody's just like,
yeah,
that cool cause I found goodwill hunting.
It's like,

1456
01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:25.130
no,
no,
I'm not buying it.

1457
01:26:25.131 --> 01:26:29.060
Ben Affleck's a tool he's not cool at all.

1458
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:32.170
Matt Damon is like,
you know,
if you want to know about

1459
01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:33.790
<v 8>how much of a tool Ben Affleck really is,</v>

1460
01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:35.680
you have to watch them on real time with Gomar.

1461
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.060
Watch you on real time with Bill Maher.
Were you accused of Sam Harris?
You know,

1462
01:26:40.061 --> 01:26:44.770
I don't know if you know Sam Harris is a brilliant intellectual who's written

1463
01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.280
many,
many books.
I'm diligent,
he's just fucking super genius.

1464
01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:52.360
And he accused him of being racist for his stance on Islam,

1465
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.190
like radical Islam and fundamentalist Islam being like a really dangerous

1466
01:26:57.191 --> 01:27:02.050
proposition,
a dangerous ideology.
And he did it in such a stupid,

1467
01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:02.920
clunky,

1468
01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:08.620
like ignorant way and look so dumb and so,

1469
01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:12.700
so much forced outrage while he was doing it like you watch and do it,
you go,

1470
01:27:12.701 --> 01:27:15.010
oh my God,
fuck this guy.
See where are you doing?

1471
01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:18.270
He was totally going to like social justice Brownie points,
right?

1472
01:27:18.271 --> 01:27:22.990
Like trying to stand up for the oppressed and the way he did it was so awkward

1473
01:27:22.991 --> 01:27:27.880
and loud and shouty it was,
it was so dumb.
It was so dumb.

1474
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:29.190
They did like you instantly,

1475
01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:33.950
instantly reveals how weak is actual argument was there was trying to back it up

1476
01:27:33.951 --> 01:27:37.720
by calling him a racist who was trying to like put him on the back of his heels

1477
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:41.130
like,
but you can't do that to Harris because he's a master debater.

1478
01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:43.750
Like he debates with people all the time.
Are they just people all the time.

1479
01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:46.210
So when you do that he like never loses his cool,

1480
01:27:46.330 --> 01:27:48.910
which made Ben Affleck look even dumber.

1481
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:53.920
And then Bill Maher is taking a Sam Harris society as well and they're both

1482
01:27:53.921 --> 01:27:57.190
going like,
I think you're missing what he's saying.
And he's like,
it's racist.

1483
01:27:57.191 --> 01:27:59.980
Oh my God.
Tracy just saying is so racist,

1484
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.970
but it's so dumb and clunky and it just you,

1485
01:28:03.971 --> 01:28:08.971
you realize like the poor quality of his thinking and how high he holds his own

1486
01:28:10.391 --> 01:28:14.890
opinions.
Like what?
You know,
it's,
you have to see it.

1487
01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:17.770
It's so Tulise.
I'll never,
I mean,

1488
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:23.200
I can't say I'll never respect his opinion again.
I value it so much less.

1489
01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:26.140
Well after watching that argument should boycott his movies.

1490
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:31.360
He was good in gone girl though.
See gone girl.

1491
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:33.450
<v 4>He was good in gone girl.
But you know what?</v>

1492
01:28:33.451 --> 01:28:36.330
I think that was just an extremely well written,

1493
01:28:36.331 --> 01:28:39.220
well directed movie that easily could have slept a,

1494
01:28:39.221 --> 01:28:43.530
you could've slept a Kevin Spacey in there and it's like,
no,
20% better.
Well,

1495
01:28:43.531 --> 01:28:44.700
yeah.
I mean,
I'm good son.
Yeah,

1496
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:49.260
<v 8>like gay and fat too.
You have to have someone younger and handsome.
But yeah,</v>

1497
01:28:49.261 --> 01:28:50.094
you could have,

1498
01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.980
<v 4>yeah,
I mean like aunt lil and haul it would act like crushed it.
Totally.</v>

1499
01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:58.290
Much better.
Much better.
There's something about Ben Affleck,
he's milk Korea.

1500
01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.290
Watch them and it makes sense.
You just know it's Ben Affleck.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1501
01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.170
It's like he doesn't,
he doesn't really break out of the,

1502
01:29:05.171 --> 01:29:07.080
it's never like a different,
you're never like,
oh,

1503
01:29:07.081 --> 01:29:09.660
I didn't even notice that was Ben Affleck.
You know what I mean?

1504
01:29:09.661 --> 01:29:10.730
Like how you have that,

1505
01:29:10.731 --> 01:29:15.060
that that's that way with so many great actors and like you're like,
oh,

1506
01:29:15.061 --> 01:29:17.790
I didn't even notice I was him.
Like,
he's so good in it.

1507
01:29:18.610 --> 01:29:22.210
<v 8>Yeah.
I felt like that in that.
Um,
what was that movie that he did?</v>

1508
01:29:22.211 --> 01:29:24.900
The town goes another movies like,
God,

1509
01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:28.930
anybody get it done that the town movie where he plays the bank robber guy.

1510
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.050
Remember that movie?
No.
How many?

1511
01:29:32.051 --> 01:29:34.420
His buddies are all bank robbers from Charlestown.

1512
01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:38.590
Charlestown was like a real area of Boston that was filled with the Jed

1513
01:29:38.591 --> 01:29:43.591
criminals and they were like a legit high amount of bank robbers came out as one

1514
01:29:44.321 --> 01:29:48.790
area.
But he's done a bunch of those Boston movies too.

1515
01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:51.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's where it goodwill hunting was.

1516
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.040
<v 4>I love it.
South Park does with Matt Damon.
Yeah,</v>

1517
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:59.810
<v 8>but he's not stupid.
So it's so funny when they do those like a,</v>

1518
01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.250
when they did team America,
world police and he's like,

1519
01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:06.360
man came and made them so stupid,
but he's not stupid.

1520
01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:07.283
<v 4>Oh,
I love it.</v>

1521
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:14.310
I think those guys are crap.
Just crappy crap.
Crap.

1522
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:19.070
<v 8>Yeah.
And they're an interesting duo.
Yeah.
I don't know.</v>

1523
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:24.430
It's hard to be an actor and not be a Douche bag and full of shit just to make

1524
01:30:24.831 --> 01:30:28.490
it through the ranks to get to a position where your actual movie star and all

1525
01:30:28.491 --> 01:30:33.020
the Dicks you've sucked along the way,
figuratively.
Not literally necessarily

1526
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:37.620
<v 4>like Christian Bale,
you know,
like he yelled at those people and stuff and,</v>

1527
01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.820
but you know what?
Sorry is fucking good.
His fucking gun.

1528
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:42.703
<v 8>Well,
not only that,</v>

1529
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:46.190
the guys distracting him in the background lies in this really important

1530
01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:49.550
emotional scene and you want to shame him by recording that as if he's an

1531
01:30:49.551 --> 01:30:53.210
asshole.
But guess what?
The guy was distracting him.
A fucking with the lights.

1532
01:30:53.211 --> 01:30:56.300
That guy's an idiot.
Yeah,
you can have idiots like that on the set.

1533
01:30:56.301 --> 01:31:01.250
And they do ruin things.
Yeah,
they do.
They do.
And if he's a perfectionist,

1534
01:31:01.251 --> 01:31:02.870
like obviously he is.
Yeah.

1535
01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:05.720
He couldn't possibly be as good as he is without being a perfectionist.

1536
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:10.130
When you have someone who's like irritating you like that,
that's on the set.

1537
01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:12.590
Yeah.
I could see him snapping.
It makes sense.

1538
01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:17.600
<v 4>Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's like,
you know,
people are like,
Oh,
Christian Bale's a Dick.</v>

1539
01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:19.020
It's like to that guy,

1540
01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.440
<v 8>we don't even know who that guy was.
Right.
Maybe we met that guy.
I'd be like,
Oh,</v>

1541
01:31:22.441 --> 01:31:23.730
you're a fucking moron.

1542
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.240
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1543
01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:28.110
Or else maybe we'd be hearing more of these clips of Christian Bale yelling at

1544
01:31:28.111 --> 01:31:32.130
innocent people instead.
There was just that one.
Yeah.
And it's like,
you know,

1545
01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:37.050
my patients grows a lot longer for people who I respect.
You know,

1546
01:31:37.051 --> 01:31:38.250
I have a whole bit about it.

1547
01:31:38.251 --> 01:31:41.090
You know about bill Cosby and woody Allen about the site.

1548
01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:43.860
You can get away with stuff if you're talented,

1549
01:31:43.861 --> 01:31:47.920
you make multiple hits and you're good.
You can get away with shit.
Well,

1550
01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:51.490
<v 8>there's obviously a point of no return for her.
[inaudible] Cosby.</v>

1551
01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:54.070
He can't get away with it anymore.
He stopped performing.

1552
01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:56.170
Remember in the beginning he was performing,

1553
01:31:56.590 --> 01:32:00.280
he had all these dates that he was doing while accusations are coming out and

1554
01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:03.850
people were still like yelling out,
we love you bill,
we love your bill.

1555
01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:08.020
But now even those people like damn bills and racist,
totally racist.

1556
01:32:08.021 --> 01:32:09.090
He is a rapist rather.

1557
01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.430
<v 4>Yeah.
I think he's going to paternal out.
You know what I mean?</v>

1558
01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.650
Like my show cancer now.
Yeah,
something like that.
Joe Paternal,

1559
01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:19.000
like the week that he retired,
it was so crazy.

1560
01:32:19.001 --> 01:32:23.170
Like I just watched it 30 for 30 ESPN documentary on it.
You ever watch those?

1561
01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:23.770
Yeah.

1562
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:28.770
And it said they were talking about how literally the day that he announced his

1563
01:32:30.221 --> 01:32:33.820
retirement,
he went home and took a bloody poop.

1564
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:39.280
Next day goes to the doctors like my poops bloody and I like,
yeah,

1565
01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:42.670
your body's filled with cancer right now.
It's like,
oh,
okay.

1566
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:46.180
Like seven days later he was dead.
Something like that.
Wow.

1567
01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:47.950
It was like so fast.

1568
01:32:48.210 --> 01:32:48.421
<v 8>Well,</v>

1569
01:32:48.421 --> 01:32:53.421
he probably had the stress of knowing that he was harboring a child molester for

1570
01:32:53.461 --> 01:32:56.220
years.
It does probably eating away at him.

1571
01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.560
Besides the fact that he was an old guy as it is,

1572
01:32:58.561 --> 01:33:03.561
but you think about what kind of stress must be involved in having a guy like

1573
01:33:04.711 --> 01:33:09.600
that that you know is fucking kids and you don't know what to do about it.

1574
01:33:09.930 --> 01:33:14.310
You don't know what to do because he's got this whole charitable organization

1575
01:33:14.311 --> 01:33:17.850
where you're taking care of children and you know,
you know,

1576
01:33:17.851 --> 01:33:22.500
and everybody else knows he's fucking those kids.
And then when it comes out,

1577
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:27.360
oh,
the world knows that you knew he was fucking those kids and you didn't do

1578
01:33:27.361 --> 01:33:30.240
anything about it and you should have and you are a coward and it just starts

1579
01:33:30.241 --> 01:33:33.960
rotting you out from the inside.
Oh yeah.
Oh my God.

1580
01:33:33.961 --> 01:33:35.520
It must be fucking devastate.

1581
01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:37.050
<v 4>I mean it's like,
it's,
it's,</v>

1582
01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:39.840
it's like almost like just being as bad as the pedophile,

1583
01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:43.290
except you don't even get to like blow those loads.
You know what I mean?

1584
01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.280
<v 8>I would love to,</v>

1585
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:51.040
that's so rude to bill Cosby.
Bill Cosby does.

1586
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:54.280
If it turns out that bill Cosby has cancer and he's dying and he wants to come

1587
01:33:54.281 --> 01:33:56.170
clean and he wants to talk about at all,

1588
01:33:56.171 --> 01:34:01.060
I would love to have him on a podcast in imagine having bill Cosby on a podcast

1589
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:05.140
before he's dying.
He's asking him like what?
How did this all start?

1590
01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:09.760
Like what was this?
What was it all about?
Like when did you first drug somebody,

1591
01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.060
did you get like,
cause it is something that excited you.

1592
01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.400
Was it a convenience thing?

1593
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:20.170
Like what was it that made you think that it's okay cause he has daughters,

1594
01:34:20.171 --> 01:34:25.030
right?
I believe he has gone,
Oh God man.
I can imagine.

1595
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.760
I don't even,

1596
01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.900
<v 4>I don't know how anybody could get into something like that.</v>

1597
01:34:29.901 --> 01:34:31.970
Like it's so interesting.

1598
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:37.090
It's such a weird like fetish because he clearly could have just had sex with

1599
01:34:37.641 --> 01:34:38.500
whoever he wanted.

1600
01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.960
<v 8>Well we clearly could have just had prostitutes.
He's worth so much money.
Yeah,</v>

1601
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:44.730
you could have always done that.

1602
01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:49.290
Or he could have always like found someone who wanted to have sex with them.

1603
01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.990
But I think he liked drugging them.
It's the only thing that makes sense.

1604
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:57.350
<v 4>I think there's something it makes you wonder.
I don't know.</v>

1605
01:34:57.351 --> 01:34:58.010
I've never heard

1606
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:59.060
<v 1>of it before,
but it's like,</v>

1607
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:03.110
you know what is that what?

1608
01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:04.880
What is that?

1609
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:09.500
I spent a fetish then why couldn't you just pay a prostitute almost to do that?

1610
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.730
<v 8>Yeah,
but then it wouldn't really be happening.
See,</v>

1611
01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:17.250
I think part of it had to be that he wanted a trip.
Those girls,

1612
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:21.420
he wanted to give them a come over here and have a Cappuccino and it gives them

1613
01:35:21.421 --> 01:35:24.080
a Cappuccino and they're like,
oh you feel asleep are you?

1614
01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:28.230
And it just pulls his cock out.
You don't even see this dude.
Mm.
And then they,

1615
01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:28.840
you know,

1616
01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.550
throws him on the bed and pulled her panties off and Fox and other alcohol.

1617
01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:37.170
Like he must have been into that.
He must've been into the game of drugging them.

1618
01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.860
He must've been into like slipping them a Mickey and Washington blackout.
Yeah.

1619
01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.420
But then he's like stuck with them for hours while they try to sober up to,

1620
01:35:47.010 --> 01:35:51.390
how bizarre is that?
Like he had to be with them while they were out cold.

1621
01:35:51.450 --> 01:35:54.390
When he dropped them and he had to be willing to deal with it.

1622
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:57.530
<v 1>There's other ways he could have gone about it too.
Like you know,</v>

1623
01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.090
like he could've just like,
you know,

1624
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:03.350
I'm interested to know if he ever just had him come over and sat down and

1625
01:36:03.351 --> 01:36:08.060
watched like a Ben Affleck movie with them just to make them fall asleep instead

1626
01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:12.170
of drugging.
I'm,
you know,
just like,
oh,
you were allergic to the Matt Damon.

1627
01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.940
<v 8>I don't think that,
I think that a guy like that,</v>

1628
01:36:18.941 --> 01:36:23.941
a guy like Cosby is probably a sociopath in some sort of a strange way of a very

1629
01:36:27.641 --> 01:36:28.480
unique way.

1630
01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:34.140
EGOMANIAC a sociopath and feels like he's better than people and it feels like

1631
01:36:36.341 --> 01:36:38.950
it's okay.
It's okay if he drugs them.

1632
01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:42.250
<v 1>I remember somebody,
I don't know if we can talk about this,</v>

1633
01:36:42.251 --> 01:36:45.340
but what that person told us in that green room that one time about him.

1634
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:50.050
<v 8>Oh yeah.
Yeah.
We could probably mention that.
I talked about that.</v>

1635
01:36:50.051 --> 01:36:53.960
We've talked about it.
I've talked about it before.
Well,
okay.
She said that he,

1636
01:36:53.970 --> 01:36:58.090
he was at a casino and he made the security guard,
tuck him in,

1637
01:36:58.690 --> 01:37:01.930
come to his hotel room and talk to him in,

1638
01:37:01.931 --> 01:37:05.290
and this was all before the allegations came out,
but not much before,

1639
01:37:05.291 --> 01:37:09.720
like a few months before,
six months at the most.
And um,

1640
01:37:10.450 --> 01:37:14.140
we,
we were,
were there like right when all this was breaking.

1641
01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:15.400
It was over a year ago.

1642
01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.700
<v 1>See that should've been a sign right there.
Anybody who needs to get tucked in,</v>

1643
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:22.550
she'd get like investigated by the FBI.
Right?

1644
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:26.170
<v 8>Well it's like why did you want to get talked in?
What's going on with that?</v>

1645
01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:29.710
He and he also wanted people to watch him eat.
Do you remember that too?

1646
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:33.700
He would have them sit down.
The whole staff,
like all the people that work there,

1647
01:37:33.850 --> 01:37:36.610
they would sit in his dressing room and watch him eat curry.

1648
01:37:37.090 --> 01:37:39.280
He would eat his food and they would sit around and he,

1649
01:37:39.281 --> 01:37:43.270
they didn't interact with them.
They would just sit around and watch him eat.
Wow.

1650
01:37:43.450 --> 01:37:46.540
Like what,
that's freaky stuff.

1651
01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.540
But what a weird request.
Yeah.

1652
01:37:50.050 --> 01:37:55.050
But I think he probably had a bunch of those weird things that he had his mind

1653
01:37:55.950 --> 01:38:00.900
that like,
like we're at this club last night and someone,

1654
01:38:01.140 --> 01:38:06.000
we don't have to mention their name,
but uh,
some comedian that we know.

1655
01:38:06.090 --> 01:38:09.450
Yeah.
And they were all saying what a piece of shit the guy was.

1656
01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.100
They would never have come back here again.

1657
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.760
But that when they got to the airport,
he's like,
you know,

1658
01:38:15.210 --> 01:38:19.800
telling him to carry his luggage.
And then when people were there,
he's like,

1659
01:38:19.801 --> 01:38:22.950
don't,
don't let anybody touch me.
People come over and take my picture.

1660
01:38:22.951 --> 01:38:24.060
Don't let anybody touch me.

1661
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:29.390
And then it's just like the weirdness of how he interacted with these people

1662
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:33.000
that work there.
They're like,
look,
you'll never be back here again.
Right.

1663
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:34.770
Like we just let you know right now.
You'll never,

1664
01:38:34.771 --> 01:38:36.570
you're never coming back here again.
Yeah.

1665
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:40.560
Or they say we'd like the worst guy they had ever had come to their club.

1666
01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:45.540
But this guy who we're talking about hat all these weird ticks,

1667
01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:49.170
all these weird things that he would do,
like make people carry his stuff,

1668
01:38:49.171 --> 01:38:54.171
like things that he would do to clearly establish that he was better than that.

1669
01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:54.880
Right.

1670
01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.230
<v 4>Make them sell his murder.</v>

1671
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.920
<v 8>Yeah.
Things like that.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

1672
01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.970
<v 4>And that neurosis that these people have,</v>

1673
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.240
it's so ridiculous because most of the most talented people that I've met drive

1674
01:39:10.381 --> 01:39:14.220
their own car,
carry their own bag,
all of it,

1675
01:39:14.250 --> 01:39:18.930
and would be insulted if somebody tried that kind of stuff.

1676
01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:20.900
You know what I mean?
Like come on,
give me my bag.
Know,

1677
01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:25.190
you know like it's like the opposite because that,

1678
01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:29.160
that's simply not how success works.
There's no,

1679
01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:34.220
you don't get extra time to think because somebody else's carrying your bag,

1680
01:39:34.410 --> 01:39:34.980
then you have more,

1681
01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:39.120
you're more pride in the person that you're hanging out with because they're

1682
01:39:39.121 --> 01:39:41.490
carrying their bag and you're carrying your bag.
You know?

1683
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:45.570
It just seems like the neurosis of it all is like such an old Hollywood myth.

1684
01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:46.411
<v 8>Well,
it's one thing is,</v>

1685
01:39:46.411 --> 01:39:49.880
is like maybe you had two big bags and like a driver came.

1686
01:39:49.881 --> 01:39:50.714
Let me help you with that.

1687
01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:54.270
They grab one of your roller bags and ask you some quite in pull it around.
Yeah.

1688
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:58.430
But his thing was like making everyone do the work or he didn't want to carry

1689
01:39:58.431 --> 01:40:02.810
anything.
Right?
He wanted them to pick up his bags at the airport.

1690
01:40:03.650 --> 01:40:08.650
But I think when people demand preferential or special treatment like that,

1691
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:14.600
they start to think of themselves as being superior to everyone else.

1692
01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:15.840
Everyone else,
you know,

1693
01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.970
throw your rose petals on the ground so that I may walk upon them.
You know,
this,

1694
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.890
this idea that Cosby was better than all those people that he was drugging.

1695
01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.700
He was better than all those people that were watching him eat curry,

1696
01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:32.870
that he was better than that guy who he wanted to tuck him in.
Tuck me in.

1697
01:40:32.871 --> 01:40:36.260
I'm the king,
right?
I will lie in my bed and then when I lie on my bed,

1698
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:40.850
then I want you to put the blanket over me and then I want you to Tuck it on

1699
01:40:40.851 --> 01:40:45.620
each side.
And I will rest and then you will leave.
Shut the night out.

1700
01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.700
The king is sleeping.
Yeah.
There's something creepy about that.
Yeah.

1701
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:53.000
That's also the same kind of thing in some sort.

1702
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.940
A way that I would allow him to have done all that horrific shit that he did.

1703
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:02.320
Drugging those people [inaudible] no one's really gonna understand it unless he

1704
01:41:02.321 --> 01:41:05.200
talks about it.
Yeah.
Unless he comes clean and talks about it.

1705
01:41:05.201 --> 01:41:10.030
We're never going to understand his unique psychosis.
Love to know that.

1706
01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:12.820
Well,
it'd be the,
what would it be?
The first question,
like when did,

1707
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:16.040
when did you do it?
Yeah.
When did you first do it?
Who was the,

1708
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:19.240
did you see someone drug someone?
Was that a common thing?

1709
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:22.390
I think people like slipping someone.
I'm Mickey.

1710
01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:25.150
They didn't think of it as that big of a deal back then.
Right.

1711
01:41:25.210 --> 01:41:28.390
I think it was a more,
I don't think they thought of it as rape.

1712
01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:32.380
I think they thought they were being sneaky,
but I think it was like,
like,

1713
01:41:32.410 --> 01:41:36.280
you know,
getting a girl,
getting her a couple of drinks,
have a couple of drinks,

1714
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:40.570
relax.
Okay.
And voluntarily girl has a couple of drinks and you know,

1715
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:42.620
once they have a couple of drinks,
they're going to loosen up.

1716
01:41:42.621 --> 01:41:46.660
They're going to be a little more playful,
little more uninhibited.
Whoa.

1717
01:41:46.661 --> 01:41:50.740
Next thing.
You know,
old sheds and millionaire.
Yup.
I wonder,

1718
01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:51.790
I wonder what,

1719
01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:56.880
what it was that started him down that path of drugging and raping women.

1720
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.250
This lady was on TV and she was talking about it.
She's like,

1721
01:42:00.490 --> 01:42:04.270
he might be the most prolific serial rapist in history.

1722
01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:08.350
[inaudible] you stop and think about it.
Like that's fucking insane.

1723
01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:12.910
Bill Cosby might be the most prolific rapist in history.

1724
01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:17.330
<v 1>He really could be already five lemon at least.
At least have accused him.</v>

1725
01:42:17.690 --> 01:42:22.340
And those are the ones that have accused him.
The ones on the road like,

1726
01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:27.320
and he's been touring for ever everywhere.
He's just been going everywhere.

1727
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:32.120
Chicks from Tennessee and the Oklahoma,
they're not gonna admit that stuff.

1728
01:42:32.121 --> 01:42:36.530
They don't even,
they don't even know what's going on
watching the news.

1729
01:42:36.531 --> 01:42:39.830
They don't even know other women are coming out with it.
You know?

1730
01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:41.300
And people with families.

1731
01:42:41.301 --> 01:42:44.630
Think of how many of those ladies must have families now and they're not coming

1732
01:42:44.631 --> 01:42:45.460
forward.

1733
01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:48.600
<v 5>Well,
also they bought probably don't think what is the point,
right?</v>

1734
01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.690
Adding their own story to a of 50 person story.

1735
01:42:53.110 --> 01:42:56.770
You're already dealing with a guy who was accused of multiple horrific crimes.

1736
01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.680
Like if you accuse him of one more is going to change anything.
Right.

1737
01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:04.540
There's one girl though that it's within the statute of limitations.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

1738
01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:08.230
There's one girl they're pursuing that is inside the statute of limitations and

1739
01:43:08.231 --> 01:43:10.330
if that comes through,

1740
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:14.830
if they want to like he might actually wind up going to jail or at least

1741
01:43:14.831 --> 01:43:18.730
standing trial or,
I mean,
I don't know.
I don't know how it works.

1742
01:43:18.731 --> 01:43:23.110
I guess she asked to press charges and maybe he could bribe briber.

1743
01:43:24.250 --> 01:43:28.120
Maybe he could settle,
you know like that term settling out of court.

1744
01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:33.070
That's just driving someone.
Totally.
That's what he did in 2005 yeah.

1745
01:43:33.130 --> 01:43:37.060
The reason why we know about what he did was because of the deposition that they

1746
01:43:37.061 --> 01:43:39.760
released.
Once all these other accusations started piling up,

1747
01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.810
then they release the results of the deposition.
So we got to know that,
oh,

1748
01:43:43.811 --> 01:43:48.730
he admitted that he gave girls Qualia Woods,
you know,

1749
01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:52.640
and then he had,
I mean you can't get quite loose anymore.

1750
01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:56.200
Like this guy has some quotes stockpiled.
Yeah,

1751
01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:00.850
<v 4>because I mean they,
they sh it that if they search they probably,</v>

1752
01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:03.550
I mean they have probable cause.

1753
01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:07.920
<v 5>Like what is happening with that case.
That's what's crazy.</v>

1754
01:44:07.921 --> 01:44:11.600
You don't hear about it for months and months and months even,
you know,
updates.

1755
01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:13.580
<v 4>Even the case has been put to sleep.</v>

1756
01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:18.020
That's how son of a bitch.
And on that note,

1757
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:22.790
I was going to make a probable Cosby joke and Denton admitted ago just to let

1758
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:27.590
you know,
like the ones that I don't say like those exists too.
I don't just say,

1759
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:33.770
oh no,
no.
When in Rome show

1760
01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:39.890
<v 5>one of those things that we could talk about a million times in a row,</v>

1761
01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:42.660
we always just bang your head against the wall.
They're just like,

1762
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:45.530
it's almost like you're repeating the same conversation over and over again.

1763
01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:46.551
Like,
how could we do,

1764
01:44:46.551 --> 01:44:49.190
what was it about the Michael Jackson thing is really similar.

1765
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.780
Like you repeat the Michael Jackson thing.
Many may too,

1766
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:57.140
but he's dead so it makes it kind of weirder because you'll never know.

1767
01:44:57.290 --> 01:44:58.520
You'll never know if it,

1768
01:44:58.610 --> 01:45:03.290
if he really did those things or if he just got weird with those kids.

1769
01:45:04.220 --> 01:45:08.330
I had heard a weird possibility about Michael Jackson and I've talked about

1770
01:45:08.331 --> 01:45:12.590
before,
but that he was a cost Strada.
What's that means he had his balls removed.

1771
01:45:12.591 --> 01:45:17.060
Do you ever heard Castrato singing?
We never heard of that.
Oh my God.

1772
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:22.390
They would have this,
uh,
they would have young men,
uh,

1773
01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:23.390
when they were really young,

1774
01:45:23.391 --> 01:45:27.470
they would castrate them and they would castrate them with the specific purpose

1775
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:31.010
of making their voice sound a certain way.
You never heard of that

1776
01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:33.390
<v 4>if it ever happened.
I bet it happened to him.</v>

1777
01:45:33.550 --> 01:45:38.320
<v 5>There were a type of opera singer.
They would do it on purpose.
Wow.
Yeah.</v>

1778
01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:39.280
How crazy is that?

1779
01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:44.200
That they would castrate young boys so that there's sound would,

1780
01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:48.520
they would keep a certain sound you want to hear some of it?
Hold on a second.

1781
01:45:48.540 --> 01:45:52.450
I'll go.
I'm going to grab my laptop.
Hang in there folks.

1782
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:57.510
Some walking across the hotel room to grab my laptop.

1783
01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:00.870
<v 4>That's Michael Jackson may not have had any balls.</v>

1784
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:02.760
You will you think about his voice,

1785
01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:07.260
like the sounds that he was able to make with his voice.
Yeah,

1786
01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:12.840
I believe it.
His Dad probably did it.
It's on the one at the money.

1787
01:46:12.841 --> 01:46:14.940
Right?
Could you imagine if that's what he did?

1788
01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:20.410
Like he had a sound when he was young and so they castrated him so that he keep

1789
01:46:20.941 --> 01:46:22.230
kept that same sound.

1790
01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:29.880
<v 5>It's cast,
Strada cast Radha music.</v>

1791
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:33.750
Castrato Castrato wow.
Yeah.

1792
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:35.300
Kind of Straw.

1793
01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:39.680
<v 4>That's insane music.
Yeah.</v>

1794
01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:44.020
Well it's just how insane is it that that is a,

1795
01:46:44.021 --> 01:46:47.960
an actual style of music listening to the testosterone.

1796
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:50.280
The testosterone

1797
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.010
<v 10>clearly would affect the voice box.
Nuts.
Yeah.
Jeez,</v>

1798
01:46:54.130 --> 01:46:56.400
I didn't know that existed.
What's going on this

1799
01:46:58.780 --> 01:47:03.780
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1800
01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:22.170
that's a guy.
Yeah.

1801
01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:25.270
Aw.

1802
01:47:25.450 --> 01:47:28.990
<v 2>This is the 1994 bio pics.
That might not be the jet,</v>

1803
01:47:28.991 --> 01:47:33.280
but that's about one of the most famous cast rato singers.
Like,

1804
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:37.810
here's a need to know.
Facts.
20 need to knows facts about cussed.

1805
01:47:37.811 --> 01:47:39.670
Roddys.
Okay.

1806
01:47:39.671 --> 01:47:43.780
The Vatican importeds very first falsetto singers from Spain.

1807
01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:49.780
It was considered preferable to have castrated boys singing the high parts since

1808
01:47:49.781 --> 01:47:53.380
girls and women were banned in the Vatican choir.

1809
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:58.780
The 17th century was a bad time to be a good travel.
During the 17th century,

1810
01:47:58.781 --> 01:48:02.560
boys in Italy began to be castrated in increasing numbers.

1811
01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:07.630
This took place between the ages of seven and 11 to preserve the purity of their

1812
01:48:07.631 --> 01:48:11.380
unbroken voices so they could sing in church choirs.

1813
01:48:12.250 --> 01:48:15.970
Castration operations were performed by actual butchers.

1814
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:21.510
Oh operations to remove a boy's tech testicles in medical terms was called

1815
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:26.910
orchidectomy was where reputedly performed by the butchers of nor Rica,

1816
01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:29.500
nausea,

1817
01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:34.500
nausea and Italian region famous for its pork products where castration of pigs

1818
01:48:35.081 --> 01:48:38.020
was common cause they castrate pigs.
Um,

1819
01:48:38.021 --> 01:48:40.270
when they oftentimes with castrate pigs,

1820
01:48:40.271 --> 01:48:43.480
like in the wild and they let them go and then they try to hunt those pigs

1821
01:48:43.481 --> 01:48:45.730
because they can't breed,
but they eat a lot.

1822
01:48:45.731 --> 01:48:48.940
And so they get really fat and they don't have as much muscle.

1823
01:48:48.941 --> 01:48:51.340
It's a density of muscle which comes from testosterone.

1824
01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:55.630
So they become fat and thick and like this,
a softer meat,

1825
01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:59.230
only a tiny fraction of the children mutilated in this way.

1826
01:48:59.231 --> 01:49:04.231
Even made it onto the stage by the early 17 hundreds as many as 4,000 Italian

1827
01:49:04.811 --> 01:49:08.590
boys a year underwent the operation,
which was illegal.

1828
01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:13.270
Of those who survived,
only a fraction went on to train as opera singers.

1829
01:49:13.450 --> 01:49:16.270
And of those only a handful became superstars.

1830
01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:19.930
Being Castrato could have unexpected physical consequences.

1831
01:49:19.931 --> 01:49:21.330
The most famous Castrati,

1832
01:49:21.570 --> 01:49:26.320
we're trained in Neapolitan conservatories where they practice breathing

1833
01:49:26.321 --> 01:49:31.090
techniques for hours everyday to expand their lung capacities.
As a result,

1834
01:49:31.210 --> 01:49:35.020
adult Castrati,
we're often notably barrel chested.

1835
01:49:35.410 --> 01:49:38.410
They were tall compared to normal men of their time,

1836
01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.640
but they also had a shortened life expectancy.
Like look at the images of them.

1837
01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.250
These images where they showed this barrel chested,

1838
01:49:45.251 --> 01:49:48.700
tall guy like odd like that.

1839
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:53.500
Like it's like he's got a little head,
little hands would a long tall torso.

1840
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:57.850
Wow.
Yeah.
This is incredible man.
Really.

1841
01:49:57.910 --> 01:50:02.590
So this article is a symphony music,
s,
I,

1842
01:50:02.591 --> 01:50:05.890
N,
F,
I,
N I,
music.com,

1843
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:10.250
and it's all 20 facts,
20 known facts about [inaudible].

1844
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:14.000
And some of them actually got married as poor bastards.
You know,
it's,

1845
01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:18.250
it's horrific man.
And there was,
there was an actual BBC documentary,

1846
01:50:18.580 --> 01:50:21.610
but here's an actual cus strati uh,

1847
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:26.650
the only recording of an actual Castrato,
uh,
is a guy,

1848
01:50:26.651 --> 01:50:28.510
his name is Alice,
Sandro,

1849
01:50:28.770 --> 01:50:33.010
more g and he died in 1922.

1850
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.900
So this is an actual,

1851
01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:37.260
<v 12>sure.
Castrati we're going to listen to here.
This is a real one.</v>

1852
01:50:37.650 --> 01:50:40.740
The other one that we played earlier was,
it apparently was a,

1853
01:50:40.741 --> 01:50:44.150
a sort of a recreation.
This is a,

1854
01:50:44.151 --> 01:50:45.830
a real castrati

1855
01:50:46.590 --> 01:50:51.590
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1856
01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.340
<v 12>that's such a haunting shit.</v>

1857
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:00.930
<v 13>That's a scary</v>

1858
01:51:02.110 --> 01:51:06.160
<v 11>[inaudible].</v>

1859
01:51:06.250 --> 01:51:07.570
<v 12>It's a guy with no balls.</v>

1860
01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:15.130
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1861
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.671
<v 12>no,</v>

1862
01:51:15.671 --> 01:51:20.350
stop and listen to this and stop you think about Michael Jackson thinking about

1863
01:51:20.351 --> 01:51:21.184
how salmon

1864
01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:29.060
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1865
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:39.530
<v 12>just how fucked up or people that they would even think to do this to a seven</v>

1866
01:51:39.531 --> 01:51:40.364
year old boy.

1867
01:51:40.630 --> 01:51:45.630
How fucked up where the parents that let this your seven year old boy and let

1868
01:51:46.401 --> 01:51:50.110
him get as nuts chopped off.
So we do need better noise in his face

1869
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:59.350
<v 1>for some reason.
That's like the scariest that I've seen in a long time.</v>

1870
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:04.360
It's crazy.
Lose your balls without a choice and have it done by a butcher.

1871
01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:08.380
I mean,
Mike,
God,
I mean I think of all the things that ruins from now on.

1872
01:52:08.381 --> 01:52:10.270
You smelled bacon,
things like that.

1873
01:52:10.271 --> 01:52:13.840
Like it reminds you of getting your balls chopped off.
No,

1874
01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:18.370
doesn't Bacon.
I mean,
may be wanting to go into a butcher shop to do it.

1875
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.220
It's a traumatic experience I'm sure.

1876
01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.520
Did traumatic part is listening to this tortured soul?
Oh No.

1877
01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:30.030
<v 2>Just fucking grown man.
Who,
oh my God.
It's just,</v>

1878
01:52:30.050 --> 01:52:34.710
it's insane.
That's freaky.
It's very freaky.
It's just,
it's,

1879
01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:39.210
it's,
it's hard to believe that people looked at human life like that.

1880
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:42.170
<v 1>I feel like this church next door keeps playing the bells.</v>

1881
01:52:42.171 --> 01:52:45.360
Every time we talk about crazy shit that the Catholic church is that,

1882
01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:46.040
I wonder what's

1883
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:48.490
<v 2>worse is that the church sound?
The Bells wars.</v>

1884
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:51.100
<v 13>Yes.</v>

1885
01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:59.450
That's like a tortured soul and he's just going to say,
if you can really

1886
01:53:03.150 --> 01:53:06.510
mean that he didn't,
it wasn't like his fault.

1887
01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.120
<v 11>[inaudible]</v>

1888
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:20.910
<v 2>I wonder if when they did the autopsy of this on balls,</v>

1889
01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:22.590
what if he didn't find balls?

1890
01:53:22.591 --> 01:53:25.620
Would they tell us they did the Michael Johnson ops on autopsy.

1891
01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:29.040
You can tell us shit.
Yeah,
that's like medical information,
right?
Yeah.

1892
01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:32.640
They wouldn't tell us he manages,
he went to his grave like that and nobody,

1893
01:53:32.641 --> 01:53:35.490
everybody kept their mouth shut and meanwhile he was castrated when he was

1894
01:53:35.491 --> 01:53:36.960
younger to make his voice sound better.

1895
01:53:37.170 --> 01:53:41.490
I guarantee you Joe Jackson knew about this.
I guarantee you this is not,
I mean,

1896
01:53:41.491 --> 01:53:43.140
if I know about this and people know about this,

1897
01:53:43.141 --> 01:53:47.430
people in the music business that actually are singers and that are a part of,

1898
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:51.390
you know,
the industry they get definitely know about cost.
Toronto's.

1899
01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:52.773
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

1900
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:58.510
<v 2>I wonder man,
that's just my own personal theory by the way.
Yeah,</v>

1901
01:53:58.690 --> 01:54:02.830
I mean,
and Michael Jackson could definitely hit some notes.
Yeah.

1902
01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:05.440
I mean like what's a song?

1903
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:09.190
Think of a song where Michael Jackson like really nailed high notes.
Well,
I mean,

1904
01:54:09.191 --> 01:54:12.010
when he was in the Jackson five because of human nature,
right?
Yeah.

1905
01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:17.020
Well with the,
but I guess he was still a kid when he was in the Jackson five.

1906
01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:22.060
Right.
The Lis.
Listen,
this is human nature.
This is a song from,

1907
01:54:22.061 --> 01:54:26.260
um,
this is a song from when he was,
uh,

1908
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:28.540
how old do you think he was when he did that?

1909
01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:31.600
He was a grown man for sure.

1910
01:54:32.900 --> 01:54:33.733
<v 7>Right.</v>

1911
01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:36.300
<v 2>So this is waiting for this ad to run now.</v>

1912
01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:38.640
He was probably in his thirties when he came over.

1913
01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:39.070
<v 11>That's right.</v>

1914
01:54:39.070 --> 01:54:44.070
[inaudible]

1915
01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:58.813
hello?

1916
01:55:02.590 --> 01:55:04.580
Hello?
Fuck.

1917
01:55:07.010 --> 01:55:09.780
Oh fuck.
Is that?
Oh Dad,

1918
01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:12.990
I think he may have been missing some of these people.
Nature

1919
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:17.340
tough.
The look at the man in the mirror.

1920
01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:22.260
<v 12>Fall out.
Fucking up.
Can you can't stop.</v>

1921
01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:24.473
I know.

1922
01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:28.930
That's the sound he ever see when he caught his head on fire and the [inaudible]

1923
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:29.783
screen.

1924
01:55:30.150 --> 01:55:35.150
<v 11>Let's see what [inaudible].</v>

1925
01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.080
<v 2>Oh,
I can't listen anymore.
Yeah.
This is obviously just my theory.</v>

1926
01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:54.160
Well,
I might've heard it somewhere to a matter of certain hurt other people.

1927
01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:56.920
I don't,
I've,
I've been thinking about this for so long.
I don't know.

1928
01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:01.000
But when you listened to the cost Toronto and then you hear that boy,

1929
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:04.820
<v 1>I mean,
he clearly wasn't hooking up with anybody.
I'm sorry.</v>

1930
01:56:04.821 --> 01:56:08.060
But the Presley girl like that was clearly a media blitz,

1931
01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:12.940
like King of pop marries the king of it.
Even merrier.
Yeah,

1932
01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:17.930
we buried I think so.
Lisa Marie.
I didn't marry her,
I think so he kissed her.

1933
01:56:17.931 --> 01:56:20.460
But did he marry her?
I thought he married her.

1934
01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:23.550
They had school that they had like a fake kit or something together.
No,

1935
01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.560
they didn't have a fake kid,

1936
01:56:24.561 --> 01:56:27.260
but he definitely had fake kids with somebody else where it turns out there

1937
01:56:27.261 --> 01:56:29.200
wasn't even his sperm.
Right.
Well,

1938
01:56:29.260 --> 01:56:33.740
it would've been his sperm because his balls are in Joe Jackson's freezer right

1939
01:56:33.741 --> 01:56:36.350
now.
Okay.
Lisa Marie Presley.

1940
01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:41.290
<v 14>Um,
let's see.</v>

1941
01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.890
<v 2>Hmm.
Did they marriage the personal relationships?</v>

1942
01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:51.330
Michael Jackson tinted it that the,
let's see,

1943
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:55.380
the intent,
the intent entertainer was said.

1944
01:56:56.190 --> 01:57:01.190
His first real date was with a child actress Tatum O'Neal when he was a teenager

1945
01:57:01.441 --> 01:57:06.030
in the 1970s he called her my first love after Diana Ross.

1946
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:11.430
The pair eventually cooled off in quotes and Jackson entered into a romance with

1947
01:57:11.431 --> 01:57:13.950
model Brooke Shields in 1981 okay.
What,

1948
01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:18.750
although the relationship became largely platonic shields said there were times

1949
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:23.460
we asked her to marry him as he grew older,
the two saw each other less.
Whoa.

1950
01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:27.960
Lisa Marie Presley by her father,
Elvis in 1974 blah,
blah,
blah,

1951
01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:30.520
<v 14>blah.
Uh,</v>

1952
01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:35.820
<v 2>well.
Shortly after becoming involved with her in 1993,</v>

1953
01:57:35.821 --> 01:57:40.050
Jackson was subjected to his first set of child sexual abuse accusations.

1954
01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:44.160
I didn't know that.
Followed by similar allegations in 2003,

1955
01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:49.020
Presley supported Jackson as became dependent on pain medication and eventually

1956
01:57:49.021 --> 01:57:53.270
helped convince him to enter drug rehabilitation and a telephone call.

1957
01:57:53.271 --> 01:57:56.760
You proposed marriage to Presley.
She agreed and the to wed.
Oh,

1958
01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:01.650
may 26,
1994 at a private ceremony in the Dominican Republic.

1959
01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:06.200
<v 1>Why are we had to marry her?
Because he was on the child.
It'd be his thing.
Yeah.</v>

1960
01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:09.890
<v 14>What the fuck?
What the fuck?</v>

1961
01:58:11.250 --> 01:58:13.380
<v 2>He doesn't have balls and isn't,</v>

1962
01:58:13.381 --> 01:58:18.280
didn't she like eventually go on Lisa Marie to marry like,
uh,
somebody quicker.

1963
01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.950
It wasn't a,
the the actor with the,
his name,
the fuck's his name?

1964
01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:27.960
Billy Bob Thornton.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Nicolas Cage.

1965
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:31.980
Didn't she married Nicholas Cage?
I don't know.
I'm pretty sure she did.

1966
01:58:32.010 --> 01:58:36.780
Let's go to electrical.
Lisa Marie Presley.
Wikipedia has amazing relationships.

1967
01:58:36.781 --> 01:58:41.640
Let's go to relationships here.
Two,
two,
two,
two,
two relationships,

1968
01:58:41.890 --> 01:58:42.370
marriages

1969
01:58:42.370 --> 01:58:45.240
<v 8>and relationships.
Bam.
She married one guy,</v>

1970
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:48.340
1988 by the Dah,
Dah,
Dah.

1971
01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:53.530
I'm Michael Jackson.
[inaudible] the

1972
01:58:55.710 --> 01:58:59.350
Michael Jackson spent four years falling or divorced together on and off to

1973
01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:02.770
attempt to reconcile bubble [inaudible].
Nicolas Cage.

1974
01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:07.600
Presley's third marriage was to Nicolas cage.
They're married August 10th,

1975
01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.430
2002 and Oceanside ceremony on the Big island of Hawaii.
Yeah,

1976
01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:13.593
whatever.

1977
01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:18.540
<v 6>What the fuck she had.
She hooked up with some weird as well.</v>

1978
01:59:18.541 --> 01:59:22.020
Imagine being an Elvis,
his daughter.
What a weird life that must've been.

1979
01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:27.380
He'd been married to the most famous guy the world had ever known at the time,

1980
01:59:27.541 --> 01:59:30.240
the most famous entertainer that had ever existed by falling.

1981
01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:35.070
It was never a guy like Elvis before Elvis because when Elvis came along,

1982
01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:36.300
he was like,

1983
01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:40.800
at the moment when movies and radio and television,

1984
01:59:40.890 --> 01:59:44.960
all that collided and someone could see a guy like that on TV,
on the outs,

1985
01:59:44.961 --> 01:59:48.090
Elvin show,
you know,
swinging his hips and you know,

1986
01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:52.310
Jailhouse Rock and women this.
Yeah.

1987
01:59:52.710 --> 01:59:57.180
Imagine as your fucking Dad,
imagine trying to be normal.

1988
01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:00.900
That guy didn't have a chance at being normal.
There was not like,

1989
02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:05.970
like today if you're Drake or if you're Jay Z or if you're fucking,

1990
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.850
you know,
John Mayer,
there's a lot of those dudes out there.

1991
02:00:08.970 --> 02:00:11.540
There's a lot of them that girls would go crazy and scream for.

1992
02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:14.690
They can hang out together and go to parties and go,
man,
life's crazy.
Right?
Yeah,

1993
02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:19.470
Bro.
Life's crazy for us.
But Elvis had Elvis,
that was,
well,
is there Fabian?

1994
02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:23.750
Fabian had like one song,
I don't even know it'd be,

1995
02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:28.030
was like a heartthrob for a very short amount of time in the fifties it was like

1996
02:00:28.031 --> 02:00:32.400
a couple other guys,
but Elvis was uniquely famous,

1997
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:35.850
like in a way they're like,
until Michael Jackson came along,

1998
02:00:35.851 --> 02:00:39.420
there's probably nobody liked him or close to it or very few people.

1999
02:00:39.421 --> 02:00:43.260
I can imagine that poorly.
Some marines,
his daughter,

2000
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:46.200
I can't really take Elvis seriously as an actor.

2001
02:00:46.201 --> 02:00:48.180
Have you ever seen any of his movies?
Cause they talk shit.

2002
02:00:48.450 --> 02:00:52.230
You don't take them seriously as an actor though.
It's not an actor and a singer.

2003
02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:53.910
That's how I feel about Matt Damon and Ben

2004
02:00:55.650 --> 02:00:58.770
[inaudible] fuckers can't even say,
maybe they should be singing.

2005
02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:02.750
Maybe Mr Calling.
Yeah,
that's cut off their nuts and

2006
02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:09.440
I wouldn't mind seeing if it works.
And on that note,
we've got a,

2007
02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:13.380
we're going to hit the gym and work out what times here it is.

2008
02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:17.730
Three 50 here in wonderful Melbourne,
Australia,
which by the way,

2009
02:01:17.731 --> 02:01:22.560
Melbourne is the fucking shit.
How great is this town?
Amazing.
God Damn.

2010
02:01:22.561 --> 02:01:27.180
It's fun.
Last time.
It was incredible.
Yeah.
All right.
That was two hours.

2011
02:01:27.450 --> 02:01:31.170
So a,
that's it is the end of our podcast from Melbourne.

2012
02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:34.140
You can catch Tony Hinchcliffe on Twitter.

2013
02:01:34.470 --> 02:01:38.130
It's Tony at Tony Hinchcliffe,
um,
killed Tony.

2014
02:01:38.131 --> 02:01:40.280
Is this a

2015
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:43.490
<v 5>one shot?
Can you announce anything?
No,
no.</v>

2016
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:49.000
But know coming soon to a major internet distribution network that you're all

2017
02:01:49.971 --> 02:01:53.570
know of.
Yes.
We can say the name of it.

2018
02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:54.960
<v 1>And when I get to announce that,</v>

2019
02:01:54.961 --> 02:01:58.900
I'm going to hopefully come back on again and talk with Joe again about more
fun.

2020
02:01:58.901 --> 02:01:59.240
Yeah.

2021
02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:02.300
<v 5>Yes,
indeed.
Yes.
All right.
We got two shows tonight.</v>

2022
02:02:02.301 --> 02:02:07.010
Two sold out shows at some giant theater was at the Palais Palais theater,
a.

2023
02:02:07.011 --> 02:02:10.470
L.
E.
I.
S.
T.
I think it's Pele alive.
How?
Yeah.

2024
02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:15.260
Palais theater tonight in Melbourne.
And we're fucking psyched.
And uh,
all right.

2025
02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:17.690
That's it folks.
That's the end.
Anything more to say?
Time?

2026
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:20.490
<v 1>Uh,
I'd like to just say,
even though this isn't out yet,</v>

2027
02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.220
good luck to a Johana NGH second tomorrow.
Uh,

2028
02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:28.410
I'm a huge fan and I love your striking and,
uh,
you know,

2029
02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:32.280
if we accidentally end up on a date some time,
uh,

2030
02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:37.640
woopsy but I think you really like my sense of humor and I am a little bit

2031
02:02:38.551 --> 02:02:41.430
bigger than you.
So like,
I know pictures of me,
I look really small,

2032
02:02:41.431 --> 02:02:46.380
but I'm like 140 pounds,
so thank you.
And,
uh,
good luck.

2033
02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:47.320
<v 5>No.</v>
