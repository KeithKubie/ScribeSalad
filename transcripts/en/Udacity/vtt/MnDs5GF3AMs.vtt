00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.350
So here we are. Back to our overarching design.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.280
And you'll notice that, thus far we've created just the

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.420
one instance of our class movie. And that instance

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.180
is, Toy Story. The next thing for us to do,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.800
is create another instance of class movie. And this

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.290
time we're going to create Avatar. So, to do that, I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.700
am back here at my code. Here's the code

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.520
for the class movie. And, here is my entertainment_center.py file, which

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.740
is where I'm creating my first instance, Toy Story.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.050
Now, you may have noticed that I've reduced the font

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.940
size of my code, this is so I can squeeze

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.520
all of the code, in one video frame so you

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.350
can see it properly. Next, I will create the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.410
instance called avatar, by calling media.Movie. The first piece of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.580
information I have to supply, is the name of the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.650
movie, which is Avatar. Next is its storyline, which is,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.390
a marine on an alien planet. That is followed by, Avatar's movie poster,

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.630
which I will paste here. And the final piece of information is, Avatar's YouTube

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.672
trailer, which I will also copy in. All right. So, here is our new

00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:09.520
instance, Avatar. Let's print out it's storyline

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.655
next. So I will say, print avatar.storyline.

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:19.650
There it is. I'm also going to comment out

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.460
my previous print statement, which was printing out twice toy

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.420
story, story line. So, there it is, let me go

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.470
ahead and save this file. Now before I go ahead and

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.500
run this program, let me ask you a question. What

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.740
do you think, will be the output of this line

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.430
of code right here? Now I know that the font

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.730
of this code is really difficult to read. So what I'm

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.130
going to do, is make it a little bit bigger. So here it is,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.540
the code in a bigger font size. Here is where we are creating the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.550
instance avatar, and here we're trying to print it story line. So, what do

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.670
you think will be the output of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.440
the following code? Here are some answer choices.
