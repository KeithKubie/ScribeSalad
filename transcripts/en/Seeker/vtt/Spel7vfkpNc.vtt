00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.760
Hey over there, I can see you!

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.760
Where you ask?

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.760
EVERYWHERE!

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.939
I just pull it up from a satellite.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.340
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.390
There was a time when satellite imagery was
conspiracy talk, only available to high-level

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.560
government officials, or, like, spies.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.840
But thanks to Google Maps and Apple Maps,
and Bing Maps, and Mapquest and the dozens

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.270
of others out there we can see satellite images
every day!

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.270
For FREE!

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.710
Though we just use them to find the nearest
thai restaurant… the process of getting

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.690
them into your phone is INVOLVED, man.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.110
The first reconnaissance, or spy satellites
were the Corona satellites launched in the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.110
1960s.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.270
They had film cameras on board, and to get
that film back to earth, they ejected it with

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.399
a parachute and had to go pick it up!

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.280
The Air Force would try and snag it out of
the air, or the Navy would sail over once

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.450
it hit the ocean.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.450
These early experiments taught us how to take
pictures from a moving satellite of a moving

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.540
planet while 100 miles up.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.720
For example, the lenses on the Corona satellites
rotated constantly to keep the shot steady.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.610
They even tried angling two cameras to capture
a stereo image!

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.280
Spy satellites were so good at grabbing images
without letting the spyees know what was up,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030
the United States and other nations continue
to use them!

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.549
But when Google acquired satellite imaging
company Keyhole in 2004, they changed the

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:23.610
whole game.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.729
Now anyone could look down on the planet and
make comments.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.420
They still blur sensitive areas, as required
by world governments, but mostly the images

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.270
we're seeing are WAY better than the ones
we used in the 60s to determine how to avoid

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.330
World War Three.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.310
Today, the actual satellite images are taken
by companies like TeleAtlas, DigitalGlobe,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.850
EarthSat, Skybox, and others.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.910
They're then sold or licensed to governments
and companies for geology, mapping, urban

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.160
planning, shipment tracking… the applications
are endless.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.200
This is why some of the images on satellite
maps are lower resolution than others.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.080
Each company is working with different equipment
and regulations keep the companies from scanning

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.189
faces, backyards or license plates.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.960
A few months ago, regulators loosened restrictions
on U.S.-based DigitalGlobe.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.430
So last week, they launched the WorldView-3
satellite, their highest resolution sat ever.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.090
Which means, in a few weeks, maps could see
images with a resolution as high as 25 centimeters!

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.349
Basically, they'll be able to see a piece
of paper, but not read it.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.419
They WANT to launch sats with 10 cm resolution,
about the size of your phone screen.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.510
Google says the data on their maps are updated
as often as possible, so though they're not

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.879
LIVE, some images are as new as two weeks
old, and none are older than three years.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.329
Which means this new, high-res 25 centimeter
imagery might be appearing soon.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.220
Each mapping company is in charge of stitching
the images into one, giant map, adding the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.779
locations of interest and keeping it regular.

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:56.000
But speaking of real time data; that stuff
is notoriously locked up.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.489
Remember, the satellites are moving, the planet's
moving… viewers of live images can only

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.249
see what the satellite is looking at during
any particular moment, and moving a sat to

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.620
look at your ex's driveway isn't really practical.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.799
But a NASA program called EarthKAM is letting
students get access to real time space cameras

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.540
-- not via spy sats, but via a camera right
on the international space station!

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.439
Schools around the world are signing up students
by the thousands to explore our planet using

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:28.689
live images, because there's just something
about seeing this information in real time,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:29.689
amirite?

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.639
Students of the Sally Ride EarthKAM program
can directly control the camera, taking pictures

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.700
of the Earth and analyzing human geography,
geology, ecology, and global change!

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.519
They even learn about space operations and
do flight control simulations!

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.519
Sign me up!

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.959
How do you feel about satellites getting more
accurate images?

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:47.959
Freaked out?

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:48.959
Excited?

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.889
Go on, let loose in the comments and be sure
you subscribe for more DNews, seven days a

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:52.889
week.

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.260
And as long as you're in a clicking mood,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.409
to RSVP for our next SpaceOut on August 27th
at 4pm Pacific!

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.859
Each month, Ian O'Neill and I get together
and hangout with experts from NASA/JPL to

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.019
talk space.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.969
This month, it's about Europa!

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:11.059
Planned robotic missions, possibilities of
alien life, and cutting through ice millions

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:12.059
of miles away!

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.569
It's going to be awesome.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.139
RSVP now, so you don't get lost on the way.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:17.500
Thanks for watching!
