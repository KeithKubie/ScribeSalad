00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.150
Okay, Michael, so here's a, a nice little concrete example to,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.540
to think about this. Let's pretend that we're no longer in

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.750
a world of a single agent like we've been thinking about

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.715
with reinforcement learning, but we've gone

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:13.630
full-blown generality to two agents, [LAUGH]

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.700
okay? And let's call those agents a and b, and they're

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.710
going to be in a very simple game where a gets to make

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400
a choice. And then b gets to make a choice. And

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.200
then a might be able to make a choice. So this tree

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.710
that I've drawn over on the right is going to capture

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.890
the dynamics of this specific game that I'm imagining. So, these

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.620
little nodes here, these circles represent states. And we can

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.920
think about those in states in the same way that we.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.490
Talked about reinforcement learning in the past. The edges between

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.910
these nodes represent actions that one could take. So, this should

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.710
look familiar, this is just basically a game tree like

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.420
anyone who's taken a, an AI course might have seen. Okay?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.250
&gt;&gt; I guess so.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.070
It doesn't look like a very interesting game.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.140
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.010
&gt;&gt; But I guess it's a, sort of abstract example.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.950
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's a very simple game just so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.330
that we can get a handle on some basic concepts.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.250
So, in particular, if you look at the details

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.720
of this game, you start out in state one. Ok?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.420
And A gets to make a choice between two

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.180
actions, going left or going right. If A goes right,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.850
goes right, she ends up in state three. If

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.240
she goes left, she ends up in state two. Regardless

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.300
B gets to make a choice. From state three we

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.710
can choose to go right, and really that's all that can

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.960
happen. And this, what happens if B goes right from state

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.910
three is that, a value of plus two is assigned to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.920
A, okay? All of these numbers at the bottom, a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.550
the leaves here, are going to be values or rewards if you

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.160
want to think about 'em that way that are assigned to

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.130
player A. And, in fact, for the purposes of this game,

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.620
it's going to be the case that B always get's the opposite

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.790
of what A get's. So, if A get's plus 2 then B get's

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.320
minus 2, if A get's plus 4 then B get's minus 4,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.060
if A get's minus 1, B get's plus 1, does that make sense?

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, though could you write it down so that I won't forget?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.920
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine. So, by the way, this is a very specific type

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.590
of game. here, and it has a name, which I want to get right.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.730
This is a two-player zero-sum finite deterministic game of perfect information.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.280
So as a, as a title or description of, of this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.920
kind of game, does this make sense to you? Do you

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.150
think you know what they all mean, what all those words mean?

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.125
&gt;&gt; So, two players because it's a and b,

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:27.750
zero-sum. Because you said the leaves are a's rewards and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.420
b's reward is the negation so if you add

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.280
the two rewards together you're always going to get zero.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.660
&gt;&gt; That's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:32.180
almost right.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.980
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Ok.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.070
&gt;&gt; It's not exactly right. Actually, so zero sum really just

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.070
means that the sum of the rewards is always a constant.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.700
&gt;&gt; And that constant needs to be zero.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.920
&gt;&gt; It doesn't need to be zero.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.700
&gt;&gt; So if it added up to eleven, that would still be zero sum?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.770
&gt;&gt; If it added up to eleven everywhere. Yes.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.310
&gt;&gt; Huh, okay, interesting choice of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.170
terminology. finite, I don't know, everything seems

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.660
to be finite here. There's no infinite number of choices or states or depth.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.940
&gt;&gt; Mhm.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.240
&gt;&gt; deterministic, well, again, thinking about it in an MVPish kind

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.720
of way, there's no sort of casting transitions in this particular. Picture.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.150
&gt;&gt; Right. So if I'm in, state two and I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.420
go right, I always end up in state four, period.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.390
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.255
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:15.780
&gt;&gt; Game. I guess, a game is because it's more than one player?

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.530
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.290
&gt;&gt; Of perfect information. That doesn't quite sound like the same terminology

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.020
that we used in the empty MDP setting. But,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.080
I'm wondering if that's like, I know what state

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.830
I'm in, when I'm making a decision. So, it's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.860
like a, like an MDP as apposed to a POMDP.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.750
&gt;&gt; Well it, that's exactly right. It's, it's

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.020
that you know what state you're in and. Yeah.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.440
That's exactly what it means. It's like being the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.290
MDP versus the Palm DP. That's a great analogy.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.930
&gt;&gt; Cool. And does it matter that it's a tree like this? because when

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.330
we were looking at MDPs, we had more complex structures of graphs and things.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.780
&gt;&gt; Well, you can think of this as unrolling the MDP if you

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.560
want to.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.010
&gt;&gt; So then those states are sort of

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.990
time stamped and history stamped. For, yeah, for

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.690
the purposes of this discussion, yes. And that's

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.020
a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.720
&gt;&gt; But, okay.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.210
&gt;&gt; But in general, we're going to be thinking

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.790
about game trees, but actually, we're going through

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.930
all of this for nothing, because we're going to

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.500
discover pretty soon that none of this matters.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.330
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.740
&gt;&gt; but, give me a couple of slides to get there, okay?

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.810
&gt;&gt; Okay. So this is about the simplest or at least the, the least

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.350
complicated game that you can think

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.529
about. Two players, zero sum. Finite deterministic

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.590
game of perfect information. You know, basically, I can look at this tree,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.170
I know everything I need to know, and I can make decisions about

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.210
what action I might want to take in order to maximize my reward. Okay?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.070
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.810
&gt;&gt; All right. Now, in NBPs, of course we had this

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.460
notion of. policies, right. You remember what a policy was Michael?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.070
&gt;&gt; Mapping from states to actions.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.790
&gt;&gt; So in the game theory world, we have something very similar to, policies.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.122
We call them strategies. So, all a strategy is, is a mapping of, [LAUGH]

00:04:52.122 --> 00:04:58.320
all, of all possible states to actions. So for example, here's a strategy,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.540
that A might have. When in state 1, go left. And when in state 4,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.480
also go left.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.190
&gt;&gt; Seems like a terrible strategy. Does it?

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.150
&gt;&gt; Well, just, if nothing else, just in state 4.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.000
&gt;&gt; Sure, but it's a strategy, right?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.330
&gt;&gt; Okay, but it's just, it's a strategy for one of the players.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.040
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly, each player has a strategy. And that makes

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.820
sense, right? Before when we talked about a policy, and mapped [UNKNOWN]

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.460
to action, there was only ever one player, only ever one

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.820
agent. And so we didn't have to worry about what other strategies

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.040
there were. Here, when we talk about a strategy, it's always with respect

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.670
to one of the players of the game. Okay, so, question. I've just

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.800
given you one strategy, which is what A does in all the states

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.130
A could potentially end up in. How many other strategies are there for A?

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.420
&gt;&gt; For A? Okay, that sounds like a quiz.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.210
&gt;&gt; That does sound like a quiz. Let's make it a quiz.
