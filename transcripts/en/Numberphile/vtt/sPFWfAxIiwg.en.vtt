00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.950
JAMES GRIME: Welcome to our
first official video on our

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.480
new channel called Numberphile,
all about

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.920
different numbers.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.390
We've decided to make out first
video on a very special

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.590
date, that's the 11th
of November 2011.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.210
That's 11/11/11.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.290
Or if you're American, that's
11/11/11, right?

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.280
So we've come to Nottingham
Forest Football Stadium, which

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.360
Brady insisted on.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.570
11 football players in a team.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.740
Personally, I more think of 11
Doctor Who's, but never mind.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.840
And we've just come in
through Entrance 11.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.780
If we walk this way up here to
row 11, and I'm going to sit

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.500
right here in seat number
11, so 11, 11, 11.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.270
So guess what we're going
to talk about today?

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.210
BRADY HARAN: What?

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.000
JAMES GRIME: 11.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.760
Yes, so recently we've had a
lot of dates with ones and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.770
zeroes in them.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.690
They're called binary days.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.360
They're like binary numbers.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.620
And this is the last binary
day until next century.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.240
When Brady first asked me to
talk about the number 11,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.620
especially for this date,
I was worried.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.720
I thought, well, it's a prime
number, but I don't know what

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.690
else I could talk about.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.320
And then I realized there's a
way that we use the number 11

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.710
every day, all the time.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.700
We're going to use a book.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.190
Now, you can do this yourself.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.030
If you've got a book
nearby, grab it.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.950
And here's my book, this is
Johnny Ball's Second Thinks.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.450
Never leave home without it.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.850
On the back of the book,
there's a bar code.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.800
And next to the barcode,
there is an ISBN.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.630
That's an International
Standard Book Number.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.290
And that number is going to be
13 digits long, or it's going

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.745
to be 10 digits long.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:46.540
Actually, I'm not interested
in the 13-digit number.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.830
I want the 10-digit number.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.540
Does your book have a 10-digit
number on the back?

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.530
Now, here's something you
can do with that number.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.600
Let's write down my number
here on the back--

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:06.540
0140318194.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.660
That's the ISBN number for
old Johnny Ball there.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
Now, the first number here
actually tells you which

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.330
country the book
was published.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.880
The next few numbers tell you
the name of the publisher.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.830
The few numbers after that
is the book itself.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.540
And the very last number is
called a check digit.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.010
Let me show you something
you can do.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.240
I'm going to take the first
digit, multiply it by 10.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.600
OK, so 0 times 10.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.550
That's quite easy, that's a 0.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.280
The second digit there I'm
going to times by 9.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.510
So 1 times 9.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.410
Quite easy again, that's 9.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.100
The third digit I
multiply by 8.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.020
That's going to be
four times 8.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.630
That's 32.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.420
The next digit I times by
7, and that's another

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.340
easy one for me.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.390
That's a 0.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.330
And you can keep going.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.040
And the very last digit
you multiply by 1.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.640
So that's going to be 4 times
1, that's the number 4.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.050
Now, what you do is you add
these together so you're going

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.730
to make a number.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.580
It's going to be something
like 100, 200, 300,

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.410
that sort of size.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.530
If I add these numbers
together-- and I've done this

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.140
already, I've done
this in my head.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.790
If you add these numbers
together, you will get here

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.060
the number 121.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.200
And this number is
a multiple of 11.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.580
And it always will be.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.410
If you try this yourself, you
will get a multiple of 11.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.610
In this case, this was 11
squared, 11 times 11.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.500
Whatever you get, it's going
to be a multiple of 11.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.120
And they do this on purpose
so that they can detect if

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.020
there's been an error.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.700
If you inputted the book code in
wrongly, if you swapped two

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.920
digits over by mistake,
it will be

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.870
able to detect a problem.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.330
It's called an error
detection code.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.190
The very last digit is chosen
so that this will work.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.940
Now, the very last digit will be
a number between 0 and 10.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.960
So for the first 9 digits,
that's not a problem.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.940
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.130
The very last digit, the number
10, well, we don't have

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.980
a single digit for a 10.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.200
So instead, you may see the
letter X, which is the Roman

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.860
numeral for 10.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.040
That's used for 10 instead.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.720
So this part, well, that
could be anything that

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.840
they want it to be.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.589
But this number is completely
engineered to make this work,

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.800
to make a multiple of 11.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.510
If you have one of the 13-digit
book codes, they use

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.025
a slightly different
operation.

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:33.940
It's actually based on
the number 10 instead

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.060
of the number 11.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.560
OK, so this is the view
from 11, 11, 11.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.650
The number 11 is used for these
error correction codes.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.360
But error correction code,
that idea is used

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.800
all over the place.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.180
It's used with computers.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.910
It's used with mobile
phones if you're

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.270
trying to send a message.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.360
And, well, in transmission,
you can

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.080
lose some of the message.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.920
So you want to be able to
reconstruct the message

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.440
without having to send
it all over again.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.640
And you can do this yourself.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.550
Again, this is with a CD.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.820
And if you burn a CD, if you
hold it up to the light, you

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.240
can even see where
the tracks are.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.990
And if you use a black pen here,
a black marker pen, I

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.310
could put a dot on this CD,
and this would represent

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.670
something like dirt
or a scratch.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.120
And this will still play.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.430
It can compensate for this
missing information.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.165
Well, in a book code, we might
know there is a missing five.

00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:29.300
There's something we can do.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.140
In a CD, it uses a whole
equation with all sorts of

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.480
numbers, and you can use that
equation to work out which

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.460
number is missing
and what it is.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.570
So we've done this with my CD
in my computer right now.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.840
I'm going to play you a song,
a song all about numbers.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.670
I thought it would be an
appropriate choice.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.410
You can hear it does
still play.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.650
If I pull it out, slightly more
dramatic than a black

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.490
marker pen.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.440
We actually drilled a
hole through the CD.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.400
So the data is actually
literally missing.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.180
Not just a black mark, we
actually took out the data.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.900
Yet the CD player can
reconstruct it and still play

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.060
the song because it will use
this error detection

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.760
technology, this mathematics
that reconstructs the missing

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.840
information.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.680
In fact, this hole is
about 2 millimeters.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.880
You can go up to about 2.5.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.560
If I go even further, I've got
one here with 3 millimeters, a

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.370
3-millimeter hole.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.610
This hole is too big.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.270
Let's try it out.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.920
I'm going to try and
play this as well.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.260
You'll notice the difference.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.170
[MUSIC SKIPPING]

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.260
It's trying.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.370
It's trying its best.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.400
It doesn't play.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400
Too much missing information.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.920
So 11 was just our starting
point into a world of

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.620
mathematics and error correction
code, something

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.800
that is used everywhere that
makes your CD work, that makes

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.960
your mobile phone work, and, of
course, makes that number

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.120
on the back of a book work.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.400
And Brady insists that I remind
you that, yes, it is

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.150
the number of players
in a football team.
