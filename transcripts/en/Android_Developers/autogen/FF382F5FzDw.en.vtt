designing home screen widgets how you
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.929
designing home screen widgets how you
should approach them in general we're

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
should approach them in general we're
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.070
should approach them in general we're
going to talk about some design

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
going to talk about some design
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589

about some of the constraints since you
 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.889
about some of the constraints since you
know as a designer you may not be fully

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
know as a designer you may not be fully
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.930
know as a designer you may not be fully
aware of you know the different types of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
aware of you know the different types of
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.090

screen widgets so with that should we
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.880
screen widgets so with that should we
just jump right in yeah let's do it all

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890

important data and functionality I'd

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
important data and functionality I'd
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319
important data and functionality I'd
actually add latest data as well here

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
actually add latest data as well here
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.910

since widget is very important the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
since widget is very important the
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.130
since widget is very important the
widgets are up-to-date

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140
widgets are up-to-date
 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.149
widgets are up-to-date
and it's accessible right from the

panels and it supported resize them so
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.850
panels and it supported resize them so
that's another kind of important aspect

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
that's another kind of important aspect
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.310
that's another kind of important aspect
is the customizability the fact that you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
is the customizability the fact that you
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.960
is the customizability the fact that you
can basically take a widget move it

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
can basically take a widget move it
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520
can basically take a widget move it
wherever you want it to whichever home

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
wherever you want it to whichever home
 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.170

whatever you know icons are around it
 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.330
whatever you know icons are around it
it's really kind of there to make it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
it's really kind of there to make it
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569
it's really kind of there to make it
your own so that's a home screen widget

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579
your own so that's a home screen widget
 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.420
your own so that's a home screen widget
at a very high level kind of overview

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
at a very high level kind of overview
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.069
at a very high level kind of overview
the idea is that you know you basically

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079
the idea is that you know you basically
 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.410
the idea is that you know you basically
take a part of your app and and throw it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
take a part of your app and and throw it
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980
take a part of your app and and throw it
onto the home screen and interject it's

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
onto the home screen and interject it's
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.480
onto the home screen and interject it's

such a great opportunity it's such a
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
such a great opportunity it's such a
shame when an application with this kind

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010
shame when an application with this kind
 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.500

of information doesn't take advantage I

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
of information doesn't take advantage I
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.540
of information doesn't take advantage I
think of a home screen widget yeah

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550
think of a home screen widget yeah
 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.960
think of a home screen widget yeah
almost like you know I'd say that you

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
almost like you know I'd say that you
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.880
almost like you know I'd say that you
know there are certain users that if

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890
know there are certain users that if
 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.920
know there are certain users that if
they are a guess if you add a home

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930
they are a guess if you add a home
 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.510
they are a guess if you add a home
screen widget it's probably a pretty

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520
screen widget it's probably a pretty
 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.040
screen widget it's probably a pretty
strong signal that you're pretty

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050
strong signal that you're pretty
 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050
strong signal that you're pretty
passionate about the app so some of your

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
passionate about the app so some of your
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.420
passionate about the app so some of your
you know biggest power users will be the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
you know biggest power users will be the
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.070
you know biggest power users will be the
ones that use the home screen widget you

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080
ones that use the home screen widget you
 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.450
ones that use the home screen widget you
know not everybody will use it you know

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460
know not everybody will use it you know
 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.910
know not everybody will use it you know
not everybody decides to add it to their

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920
not everybody decides to add it to their
 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.530
not everybody decides to add it to their
home screen but the folks that do really

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
home screen but the folks that do really
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.640
home screen but the folks that do really
probably love your content so let's move

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
probably love your content so let's move
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.890
probably love your content so let's move
on so there are a few types of home

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
on so there are a few types of home
 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.910
on so there are a few types of home
screen widgets so if you look at the

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920
screen widgets so if you look at the
 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.110
screen widgets so if you look at the
design guidelines they'll talk about

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
design guidelines they'll talk about
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.540
design guidelines they'll talk about
these but they're roughly broken up into

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550
these but they're roughly broken up into
 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.330
these but they're roughly broken up into
into three main categories information

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340
into three main categories information
 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.010
into three main categories information
type widget like whether that shows you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020
type widget like whether that shows you
 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.040
type widget like whether that shows you
information at a glance control widgets

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050
information at a glance control widgets
 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.530
information at a glance control widgets
that let you kind of you know make

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540
that let you kind of you know make
 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.990
that let you kind of you know make
changes to a certain app or even the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000
changes to a certain app or even the
 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.260
changes to a certain app or even the
system in this case and collection

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270
system in this case and collection
 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.780
system in this case and collection
widgets which basically let you see

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790
widgets which basically let you see
 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.870
widgets which basically let you see
collections of data scrolling vertically

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
collections of data scrolling vertically
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.210
collections of data scrolling vertically
to see kind of past items or other items

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220
to see kind of past items or other items
 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.040
to see kind of past items or other items
in the list and then of course there's

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050
in the list and then of course there's
 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.170
in the list and then of course there's
the the hybrid type of widget that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180
the the hybrid type of widget that
 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.570
the the hybrid type of widget that
includes multiple items and most widgets

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580
includes multiple items and most widgets
 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.740
includes multiple items and most widgets
are probably going to be kind of hybrid

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750
are probably going to be kind of hybrid
 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.900
are probably going to be kind of hybrid
widgets they'll include aspects of you

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910
widgets they'll include aspects of you
 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.640
widgets they'll include aspects of you
know showing information also allowing

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
know showing information also allowing
 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.070
know showing information also allowing
you access to you know control of the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080
you access to you know control of the
 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.530
you access to you know control of the
app or potentially you know linking you

into different parts of the app which
 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.920
into different parts of the app which
we'll talk about in a bit and so you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930
we'll talk about in a bit and so you
 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.030
we'll talk about in a bit and so you
know there are a couple things that I

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040
know there are a couple things that I
 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.340
know there are a couple things that I
think make a home screen widget really

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350
think make a home screen widget really
 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.130
think make a home screen widget really
good a couple of key important items so

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140
good a couple of key important items so
 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.290
good a couple of key important items so
the first is up-to-date you know home

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300
the first is up-to-date you know home
 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.850
the first is up-to-date you know home
screen widget should be dynamic it

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860
screen widget should be dynamic it
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.350
screen widget should be dynamic it
should never really be you know just

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360
should never really be you know just
 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.479
should never really be you know just
showing one piece of information from

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489
showing one piece of information from
 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.970
showing one piece of information from
you know a week ago or two weeks ago it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980
you know a week ago or two weeks ago it
 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.770
you know a week ago or two weeks ago it
should really be something that the user

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780
should really be something that the user
 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.420
should really be something that the user
you know would open up their home screen

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430
you know would open up their home screen
 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.860
you know would open up their home screen
and expect to you know see the latest

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870
and expect to you know see the latest
 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.320
and expect to you know see the latest
and greatest information so for example

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330
and greatest information so for example
 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.449
and greatest information so for example
if it's you know if you have a for some

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459
if it's you know if you have a for some
 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.000
if it's you know if you have a for some
reason a widget that does traffic then

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010
reason a widget that does traffic then
 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.140
reason a widget that does traffic then
you should probably show something

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150
you should probably show something
 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.340
you should probably show something
that's very immediate

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350
that's very immediate
 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.840
that's very immediate
something that's that's relevant to the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850
something that's that's relevant to the
 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.150
something that's that's relevant to the
next you know a few hours if you have

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160
next you know a few hours if you have
 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.680
next you know a few hours if you have
something if you have a widget that's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690
something if you have a widget that's
 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.300
something if you have a widget that's
showing weather also you want to show

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310
showing weather also you want to show
 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.370
showing weather also you want to show
something that's kind of around now you

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380
something that's kind of around now you
 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.480
something that's kind of around now you
don't want to show weather from

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490
don't want to show weather from
 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.490
don't want to show weather from
yesterday or something like that as well

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500
yesterday or something like that as well
 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.640
yesterday or something like that as well
as you know news articles or Gmail or or

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
as you know news articles or Gmail or or
 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.980
as you know news articles or Gmail or or
or any sort of sort of you know list or

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
or any sort of sort of you know list or
 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.840
or any sort of sort of you know list or
feed type widget you want to make sure

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850
feed type widget you want to make sure
 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.360
feed type widget you want to make sure
to to basically update the widget as

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370
to to basically update the widget as
 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.580
to to basically update the widget as
soon as there's new data so for example

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590
soon as there's new data so for example
 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.250
soon as there's new data so for example
in the case of Gmail you know when you

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260
in the case of Gmail you know when you
 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.170
in the case of Gmail you know when you
get a new email there's a push message

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180
get a new email there's a push message
 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.820
get a new email there's a push message
that's sent to the device that basically

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830
that's sent to the device that basically
 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.920
that's sent to the device that basically
tells Gmail the Gmail application that

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930
tells Gmail the Gmail application that
 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.470
tells Gmail the Gmail application that
hey there's a new email so along with

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480
hey there's a new email so along with
 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.360
hey there's a new email so along with
you know updating the you know the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
you know updating the you know the
 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.430
you know updating the you know the
cached content for Gmail you should also

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440
cached content for Gmail you should also
 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.380
cached content for Gmail you should also
make sure to trigger an update to the

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390
make sure to trigger an update to the
 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.960
make sure to trigger an update to the
widget so the widget can can show that

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970
widget so the widget can can show that
 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.970
widget so the widget can can show that
new information and this is all possible

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980
new information and this is all possible
 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.620
new information and this is all possible
as a developer you can all you could do

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630
as a developer you can all you could do
 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.270
as a developer you can all you could do
this of course but as a designer you

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280
this of course but as a designer you
 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.520
this of course but as a designer you
should you should plan for for push

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
should you should plan for for push
 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.170
should you should plan for for push
updates to your widget as the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180
updates to your widget as the
 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.290
updates to your widget as the
information comes in you can also

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300
information comes in you can also
 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.330
information comes in you can also
specify a parry a periodic refresh and

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340
specify a parry a periodic refresh and
 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.700
specify a parry a periodic refresh and
absolutely you know most widgets should

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710
absolutely you know most widgets should
 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.380
absolutely you know most widgets should
probably refresh automatically unless

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390
probably refresh automatically unless
 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.540
probably refresh automatically unless
there's you know some great reason not

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550
there's you know some great reason not
 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.180
there's you know some great reason not
to and generally you don't want to

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190
to and generally you don't want to
 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.500
to and generally you don't want to
refresh too often like for example

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510
refresh too often like for example
 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.760
refresh too often like for example
refreshing once a minute or you know

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770
refreshing once a minute or you know
 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.320
refreshing once a minute or you know
once every few minutes even that's

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330
once every few minutes even that's
 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.630
once every few minutes even that's
pretty pretty dangerous because you may

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640
pretty pretty dangerous because you may
 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.250
pretty pretty dangerous because you may
kind of you know suck up battery life

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260
kind of you know suck up battery life
 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.370
kind of you know suck up battery life
and basically you should you should

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380
and basically you should you should
 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.460
and basically you should you should
probably optimize around refreshes of no

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470
probably optimize around refreshes of no
 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.010
probably optimize around refreshes of no
more frequent than say you know once

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020
more frequent than say you know once
 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.570
more frequent than say you know once
every half hour to an hour that's

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580
every half hour to an hour that's
 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.600
every half hour to an hour that's
probably the the peak or the the minimum

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610
probably the the peak or the the minimum
 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.120
probably the the peak or the the minimum
bar for the minimum refresh time for a

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130
bar for the minimum refresh time for a
 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.650
bar for the minimum refresh time for a
widget without you know using too much

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660
widget without you know using too much
 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.350
widget without you know using too much
battery life the other thing to note is

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360
battery life the other thing to note is
 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.990
battery life the other thing to note is
that if you there's a lot of ways to

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000
that if you there's a lot of ways to
 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.850
that if you there's a lot of ways to
tweak this but should also be conscious

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860
tweak this but should also be conscious
 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.070
tweak this but should also be conscious
of when you update so do you want to

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080
of when you update so do you want to
 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.720
of when you update so do you want to
sure you want to update when the screen

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730
sure you want to update when the screen
 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.810
sure you want to update when the screen
or when the phone is sleeping or do you

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820
or when the phone is sleeping or do you
 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.550
or when the phone is sleeping or do you
want to update only when the phone is

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560
want to update only when the phone is
 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.140
want to update only when the phone is
awake and those are things that as a

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150
awake and those are things that as a
 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.370
awake and those are things that as a
developer you can control but as a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380
developer you can control but as a
 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.660
developer you can control but as a
designer you should also be aware of the

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670
designer you should also be aware of the
 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.460
designer you should also be aware of the
different types of updates you can do

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470
different types of updates you can do
 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.150
different types of updates you can do
for religions the other most of the

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160
for religions the other most of the
 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.050
for religions the other most of the
other very important thing about a

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060
other very important thing about a
 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.130
other very important thing about a
widget is that it should be actionable

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140
widget is that it should be actionable
 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.040
widget is that it should be actionable
so you know it's one thing to just show

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050
so you know it's one thing to just show
 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.810
so you know it's one thing to just show
information but generally the

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820
information but generally the
 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.050
information but generally the
information you show is a snippet right

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060
information you show is a snippet right
 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.300
information you show is a snippet right
so you don't actually just want to end

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310
so you don't actually just want to end
 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.860
so you don't actually just want to end
the experience there you want to somehow

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870
the experience there you want to somehow
 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.530
the experience there you want to somehow
let the user you know dive deeper if

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540
let the user you know dive deeper if
 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.210
let the user you know dive deeper if
they actually care about the the news

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220
they actually care about the the news
 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.070
they actually care about the the news
story that you're showing for example in

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080
story that you're showing for example in
 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.070
story that you're showing for example in
your widget let them touch on that story

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080
your widget let them touch on that story
 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.100
your widget let them touch on that story
and jump into you know the details for

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:43.110
and jump into you know the details for
 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.770
and jump into you know the details for
that so that they can read it like a

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780
that so that they can read it like a
 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.720
that so that they can read it like a
teaser when I think of like a newspaper

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730
teaser when I think of like a newspaper
 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.790
teaser when I think of like a newspaper
headline right so you want to be able to

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800
headline right so you want to be able to
 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.490
headline right so you want to be able to
tease these and entice them to click

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500
tease these and entice them to click
 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.770
tease these and entice them to click
through to more details right absolutely

and another thing to point out and Nick

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720
and another thing to point out and Nick
 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.930
and another thing to point out and Nick
will talk about this later but it's

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940
will talk about this later but it's
 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.250
will talk about this later but it's
important to note that widgets can have

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:01.260
important to note that widgets can have
 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.620
important to note that widgets can have
different linkable regions so you know

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630
different linkable regions so you know
 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.120
different linkable regions so you know
make sure to be aware of you know what

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130
make sure to be aware of you know what
 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.320
make sure to be aware of you know what
are the different types of things user

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330
are the different types of things user
 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.970
are the different types of things user
would want to do from this widget and

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980
would want to do from this widget and
 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.380
would want to do from this widget and
tailor to those different behaviors the

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.390
tailor to those different behaviors the
 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.400
tailor to those different behaviors the
other thing is that a widget should be

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410
other thing is that a widget should be
 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.580
other thing is that a widget should be
very very customizable so you know again

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:16.590
very very customizable so you know again
 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:18.980
very very customizable so you know again
the the idea is that a user is granting

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990
the the idea is that a user is granting
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.660
the the idea is that a user is granting
their precious real estate to you right

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670
their precious real estate to you right
 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.090
their precious real estate to you right
there they're giving away part of their

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.100
there they're giving away part of their
 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.460
there they're giving away part of their
home screen to you so you should make

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:25.470
home screen to you so you should make
 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.830
home screen to you so you should make
sure to make your widget as customizable

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840
sure to make your widget as customizable
 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.890
sure to make your widget as customizable
as you feel is fit in the sense that you

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900
as you feel is fit in the sense that you
 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.630
as you feel is fit in the sense that you
know make sure that it is resizable you

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:32.640
know make sure that it is resizable you
 

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.130
know make sure that it is resizable you
know one of the worst things is when a

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140
know one of the worst things is when a
 

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.410
know one of the worst things is when a
user finds a widget that that can't be

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:36.420
user finds a widget that that can't be
 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.810
user finds a widget that that can't be
reset is there can't be that or it's too

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820
reset is there can't be that or it's too
 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.240
reset is there can't be that or it's too
large and then it's kind of it's

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.250
large and then it's kind of it's
 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.710
large and then it's kind of it's
requesting too much of that precious

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720
requesting too much of that precious
 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.600
requesting too much of that precious
real estate so make sure that you design

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:44.610
real estate so make sure that you design
 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.250
real estate so make sure that you design
your widgets to scout the different

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:46.260
your widgets to scout the different
 

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.460
your widgets to scout the different
sizes the other thing is that you know

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:49.470
sizes the other thing is that you know
 

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.870
sizes the other thing is that you know
you should really want to show

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880
you should really want to show
 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.790
you should really want to show
information that's custom tailored to

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800
information that's custom tailored to
 

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.050
information that's custom tailored to
the user so for example if it's if it's

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.060
the user so for example if it's if it's
 

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.940
the user so for example if it's if it's
like a reader type thing or a feed

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:58.950
like a reader type thing or a feed
 

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.640
like a reader type thing or a feed
consumption app and the user has a list

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:01.650
consumption app and the user has a list
 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.370
consumption app and the user has a list
of favorite favorite feeds that you want

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380
of favorite favorite feeds that you want
 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.960
of favorite favorite feeds that you want
to see make sure to make that the

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:05.970
to see make sure to make that the
 

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.670
to see make sure to make that the
default option but let them obviously

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680
default option but let them obviously
 

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.470
default option but let them obviously
customize if they want to change things

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:09.480
customize if they want to change things
 

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.410
customize if they want to change things
around and then also note that there is

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:12.420
around and then also note that there is
 

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.510
around and then also note that there is
a the option of a configuration step so

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520
a the option of a configuration step so
 

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.940
a the option of a configuration step so
before the user or after the user

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:16.950
before the user or after the user
 

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:20.320
before the user or after the user
selects which you which widget to add

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.330
selects which you which widget to add
 

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.580
selects which you which widget to add
you have the option of providing an

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:22.590
you have the option of providing an
 

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.710
you have the option of providing an
inter kind of an interstitial page where

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720
inter kind of an interstitial page where
 

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.050
inter kind of an interstitial page where
they can customize what should be shown

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060
they can customize what should be shown
 

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.790
they can customize what should be shown
in the widget so make sure to make use

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800
in the widget so make sure to make use
 

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.890
in the widget so make sure to make use
of that as well so again in the case of

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
of that as well so again in the case of
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.480
of that as well so again in the case of
the feed reader example you want to give

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.490
the feed reader example you want to give
 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.970
the feed reader example you want to give
them the option to to specify which

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:34.980
them the option to to specify which
 

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.940
them the option to to specify which
feeds they'd like to see in that would

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:36.950
feeds they'd like to see in that would
 

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.250
feeds they'd like to see in that would
and that's probably preferable to having

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:39.260
and that's probably preferable to having
 

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.959
and that's probably preferable to having
multiple widgets maybe even though the

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:40.969
multiple widgets maybe even though the
 

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:43.089
multiple widgets maybe even though the
application can rather than having you

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:43.099
application can rather than having you
 

00:08:43.099 --> 00:08:46.090
application can rather than having you
know 10 15 different widgets for all you

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.100
know 10 15 different widgets for all you
 

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.590
know 10 15 different widgets for all you
know different fear to application might

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600
know different fear to application might
 

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.910
know different fear to application might
be able to produce it's preferable to

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920
be able to produce it's preferable to
 

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.139
be able to produce it's preferable to
probably have just the one and then

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:50.149
probably have just the one and then
 

00:08:50.149 --> 00:08:52.720
probably have just the one and then
configurations them right in so in past

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:52.730
configurations them right in so in past
 

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.160
configurations them right in so in past
versions of Android you weren't able to

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.170
versions of Android you weren't able to
 

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.009
versions of Android you weren't able to
create resizable widgets so a lot of one

00:08:57.009 --> 00:08:57.019
create resizable widgets so a lot of one
 

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:58.720
create resizable widgets so a lot of one
of the biggest workarounds was let's

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:58.730
of the biggest workarounds was let's
 

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.889
of the biggest workarounds was let's
just create you know four different

00:08:59.889 --> 00:08:59.899
just create you know four different
 

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:02.590
just create you know four different
widgets at four different sizes on newer

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:02.600
widgets at four different sizes on newer
 

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.240
widgets at four different sizes on newer
versions of the platform you should hide

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.250
versions of the platform you should hide
 

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.490
versions of the platform you should hide
away all those widgets you should only

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:06.500
away all those widgets you should only
 

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.319
away all those widgets you should only
really show the single widget that is

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:08.329
really show the single widget that is
 

00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:12.430
really show the single widget that is
resizable that's the best approach so

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:12.440
resizable that's the best approach so
 

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.500
resizable that's the best approach so
let's move on and talk about the

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:14.510
let's move on and talk about the
 

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.629
let's move on and talk about the
guidelines Nick do you want to kick us

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:16.639
guidelines Nick do you want to kick us
 

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.300
guidelines Nick do you want to kick us
off here yeah so speaking of sizing and

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.310
off here yeah so speaking of sizing and
 

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.670
off here yeah so speaking of sizing and
the way that the widget kind of system

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:21.680
the way that the widget kind of system
 

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.920
the way that the widget kind of system
works is you have a number of cells on

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:23.930
works is you have a number of cells on
 

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.420
works is you have a number of cells on
your home screen so one cell is

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:25.430
your home screen so one cell is
 

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.910
your home screen so one cell is
typically the size of a an application

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920
typically the size of a an application
 

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.530
typically the size of a an application
shortcut and so when you're designing

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:29.540
shortcut and so when you're designing
 

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.530
shortcut and so when you're designing
your widget you want to be cognizant of

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:31.540
your widget you want to be cognizant of
 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.639
your widget you want to be cognizant of
when you use this place the widget on

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:33.649
when you use this place the widget on
 

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:34.810
when you use this place the widget on
the home team they're going to allocate

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:34.820
the home team they're going to allocate
 

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.850
the home team they're going to allocate
it and number of cells so hopefully

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:36.860
it and number of cells so hopefully
 

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.439
it and number of cells so hopefully
you're using a resizable we did say you

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:38.449
you're using a resizable we did say you
 

00:09:38.449 --> 00:09:40.389
you're using a resizable we did say you
want to and what you would do is you'd

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399
want to and what you would do is you'd
 

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.189
want to and what you would do is you'd
set the minimum number of cells which it

00:09:42.189 --> 00:09:42.199
set the minimum number of cells which it
 

00:09:42.199 --> 00:09:43.509
set the minimum number of cells which it
makes sense of the information you're

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519
makes sense of the information you're
 

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.460
makes sense of the information you're
going to present and then let the user

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:45.470
going to present and then let the user
 

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.740
going to present and then let the user
kind of resize it by the number of cells

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:47.750
kind of resize it by the number of cells
 

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.280
kind of resize it by the number of cells
so when you come to actually designing

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.290
so when you come to actually designing
 

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.220
so when you come to actually designing
that you need to think about a few

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:54.230
that you need to think about a few
 

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.630
that you need to think about a few
things the first thing is that this

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:55.640
things the first thing is that this
 

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.900
things the first thing is that this
cells aren't really that deterministic

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:58.910
cells aren't really that deterministic
 

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.310
cells aren't really that deterministic
right they can be there's a slight

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320
right they can be there's a slight
 

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.920
right they can be there's a slight
amount of flexibility in the actual size

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:02.930
amount of flexibility in the actual size
 

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.259
amount of flexibility in the actual size
depending on the device implementation

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:05.269
depending on the device implementation
 

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:07.660
depending on the device implementation
so you know if the home screen is in

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:07.670
so you know if the home screen is in
 

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.040
so you know if the home screen is in
landscape or portrait you know the

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.050
landscape or portrait you know the
 

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.540
landscape or portrait you know the
actual number of pixels may vary

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:10.550
actual number of pixels may vary
 

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.880
actual number of pixels may vary
slightly so you need to be and to build

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:12.890
slightly so you need to be and to build
 

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.680
slightly so you need to be and to build
a lot of flexibility into your widget

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:14.690
a lot of flexibility into your widget
 

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.449
a lot of flexibility into your widget
really so it can cope with a little bit

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:16.459
really so it can cope with a little bit
 

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:19.329
really so it can cope with a little bit
of change either way of the ideal

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:19.339
of change either way of the ideal
 

00:10:19.339 --> 00:10:22.660
of change either way of the ideal
boundary sizes

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:22.670
 
 

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.000
 
and also they're saying worth bearing in

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.010
and also they're saying worth bearing in
 

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.180
and also they're saying worth bearing in
mind that the actual pixel size and the

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:28.190
mind that the actual pixel size and the
 

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.750
mind that the actual pixel size and the
way that we handled margins has changed

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760
way that we handled margins has changed
 

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.910
way that we handled margins has changed
slightly in newer versions of Android so

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920
slightly in newer versions of Android so
 

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.300
slightly in newer versions of Android so
previously we used to leave it up to up

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:37.310

to the developer to include any padding
 

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.920
to the developer to include any padding
inside with the bounce so we're just

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:41.930
inside with the bounce so we're just
 

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.090
inside with the bounce so we're just
given the cell and let them draw

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.100
given the cell and let them draw
 

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.710

massive padding's and we decided to

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:48.950
massive padding's and we decided to
 

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.920
massive padding's and we decided to
change that number at 4.0 and primarily

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:50.930
change that number at 4.0 and primarily
 

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.410

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:57.980
similar and got the same padding so that
 

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.930

everything kind of was a nice tight grid

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:00.940
everything kind of was a nice tight grid
 

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.210
everything kind of was a nice tight grid
so you need to be aware of that so we've

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:04.220
so you need to be aware of that so we've
 

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.950
so you need to be aware of that so we've
included here the formula which we use

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:05.960
included here the formula which we use
 

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.190
included here the formula which we use
to calculate the size of the cells in in

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200
to calculate the size of the cells in in
 

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.520
to calculate the size of the cells in in
in DP units so bear these in mind when

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:12.530
in DP units so bear these in mind when
 

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.810
in DP units so bear these in mind when
you're creating widgets if you're

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:13.820
you're creating widgets if you're
 

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.550
you're creating widgets if you're
talking just for point number above you

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:15.560
talking just for point number above you
 

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.170
talking just for point number above you
might want to use one formula if you

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:17.180
might want to use one formula if you
 

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.090
might want to use one formula if you
were target older devices and you need

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.100
were target older devices and you need
 

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.100
were target older devices and you need
to bear in mind how much padding to

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:21.110
to bear in mind how much padding to
 

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.320
to bear in mind how much padding to
allow for and one other thing I wanted

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:23.330
allow for and one other thing I wanted
 

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.170

to add is that this is kind of a good

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:25.180
to add is that this is kind of a good
 

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.790
to add is that this is kind of a good
guideline to follow for minimum sizes

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.590
landscape to portrait the cells aren't
actually still perfectly square they're

as far as I know the idea is that in

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:45.050
as far as I know the idea is that in
 

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.750
as far as I know the idea is that in
landscape this the cells are slightly

landscape this the cells are slightly
 

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.790
landscape this the cells are slightly
wider and in portrait the cells are

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800
wider and in portrait the cells are
 

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.700
wider and in portrait the cells are
slightly taller so designing with this

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:51.710
slightly taller so designing with this
 

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.500

personal wallpaper and you know so to
work nicely at that and to go with their

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:00.610
work nicely at that and to go with their
 

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.949
work nicely at that and to go with their
color scheme to find a transparency can

00:13:01.949 --> 00:13:01.959
color scheme to find a transparency can
 

00:13:01.959 --> 00:13:03.989
color scheme to find a transparency can
work quite well their lines also to the

00:13:03.989 --> 00:13:03.999
work quite well their lines also to the
 

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:06.030
work quite well their lines also to the
system which is how we do that as well

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040
system which is how we do that as well
 

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.280
system which is how we do that as well
you know just one point I wanted to

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:08.290
you know just one point I wanted to
 

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:10.980
you know just one point I wanted to
point out so a lot of the system will

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:10.990
point out so a lot of the system will
 

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:12.509
point out so a lot of the system will
just actually have subtle transparency

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519
just actually have subtle transparency
 

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:13.590
just actually have subtle transparency
it's not showing up well here in the

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600
it's not showing up well here in the
 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.720
it's not showing up well here in the
slides but the idea is that you know in

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:15.730
slides but the idea is that you know in
 

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.809
slides but the idea is that you know in
very very small parts of the widget

00:13:18.809 --> 00:13:18.819
very very small parts of the widget
 

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:19.949
very very small parts of the widget
you'll see a little bit of the

00:13:19.949 --> 00:13:19.959
you'll see a little bit of the
 

00:13:19.959 --> 00:13:21.840
you'll see a little bit of the
background peek through and it kind of

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:21.850
background peek through and it kind of
 

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.460
background peek through and it kind of
gives that extra feeling of you know

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:23.470
gives that extra feeling of you know
 

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.590
gives that extra feeling of you know
digital right that this is actually you

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600
digital right that this is actually you
 

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.150
digital right that this is actually you
know it's a real object but it's

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160
know it's a real object but it's
 

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.650
know it's a real object but it's
actually something that's living in my

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:28.660
actually something that's living in my
 

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.799
actually something that's living in my
digital world yeah exactly and I think

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:31.809
digital world yeah exactly and I think
 

00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:33.360
digital world yeah exactly and I think
the users chose the background and

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:33.370
the users chose the background and
 

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:34.769
the users chose the background and
purpose you know so you know you feel

00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:34.779
purpose you know so you know you feel
 

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:36.840
purpose you know so you know you feel
like you know sense of ownership with

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:36.850
like you know sense of ownership with
 

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.699
like you know sense of ownership with
that connection with that and I think it

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:38.709
that connection with that and I think it
 

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:40.259
that connection with that and I think it
reinforces the fact that you're on the

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:40.269
reinforces the fact that you're on the
 

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:41.519
reinforces the fact that you're on the
user's home screen right they've chosen

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:41.529
user's home screen right they've chosen
 

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.199
user's home screen right they've chosen
to give you this piece of space as well

00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:43.209
to give you this piece of space as well
 

00:13:43.209 --> 00:13:44.699
to give you this piece of space as well
that you blend in well with it like

00:13:44.699 --> 00:13:44.709
that you blend in well with it like
 

00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:46.619
that you blend in well with it like

good practices like including press stay

00:13:57.179 --> 00:13:57.189
good practices like including press stay
 

00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:58.650
good practices like including press stay
or inactive estate of all your elements

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:58.660
or inactive estate of all your elements
 

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.239
or inactive estate of all your elements
because they are still interactive

00:14:00.239 --> 00:14:00.249
because they are still interactive

of semi-transparent blue overlay you

00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:18.279
of semi-transparent blue overlay you
 

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:20.249
of semi-transparent blue overlay you
want to use a similar press state if

00:14:20.249 --> 00:14:20.259

don't provide them a preview image so

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:30.740
don't provide them a preview image so
 

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.980
don't provide them a preview image so
you can provide one preview image per

tray here so when I'm going through
 

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.350

semi-transparent version will be a hold

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:48.080
semi-transparent version will be a hold
 

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.810
semi-transparent version will be a hold
onto an hover to place it where I want

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:49.820
onto an hover to place it where I want
 

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:50.829
onto an hover to place it where I want
on the home screen so it's really

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839
on the home screen so it's really
 

00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:53.350

of what the witch is going to look like

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:54.650
of what the witch is going to look like
 

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.019
of what the witch is going to look like
and you need to when you're creating

00:15:59.019 --> 00:15:59.029
and you need to when you're creating
 

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:00.160
and you need to when you're creating
these when they're placed into the tray

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.170
these when they're placed into the tray
 

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.500
these when they're placed into the tray
you'd be aware that you have this kind

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:02.510
you'd be aware that you have this kind
 

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.980
you'd be aware that you have this kind
of landscape crops representation so if

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:05.990
of landscape crops representation so if
 

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.870
of landscape crops representation so if
you provide a very tall widget it's

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880
you provide a very tall widget it's
 

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.880
you provide a very tall widget it's
going to do like a center top crop so if

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:09.890
going to do like a center top crop so if
 

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:11.110
going to do like a center top crop so if
you look in this example we're showing

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120
you look in this example we're showing
 

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.780
you look in this example we're showing
here the photo gallery widget it's

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:13.790
here the photo gallery widget it's
 

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.550
here the photo gallery widget it's
showing kind of like the top half almost

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:15.560
showing kind of like the top half almost
 

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.710

of the preview image which is fine but

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720
of the preview image which is fine but
 

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.790
of the preview image which is fine but
just bear that in mind when you're

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800
just bear that in mind when you're
 

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.260
just bear that in mind when you're
designing the asset that it may be

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:20.270
designing the asset that it may be
 

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.120
designing the asset that it may be
displayed as such and then when I pick

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.130
displayed as such and then when I pick
 

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.500
displayed as such and then when I pick
it up to place it on the home screen it

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:23.510
it up to place it on the home screen it
 

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:24.900
it up to place it on the home screen it
will display the whole image

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:24.910
will display the whole image
 

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.400
will display the whole image
semi-transparent white and also when

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.410
semi-transparent white and also when
 

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.240
semi-transparent white and also when
you're creating this you want to be

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.250
you're creating this you want to be
 

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:29.410
you're creating this you want to be
covers and not to be leaking any

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:29.420
covers and not to be leaking any
 

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.420
covers and not to be leaking any
personal data or anything like that you

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:31.430
personal data or anything like that you
 

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.040
personal data or anything like that you
want to create these with test data just

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.050
want to create these with test data just
 

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:34.360
want to create these with test data just
when you when you're designing them I

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:34.370
when you when you're designing them I
 

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.670
when you when you're designing them I
wanna one general technique that I've

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680
wanna one general technique that I've
 

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.530
wanna one general technique that I've
used when creating widgets is basically

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:38.540
used when creating widgets is basically
 

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.769
used when creating widgets is basically
you know take a screenshot of the widget

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:40.779
you know take a screenshot of the widget
 

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:43.329
you know take a screenshot of the widget
open it up in Photoshop and you know I'm

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:43.339
open it up in Photoshop and you know I'm
 

00:16:43.339 --> 00:16:44.920
open it up in Photoshop and you know I'm
guessing that as a designer you probably

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:44.930
guessing that as a designer you probably
 

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.980
guessing that as a designer you probably
have some of the source assets anyway

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:46.990
have some of the source assets anyway
 

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.170
have some of the source assets anyway
but drop in the source assets on top of

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:49.180
but drop in the source assets on top of
 

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.120
but drop in the source assets on top of
your your screenshot kind of you know

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.130
your your screenshot kind of you know
 

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.920
your your screenshot kind of you know
line things up appropriately and then

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:52.930
line things up appropriately and then
 

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.960
line things up appropriately and then
just replace all the the real data with

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:54.970
just replace all the the real data with
 

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.360
just replace all the the real data with
dummy data and then take you know export

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.370
dummy data and then take you know export
 

00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:00.269
dummy data and then take you know export
that as a PNG file and drop it in as a

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279
that as a PNG file and drop it in as a
 

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:01.710
that as a PNG file and drop it in as a
preview image the other thing to note

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720
preview image the other thing to note
 

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.360
preview image the other thing to note
about preview images is that you try to

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:03.370
about preview images is that you try to
 

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.179
about preview images is that you try to
avoid showing any extra transparent

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:06.189
avoid showing any extra transparent
 

00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:08.220
avoid showing any extra transparent
pixels around the sides of the preview

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:08.230
pixels around the sides of the preview
 

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.199
pixels around the sides of the preview
image since the launcher will

00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:10.209
image since the launcher will
 

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:13.020
image since the launcher will
automatically apply padding and margins

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:13.030
automatically apply padding and margins
 

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.210
automatically apply padding and margins
so that your preview image isn't kind of

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:15.220
so that your preview image isn't kind of
 

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.710
so that your preview image isn't kind of
flush with the bounds of its cell should

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720
flush with the bounds of its cell should
 

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.309
flush with the bounds of its cell should
we move on yeah absolutely all right and

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:23.319
we move on yeah absolutely all right and
 

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.110
we move on yeah absolutely all right and
this is a few more guidelines we talked

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120
this is a few more guidelines we talked
 

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:26.910
this is a few more guidelines we talked
we touched briefly on the configuration

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:26.920
we touched briefly on the configuration
 

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.950
we touched briefly on the configuration
but this is kind of an example what it

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960
but this is kind of an example what it
 

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.360
but this is kind of an example what it
might look like so if you if you drop

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:30.370
might look like so if you if you drop
 

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.820
might look like so if you if you drop

one of the media sources and so some
 

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.270
one of the media sources and so some
general guidelines about creating these

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280
general guidelines about creating these
 

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.950
general guidelines about creating these
configuration steps is you want to keep

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960
configuration steps is you want to keep
 

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.020
configuration steps is you want to keep
it very light I mean if you want to make

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.030
it very light I mean if you want to make
 

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.610
it very light I mean if you want to make
it personalizable but you don't want to

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:50.620
it personalizable but you don't want to
 

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.200
it personalizable but you don't want to
be leading the user for you know five

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.210
be leading the user for you know five

six seven deep and series of steps this

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:54.429
six seven deep and series of steps this
 

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:55.890
six seven deep and series of steps this
is suppose to be quite light process to

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:55.900
is suppose to be quite light process to
 

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.180
is suppose to be quite light process to
grab something and place it onto the

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:57.190
grab something and place it onto the
 

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.150
grab something and place it onto the
home screen so do keep that in mind and

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160
home screen so do keep that in mind and
 

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.650
home screen so do keep that in mind and
the other things we do recommend is to

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:01.660
the other things we do recommend is to
 

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.120
the other things we do recommend is to
use a dialogue style here this is one of

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.130
use a dialogue style here this is one of
 

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.799
use a dialogue style here this is one of
the very few cases against where we

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:04.809
the very few cases against where we
 

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:07.140
the very few cases against where we
recommend a dialogue and just to give

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.150
recommend a dialogue and just to give
 

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:08.730
recommend a dialogue and just to give
the user in the context that they're you

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:08.740
the user in the context that they're you
 

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.870
the user in the context that they're you
know you are actually working on

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880
know you are actually working on
 

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.160
know you are actually working on
something on the home screen and you're

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:11.170
something on the home screen and you're
 

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.960
something on the home screen and you're
not like deep in the app to getting one

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:12.970
not like deep in the app to getting one

so as we talked about earlier it's all
 

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.390
so as we talked about earlier it's all
about you know and never having you to

you also want to include access point

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:48.050
you also want to include access point
 

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.870
you also want to include access point
since you have other common points in

want to mention when you actually touch

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:48.820
want to mention when you actually touch
 

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.999

an item on a lockscreen widget like

an item on a lockscreen widget like
 

00:23:51.009 --> 00:23:54.450
an item on a lockscreen widget like
let's say you were to touch this this I

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:54.460
let's say you were to touch this this I
 

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.820
let's say you were to touch this this I
guess this calendar item you'd actually

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:56.830
guess this calendar item you'd actually
 

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.480

if you don't unlock the device it'll

00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:02.289
if you don't unlock the device it'll
 

00:24:02.289 --> 00:24:05.100
if you don't unlock the device it'll
actually just cancel that that click so

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.110
actually just cancel that that click so
 

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.019
actually just cancel that that click so
keep in mind that what's on the widget

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:07.029
keep in mind that what's on the widget
 

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:09.180
keep in mind that what's on the widget
is insecure but once you touch on

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:09.190
is insecure but once you touch on
 

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.210
is insecure but once you touch on
something it will be secure so

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:12.220
something it will be secure so
 

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:17.340
something it will be secure so
constraints is our constraints so there

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:17.350
constraints is our constraints so there
 

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.049
constraints is our constraints so there
are a couple of constraints that that

00:24:19.049 --> 00:24:19.059
are a couple of constraints that that
 

00:24:19.059 --> 00:24:20.519
are a couple of constraints that that
you should keep in mind when you're

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:20.529
you should keep in mind when you're
 

00:24:20.529 --> 00:24:22.440
you should keep in mind when you're
designing home screen widgets the first

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:22.450
designing home screen widgets the first
 

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:24.180
designing home screen widgets the first
is there isn't really support for custom

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.190
is there isn't really support for custom
 

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.759
is there isn't really support for custom
fonts so from a developer standpoint I

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:26.769
fonts so from a developer standpoint I
 

00:24:26.769 --> 00:24:28.560
fonts so from a developer standpoint I
mean in your app you can actually just

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:28.570
mean in your app you can actually just
 

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.080
mean in your app you can actually just
specify a font file a true type font

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:31.090
specify a font file a true type font
 

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.960
specify a font file a true type font
file to use for a given view or there's

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:33.970
file to use for a given view or there's
 

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.720
file to use for a given view or there's
a label or a piece of edit text or

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:36.730
a label or a piece of edit text or
 

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:38.909
a label or a piece of edit text or
something like that but on widgets

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919
something like that but on widgets
 

00:24:38.919 --> 00:24:40.289
something like that but on widgets
there's no real way to do that there is

00:24:40.289 --> 00:24:40.299
there's no real way to do that there is
 

00:24:40.299 --> 00:24:42.119
there's no real way to do that there is
a hack you know you can obviously you

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:42.129
a hack you know you can obviously you
 

00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:44.879
a hack you know you can obviously you
know render the text into a bitmap into

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:44.889
know render the text into a bitmap into
 

00:24:44.889 --> 00:24:46.889
know render the text into a bitmap into
an image and throw that into the widget

00:24:46.889 --> 00:24:46.899
an image and throw that into the widget
 

00:24:46.899 --> 00:24:49.259
an image and throw that into the widget
but that's just a really really bad hack

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:49.269
but that's just a really really bad hack
 

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:50.490
but that's just a really really bad hack
it's it's very bad for performance

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:50.500
it's it's very bad for performance
 

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.799
it's it's very bad for performance
things like that so just avoid custom

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:52.809
things like that so just avoid custom
 

00:24:52.809 --> 00:24:55.259
things like that so just avoid custom
fonts if possible there's also no

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:55.269
fonts if possible there's also no
 

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:56.909
fonts if possible there's also no
opportunity for custom animations this

00:24:56.909 --> 00:24:56.919
opportunity for custom animations this
 

00:24:56.919 --> 00:24:58.740
opportunity for custom animations this
is something that a few designers have

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:58.750
is something that a few designers have
 

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.509
is something that a few designers have
asked me like what can I really do can I

00:25:00.509 --> 00:25:00.519
asked me like what can I really do can I
 

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:02.879
asked me like what can I really do can I
make cool transitions when I press one

00:25:02.879 --> 00:25:02.889
make cool transitions when I press one
 

00:25:02.889 --> 00:25:05.549
make cool transitions when I press one
thing the widget rotates unfortunately

00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559
thing the widget rotates unfortunately
 

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:08.070
thing the widget rotates unfortunately
the widget framework right now is a

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080
the widget framework right now is a
 

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.259
the widget framework right now is a
little static so you know if you touch

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:10.269
little static so you know if you touch
 

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:11.789
little static so you know if you touch
on something in the widget you can

00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:11.799
on something in the widget you can
 

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:13.860
on something in the widget you can
update the widget you can change the

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:13.870
update the widget you can change the
 

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:15.600
update the widget you can change the
contents you know show something expand

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:15.610
contents you know show something expand
 

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.639
contents you know show something expand
or whatnot but you won't be able to

00:25:17.639 --> 00:25:17.649
or whatnot but you won't be able to
 

00:25:17.649 --> 00:25:20.669
or whatnot but you won't be able to
animate it really well so you're just

00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:20.679
animate it really well so you're just
 

00:25:20.679 --> 00:25:21.990
animate it really well so you're just
kind of assume that there won't be

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000
kind of assume that there won't be
 

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.029
kind of assume that there won't be
animations one thing to note is that if

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039
animations one thing to note is that if
 

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:26.159
animations one thing to note is that if
you're touching an item and jumping into

00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:26.169
you're touching an item and jumping into
 

00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:28.499
you're touching an item and jumping into
the full-screen view like linking deep

00:25:28.499 --> 00:25:28.509
the full-screen view like linking deep
 

00:25:28.509 --> 00:25:31.440
the full-screen view like linking deep
linking into content as of Android 4.1

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:31.450
linking into content as of Android 4.1
 

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:32.789
linking into content as of Android 4.1
there is something called activity

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799
there is something called activity
 

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:34.830
there is something called activity
options where you can basically create

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840
options where you can basically create
 

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.659
options where you can basically create
kind of a zoom up animation from the

00:25:36.659 --> 00:25:36.669
kind of a zoom up animation from the
 

00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:38.610
kind of a zoom up animation from the
content but that's basically the limit

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:38.620
content but that's basically the limit
 

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.490
content but that's basically the limit
of the

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:39.500
of the
 

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.899
of the
abilities you can do with widgets

00:25:42.899 --> 00:25:42.909
abilities you can do with widgets
 

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:45.310
abilities you can do with widgets
actually there's also the option of a

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320
actually there's also the option of a
 

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.860
actually there's also the option of a
cross fading between views we'll talk

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:47.870
cross fading between views we'll talk
 

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.840
cross fading between views we'll talk
about that in a second also there's no

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:49.850
about that in a second also there's no
 

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.779
about that in a second also there's no
horizontal gesture support so you know

00:25:52.779 --> 00:25:52.789
horizontal gesture support so you know
 

00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:54.340
horizontal gesture support so you know
the homescreen the the main way you

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:54.350
the homescreen the the main way you
 

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.750
the homescreen the the main way you
navigate the home screen and a lock

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760
navigate the home screen and a lock
 

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.700
navigate the home screen and a lock
screen is you swipe left and right to

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:57.710
screen is you swipe left and right to
 

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.279
screen is you swipe left and right to
change between your different screens

change between your different screens
 

00:25:59.289 --> 00:26:01.690
change between your different screens
that's since that's a very kind of

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:01.700
that's since that's a very kind of
 

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:03.370
that's since that's a very kind of
important gesture

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:03.380
important gesture
 

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:07.090
important gesture
we don't allow widgets to contain views

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:07.100
we don't allow widgets to contain views

can do is vertical and and to do that
 

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:18.159
can do is vertical and and to do that
you need to use one of the specific

00:26:18.159 --> 00:26:18.169
you need to use one of the specific
 

00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:21.430
you need to use one of the specific
views which we'll talk about also

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440
views which we'll talk about also
 

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.320

of Android 3.0 resize ability basically

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120
of Android 3.0 resize ability basically
 

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.120
of Android 3.0 resize ability basically
the ability to you know long press on

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:28.130
the ability to you know long press on
 

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:29.409
the ability to you know long press on
the widget and then get those nice

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:29.419
the widget and then get those nice
 

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:31.539
the widget and then get those nice
little resize handles is only an Android

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:31.549
little resize handles is only an Android
 

00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:34.990
little resize handles is only an Android
3.1 and then there's also we added this

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000
3.1 and then there's also we added this
 

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.240
3.1 and then there's also we added this
option to change the layout of your

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:37.250
option to change the layout of your
 

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.970
option to change the layout of your
widget based on its size dynamically and

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:39.980
widget based on its size dynamically and
 

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.029
widget based on its size dynamically and
so basically after you resize you can

00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039
so basically after you resize you can
 

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.799
so basically after you resize you can
update the the layout of the widget and

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:44.809
update the the layout of the widget and
 

00:26:44.809 --> 00:26:47.529
update the the layout of the widget and
that was added in jellybean Android 4.1

00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:47.539
that was added in jellybean Android 4.1
 

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:49.960
that was added in jellybean Android 4.1
so in earlier versions you basically

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:49.970
so in earlier versions you basically
 

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.600
so in earlier versions you basically
kind of stuck with your layout once you

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:52.610
kind of stuck with your layout once you
 

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.430
kind of stuck with your layout once you
placed it and even after you resized it

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440
placed it and even after you resized it
 

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.289
placed it and even after you resized it
until the next time you updated it I

00:26:56.289 --> 00:26:56.299
until the next time you updated it I
 

00:26:56.299 --> 00:26:58.120
until the next time you updated it I
think we mentioned this lock screen

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:58.130
think we mentioned this lock screen
 

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.560
think we mentioned this lock screen
widgets at full point to plus as well

00:26:59.560 --> 00:26:59.570
widgets at full point to plus as well
 

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.070
widgets at full point to plus as well
right so there's some of the constraints

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080
right so there's some of the constraints
 

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.899
right so there's some of the constraints
the other things too the other thing to

00:27:04.899 --> 00:27:04.909
the other things too the other thing to
 

00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:06.190
the other things too the other thing to
keep in mind is that there are certain

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200
keep in mind is that there are certain
 

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.510
keep in mind is that there are certain
things you just can't do in widgets for

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520
things you just can't do in widgets for
 

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.700
things you just can't do in widgets for
example you can't play video in widgets

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:09.710
example you can't play video in widgets
 

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.909
example you can't play video in widgets
you can't do create you can't play a

00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919
you can't do create you can't play a
 

00:27:12.919 --> 00:27:14.320
you can't do create you can't play a
game in a widget you can't like draw

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:14.330
game in a widget you can't like draw
 

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:16.720
game in a widget you can't like draw
arbitrary stuff into the widget there

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:16.730
arbitrary stuff into the widget there
 

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.279
arbitrary stuff into the widget there
are a few kind of standard things that

00:27:18.279 --> 00:27:18.289
are a few kind of standard things that
 

00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:20.500
are a few kind of standard things that
you can do though the common things like

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:20.510
you can do though the common things like
 

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.630
you can do though the common things like
text labels and images and buttons those

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640
text labels and images and buttons those
 

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.000
text labels and images and buttons those
work their support for loading spinners

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:25.010
work their support for loading spinners
 

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.020
work their support for loading spinners
as well progress bars as well although

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.030
as well progress bars as well although
 

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.010
as well progress bars as well although
like we mentioned before you don't want

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:30.020
like we mentioned before you don't want
 

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:31.299
like we mentioned before you don't want
to update the widget very very

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:31.309
to update the widget very very
 

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:33.430
to update the widget very very
frequently so it's not really feasible

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:33.440
frequently so it's not really feasible
 

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.070
frequently so it's not really feasible
to have a progress bar that updates you

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080
to have a progress bar that updates you
 

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.510
to have a progress bar that updates you
know as you're downloading something for

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520
know as you're downloading something for
 

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.279
know as you're downloading something for
example so progress bars you should

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:39.289
example so progress bars you should
 

00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:40.930
example so progress bars you should
probably only use for like you know

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:40.940
probably only use for like you know
 

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.710
probably only use for like you know
percent watched for example you know if

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:43.720
percent watched for example you know if
 

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.450
percent watched for example you know if
if the widget is showing the latest TV

00:27:46.450 --> 00:27:46.460
if the widget is showing the latest TV
 

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.029
if the widget is showing the latest TV
show episode that I've seen and I've

00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039
show episode that I've seen and I've
 

00:27:49.039 --> 00:27:50.230
show episode that I've seen and I've
seen fifty percent of it maybe you can

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240
seen fifty percent of it maybe you can
 

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.399
seen fifty percent of it maybe you can
use a progress bar to show that I've

00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:51.409
use a progress bar to show that I've
 

00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:52.290
use a progress bar to show that I've
seen 50 percent of

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:52.300
seen 50 percent of
 

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.820
seen 50 percent of
but don't show something that is

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:53.830
but don't show something that is
 

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.640
but don't show something that is
supposed to update very very frequently

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:55.650
supposed to update very very frequently
 

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.110
supposed to update very very frequently
you can also show an in-place carousel

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.120
you can also show an in-place carousel
 

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.300
you can also show an in-place carousel
basically you have like an image in

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:00.310
basically you have like an image in
 

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.610
basically you have like an image in
place in the widget and then you know

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:02.620
place in the widget and then you know
 

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.920
place in the widget and then you know
after a few seconds it kind of fades out

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:04.930
after a few seconds it kind of fades out
 

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.140
after a few seconds it kind of fades out
into another image you can do something

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:07.150
into another image you can do something
 

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.700
into another image you can do something
like that a good example of that is the

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:08.710
like that a good example of that is the
 

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.160
like that a good example of that is the
the news and weather widget that comes

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:11.170
the news and weather widget that comes
 

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:13.560
the news and weather widget that comes
by default with with like you know Nexus

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:13.570
by default with with like you know Nexus
 

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.270
by default with with like you know Nexus
4 things like that

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:15.280
4 things like that
 

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.330
4 things like that
and that's kind of an alternative to a

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:18.340
and that's kind of an alternative to a
 

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.800
and that's kind of an alternative to a
collection widget that basically lets

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:19.810
collection widget that basically lets
 

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:22.320
collection widget that basically lets
you you know scroll up and down and then

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:22.330
you you know scroll up and down and then
 

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.820
you you know scroll up and down and then
you can you can add some clocks in there

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:23.830
you can you can add some clocks in there
 

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.490
you can you can add some clocks in there
if you really want also for scrollable

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:26.500
if you really want also for scrollable
 

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.260
if you really want also for scrollable
elements you can have list views and

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:28.270
elements you can have list views and
 

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.150
elements you can have list views and
bita list view I don't mean specifically

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:30.160
bita list view I don't mean specifically
 

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.590
bita list view I don't mean specifically
a basically a view containing a you know

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600
a basically a view containing a you know
 

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.900
a basically a view containing a you know
a list item or like a piece of text

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:36.910
a list item or like a piece of text
 

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.370
a list item or like a piece of text
followed by another piece of text your

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:38.380
followed by another piece of text your
 

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.440
followed by another piece of text your
list items themselves the items you show

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:40.450
list items themselves the items you show
 

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.750
list items themselves the items you show
in this list view can be fairly complex

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760
in this list view can be fairly complex
 

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.670
in this list view can be fairly complex
you know you can do lots of different

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:44.680
you know you can do lots of different
 

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.620
you know you can do lots of different
things in them so don't treat this as a

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:46.630
things in them so don't treat this as a
 

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:48.230
things in them so don't treat this as a
list view think of it more as like a

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240
list view think of it more as like a
 

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:51.270
list view think of it more as like a
basic kind of like collection view that

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:51.280
basic kind of like collection view that
 

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.250
basic kind of like collection view that
can show you know list items or

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:53.260
can show you know list items or
 

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.590
can show you know list items or
different presentations the email and

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600
different presentations the email and
 

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.420
different presentations the email and
counter examples I guess we and we show

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:57.430
counter examples I guess we and we show
 

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.770
counter examples I guess we and we show
you briefly earlier and good examples of

00:28:58.770 --> 00:28:58.780
you briefly earlier and good examples of
 

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.720
you briefly earlier and good examples of
that we have a you know quite a lot of

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:00.730
that we have a you know quite a lot of
 

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:02.870
that we have a you know quite a lot of
different spec content in that list view

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880
different spec content in that list view
 

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.000
different spec content in that list view
user thing for it and also you can have

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.010
user thing for it and also you can have
 

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:07.740
user thing for it and also you can have
grid views so for example the bookmarks

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:07.750
grid views so for example the bookmarks
 

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.710
grid views so for example the bookmarks
widget lets you lets you see kind of a

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720
widget lets you lets you see kind of a
 

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.470
widget lets you lets you see kind of a
two column a view of bookmarks so that's

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:13.480
two column a view of bookmarks so that's
 

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.610
two column a view of bookmarks so that's
another example and you can actually

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:14.620
another example and you can actually
 

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.520
another example and you can actually
replicate that using a list view as well

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:16.530
replicate that using a list view as well
 

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.750
replicate that using a list view as well
and then finally stack view which will

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760
and then finally stack view which will
 

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.580
and then finally stack view which will
show an example of in a bit and then

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:20.590
show an example of in a bit and then
 

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.560
show an example of in a bit and then
most of the layout types you know as a

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:22.570
most of the layout types you know as a
 

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:23.970
most of the layout types you know as a
designer you may not be aware of the

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:23.980
designer you may not be aware of the
 

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.440
designer you may not be aware of the
different layout types but you know

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:25.450
different layout types but you know
 

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.000
different layout types but you know
there are things like relative layout

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.010
there are things like relative layout
 

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:28.980
there are things like relative layout
where things are arranged relative to

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:28.990
where things are arranged relative to
 

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:32.130
where things are arranged relative to
one another linear layout where things

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:32.140
one another linear layout where things
 

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:34.380
one another linear layout where things
are arranged linearly and frame layout

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:34.390
are arranged linearly and frame layout
 

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:36.030
are arranged linearly and frame layout
and things like that all those main ones

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:36.040
and things like that all those main ones
 

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.240
and things like that all those main ones
are supported so if it's you know you

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.250
are supported so if it's you know you
 

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.980
are supported so if it's you know you
you have a lot of options in terms of

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:40.990
you have a lot of options in terms of
 

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.420
you have a lot of options in terms of
where things are placed within the

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:42.430
where things are placed within the
 

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.630
where things are placed within the
widget so that's kind of one of the the

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640
widget so that's kind of one of the the
 

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:50.020
widget so that's kind of one of the the
more open parts of the widget system

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.030
more open parts of the widget system
 

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.120
more open parts of the widget system
so those are the support UI elements

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.130
so those are the support UI elements
 

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.740
so those are the support UI elements
let's let's actually then just jump into

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:53.750
let's let's actually then just jump into
 

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.030
let's let's actually then just jump into
example since I think we're probably

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.040
example since I think we're probably
 

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.220
example since I think we're probably
running a little low on time yeah all

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:57.230
running a little low on time yeah all
 

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:59.500
running a little low on time yeah all
right let's so we had some screenshots

00:29:59.500 --> 00:29:59.510
right let's so we had some screenshots
 

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.940
right let's so we had some screenshots
but we thought hey we've actually got a

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:00.950
but we thought hey we've actually got a
 

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.440
but we thought hey we've actually got a
device connected why don't we actually

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:02.450
device connected why don't we actually
 

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.350
device connected why don't we actually
demo these widgets like so he added just

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360
demo these widgets like so he added just
 

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.600
demo these widgets like so he added just
a few widgets that we like to to the

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:07.610
a few widgets that we like to to the
 

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.390
a few widgets that we like to to the
home screen of this device first of all

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:10.400
home screen of this device first of all
 

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.520
home screen of this device first of all
we've got some news widgets there's the

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:12.530
we've got some news widgets there's the
 

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.440
we've got some news widgets there's the
New York Times and the BBC News widgets

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:14.450
New York Times and the BBC News widgets
 

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.320
New York Times and the BBC News widgets
they're both three sizable widgets both

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:17.330
they're both three sizable widgets both
 

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:19.060
they're both three sizable widgets both
vertically scrolling so here you can see

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.070
vertically scrolling so here you can see
 

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.350
vertically scrolling so here you can see
the New York Times we've got a list of

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360
the New York Times we've got a list of
 

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.240
the New York Times we've got a list of
different news articles some headline

text some summary text and sort of an
image in most cases here on the right

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000
image in most cases here on the right
 

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.970
image in most cases here on the right
all right

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:27.980
all right
 

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.010
all right
sorry you show you how the resizing

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:30.020
sorry you show you how the resizing
 

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.170
sorry you show you how the resizing
works yeah you just pick up the widget

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:32.180
works yeah you just pick up the widget
 

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:36.010
works yeah you just pick up the widget
and drop it and then you can very easily

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:36.020
and drop it and then you can very easily
 

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:39.010
and drop it and then you can very easily
resize it right there and then the BBC

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.020
resize it right there and then the BBC
 

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.320
resize it right there and then the BBC
news widget actually what I might do is

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:41.330
news widget actually what I might do is
 

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:45.880
news widget actually what I might do is
put this guy over here so you can see

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:45.890
put this guy over here so you can see
 

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:47.170
put this guy over here so you can see
bit better this is quite a nice widget

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:47.180
bit better this is quite a nice widget
 

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.500
bit better this is quite a nice widget
as well and when you expand it out there

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:50.510
as well and when you expand it out there
 

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.500
as well and when you expand it out there
it actually grows the columns quite

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:53.510
it actually grows the columns quite
 

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.270
it actually grows the columns quite
nicely here's probably a grid view right

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:55.280
nicely here's probably a grid view right
 

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.890
nicely here's probably a grid view right
I'm guessing I think of you so that's a

00:30:56.890 --> 00:30:56.900
I'm guessing I think of you so that's a
 

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.090
I'm guessing I think of you so that's a
great example I mean this is coming for

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:58.100
great example I mean this is coming for
 

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.590
great example I mean this is coming for
free it's a great view but you want your

00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600
free it's a great view but you want your
 

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.630
free it's a great view but you want your
widget to dynamically resize like to

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:01.640
widget to dynamically resize like to
 

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.890
widget to dynamically resize like to
base long you know if I give it more

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:02.900
base long you know if I give it more
 

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.630
base long you know if I give it more
horizontal real estate that you might

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640
horizontal real estate that you might
 

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.250
horizontal real estate that you might
change a representation of the story

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:06.260
change a representation of the story
 

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:07.990
change a representation of the story
like going into multiple rows of a grid

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000
like going into multiple rows of a grid
 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.850
like going into multiple rows of a grid
or you might show a more detailed

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:09.860
or you might show a more detailed
 

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:11.470
or you might show a more detailed
headline or something along those lines

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480
headline or something along those lines
 

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:13.480
headline or something along those lines
you want your widget to react and make

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:13.490
you want your widget to react and make
 

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.570
you want your widget to react and make
the most of those of that space yeah I

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:16.580
the most of those of that space yeah I
 

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:18.400
the most of those of that space yeah I
really like these were just quite nice

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:18.410
really like these were just quite nice
 

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.990
really like these were just quite nice
for news news widgets and I think both

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000
for news news widgets and I think both
 

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.490
for news news widgets and I think both
of them when you add them you get to

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:21.500
of them when you add them you get to
 

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.160
of them when you add them you get to
configure which category of news that

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.170
configure which category of news that
 

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:26.470
configure which category of news that
you want to actually show here so you

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480
you want to actually show here so you
 

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.150
you want to actually show here so you
know you can show technology news on

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:28.160
know you can show technology news on
 

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.080
know you can show technology news on
your home screen if that's what's

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.090
your home screen if that's what's
 

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.640
your home screen if that's what's
interesting to you or you can show top

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:30.650
interesting to you or you can show top
 

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.550
interesting to you or you can show top
news in these cases so that some news

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:33.560
news in these cases so that some news
 

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.000
news in these cases so that some news
widgets this is the Google Play in my

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.010
widgets this is the Google Play in my
