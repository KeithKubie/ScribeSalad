GUEST SPEAKER 1: IR bike lock.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.060
GUEST SPEAKER 2:
Or... an IR light,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.440
so we just combined
it all into one.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.855
So if you want to
unlock this remotely

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:26.355
and you hit the
wrong button, you're

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:26.940
going to get blinking lights.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.160
Nothing's going to happen.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.300
But if you want to actually
unlock it, you aim.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.860
The light goes on
so you can see.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.940
And now you've
unlocked your bike.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.020
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And
then you can lock it.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.061
GUEST SPEAKER 2: If you
want to lock it back up--

00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:40.655
[CLICK]

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.047
--light goes off, and you'll--

00:00:45.047 --> 00:00:46.630
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And
the other buttons

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.772
are kind of reminiscent
of if someone

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:52.700
using the different key or
different remote control,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.136
it's not the right one.

00:00:54.136 --> 00:00:56.626
GUEST SPEAKER 2: So nothing
else will set it off.

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:01.108
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.250
GUEST SPEAKER 3: If
you push a button,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.450
it sends the specific hex code.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.906
So if we program in--

00:01:11.906 --> 00:01:15.306
if we program, the program
takes up the right hex code,

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:17.258
then it will open up and close.

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:19.834
PROFESSOR: There's
a IR tech standard.

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:20.750
GUEST SPEAKER 3: Yeah.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.000
So there's specific
libraries for each remote.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.965
And as long as you have
that library installed,

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.070
it'll understand
each you've sent in.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.570
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
But the easiest way

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.240
to figure out what the
hex code is, is just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.280
shining it on, putting
it on the serial monitor

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.863
and figuring out
what the hex code is.

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:40.040
We also built a emitter,
but it wasn't as nice.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.459
So we just decided to go
with the preset remote.

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:44.250
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240
GUEST SPEAKER 2: It did work
at one point in time as well.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.680
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We
know that struggle.
