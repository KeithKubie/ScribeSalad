00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi! How can we survive without overusing nature's resources?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's of vital importance here to maintain a balance.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is what we examine in this unit, focusing on fishing--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
trying to find the best strategy that serves both humans and nature.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
On the way there, we encounter some fundamental concepts of differential equations

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and in the larger fleet of simulation.
