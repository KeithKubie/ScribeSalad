00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.769
The following trailer is rated "S" for super
spoilers.

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.990
From Zack Snyder,

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.270
the visionary director behind "Legend of the
Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.680
Comes the world's most hopeful superhero

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.949
in his inevitable dark, moody Christopher
Nolan update

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.529
Because God forbid a Superman movie be any
damn fun for anybody.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.559
Man of Steel.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.150
Prepare for a mopey, violent reboot

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.079
guaranteed to depress adults and frighten
small children.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.530
where one of America's greatest icons, Superman,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.609
is played by this Englishman

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:48.219
with the acting range of a crumpet.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.420
"Who are you?"

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.410
"I am your father, Kal."

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.609
"That's my name.'

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.000
But my god, what a beefcake.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.469
He's the hero who stood for truth, justice,
and the American way,

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.280
but this time stands for

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.789
destroying American property,

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.110
"That's a $12 million piece of hardware!"

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.380
"It was."

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.330
the Canadian Arctic,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.679
this guy's livelihood,

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.210
Bruce Wayne's satellite,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.670
Downtown Smallville,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.030
and like half of Metropolis.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.470
It's a bird,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.700
it's a plane,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.360
it's -- coming right for us.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.200
Everybody run!

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.649
Journey to Superman's birthplace of Pandora,
err... Krypton,

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.739
an alien planet full of

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:33.349
Avatar birds,

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:34.640
Matrix babies,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.229
sepia tone,

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.630
way too many subplots,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.509
"Krypton's core is collapsing."

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.920
"This Council has been disbanded."

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.569
"I know you stole the codex."

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.819
"I will find him!"

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.789
And ships shaped like wangs.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.690
Meet General Zod, a Kryptonian out to destroy
humanity

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.690
with the power of dubstep.

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.060
In order to defeat Zod,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.970
Superman must decide which of his two Robin
Hood dads to listen to.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.620
Space Dad says show off your powers to inspire
humanity.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.680
"You could be the bridge between two peoples."

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.459
Farm Dad says hide your powers and let innocent
people die.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.989
"What was I supposed to do? Just let them
die?"

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.629
"Maybe."

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.590
Watch Superman honor them both, as he shows
off his powers AND lets innocent people

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.769
die.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.459
Meet Lois Lane, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.719
"I am a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter!"

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.890
That's what I just said.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.760
She's a superhero in her own right,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.840
with the powers of staying alive in sub-freezing
temperatures,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.060
scaling ice mountains,

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.180
seducing hot space dudes,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.409
and showing up wherever the plot needs her
to be.

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.909
"General Zod would like THIS WOMAN to accompany
me."

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.439
C'mon, there is no reason she should be on
that military plane.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.239
"It's supposed to go in all the way!"

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.680
Heh, that's what she said.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.260
When Lois uses her Nikon camera

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.920
to photograph this Budweiser drinking alien,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.219
she'll discover the truth from his friend
at the IHOP.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.439
But when Zod sends a message on this Nokia
phone

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.340
it's up to Superman to take him on with this
U-Haul truck

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.999
through this 7/11,

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.269
back to the IHOP,

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.969
and inside this Sears.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.939
So, if you loved the Christopher Reeve era
Superman movies,

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.209
but wished they made them less hopeful,

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.810
killed countless civilians,

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.629
visualized our worst fears of urban terrorism,

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.719
and had Superman overcome his first villain
by murdering him with his

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:33.469
bare hands,

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:40.469
DC has made the reboot for you, psycho!

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.340
Yikes.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.109
Starring...

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.469
Specific Zod

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.389
Superman Pooping

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.319
and those pin art desk toy things.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.049
you know, from Spencer's gifts...

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.400
the one's you used to press your face against.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.129
You guys know what I'm talking about, right?

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.889
Man of Steel

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:09.889
Can't believe I'm now actually rooting for
Ben Affleck to kick this guys ass.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.299
Thanks for watching.

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.279
"I'm going to steal the Declaration of Independence."

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:19.350
"The jerk store called and they rant out of YOU."

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.070
"Spoooon!"

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.340
"The fox says what I say it says."

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.690
"I am vengence, I am the night, I am Batman."

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.190
