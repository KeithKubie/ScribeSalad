Ginny Foos has a spontaneous mutation causing a

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.210
chondroplasia which we're going to talk a lot

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.310

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.900
is just a mutation that happened for the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.190

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.270
chondroplasia, or dwarfism in Ginny's family. How many

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.280
other affected individuals would we expect to see?
