00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.859
Hi, YouTube. It's Ed Miliband, the Secretary
of State for Energy and Climate Change in

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.380
the United Kingdom.
I don't think that the environment should

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.529
or will lose out to ah-the economy in the
coming year but only if we take the right

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.310
decisions. Obviously, what's hapeping in the
economy is at the top of people's minds at

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.460
the moment, and we have to show people that
tackling climate change as the world has pledged

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.160
to do this year culminating in Copenhagen
in December 2009. And fixing our economy,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.201
creating the jobs of the future are not inconsistent.
They are consistent. And that's why it's so

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:44.110
important that President Obama has talked
about the green stimulus as part of his overall

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.650
economic stimulus ah-package. Ah-ah and I
think it's very important why across countries

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.720
we need to be talking about ah-that sort of
action.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.920
But I think the other thing I would say is
that I recognize that governments alone can't

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.060
ensure that we meet our obligations to the
climate in 2009. It needs people as well.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.380
That's why we need an international movement
which goes across countries, telling politiicians

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.500
like me ah-that we need to reach a global
deal in copenhagen in 2009. That's why we

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.920
need to involve business. I've been talking
to business here at Davos about that and how

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060
we involve them in that process. That's why
we need faith groups. That's why we need people

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.830
across societyof all persuasions to be saying,
"Look, the climate is too urgent a problem.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.670
And we know that the longer we wait, the higher
the cost." The climate is too urgent a problem

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
to leave. And that way we can ensure that
the environment doesn't lose out to the economy

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.350
in 2009.
