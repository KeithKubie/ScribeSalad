00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.880
- Good afternoon.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.310
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin,
the dean of the Radcliffe

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.260
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.310
I'm delighted to welcome all of
you to today's panel discussion

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.670
on the 2018 midterm elections.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.120
This program is part of
the Davis Lecture series,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.340
established by Kim
and Judy Davis,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.630
to feature leading thinkers
and artists in public talks.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.220
I'm glad to see Kim
Davis in the audience.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.740
Thank you for your
support, as always.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.930
I'm also grateful to members
of the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.010
Leadership Society, and to all
of our dedicated annual donors

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.880
who are here this afternoon.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800
Thank you very much.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.650
Today, we're exactly
four weeks out

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.230
from the most anticipated
midterm elections

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.030
in recent memory.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.400
The stakes were high.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.720
Besides all 435 seats in the
House of Representatives,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.600
the polls decided 35
seats in the Senate,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.090
governorships in 36 states,
ballot measures in 37 states,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.310
and thousands of state
legislative seats

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.410
and local races.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.530
The outcomes of the
midterms has a bearing

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.950
on political
representation, on policy,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.130
on many facets of daily
life and local communities,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.950
and on the civic climate
and the political landscape

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.800
of our nation at large.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.260
While the results are in,
with a few exceptions--

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.770
[CHUCKLING]

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.660
Yes.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.490
Answers to some of
the big questions

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.620
will take time to emerge.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.990
Questions like,
what do the midterms

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.520
mean for American politics,
for American society?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.370
What do they mean for policy
in the immediate term,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.740
and for years to come?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.130
Was the election
a turning point?

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.980
Put another way, to what
extent and in what areas

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.670
do these midterms tell a
story of fundamental change,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.730
or a story of continuity?

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.070
Our speakers this
afternoon will explore

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.800
some of these questions,
and many other questions,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.340
as they put the midterm
results in context.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.660
They'll also focus our attention
on the roles of new voters,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.630
and the results for candidates
and elected officials

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.370
from historically
underrepresented groups,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.370
including women,
people of color,

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.500
religious minorities,
immigrants,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.010
and the LGBTQ community.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.190
We do know that history
was made in many races.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.330
In House contest, an
unprecedented number of women

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.910
ran, and they won.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.030
Come January, for the
first time in history,

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.360
the house will have more than
100 women representatives.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.860
Yes.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.195
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.390
And yet, men still outnumber
women in Congress by a 3 to 1

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.610
ratio.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.040
Many of the House races
were historic from

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.710
an intersectional perspective.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.470
Among the 40 or so women
who will take their seats

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.710
in the House of Representatives
for the first time in January

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.070
are the first two Native
women elected to Congress,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.030
the first two
Muslim women elected

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.070
to Congress, the first two
Latinas elected to Congress

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.870
from Texas, the first openly
gay representative of Kansas,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.850
and the first
African-American woman

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.370
to represent the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.740
You can applaud for that too.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.240
Beyond the House
of Representatives,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.210
Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee
and Cindy Hyde-Smith

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.370
of Mississippi became
the first women

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.730
elected to represent their
states in the US Senate.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.860
And Jared Polis
of Colorado became

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.450
the country's first
openly gay governor,

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.450
as well as the first
Jewish governor of a state.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.630
In Florida, voters approved
a ballot initiative

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.540
that restores the right
to vote to more than 1

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.889
million Floridians with
prior felony convictions.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:04.388
- Woo!

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:04.887
- Yes.

00:04:04.887 --> 00:04:07.136
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.990
But the story, as
ever, is complex.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.750
At the same time as we
witness historic wins

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.480
and the restoration of
voting rights to some,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.220
voters in North
Carolina and Arkansas

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.920
passed constitutional
amendments that

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.370
will require photo IDs
in order to cast ballots

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.200
in future elections.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.020
Thus, we saw both expansion and
contraction of the franchise.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.880
Historic firsts
are important for

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.670
a diverse and
representative democracy,

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.640
even though we know
that firsts are not

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.840
sufficient to undo gender and
racial disparities, wealth

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.620
inequality, voter suppression,
and the many systemic barriers

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.520
to achieving
opportunity and justice.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.650
Thus, the celebration
of firsts only

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.160
scratches the surface of
today's ambitious topic,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.620
the meaning of the midterms.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.330
In a moment, I'll
turn things over

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.120
to Asma Khalid, who
I'm delighted to have

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.060
here today as our moderator.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.270
Asma is a political
reporter for NPR.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.360
She is known for clear,
sensitive, and insightful

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.150
reporting on American
voters and the shifting

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.480
political landscape in
the US through the lenses

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.820
of demographics and economics.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.580
In recent months,
weeks, and days,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.190
Asma has brought that
expertise and insight

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.830
to the 2018 midterms.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.840
She also covered the 2016
presidential campaign for NPR.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.980
Before that, Asma covered tech,
business, and economic issues

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.790
here in Boston at WBUR.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.660
Asma got her start in journalism
in her home state of Indiana.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.490
She decided to become
a reporter when

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.420
she was just seven years old.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.370
Among many honors, Asma received
the University of Missouri

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.160
Honor Medal for Distinguished
Service in Journalism

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.540
just last year.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.460
I'm grateful to
her for joining us,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.780
and she'll introduce the panel.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.420
Thank you all for
being here, and I

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.360
hope to see you at
Radcliffe again soon.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.830
If you're interested
in continuing

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.260
to explore
contemporary politics,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.030
you can join us next week
on Wednesday, December

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.890
12 at 4:00 PM for a
talk by Radcliffe Fellow

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:27.170
and Yale Professor Jacob
Hacker on right-wing populism

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.520
in the US.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.325
And now, please join me in
warmly welcoming Asma Khalid

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.230
to the stage.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.460
- So thank you all
so much for coming.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.970
It's such a delight to see
so many people who are still

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.040
excited to talk
about the midterms,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.160
because, candidly,
I think some of us

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.040
feel like we've been in
this rut of reporting

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.720
on the midterms
for so many months.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.850
But I think there are
still lots of lessons

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.150
to learn from what happened
in 2018 that might give us

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.020
a glimpse into what
we can try to decipher

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.570
about the next presidential
election in 2020.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.070
So thank you again.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.710
My name is Asma Khalid, and
I'm a political reporter

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.660
with National Public Radio.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.630
During the campaign
cycle that just passed,

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.150
I was one of our chief
political correspondents.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.880
And that meant I traveled
across the country,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.590
criss-crossing the
country many places,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.380
trying to figure out what
was motivating voters,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.840
and what was also motivating
some of the candidates

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.120
that those voters
were selecting.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.760
For me, as a
reporter who focuses

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.430
a lot on voters
and demographics,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.091
I just want to quickly give us
a sense of three big takeaways.

00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:57.590
And then I will
introduce our panel,

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.450
who will talk in a lot more
depth about all of this.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.810
So the three big,
what I would call

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.540
essential takeaways
of the midterms

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.870
was, number one,
voter turnout was up.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.394
We really reached, actually,
rather historic levels

00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:13.310
of turnout this election
cycle that we had not

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.440
seen since World War II.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.040
Still, though, a majority of
eligible voters did not vote.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.250
And when you say that in
slow language, you're like,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.590
wow, a majority of the eligible
voting population did not vote.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.230
I think what we want to
focus on lessons learned

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.980
from what this might
mean-- because we did

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.070
have some Democratic candidates,
particularly in Georgia

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.830
and in Texas, who really
tried to galvanize

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.299
these non-traditional voters
in a midterm election cycle.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.039
And undoubtedly,
you're going to see

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.530
Democratic candidates
in 2020 also

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.820
try to mobilize this base
of the Democratic Party.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.620
Number two, we saw an increasing
split along education lines.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.980
Among the 15 most
highly-educated congressional

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.190
districts in the country--

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.090
including yours truly, this
district right here that we all

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.920
live in--

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.740
not one is currently
represented or will

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.346
be currently represented in the
new Congress by a Republican.

00:09:10.346 --> 00:09:12.470
What I find rather astounding
about all of this is,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.330
we don't need to
go very far back--

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.980
we could go just to the '90s--

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.560
and we had many of these
highly-educated districts

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.620
represented by
Republicans at a time when

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.020
George HW Bush was
the Republican Party

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.280
standard-bearer.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.250
But as I said, two
districts in particular--

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.200
a suburban district
outside of Georgia,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.870
and another suburban district
in northern Virginia--

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.300
which had been
represented by Republicans

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.460
now will be both
represented by Democrats.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.120
And to me, this is a really
interesting new change

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.630
that we saw that may give us
a glimpse, again, into 2020.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.090
And lastly, as the
dean just mentioned,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.020
this was undoubtedly a huge
year for Democratic women.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.910
And I'm sure that we will
talk a lot more about this,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.300
and what this means,
but there were really

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.700
women that I met throughout
my reporting cycle

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.890
this year who told
me they had never

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.370
been involved in a campaign
cycle prior to 2018.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.050
They were now knocking on doors.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.090
They were volunteering
for candidates.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:11.120
And these were women who,
prior to this election cycle,

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.530
perhaps may have just voted.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.170
That was the extent of
their political engagement.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.110
So we're going to talk a
lot more about all of this,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:22.156
and many other, also, lessons
that all of our panelists have.

00:10:22.156 --> 00:10:24.860
And to help us do that,
we've got a panel that I just

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.450
want to quickly introduce.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.420
Immediately to my left
here is Aimee Allison.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.020
She's the president of Democracy
in Color, a really interesting

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:33.651
organization.

00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:35.900
Aimee and I candidly actually
have spoken on the phone

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.910
a couple of times
in my reporting,

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.430
but just now had the
opportunity to meet in person.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.720
Then we have Sarah Lenti, who's
a board member of Serve America

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.120
Movement and a
political consultant

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.210
to what I believe is
center-right Republicans

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.530
at this point.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.360
Then we have Katharine
Cramer, who's

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.390
a professor of political science
at the University of Wisconsin,

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.520
Madison, and the
author of a book

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.620
that you all might be
familiar with called

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.560
The Politics of Resentment,
which was about politics

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.260
in rural areas of Wisconsin.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.880
And then all the way
down to our left,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.820
we have Robert Self, a
professor of American history

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.860
at Brown University.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.260
So I will let the
panelists kick it off,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.061
and we'll begin
with Aimee Allison.

00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:18.034
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:18.034 --> 00:11:18.534
- Yay.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.780
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.620
It's such a pleasure to
be here, and thank you

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.730
so much for the organizers,
dean, the professors,

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.650
and for the community, for
welcoming this conversation,

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.940
I just want to say one thing.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.120
Women of color won the midterms.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.520
I wrote an op-ed
a week and a half

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.850
ago in the San Francisco
Chronicle, where I come from,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.010
making that assertion.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.320
But before that--
long before that--

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.430
the story, for me,
about women of color

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:01.790
begins a year and a half ago.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.900
I was there in Albany, Georgia
when Stacey Abrams declared

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.060
her candidacy for governor.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.450
She would be the first
black woman governor

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:17.870
ever in our history, and
certainly in the Deep South.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.540
Her campaign was
exciting from the get-go.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.880
Here was a woman who
was a fantastic leader.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.960
She was a woman who was already
a House leader, Democrats,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.630
the House minority leader, with
a broad-based social justice,

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.170
progressive agenda.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.500
She also recognized
something about Georgia

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.020
that most Democrats and the
public at large did not know.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.460
That Georgia, in
a couple of years,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.470
will be majority
people of color.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.690
It wasn't just a
black-and-white state.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.720
It was a rainbow
there in Georgia.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:58.290
And that 40% of registered
Democrats were black women.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.880
She recognized black
women were the core

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.280
and the most loyal
and important voting

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.800
bloc of the Democratic Party.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.610
She recognized
something else too.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.170
Even though white Democrats--
including Jason Carter,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.150
President Jimmy
Carter's grandson--

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:21.800
had run for statewide
office, he was only

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.440
able to capture 23% of the
white vote in that state.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.500
Many of these Democrats ran on a
very moderate, centrist agenda,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.840
and yet they were
never able to win.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.690
In the last 10 years, there
hasn't been a statewide victory

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.520
of Democrats in Georgia.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.310
And yet Stacey Abrams
knew something else.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.730
She looked at the electorate,
and she recognized

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.560
that there were 1.2 million
eligible unregistered people

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.930
of color, not just in Atlanta,
but throughout the state,

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.950
including the rural part
of southern Georgia,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.240
known as the Black Belt. When
she declared her candidacy

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.150
in southern Georgia, she
was making a statement right

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.580
from the Black Belt,
which was this.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.040
Instead of stacking
millions like most

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.350
gubernatorial
candidates, right away,

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.960
she had two dozen
organizers going

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.580
on every part of the state,
rural, suburban, and urban,

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.200
registering and
talking to voters.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.860
Now, the Democratic
Party, of which

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:31.290
she helped by expanding
the electorate in her time

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.452
before she declared candidacy
by founding this organization

00:14:34.452 --> 00:14:35.910
called the New
Georgia Project that

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:38.550
was registering new voters.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.260
But the Democratic
Party did not believe

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.430
a black woman could win.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:48.940
And so they cynically recruited
a white moderate millionaire

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.480
married woman named
Stacey Evans to run

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.960
in the primary
against Stacey Abrams.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:03.500
Now, the party believed that
the most important voters to win

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.930
were moderate white
voters in Georgia.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:12.210
And so Stacey Abrams
reached out specifically

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.310
to all these
different communities,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.800
and at the end of the primary--

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.450
which resulted in
a landslide where

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:23.810
she won all but four counties
throughout the state--

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.440
the turnout for black
women was through the roof,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.970
for black voters.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.680
But the Latina turnout--

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.370
Latinx turnout--
was up three times,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.640
and the Asian-American
turnout was up six times

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.980
over the last midterms.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.130
So what I argued was
that Stacey Abrams

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.520
knew something the Democratic
Party needed to learn.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.560
It was a new playbook that
recognized who is in the party.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.840
That the party nationally
was half people

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.660
of color and a quarter black.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.270
And that black women
and women of color

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.760
were the most
progressive at the polls.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.430
They were also the most likely
to be primaried by people

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.770
in their own party,
and they were also

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.020
those who were promoting the
strongest social justice,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:14.790
racial, economic justice
agenda in this country.

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.480
And on top of that,
women of color

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.670
were the best strategists
for this new playbook

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.710
of expanding the electorate.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.980
Now, I've been in politics
a number of years,

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.350
and I've seen a
lot of campaigns.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.540
And the big mistake
that I believe

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:33.740
happened that we saw with
the Clinton campaign in 2016

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:35.660
that Stacey Abrams
was attempting

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.170
to correct in the
midterms was deeply

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.620
investing in the most
progressive voters

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.240
and expanding the electorate.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.600
Instead of spending millions
on TV ads-- which, by the way,

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.910
don't get people to the polls--

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.780
she was investing on the ground,
people knocking on doors,

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.940
and meeting people
where they were.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.600
Now, you might have read
that it didn't work out

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.030
with the prize
for Stacey Abrams.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.550
At the time, as a
longtime consultant

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.690
in her campaign, who
spent a lot of time

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.970
in Georgia with her
campaign and got

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:17.810
to see what it was like on the
ground, the voter suppression,

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:23.390
the way that, institutionally,
she ran against an opponent,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.510
it's like playing a
football game where

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:30.320
your opponent is the referee.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:38.600
And she had to face an
insurmountable series of voter

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.030
suppression techniques,
and ultimately

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.240
wasn't able to gain the prize
as the first black woman.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.480
But she cracked the code.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.660
Originally thought, hey, I
need a little over 200,000

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.370
additional Democratic
Party votes

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.230
in order to win
the state, and she

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:58.040
delivered 800,000 additional.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.060
So what's happened?

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.700
It's amazing what she did.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.390
So you can lose and win.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.030
Because if we look at the
lesson for the midterms,

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.370
when it comes to
Stacey Abrams, you

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.760
see how close the Democrats
got to capturing the big prize

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.840
despite the challenges.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.090
So when I say women of
color won the midterms,

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.520
it's not just the incredible
firsts of the new members

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.006
of Congress, the
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez--

00:18:29.006 --> 00:18:31.380
who's very cool on Instagram,
if you're not following her

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.580
stories--

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:38.310
who's opening up, and really,
for the country to see,

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:41.460
what is it like to be on-boarded
as a new Congress person?

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.260
What's it like for her?

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.970
And she is making it more
accessible as the youngest

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:51.370
member of Congress ever,
the political process.

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.970
It's not just Deb
Haaland from New Mexico,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:56.580
or Rashida Tlaib from Michigan.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:02.880
It's that all of these women,
after 2016, decided to serve.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.540
They were coming from
movements, and not one of them

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.645
was backed in the primary by the
Democratic Party, like Stacey.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.590
Right here in your own
home state, Ayanna Presley,

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.157
incoming Congresswoman.

00:19:16.157 --> 00:19:17.740
The thing that people
don't understand

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.910
about her and her leadership
is that she inspired

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.100
a whole new set of voters.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:30.100
52% of the people who voted for
Ayanna Presley were new voters.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.310
So what we're seeing,
and one of the lessons

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.970
that I desperately need people
to understand, particularly

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.640
around the Democratic
Party and why

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.940
there was such success at
the polls when there hadn't

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.620
been in 2016 and years past.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.610
We're at an inflection
point in this country.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.250
We're almost majority
of people of color.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.550
And as I said with a group
of students earlier today,

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.390
there's no majority,
and there's no minority.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:02.470
And the primacy of voters,
who is invested in,

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.800
what the candidates look like,
what the issues they carry,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.410
need to change in
order to inspire

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.200
the population of
our country as is.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.780
And that future is multiracial.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.780
And women of color are
at the leading edge

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.140
of inspiring a multiracial
coalition that I

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.930
believe will win in 2020.

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.570
Now, today in Politico,
there was an article,

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.420
the first one that
acknowledged that women--

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.600
black women in particular--

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.050
will be the main vote picking
the presidential primary

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:36.770
candidate.

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.640
And that was never
acknowledged before.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.060
So I founded She the
People earlier this year

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.520
as the first-ever
organization focused

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.990
on solidifying the political
voice of women of color

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.650
as voters, as leaders,
as movement leaders,

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.910
and as strategists who
are defending democracy

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:03.590
and providing a really inspiring
solution for the country.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:08.170
And in my last, I
had a big summit

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:11.920
that brought together 600
women in San Francisco,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.500
100,000 on livestream, and some
really great women on stage.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.440
A woman named Elmaz
Abinader wrote a poem.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.070
She called it "Anthem for Now,"
and I'll read two stanzas.

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.590
"Hear this.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:29.590
Country, you do not need
a telescope to find us.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.480
Stars are among you.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.180
Shift your eyes from the
corridors to the sky,

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.120
from the sky to the home,
from the home to the field,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.060
from the field to the classroom,
hospital, factory floor,

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.910
and street corner.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:42.990
Hear this.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.290
We are the voiceless,
and we will be heard.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.410
Not as a song to entertain you,
not as a rule to be followed,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.580
or a call to dinner.

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:54.270
We call on you to
listen to the voices

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:57.360
that stream in from embattled
countries and towns with names

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.990
hard to pronounce and
ways you do not see on TV.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.810
The world inside and
beside me are one.

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.790
Change starts when you
listen to the heart."

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.940
So I'd finally
say, women of color

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.920
who showed such incredible
power at the polls

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.250
in the midterms I
believe will lead,

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.370
because they're leading
with love and justice,

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.620
to create a country
of belonging.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.200
And that's what we
so desperately need.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:26.700
Thank you.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:32.628 --> 00:22:35.600
- Great presentation.

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.090
Thank you.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.230
OK.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.830
It's great to be
here with you today.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.540
I want to take this time to
forecast a little upon what

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.670
the midterm results
may mean for President

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.610
Trump, the GOP, and 2020.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.080
Why the GOP focus?

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.270
I started out in
Republican politics

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.080
under Condi Rice,
one of the greats,

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.090
and I left the party in
2016 because of the obvious.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.120
As such, I'm keenly
interested in what's happening

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.640
to the GOP, so let's review.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.670
The GOP lost the
midterms by roughly 9%.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:12.080
2018 goes down as the highest
midterm turnout in 50 years,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.890
with 49% of the voting
population casting votes

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.932
because they were angry
and highly motivated.

00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:21.140
There were some interesting
results across the states

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.056
that I quickly want to
review, because I think

00:23:23.056 --> 00:23:24.410
it reflects on the president.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:27.200
Consider that in
Iowa, during 2016,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.440
there wasn't a day when Trump
wasn't ahead in the polls.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.480
On November 6,
the GOP lost three

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.990
of four congressional
seats in that state.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.810
Pennsylvania.

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.710
In 2016, Trump won
with 44,000 votes.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.540
The midterms came.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.550
The GOP lost four
congressional seats.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.660
In 2016, in Arizona,
Trump won by 91,000 votes.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.340
The midterms came.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.680
The GOP lost a Senate seat
and a Congressional seat.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.400
And that was not supposed to
happen, by the GOP's terms.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.090
So the GOP suffered major losses
across the country this cycle,

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:02.300
and particularly in
the suburbs with women.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.980
With that said, we
learned some things

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.380
about the increasing
Trumpification

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.120
of the Republican base.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.010
Let's look at the
shifting ideology

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.470
and rhetoric of the GOP first.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.370
Russia.

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.980
Since when have
conservative Republicans

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.644
advocated for a softer approach
to Putin or Russia itself?

00:24:19.644 --> 00:24:21.310
Yeah, I studied this
in graduate school,

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.680
and it's not in my lifetime.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.360
So immigration.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.170
Republicans went from advocating
for comprehensive immigration

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.070
reform under George W. Bush to
now supporting a massive wall

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.710
and being OK with family
separation at the border.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:36.350
What about the base's
new take on trade?

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.180
These new and
shifting ideologies

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.300
are a reflection of
the president himself.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:43.100
Some would argue that the
pro-Trump Republican base isn't

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.330
growing.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:45.800
This may be the
case, but I would

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.740
argue that it's hardening, and
we know this from the midterms.

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.140
That is, Republicans
who chose not

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.780
to align with
President Trump in 2018

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.210
lost in places that were
Republican strongholds.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.210
Asma, you mentioned northern
Virginia and Barbara Comstock,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.560
Virginia 10.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.060
This was a seat the
Republicans held

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.880
for 60 of the last 66 years.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.840
No longer.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.120
Mike Coffman, near me
in Denver, Colorado.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.570
10 years in a
conservative enclave.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.200
Lost district 6.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.880
Mia Love in Utah.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.080
Need I say more?

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.570
So even if the president's
base is stagnant,

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:20.540
it is also radical,
and it's hardening.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:22.400
And what I want
to convey here is

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.560
that despite the fact
that Democrats just

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:31.280
won the midterms, the president
could be re-elected in 2020.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.230
So what am I basing
this statement on?

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:34.910
The facts and history.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.350
Fact, the average midterm pickup
for a party out of power is 33.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.540
Democrats just succeeded that.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.150
And now let's hone in
on which side's won big

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:45.890
in the last 40-plus years.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.760
Democrats in '72,
'82, '06, and '08.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.610
Republicans in '94 and '10.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.490
And the result of
these big midterm wins?

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.630
Nothing with respect
to the presidency.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.152
So let me repeat,
midterm results

00:25:59.152 --> 00:26:00.860
have little to no
bearing on the upcoming

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.540
presidential elections.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.740
OK.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.480
So what does matter?

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.130
If midterm election
results are not

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.430
predictive of presidential
election results, what is?

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.430
Historically, data shows
us that approval ratings

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:17.220
are the key indicators
for incumbent presidents.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.770
And more specifically,
a president or party

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.010
needs to maintain a base
approval rating of 40%

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.350
to tip an incumbent presidential
candidate toward success.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.040
And you'll see that as
you move from 40% to 50%,

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.040
it increases dramatically
the likelihood of a win.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.610
Some of you are hearing
this 40% threshold

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.220
and shaking your head,
thinking, this can't apply.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:44.110
But we have to slow
down and recall

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:48.730
that President Obama had similar
numbers around his midterm

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.260
elections and won.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.000
I personally entered
this analysis

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.750
thinking that President Trump is
just too partisan for anything

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.140
historic to apply, but-- and
I did this with the assumption

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.690
being that the more
partisan the president,

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:04.090
the closer the president's
approval rating

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.390
would be to zero amongst the
opposing party or independents.

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:09.140
And that's just not the case.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.320
The data shows us that
even amongst the opposing

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.100
party and independents, approval
ratings for President Obama

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.190
and President Trump with
the opposing parties

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.620
were similar at around 10%.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.510
And then for the opposing
party, between 36% and 40%

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.970
for independents.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.780
Just a snapshot of where the
president was at Halloween.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.630
And then where he
was at November 14.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.170
Post midterms, post the
caravan, post deploying troops

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:41.470
to the border, his numbers
inched up incrementally

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.280
from 41% to 43%, which,
to me, was shocking.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.920
Moving on, I want
to present to you

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.470
a poll that was taken
by the Tarrance Group.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.340
And this poll sampled 800
likely 2020 voters before

00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.480
and after the midterms in
pivot counties across the US.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.970
The poll asked voters, if
the 2020 presidential were

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.520
to occur today, would you
vote for President Donald

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.360
Trump, the Democratic nominee,
or some other candidate?

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.950
The result, the president
won before the midterms,

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.190
and he won after the midterms.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:16.590
But to me, what's
interesting here is

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.620
the 25% bloc of voters
who were either leaning

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.080
towards an independent
after the midterm,

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.700
or undecided in their vote.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.690
Combined, this is a
potentially-powerful bloc

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:29.670
that could influence 2020.

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:33.330
And further, we don't know how
this bloc would shift the vote

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.870
with the entry of a credible
independent candidate that

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.610
could self-fund, or that
would just be funded,

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.920
who's able to peel off some
soft Republicans and Democrats.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.630
And most will say,
this can't be done.

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.850
And we can look
to Perot on this.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.420
Perhaps.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.360
But there is a very
specific scenario in polling

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.610
that has been done
suggesting that if you have

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.680
extreme candidates coming
out of the primary,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.220
a la Trump on the right,
or progressive Sanders

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:02.730
or Warren on the left, you
have a window for a more

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:05.610
moderate independent candidate.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.710
And I think there's some
interesting data here.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:12.370
And this is the group of voters
that went from 10% to 16%

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.740
after the midterms saying
that they were undecided.

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.500
And I want to look at who
was left feeling undecided

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.960
after that vote.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.540
Southeastern and
Mountain-Pacific voters,

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.530
unemployed male voters, employed
voters, male college graduates,

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:30.640
soft GOP, unmarried
men, dads, single women,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.980
and the 55-and-over group.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.510
So we know a lot about
the post-midterm analysis.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.510
And Aimee, you focused
on the women demographic,

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:38.500
and it is critical.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.649
I totally agree.

00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:40.690
But we have to be honest.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.106
Some of this data suggests
that the male vote is something

00:29:43.106 --> 00:29:44.890
that we have to contend
with, and continue

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.860
to contend with as well.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.010
Quickly, I just want to touch
on a few things, on the issues.

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.242
It was surprising in
this election cycle.

00:29:53.242 --> 00:29:54.700
It was health care
and immigration.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.400
And probably not a
surprise, Democrats

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.620
carried with the
health care narrative.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.290
President Trump was forcing
the immigration debate.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:05.200
But one thing that Democrats,
Republicans, and independents

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.210
are in solid agreement
upon was this.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.700
The political system is broken.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.240
And that extends
beyond the presidency.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.820
It touches the
primary system, how

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.610
Congress functions,
dark money in politics,

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:20.470
and government writ large.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.470
And the main takeaway from
some polling that Ipsos--

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.380
a research firm-- did was
that, in this election,

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:30.460
restoring trust and civility
was a far greater importance

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.900
than the issues itself.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.980
So why are we desirous
of trust and civility?

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:40.240
Because today, the trust in our
political parties is at 18%.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.000
We are experiencing
increased tribalization.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.230
This graphic depicts where the
two parties and independents

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.900
are on perhaps the most
contentious and polarizing

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:52.990
issue from 1972 to
today, abortion.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:54.910
Over time, there were
moments when the groups

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.050
were closer together.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:00.520
But today, they're farther
apart than we've ever seen.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.260
Finally, what does
this tribalization

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.644
mean for people and for
our own relationships?

00:31:04.644 --> 00:31:07.060
I think we all have anecdotes
where people have defriended

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.920
people because of
what they're saying

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.200
about this party or the other.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:14.980
There was a poll conducted
in August of 2017

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:17.200
asking people from
the two parties

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.450
who they consider to
be a real American.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.360
And sadly, today, we're so
polarized that Democrats

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:26.020
and Republicans are
increasingly prone to not view

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.630
each other as, quote-unquote,
real Americans.

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.250
And if you believe
that immigration

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:33.130
should be restricted, you're
not a real American to some.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.500
And if you believe that
black lives matter,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.390
you're not a real
American to some.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.640
To me, this is not only
sad, it's dangerous,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.582
and it begs for a unifier who
can restore trust and civility.

00:31:43.582 --> 00:31:45.040
And so that's what
I'm waiting for,

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:48.362
and we'll see what
happens in 2020.

00:31:48.362 --> 00:31:49.344
Sorry to depress.

00:31:49.344 --> 00:31:51.799
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.180
- So it's my honor to be
with you this afternoon,

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:01.760
and I'm going to pick up where
Sarah left off, because I

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.290
share these concerns as well.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.810
And I think those results
about so many people

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:09.062
being very focused on the
lack of trust and civility,

00:32:09.062 --> 00:32:10.520
and being more
concerned about that

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.670
than any specific issue is a
really important data point

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.710
that we need to
pay attention to.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.450
I've been very interested
in the geographic divides

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:22.300
that we're experiencing
in this country.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.070
And so my research over
the past decade or so

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.140
has been focused on
the so-called rural

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.600
versus urban
divide, and so I was

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.240
interested in the outcomes of
these midterms with respect

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.880
to that.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.000
And sure enough,
we definitely saw

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.930
that our bluer areas, or our
more Democratic urban areas,

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:43.160
became more Democratic, and
our rural or small towns

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.320
became even more Republican.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.500
That's a broad brush to paint,
and really, a lot of people

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.410
will point to the suburbs as
the big story in this election.

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.560
And that was a really
interesting case in point

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.810
in which we saw a
deepening of divides.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.670
In other words, the suburbs
kind of sorting out.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:05.120
And so, for example, you saw,
of the 40 Democratic gains

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.450
and seats in the House,
most of those seats

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.990
came from majority-suburban
districts.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:16.100
And in particular, we saw
white college-educated women

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.870
leaning toward the
Democratic Party

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:22.520
at rates that were unusual with
respect to recent elections.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:27.260
And so for me, the
outcome of this midterm

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.530
reinforces the divides that
we're experiencing with respect

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:31.910
to geography.

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.710
And that's important, because
it's not just a correlation.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:39.320
It's not just people moving
to a place that corresponds

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.700
with their partisanship.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.030
But instead, I've seen
through my own fieldwork

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:48.170
that, in fact, it's oftentimes
a deep cultural divide in which

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.830
people are making
sense of politics

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:54.500
through lenses that are
rooted in their identity

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.560
as a person of a
certain type of place.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.620
So for example, what I
heard in Wisconsin when

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.650
I was doing fieldwork along
the lines of inviting myself

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.890
into conversations with
regularly-occurring groups

00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.150
of people, I heard people
in these smaller towns just

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:14.810
resenting what they saw
as more attention, more

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.960
resources, and more respect
going to the cities.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:19.670
And they were
making those claims

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.969
on the basis of people
who saw themselves

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:25.025
as small-town, or rural folks.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.860
I would say there's an upside,
though, to these midterms.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.260
And that is that
intense engagement

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.780
that we saw in
the turnouts where

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:39.659
the turnout rates were quite
astounding, as Asma was saying.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.709
And that's an upside.

00:34:42.709 --> 00:34:44.750
Any time we see more
engagement in our democracy,

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.208
I guess you could
say is an upside.

00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:47.840
But there's a
downside to that too,

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.380
in that much of that engagement
was driven by people feeling

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.260
as though their voices
were not being heard,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:58.010
and that politics was out of
step, that the political system

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.670
was broken.

00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:02.780
And so in many respects, we
see a lot of different people

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.010
saying that they're left
out of the conversation.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:11.000
Feeling or expressing that
their lives are very removed

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.670
from the public conversation.

00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:17.180
And I'll give you one example
from my fieldwork in Wisconsin.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.640
That when I go to
these small towns, even

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.300
groups of people who
supported Donald Trump, who

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.970
voted for Donald Trump, and I
ask them, so which party better

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.790
represents the interests
of people around here?

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.190
Without skipping a beat,
more often than not,

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.840
they say neither.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.840
Neither party represents
people like me.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.180
And folks in
small-town Wisconsin

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.520
aren't the only ones saying
that around the country.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.990
And that feeling
of being removed

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.300
from the public conversation
is pretty important,

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.660
and pretty depressing.

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.520
However, at this
point, I guess I

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.600
would like to move my remarks
from being one of an academic

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.730
to one of a practitioner.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:59.040
Because as I, like many of
you, have looked around me

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:01.880
and thought about, how
do I best use my talents

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.930
at this point in time to try
to make this a better democracy

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:07.400
for all of us?

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.590
By chance, I met someone
who's become a dear

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:11.660
friend and a collaborator
who's with us

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:15.230
today, Deb Roy, who's
a scientist at MIT.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.110
He runs the Laboratory
for Social Machines

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.270
at the MIT Media Lab.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.360
And Deb and I met by chance,
actually, at a conference

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.860
here at Harvard.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.740
And Deb approached me and
asked me about my background.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.450
And he basically
said, what would it

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:33.950
take to scale up the listening
that you did so that we could

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.690
better understand what people
think about in the public,

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.920
and so that people in the
public could have a chance

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.980
to listen to one another, to
better understand one another?

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.950
And so through a
series of conversations

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:48.800
and through working with
the amazing group of people

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.920
he has at his lab, the
Laboratory for Social Machines,

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.350
and this nonprofit
organization that they've

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.470
created to disseminate the
great things that they create--

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.870
and that nonprofit's
called Cortico--

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:03.850
we're starting an
experiment in about a month

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:05.480
in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.670
We're running a pilot experiment
of a project called the Local

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.820
Voices Network in which
we're drawing together

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.640
small groups of people
in conversations

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.280
run by facilitators who
are themselves volunteers

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.210
from the community.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.340
And the conversation
will be based on a script

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.620
that we've developed over
time which asks people

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:31.010
basic open-ended
questions about,

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:32.630
what are they concerned about?

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.220
What are they hopeful about?

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.110
What brought them
to their community?

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:39.557
What do they want others
to know about their lives?

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.390
And so through the
conversations themselves,

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.280
people will have a chance
to listen to one another.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.080
But the team at Deb's
lab and at Cortico

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.630
has developed a
piece of hardware

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:53.900
that will enable the
facilitators to actually import

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.020
comments from other
conversations going on, right

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.240
now, in other parts of Madison.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.850
But ideally, down
the line, as we

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:05.352
expand into other communities,
from other types of places.

00:38:05.352 --> 00:38:07.685
So the facilitator will be
able to stop the conversation

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:10.220
and say, let's
reflect for a moment

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.520
on a bit of a conversation
that took place last week

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.290
in such-and-such place.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.630
And I'd like you all to
think about what insights you

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.060
get from hearing this person.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:24.140
And through those conversations,
then-- which will be recorded--

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:28.010
there's a creation
of a dashboard that

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.440
will enable people to see
what other people are talking

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.470
about, to see the transcripts
of what people said,

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.750
and to hear for
themselves the words

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.390
of their fellow residents,
whether that be right

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:41.270
there in Madison or in
other parts of the state,

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.730
or in other parts
of the country.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:49.510
And we're hoping that
this is one way in which--

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.550
that we can make something
different of the divides

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.260
that we're experiencing.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.370
We're not naive to think that
our partisan leanings are not

00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.900
deeply rooted.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.300
But what we're hoping for
is that people have a chance

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.750
to see the nuance in each
other, as opposed to just seeing

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:09.230
red, or blue, or
Democrat, or Republican,

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.710
or whatever divide you
want to talk about.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.900
We think that there
is a need for nuance,

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.730
and there's a need
for listening,

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:20.270
and there's a need to recognize
that there are many of us

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.610
who wish to be heard.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:23.420
So thanks.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.865
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:32.590
- Good afternoon.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.050
I am really
delighted and humbled

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:38.730
to be on this panel with
Aimee, Kathy, Sarah, and Asma.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.730
I can't imagine a
more insightful cohort

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.130
of expert activists.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:46.500
My role this afternoon
is to step back a bit

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.020
from the 2018 midterm
elections and suggest

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.020
some profitable historical
contexts in which we

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.630
might profitably place them.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.340
And I'll offer three
with no pretense

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.710
of being comprehensive,
but in the spirit

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.060
of the session's title,
"Who Counted, Who Voted."

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.410
The three perspectives
are, first,

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.470
voter suppression and the
making of an electorate.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:10.410
Second, gender gaps in voting.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.770
And third, coalitions and
dominant political paradigms

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.050
in America since the 1930s.

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.850
My hope is to make one
or two clear points

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.650
about each of those to build on
the insights of my colleagues.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:24.570
So first, let's talk
about voter suppression

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.617
and the construction
of the electorate.

00:40:27.617 --> 00:40:29.700
In the simplest terms,
people in the United States

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.450
have fought over access
to the ballot since 1787.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.600
The earliest exclusions--
perhaps too obviously--

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.680
included anyone not white,
male, and property-owning.

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:43.650
From that beginning,
pushes for enfranchisement

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:47.670
and disfranchisement came
together in successive waves.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.160
Property-less white
men were enfranchised

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.280
in the first half of the
19th century at the same time

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.480
that most states eliminated
alien or non-citizen voting.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.140
The 15th Amendment enfranchised
black men after the Civil War,

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.730
but widespread
suppression quickly

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.580
followed, especially in
the former Confederacy,

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:07.140
with systematic
disenfranchisement

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.330
coming a few decades later.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:12.540
Native people were excluded
explicitly from their franchise

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.580
until 1924.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.270
The 19th Amendment enfranchised
women by Constitutional mandate

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:22.770
in 1920, but was silent on
the forms of disfranchisement

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:25.740
that prevented the poor
and non-white from voting.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:29.490
A list of laws and practices
running pages in length.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:33.810
Among those who could legally
vote, some votes counted more.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:37.420
Until the 17th Amendment
was ratified in 1913,

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.350
there was no direct
election of senators.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:44.220
Choosing them by popular vote
was a democratic advancement,

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.830
but it still gave the
citizens of rural states

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.380
disproportionate
power in Congress

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.210
and the Electoral
College compared

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:53.730
with their counterparts
in urban states.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.700
Moreover, until the one
person, one vote Supreme Court

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.030
decisions of the
1960s, most states

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.180
awarded rural areas
significantly-disproportionate

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.840
political representation in
their state legislatures.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.540
The Voting Rights
Act came in 1965,

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:13.260
as you know, alongside
the 14th, 15th

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:16.500
19th, and 26th
Constitutional amendments.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.790
The 26th is the one that
set the voting age at 18.

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:23.460
The Voting Rights Act
of '65 is the foundation

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.810
of modern voting.

00:42:24.810 --> 00:42:27.570
But the Supreme Court's gutting
of the law in the Shelby County

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:32.430
decision in 2013 opened the
door to a new generation of laws

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.500
and practices aimed at targeted
voter suppression, enacted

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.560
almost exclusively by Republican
state legislatures and states

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.180
attorney general that played
a major role in this election.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.560
I need not remind you that race
in particular, and also age,

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.800
have been central to
these new efforts.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.940
The electorate is dramatically
changing, as Aimee introduced

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.400
this panel by suggesting.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.130
It's changing with the
country's demographics.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:06.690
We can see this just in looking
at the representation in 1992

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.030
and 2016 that I
have provided here.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.340
And if we just
isolate race, we can

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:16.200
see the ways in which
demographics and the voter

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.690
identification are
shifting dramatically.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.540
Overall, in the
nation, white voters

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:27.260
are declining dramatically
as a share of the electorate.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:29.300
Given this history,
it's not surprising

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.760
that among nations
with free elections,

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.820
the US sits near the bottom
of voter participation

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.770
as a percentage of
age-eligible voters.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:43.490
This brief history condenses
into a few basic points.

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:47.750
The electorate is not a
natural or organic entity.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.840
It is brought into being by
law, culture, and practice.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.870
Since 1787, struggles
over who could vote

00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:57.170
and how much their vote
counted have never abated.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.540
But the Shelby County
decision in 2013,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:01.250
together with
demographic changes,

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.550
have intensified the politics
of electoral construction

00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:06.380
and management,
which we can expect

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.840
to play an ever-larger
role in US politics

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:10.910
in the next few decades.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.580
If voter suppression
emerged as a major tactic

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:18.020
in the 2018 elections, let
me turn to a second issue.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.060
The combined energy of
several developments

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:23.210
raised anew the question
of whether and how women

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.430
vote differently from
men, a phenomenon

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.430
simplified by journalists
as the gender gap.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:30.860
Journalistic observations
of a gender gap in voting

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:36.080
date to 1964, the year of Lyndon
Johnson's Democratic landslide.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.540
And, by the way, the
last national election

00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:42.370
in which a Democratic candidate
won the majority of white men.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.900
The gap was small-- the
gender gap-- mostly between 5%

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.720
and 10%, and always
found women choosing

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.370
Democratic
presidential candidates

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.230
at higher rates than men.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:54.140
It exploded in the 1990s,
and with the exception

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.320
of the early 2000s, has
remained in the teens and 20s

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.250
since then.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.590
Here's a graphic
representation of that gender

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:04.370
gap in presidential, and I
believe midterm elections

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.480
as well.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.210
The gap is important,
and worth our attention.

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:11.890
But as a single metric, it
obscures as much as it reveals.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:14.330
Its pretense is that half
the voting age population

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.580
of a nation of more
than 300 million people

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:19.760
can be described by a
single category of identity.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.650
If we disaggregated
even a little,

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:24.170
more illuminating
aspects emerge.

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:26.990
For one, the divergence
of party identification

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:29.180
between women and
men is astonishingly

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.970
high among people under 40.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.390
Further disaggregation
here is needed by race.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:40.190
And as we do that, we see that
African-American and Latinx

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.300
women, by and large, are
voting in enormous numbers

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.560
and percentages for Democratic
candidates in both 2016

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.630
and 2018 overwhelmingly.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.060
So if we disaggregate
the gender gap by race,

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:56.180
it's clear that it's also
and importantly a racial gap.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.565
Again, this is something that
Aimee stressed in her opening

00:45:59.565 --> 00:46:00.065
remarks.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.920
What can we conclude from this?

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.140
Women vote in higher
absolute numbers

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.397
and at a higher rate than men.

00:46:09.397 --> 00:46:11.730
According to the Center for
American Women and Politics,

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:16.200
9.9 million more women
than men voted in 2016.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.850
Overall, the gender
gap in voting--

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:22.770
with a few exceptions-- has run
between 12% and 22% since 1994.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:25.500
Within that, there is a
substantial racial gap

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:27.990
among women, with
black and Latinx voters

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:30.930
choosing Democrats by
24 to 43 percentage

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:33.380
points above white women.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.400
If voter suppression
and the gender gap both

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.970
emerged as prominent narratives
in the 2014 midterms,

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.300
my final historical
subject did not.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.760
This is quite unlike
2018, where there

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.340
was a great deal of media
chatter about whether the Obama

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.400
election represented an
electoral realignment.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:53.130
But the Democratic
Congressional surge of 2010,

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.980
the rise of the Tea Party,
and the election of Trump

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.590
quieted those
speculations decisively.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.060
If Obama's election
did not usher

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.760
in a new dominant
political coalition,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.702
how do we think about
our present moment?

00:47:05.702 --> 00:47:07.410
As I've argued elsewhere,
we can identify

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.860
three major political
syntheses in the last 80 years

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.360
in the United States.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.430
Two were once
dominant in the sense

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:17.100
that they shaped the terms
of political contest,

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.410
gave us our language
of political culture,

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:21.600
and defined the policy horizons.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.610
The third was-- and is--

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:25.740
powerful enough to be
meaningful, but not

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.710
enough to structure the
political system as a whole.

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:31.590
None of the three, at
present, is ascendant.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:34.650
The first is what I call
breadwinner liberalism,

00:47:34.650 --> 00:47:37.860
a center-left convergence of
ideologies and policy around

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:40.950
investing in the human capital
of and creating a safety net

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:44.580
for heterosexual male
breadwinner nuclear families,

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.310
largely--

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:48.210
though we should not say
entirely-- exclusively white.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:50.880
This political synthesis emerged
during the Great Depression,

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.250
was primarily the work
of the Democratic Party,

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.860
and gave structure and
content to national politics

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.200
until roughly the 1970s.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:04.400
It was displaced by what I
call breadwinner conservatism.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.860
Breadwinner conservatism
was a right-wing synthesis

00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:10.010
that sometimes flirted with a
center-right moderation that

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.110
seized upon the heterosexual
male breadwinner

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:15.980
nuclear family, but reversed
its ideological terms.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.840
The nuclear family required
moral, not economic protection.

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.060
Rather than providing a
safety net and varied forms

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.610
of economic assistance,
government would secure

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:29.150
heterosexuality and patriarchy--
again, largely white--

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:32.510
by defeating, containing, or
limiting their alleged enemies.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:36.470
Civil rights, feminism,
LGBT rights, and dependency.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:39.140
Breadwinner conservatism gave
such structure and coherence

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.450
to national politics
that a whole wing

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:44.360
of the Democratic Party
believed its only route to power

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.820
was accommodation to its terms.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.700
The transition from the
first synthesis to the second

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.160
was possible because a
third major synthesis,

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.230
itself highly
fractured, produced

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:55.910
such a dramatic rupture.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:59.180
We might call this simply
democratic insurgency,

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.340
and gathered under that
umbrella the various left

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.550
and progressive social movements
of the 1960s and afterward,

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.230
including especially those
concerned with racial, gender,

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:10.820
and sexual equity inclusion
and self-determination.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.990
The democratic insurgency was
and is fractious and unstable,

00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:17.090
but no more than the other two.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.270
The salient point is that
none of the three syntheses

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:22.400
seems presently
capable of establishing

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.850
a new dominant
political paradigm.

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:27.860
Breadwinner liberalism
defined US political culture

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:30.290
for nearly half a century.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.080
Breadwinner conservatism
for slightly less time.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:36.680
The democratic insurgency has
been effective to be sure,

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.770
but it has not assembled
a true national coalition

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.350
and a national
electoral realignment

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:44.210
comparable to the other two.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:47.210
Instead, what has emerged
is a fragmented electorate

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.950
organized around what
one historian has

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.470
called a volatile center.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:54.140
The question remains, then--
and I will leave you with this--

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:58.850
whether the election cycles
of 2016, 2018, and 2020

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:02.450
are simply another skirmish
around that volatile center,

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:05.930
or a more fundamental
transformative opportunity.

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:07.820
My hunch is that the
answer to this question

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.310
has a great deal to do with
the direction things take

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:13.432
in the arena of my
previous two observations.

00:50:13.432 --> 00:50:15.890
Thank you for allowing me to
share these thoughts with you,

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:17.431
and I look forward
to the discussion.

00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:19.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:26.030
- So thank you so
much to all of you.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:29.490
And I think this jump-starts
a really good conversation.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:31.100
I have a few
questions, and so I'm

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.100
going to spearhead a
conversation amongst us first,

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.200
and then afterwards,
we will open it up

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.390
to questions from
the audience as well.

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:40.820
So I felt like I heard
different strains

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:44.130
from all of you
referring to coalitions

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.130
of both the Republican
and the Democratic Party.

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:47.588
And Robert, you
talked a little bit

00:50:47.588 --> 00:50:50.180
about how some of those
coalitions have changed.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.010
One question I have
for all of you,

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.680
actually, is that,
there's been a lot of talk

00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:58.490
after the 2016 election about
what some folks have described

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:00.290
as an identity crisis.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.720
That our politics is very
identity-driven on both

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.460
the right and the left.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:10.040
And I am curious what sort
of consequences, good or bad,

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.060
that that has as we look into
2020, if we are not really

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:16.340
debating-- maybe we never
were, but we're certainly

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:18.830
no longer debating--
the marginal tax rate.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.660
We're debating what
it means about who

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:23.400
gets to be an American, and
who gets to be a part of that.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.210
And I just want to
know what effects you

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:30.440
think that could have as
we're heading into 2020.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.670
- First, let me say that
there is a coalition.

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.200
We call it the new
America majority.

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:42.890
Our work at Democracy in Color
has taken a look at the last,

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:47.237
really, since people of
color have been transforming

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:49.070
not only the population,
but the electorate,

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:53.000
since 1965's Voting
Rights Act guaranteed

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.610
the rights for many people of
color coming to this country,

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.210
as well as immigration
reshaping the communities

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.130
across the nation.

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.210
We had a president,
Barack Obama,

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:06.080
who was elected and
re-elected on the power

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.050
of a multiracial
progressive coalition.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.520
It is the majority of voters.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:14.760
It's 23% of all white voters
and 28% of people of color.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.480
It's not everybody
from every group.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:20.420
But because our
demographics are changing,

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:23.330
I'm arguing that, both--

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.490
what we're seeing is a
fundamental realignment.

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.020
When I started
this conversation,

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:34.640
I was saying that traditional
political consultants valued

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.990
white voters above all.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:39.860
But that became a limiting
factor for Democrats

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.630
unable to appeal and take
full advantage of the changing

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:45.890
demographics.

00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:48.980
The fact that we have a
new American majority that

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:53.900
has the power to elect
Congress people, senators,

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:56.510
and presidents, we already know.

00:52:56.510 --> 00:53:00.120
And that, in terms of
the population growth,

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.450
it's only going to be more so.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:07.160
In terms of the eligible
population, it's more than just

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.420
about identity.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.150
I think that we're going into
a political identity that's

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:14.390
intersectional and
complex, but that we

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:17.540
have people in this
country who can

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:21.050
have a single political
identity that also

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:23.600
allows people to come
fully as themselves

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.100
in their full identity.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:29.600
And women of color do this
exceptionally well, because we,

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.070
as women--

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:33.620
when people say
women in politics,

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:34.850
they mean white women.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.740
But we know women of color,
as you were pointing out,

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:43.490
vote significantly
different based on race.

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:50.450
We know that our race identity
helps us understand the world,

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:55.400
but that it is an intersectional
identity that helps to cement

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.860
a new political force.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:03.230
And I really reject the
dismissal of people saying

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:05.300
identity politics is bad.

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.200
We all have our identities.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.870
And we, in a
democracy, should be

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:15.440
able to accommodate those and
be who we are in democracy.

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.970
And identity politics,
that phrase itself

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:22.700
is real ugly, because it's
used to squash people who have

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.530
specific kinds of identity.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.480
So as a black person,
it's identity politics.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:32.160
But as a white person,
it's just being myself.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:37.690
So I think that the
implication for 2020 for me

00:54:37.690 --> 00:54:41.050
is that the Democrats
showed that,

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:46.181
by having both candidates and an
agenda that appealed to people

00:54:46.181 --> 00:54:48.430
of different identities and
new American majority that

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:51.490
can actually win, or that came
close in places like Texas,

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.190
and Florida, and Arizona.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:56.230
Places that Trump
won in the past.

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:58.420
And this new kind
of identity that's

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.657
multi-modal and
intersectional, I

00:55:01.657 --> 00:55:03.490
believe is going to
help the Democrats to be

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:05.230
successful in 2020.

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.480
And the presidential
candidate who's

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.600
able to speak in that
new way is the one

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.120
that's going to be successful.

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.640
- Just a quick clarification.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.820
I wasn't suggesting that
there's no coalition, which

00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:23.540
I absolutely believe
fundamentally.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.240
My point in that
last section is more

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.470
that, what we can think of as
that democratic insurgency--

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:32.840
which is admittedly a
very, very broad brush,

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.850
and we can disaggregate
that if we want.

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.820
It's just-- I had 10
minutes to summarize.

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.235
I'm not suggesting at all
that that's not a coalition.

00:55:41.235 --> 00:55:42.860
I think what I was
trying to reflect on

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:48.530
was that, under Obama,
that coalition was not

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:53.030
powerful enough and successful
enough to totally transform

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:55.370
the political
structure and implement

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:59.449
its framework as the new
framework of American politics.

00:55:59.449 --> 00:56:01.490
That's true for lots of
reasons, not all of which

00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:02.823
are the fault of that coalition.

00:56:02.823 --> 00:56:04.610
Some of it's political
gerrymandering,

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:06.443
some of it's voter
suppression, some of it's

00:56:06.443 --> 00:56:09.020
our internal struggles
within the Democratic Party.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.280
So it was more about--

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.780
not that there isn't
that coalition,

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.550
which is absolutely there.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:15.950
It's that I don't think
we've yet seen a turn where

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:18.830
that coalition is
capable of establishing

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:21.049
a whole new paradigm
of American politics.

00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:23.090
And maybe in a way, Aimee,
what you're saying is,

00:56:23.090 --> 00:56:25.520
we're at a moment
when that coalition is

00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.916
pushing to do just that.

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:27.415
- Yeah.

00:56:27.415 --> 00:56:30.620
- Can I jump in on
identity politics too?

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.320
Just to say that,
what I see happening

00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:38.820
is the use of identity by
political actors is changing.

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:43.640
And I think the 2018
midterms suggests that we

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:45.500
are going to see more of that.

00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:49.280
And I say that
because identity--

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.860
as Aimee was saying,
we all have identities,

00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:54.320
and there's increasing
evidence in political science,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.910
and in social sciences
more generally,

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:59.540
that identities are central
to the way we make our votes.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:04.640
And oftentimes, it's not just
now at this point in history

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.440
that identities
are driving votes,

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.660
but it has been that
way for some time.

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.820
And in fact, there's
evidence that people actually

00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.580
shift their policy
positions to correspond

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.610
with their identities.

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:17.600
Their partisan identities,
but their partisan identities

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:21.830
being a basket of
identities that

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:24.110
fit their sense of who
they are, and what's

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:27.200
appropriate for someone
like themselves.

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.850
And so for me,
what this suggests

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:31.520
is that there's a huge
duty on our leaders

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.840
right now to make use of
identities in a positive way.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.330
I may sound like a Pollyanna.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:39.530
It may be forever
before we actually

00:57:39.530 --> 00:57:41.640
see that kind of good behavior.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.060
But what I'm saying
is that identities

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.830
are something that we are
proud of, and ought to be.

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.440
And they are who we are.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:50.060
They help us
understand the world.

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:53.960
They help us
communicate with others.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.690
And there is room
for people to be

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:59.960
respectful of the individual
identities that people have,

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:03.200
as well as help
people lead people

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.650
in seeing how those identities
can be woven together

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:08.520
into something like a democracy.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.360
So I see this as a
trend that we should

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:14.180
expect to continue in terms
of people using identities

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:15.410
to divide.

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:17.990
But what I'm hoping
for, and calling for,

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:20.150
is leaders to do
something different.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.740
- Sarah, can I ask
you specifically?

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.170
Because a couple of
political science researchers

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.200
have done some work after 2016
and said that, in some ways,

00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:30.440
Donald Trump differed from
some prior Republicans

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.620
we saw in that he
really also appealed

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.060
to an identity politics.

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:37.320
And you could point
specifically to immigration.

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.320
And it was very
successful for him,

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.750
which is in part why, in
the waning days of the 2018

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:44.780
campaign, we saw him talk about
the caravan, and the border,

00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:48.480
because he believed that those
were successful strategies.

00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.950
- So take me back
to your question.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:50.450
- Yeah.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:52.033
So I guess my question
is I was asking

00:58:52.033 --> 00:58:54.380
about the consequences
of identity politics

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:57.080
as we head into 2020.

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.300
- So that's a tough
one for me, because I

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:05.180
think he was also appealing
to a class of people that

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:09.680
felt like they had been spoken
over in a specific income

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.880
bracket.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:16.550
And so I feel like his win
was reflective of a group

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:19.610
of people, and it definitely
did touch on immigration.

00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:23.210
But can I suggest that--

00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:25.880
there was a study done
recently, the Hidden Tribes

00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.090
of America, where they
looked at all-- they broke up

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:31.670
the electorate and talked
about devoted conservatives,

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:34.910
and traditional conservatives
who are with Trump right now.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:39.102
And then your progressive
activists, which are at 8%

00:59:39.102 --> 00:59:40.310
all the way over to the left.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.350
But there's a
politically-disengaged,

00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:43.770
in the middle, 26%.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:46.070
There are moderates
that are 15%,

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:47.840
and then there are
passive liberals.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.610
And there's this
whole middle space

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.580
of people that feel like they
are not being represented

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.330
by either party.

00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:54.740
And that's like 61%.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.340
So I think, rather than
me talking about identity,

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.800
I would like to look
at this group of people

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.500
that don't feel represented.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.530
And will they feel
represented coming out

01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:06.980
of the primary
system if you have

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:09.770
super extremes on each side?

01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:12.430
Or is there a middle way where--
and there's several people

01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:14.350
circulating, talking
about independent runs.

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:17.140
And is there a way to
do something different

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:19.580
and meet this middle?

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.560
- Do you that there is?

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.340
- I do.

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.200
Depending-- if it's
super extreme candidates

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.140
on either side.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:25.655
It's a very specific scenario.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:27.530
It would have to be a
very specific scenario.

01:00:27.530 --> 01:00:28.310
- Third party.

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:29.260
- Yeah.

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.100
Not necessary third party, or
just an independent candidate.

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.470
Because the third party
versus independent candidates,

01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:36.770
ballot access is a big deal.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:40.030
So it's harder to garner
ballot access as a third party.

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.000
It's easier to garner ballot
access as a person just running

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.450
as an independent.

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:47.120
- Can I just add something?

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:49.220
I think it's
interesting to reflect

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:53.570
on what I hear, in a way,
from the panel as two

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:56.160
different strategies.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.900
One is what I think you just
articulated, Sarah, which

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:03.500
is for politicians
and political parties

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.310
to think about the existing
electorate, and to analyze it,

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.380
and to think about how
to move various pieces

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.399
within that electorate around.

01:01:11.399 --> 01:01:13.190
And what I heard you,
Aimee, articulating--

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:15.720
I think-- is a different
political strategy coming out

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.660
of the Abrams campaign,
which is actually

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.850
not to accept the
electorate as it is,

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:25.370
but to expand it
dramatically, and to vastly

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:28.760
increase the political
participation of nonvoters.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.310
And those strike me as two--

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:34.340
I'm not sure-- complementary,
not complementary, perhaps,

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.087
political strategies.

01:01:36.087 --> 01:01:37.670
One accepting the
existing electorate,

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:38.960
and the other one saying,
we're not going to accept that.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.120
We're going to do
something different.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.899
Does that make any sense?

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:45.440
- I think it sounds like that's
exactly the conversation when

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.590
you talk to, I would say,
Republican and Democratic

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:49.200
strategists.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.140
So this is the debate
that people have,

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.435
is can you turn out your base
more effectively, or can you--

01:01:55.435 --> 01:02:00.692
and I guess my question maybe
is, if the strategy for winning

01:02:00.692 --> 01:02:02.900
is to turn your base out,
you could make the argument

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.450
that Donald Trump did that,
and he did it very successfully

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:07.100
in 2016.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.875
He did turn out people who
had historically not voted,

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:12.500
at least presuming that many of
the people I met at his rallies

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.670
were telling me the truth.

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.211
They will say that
they had not voted

01:02:15.211 --> 01:02:16.970
for x number of elections.

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:19.130
But yet you also find
us, as a country,

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.560
I think, in a very
divided space right now.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.910
And so I guess my
question maybe to you

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:29.360
all is that, even if it's
electorally successful,

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.820
what are the consequences
of doing that?

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:35.060
Because if you do reach out to
your base and your base alone,

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.470
you may win.

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.850
And we saw Trump win.

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:39.560
- I guess that the
path that the--

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.230
OK.

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:44.090
So I'm a partisan, so
I'm not going to talk--

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:46.870
the path to victory--

01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:53.000
the Democrats lost and lost
and lost until this year

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.750
partly because that
there were people

01:02:55.750 --> 01:03:00.430
on the ground, mostly funded
through independent efforts--

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:02.500
But remember, that didn't
begin until Alabama.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.470
My organization was
involved in funding

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:08.637
an independent expenditure in
Alabama's special election.

01:03:08.637 --> 01:03:09.220
Remember that?

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.165
It was December.

01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:11.860
It was a year ago.

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.850
And there was a
child molester guy

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:17.300
who was running for the
GOP, disgusting dude,

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:21.770
and then there was a
not-that-inspiring Democrat

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:23.870
running.

01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:27.380
But the Republicans
had been dominating

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.080
Alabama and that Senate
seat for 25 years.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:33.620
And that's a state 24% of
the population of voters

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.270
were black.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.950
And the independent
expenditure--

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.440
not like the Democratic Party,
and certainly not like Doug

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.500
Jones, the Democrat's campaign--

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.670
focused deeply on activating,
speaking to, and engaging

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:49.222
the black community
driven by black women.

01:03:49.222 --> 01:03:50.930
There was a woman
named DeJuana Thompson,

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:54.290
for example, who's
one of the nation's

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:57.340
best top political strategists.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:03:59.180
No one's asking her--

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:00.462
people are not asking her--

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:01.420
- I just talked to her.

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:01.919
- Right?

01:04:01.919 --> 01:04:03.930
Oh, except Asma.

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:06.840
Except NPR.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:10.740
There's LaTosha Brown,
who helped in Alabama.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.360
And they were successful winning
that seat based on the premise

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.150
that the way that you change
the political trajectory

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.670
is you expand the electorate.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:23.840
The Republicans-- it
is very sad that we're

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.690
seeing that part
of their strategy

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:28.970
is actually keeping it as is.

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:33.140
To try to compress and
suppress the number

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.940
of people who participate.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.120
But the path to victory
for women of color

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:41.150
has to be through
expanding the electorate,

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:46.580
because the Democrats haven't
been big backers of women

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.130
of color, and we already
established that women of color

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:53.190
are the most progressive voters
and leaders in the country.

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:56.090
And so it's not like
there's been great support

01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:58.190
from the Democratic Party.

01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:01.460
But it is that, because
strategists like DeJuana

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.120
Thompson, people
like Andrea Mercado

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.170
in Florida, who expanded
black and brown voters

01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:11.690
in the electorate.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.230
They were aiming for 2% in
the primary, and they got 5%,

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.060
and then in the
general, they were

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.600
able to have such
great turnout because

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.790
of their ongoing
operation that they

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:25.520
were able to pass Amendment
4, which we mentioned earlier,

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.060
restored the voting rights of
people with felony records.

01:05:29.060 --> 01:05:31.550
The same thing
happened in Arizona,

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.850
where David Garcia was a
gubernatorial candidate

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:36.210
at the top the ticket.

01:05:36.210 --> 01:05:40.520
He didn't win, but Kyrsten
Sinema won as a Democrat

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.330
not because of this middle
of their white voters--

01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:46.880
the white voters didn't
vote for Kyrsten Sinema.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:51.050
And in fact, white women mostly
do not vote for white women

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:53.180
Democratic candidates.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.310
And so Kirsten Cinema
won, in the end,

01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:00.060
because of the power of the
Latinx expanded electorate.

01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.180
So what I want to
say is that that

01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:05.960
is the path forward
for Democrats for sure,

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.880
and for people who
are progressive,

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:12.200
to be able to bring more people
in, younger people in to vote.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.520
And that will be the way that
we actually turn the corner.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.590
We have an opportunity,
and it could

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:19.766
go a lot of different ways.

01:06:19.766 --> 01:06:21.515
But I think that's our
bigger opportunity.

01:06:21.515 --> 01:06:22.010
- Could--

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.300
- Sure.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.420
- One of the things
that I think is

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.753
fascinating about what Katherine
is doing, and exciting,

01:06:25.753 --> 01:06:28.300
and bridging the gap between
an expanded electorate and then

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.170
the current electorate
is this listening.

01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:32.180
And I think, if you look
at President Macron--

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.840
and his numbers aren't
great right now,

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.590
but he did win because he
went out and he listened,

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:39.360
and his campaign actually
went out and talked to people.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.780
So I think there's
something great here

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.328
about what you're about to do.

01:06:43.328 --> 01:06:45.080
- Thanks.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.660
- So I want to make sure we
have enough time for questions.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.250
So there is a
microphone right here

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:52.490
in the middle of the
hallway, and please line up.

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:55.220
Just two quick things in
terms of asking questions.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:58.100
When you do ask a question,
please identify who you are,

01:06:58.100 --> 01:06:59.720
just so we know who you are.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.919
And please ask a question,
because otherwise I

01:07:01.919 --> 01:07:02.960
will have to cut you off.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.470
So please make sure
it's a question.

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:05.400
All right, go ahead.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:05.940
- Hi.

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.190
My name is Heather Hendershot.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:08.356
I have a question for Sarah.

01:07:08.356 --> 01:07:11.960
You identified yourself as
someone who had left the GOP.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.240
And certainly a lot of
people have done that.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.376
And I'm wondering
how that impacts

01:07:17.376 --> 01:07:19.250
how we should understand
a lot of the numbers

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:21.710
that we see when we see a poll
that shows a high approval

01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:24.050
rating among
Republicans for Trump.

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:26.330
Should we be thinking,
right, but pollsters

01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:28.130
are talking to people
who don't identify

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:31.280
as Republicans anymore, and that
should impact how we understand

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.130
the number, or do
we have more people

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:36.320
who didn't identify as
Republicans before who

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.960
now do because they're from the
far-right, or they're populist,

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.899
and that pulls
them into the GOP?

01:07:40.899 --> 01:07:42.940
And I don't know if that
balances out in any way.

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.090
I just don't know
what to make of it.

01:07:44.090 --> 01:07:46.572
- So of the numbers that
I presented in particular?

01:07:46.572 --> 01:07:47.900
Or--

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.400
- I'm just--

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.900
- Are you talking
about, in general,

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.635
Trump's approval rating
among Republicans,

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:52.940
how accurate is that?

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.439
- Yes.

01:07:53.439 --> 01:07:57.920
But any other numbers about
Republican feelings about x.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.760
I'm wondering if we have
to say, well, that's not--

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.800
- Is it really reflective
of the Republican Party,

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.270
and conservatives, and
the Trumpification--

01:08:06.270 --> 01:08:10.970
because there is
that new GOP base,

01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:13.470
which I don't feel like is
reflective of the Republican

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:14.060
Party.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.939
My parents still
identify as Republicans.

01:08:16.939 --> 01:08:19.260
They don't like Donald Trump.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.620
So the numbers are
tough, but I think--

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.149
they're tough with
the approval rating.

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:27.359
But the approval rating numbers
that I gave were nationwide.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.620
The 41% to the 43%.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.819
So I think some people--

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:35.630
and I think this is true
of the 2016 election--

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:37.910
are quietly approving what
he's doing, and may not

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.720
be identifying that to you and
me as people, but are saying,

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.779
the economy's fine.

01:08:44.779 --> 01:08:47.359
Brett Kavanaugh
just got nominated--

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:50.769
so I think there's
a quiet acceptance.

01:08:50.769 --> 01:08:52.130
Does that makes sense?

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:52.869
- Yeah.

01:08:52.869 --> 01:08:53.369
- Sadly.

01:08:53.369 --> 01:08:53.910
- I think so.

01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:54.529
Yeah.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:55.520
Thank you, thank you.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.728
- It's not satisfying, is it?

01:08:56.728 --> 01:08:57.670
- No.

01:08:57.670 --> 01:08:58.211
Yeah, I know.

01:08:58.211 --> 01:09:00.388
[CHUCKLING]

01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:01.520
- Hi.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:03.450
I'm Kathryn Sikkink,
and I'm a faculty member

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:06.779
at the Kennedy School and
a Radcliffe professor.

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:08.520
In terms of expanding
the electorate,

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.160
we haven't heard much about
the youth vote and the college

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:11.859
vote.

01:09:11.859 --> 01:09:13.330
And we're here on campus.

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:17.000
And so we know that youth
voters and college voters

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.399
vote at some of the lowest
levels of any people

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.600
in the electorate.

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.600
I've also heard-- but I
have not had confirmed--

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.990
that there was about a 10%
increase in this midterm as

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:29.295
compared to the last midterm.

01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:30.920
So could you just
tell us a little more

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.630
what we know about the
youth vote, and the college

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:37.260
vote in the midterms?

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:37.979
- Sure.

01:09:37.979 --> 01:09:39.957
To your question
about the numbers,

01:09:39.957 --> 01:09:41.790
there are unconfirmed
numbers at this point.

01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:43.950
I know CIRCLE over
at Tufts University

01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:46.260
does really good analysis
on the youth voter turnout,

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:50.414
and did find the estimates
to be about 10% higher.

01:09:50.414 --> 01:09:52.080
I think we'll get a
better sense of that

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.750
once the census numbers come
out, which are self-reported.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:58.500
But overall, I feel like most
people will say confidently,

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.570
youth voter turnout was up.

01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:04.050
I think the conundrum people
run into a little bit is--

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:05.700
Florida's a really
good case study.

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.800
I talked to both
Democrats and Republicans

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.040
who'll both admit and say
youth voter turnout was up.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.560
But the problem is everybody's
voter turnout was up.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.920
I mean, the problem for
Democrats, in that situation,

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:19.950
was that, as a result,
there was expected

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.920
to be a huge uptick
because of the results

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:25.230
of the school shooting
at Parkland and whatnot,

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.150
and they did not see
that manifest itself

01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:29.864
fully in the general election.

01:10:29.864 --> 01:10:32.280
And Florida, I think, is a
really good case study of that,

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.730
because you have polar
opposite extremes in terms

01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:39.562
of the age electorate there.

01:10:39.562 --> 01:10:42.060
- Thank you.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.560
- Hi.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.960
I'm Julio Ricardo Varela.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:50.230
I'm a journalist and a proud
alumnus of the college of 1990.

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.690
Asma, you mentioned Florida.

01:10:52.690 --> 01:10:56.110
And I'm glad, because I
wanted to know, particularly

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:59.320
from Robert and Aimee--
because the notion

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:03.880
of the multiracial,
multi-ethnic coalition, no one

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:06.830
used Florida as an example.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:10.750
And actually, is
Florida the national--

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.730
are we going to become
Florida as a nation?

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:16.860
And I say that because--

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.960
and I point to your side,
Robert, about the Latina vote.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.950
Black women, totally Democratic.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:30.380
Latina women, 27%
voted for Donald Trump,

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.510
or voted Republican.

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:33.760
And also, if you look
at the numbers in 2016--

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.720
and Florida's the perfect case,
because when you have DeSantis

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.180
telling people that Gillum's
going to turn Florida

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.029
into Venezuela, then you have
one extreme to the other,

01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:45.820
and it kind of speaks
to Sarah's point too.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.240
So I'd love to hear what you
guys think about Florida,

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:52.990
because it kind of goes against
the winning-is-losing type.

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.920
Or what do you think?

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.009
Because it's not so cut and dry.

01:11:56.009 --> 01:11:56.800
So I'm curious to--

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.240
- Can I just give
you a quick summary?

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.740
Just because I
actually specifically

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:02.290
looked at the Florida Latino
population just a couple

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:05.410
of weeks ago, actually, to
answer that specific question.

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.810
And I think that, in Florida,
there were two really

01:12:07.810 --> 01:12:08.800
interesting dynamics.

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.980
One is Rick Scott, who was
running for the Senate seat,

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:14.560
explicitly courted the
Hispanic vote in a way

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.697
that I would argue
other Republicans ought

01:12:16.697 --> 01:12:17.530
to pay attention to.

01:12:17.530 --> 01:12:18.000
It was highly successful.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.900
- And the Puerto Rican
vote in central Florida.

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.400
- Exactly.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.090
He was doing Spanish
language ads.

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:25.130
He taught himself
Spanish through an aide.

01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:26.140
So that was one factor.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:28.270
The other people
pointed me towards

01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:31.720
is that DeSantis, who is now
going to be the governor,

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.210
his running mate
was a very popular

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:37.390
Cuban-American legislator,
and she heavily

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:40.120
focused on upping
that population.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.220
And so as a result,
I think many people

01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:45.550
thought Barack Obama did
pretty well with parts

01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:48.479
of the Cuban population in
Florida that seemed to revert.

01:12:48.479 --> 01:12:50.770
I don't know if revert's the
right-- because who knows?

01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:52.790
Maybe these were
different Cuban voters.

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:54.010
It was an older electorate.

01:12:54.010 --> 01:12:56.020
But I think that that's
a really good question,

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:57.821
because it showed,
to me, inroads

01:12:57.821 --> 01:13:00.070
that Republicans have been
able to make in that state.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.520
But please--

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:01.890
- I'm curious what you
guys have about this.

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:02.390
Thank you.

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:04.120
- Yeah.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.630
I will say-- when you say,
is the country become--

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:09.230
there's no monolith
among Latinos.

01:13:09.230 --> 01:13:11.620
I don't have to tell you that.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.890
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:14.390

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.140
- What the strategists
need to know about what

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.810
motivates Puerto Rican voters--

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:22.150
200,000 additional were
added to the voter rolls

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:24.514
since the hurricane--

01:13:24.514 --> 01:13:26.680
is different from Tejanos,
different from Mexicanos,

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.410
different from people from
Colombia or Central America.

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:30.320
It's different.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:31.720
Dominicans.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:33.850
So there's no monolith.

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:36.520
And before Trump
came along, the GOP

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.760
was actually making some
significant inroads,

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.730
and had funded
programs where we had

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:45.940
people in the center of
the highest population--

01:13:45.940 --> 01:13:48.170
Latinos in Texas,
and in Arizona,

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:49.930
New Mexico, and
California-- where

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:53.470
they were running voter
engagement, because every day,

01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:57.400
in California, 7,000 Latinos
become eligible to vote.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.420
18-year-olds.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.420
It's a number that the GOP, at
one point, was deeply invested

01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:04.480
and speaking to.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.760
And then Trump came along.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.350
And Trump messed up--

01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:09.790
despite what
happened in Florida,

01:14:09.790 --> 01:14:15.790
Trump messed up the GOP plans
to really engage and bring it.

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:20.710
So in Florida specifically,
the GOP has won by 1%.

01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:22.870
1%.

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:26.470
Out of 15 million voters,
it's such a small number.

01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:29.056
And that number,
although Andrew Gillum--

01:14:29.056 --> 01:14:30.430
who's a gubernatorial
candidate--

01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:32.763
wasn't able to overcome that,
the Democrats weren't able

01:14:32.763 --> 01:14:35.380
to overcome that, there
are efforts on the ground--

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.350
I mentioned Andrea Mercado
from an organization

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:40.910
called the New Florida Majority.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:44.620
And that is not a one-and-done
type of organization.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.510
It's a statewide
organization that

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:49.900
continues to build and
outreach among the Latinx

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.250
and black communities.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:53.680
And the gains that
they saw in terms

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.995
of turnout and engagement,
if they're fully funded

01:14:56.995 --> 01:14:59.500
and continue on
this path, you're

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:04.940
going to see even stronger
Latinx turnout come 2020.

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:06.190
- The only thing I would add--

01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:07.231
I agree with all of that.

01:15:07.231 --> 01:15:10.922
And I would just add that
the new American majority--

01:15:10.922 --> 01:15:12.880
as well, I would say
Asian-Americans-- are also

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:16.420
a slightly more complicated
demographic in-group in terms

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:18.460
of its voter preference.

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:21.760
So there are absolutely
important distinctions,

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.930
and differences, and values,
and political leanings

01:15:25.930 --> 01:15:27.610
within that new
American majority

01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.587
that politicians who
are emerging to lead it

01:15:30.587 --> 01:15:32.420
are going to have to
be paying attention to.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.390
So that's-- I think I'm just
reiterating, essentially,

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:35.420
what you said, but.

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.781
- Yeah.

01:15:36.781 --> 01:15:37.280
- Hi.

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.710
My name's David Layman,
member of the general public.

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:40.964
[CHUCKLING]

01:15:40.964 --> 01:15:41.880
- That's a good title.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.290
- No affiliation with Harvard.

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:47.030
So my question is
really a generalization

01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:49.610
of the first questioner's
question, which

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:51.810
is, do you trust the polls?

01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:55.550
All of you have talked about
the changing demographics

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:56.850
of the electorate.

01:15:56.850 --> 01:16:00.470
A footnote on one
of the charts said

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:04.670
based on 600 of likely voters.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:07.430
As it's all changing,
how do the pollsters

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.680
know who the likely voters are?

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:11.690
Because it's changing,
as you speak,

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:13.490
through deliberate
action, and through

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:15.140
the action of the politicians.

01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.235
- We got it all wrong in 2016.

01:16:17.235 --> 01:16:20.550
- Well, everyone's like,
remember when Alexandria

01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:21.361
Ocasio-Cortez won?

01:16:21.361 --> 01:16:21.860
[GASPS]

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.820
What a shock!

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.262
She beat 10-term Crowley.

01:16:24.262 --> 01:16:25.220
It was out of the blue.

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.890
No it wasn't, buddy.

01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:31.040
Because she had a strategy
of expanding the electorate,

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.110
and the pollsters missed it.

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:36.410
And they missed Andrew
Gillum in the primary.

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:41.570
He was the only non-millionaire
in a field of five.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:43.640
And for sure, they
thought he had no chance.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.985
Black guy who's
mayor of Tallahassee

01:16:46.985 --> 01:16:48.110
trying to run for governor.

01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:50.000
No way he's getting
through the primary.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.124
And then when he was
successful, they were shocked.

01:16:52.124 --> 01:16:53.640
Pollsters had no idea.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.000
So what the pollsters
we work with,

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.500
like Celinda Lake and PPP--

01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.450
these are Democratic
Party pollsters--

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:02.750
they have to change
their strategy

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:07.040
to be able to figure out
what's really going on.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.890
If they're doing
calling, for example--

01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:11.960
people don't have home phones.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.180
Just the methodology
in that in order

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.700
to figure out what voters
think has to change.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:21.530
And that five-out-of-five-- what
they call the regular voters--

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:24.050
they're going to have to
expand who they ask for.

01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:26.112
These are eligible,
maybe registered.

01:17:26.112 --> 01:17:28.070
Maybe they've never voted
for president before.

01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:30.150
They need to ask
that person too.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:33.770
And in particular races,
and districts and states,

01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:37.070
they need to prioritize,
particularly what

01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:39.410
women of color are doing
on the Democratic side,

01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:42.740
because that's an indicator
of how, in the primaries,

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.350
things will go.

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:46.760
- I'm going to jump in
on this one too, since--

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:50.151
I study public opinion, so I
use polling data quite a bit.

01:17:50.151 --> 01:17:51.650
But I think it's
safe to say there's

01:17:51.650 --> 01:17:55.280
a vast over-reliance on
polls as a measure of what

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.840
public opinion is.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.530
And it's our best-known
way of capturing

01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:03.620
what a broad population
thinks at a moment in time.

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.530
But I think 2016--

01:18:06.530 --> 01:18:08.450
I don't think it was as
much of a wake-up call

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:11.720
as it should have been, but
it was a wake-up call to say,

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.430
public opinion is
complex, and there's

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:15.650
a lot that's going on
that we don't understand,

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:19.458
and our current methods
aren't adequate for the task.

01:18:19.458 --> 01:18:20.850
- Thank you very much.

01:18:23.531 --> 01:18:24.030
- Hi.

01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:25.700
Tom [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.490
You seem to have looked at this
from every perspective except

01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:30.260
the president's.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.410
When you look at Obama's
first midterm in 2010,

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:36.320
Democrats lost 63 seats,
which is about 40%

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:38.270
more than Republicans lost.

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:41.270
They also lost six Senate seats,
while the Republicans actually

01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:42.630
had a net gain.

01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:44.900
We also saw that when
the president personally

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.390
campaigned for candidates,
such as was mentioned--

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:50.840
Marsha Blackburn and
Hyde-Smith, as well as for Kemp,

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.890
and DeSantis, and Hawley,
and Braun, and many others--

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:55.830
they did quite well.

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:58.700
So the president's still a
very powerful campaigner.

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:04.610
We've also, of course, seen that
there were other factors that

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:07.610
came into this, such as the
Kavanaugh hearings, that

01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:11.210
mobilized the base of
the Republican Party.

01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:14.000
And it looks like
the president still

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.534
has a lot of cause for optimism,
because the Democrats also--

01:19:18.534 --> 01:19:20.075
even though they
lost the House, this

01:19:20.075 --> 01:19:21.491
is going to be a
ready-made excuse

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:24.250
to explain why his
agenda won't pass,

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.750
whereas he had a harder time
explaining when they controlled

01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:29.330
both houses of the Congress.

01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:31.800
So the president still has
a lot of cause for optimism,

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.300
doesn't he?

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:32.690
- Yeah.

01:19:32.690 --> 01:19:33.850
I think that was
Sarah's point, right?

01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:34.683
- That was my point.

01:19:34.683 --> 01:19:35.630
- Yeah.

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:36.425
Thank you, though.

01:19:36.425 --> 01:19:38.450
- Yes.

01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:38.950
- Hi.

01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:43.420
My name's Monty Allen, and
I go to things like this

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:45.010
as much as I can,
and I have to say,

01:19:45.010 --> 01:19:47.890
this has been a really,
really good one.

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:49.407
Thank you all for that.

01:19:49.407 --> 01:19:49.990
- I like that.

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:51.349
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:51.349 --> 01:19:53.620
I like that comment.

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:57.040
- I really care about
what happens in 2020.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:00.760
And I want the Democrats
to just prevail.

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.300
And so what's been
really insightful to me--

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.090
and I thank you for
presenting it-- is identifying

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:09.820
constituencies where
it's strategically

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:14.140
really wise for Democratic
candidates to invest.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:16.520
Expanding the electorate.

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:23.900
I was heartened by the vote
in Florida that expanded

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:26.045
the vote to former-- to felons.

01:20:28.705 --> 01:20:30.730
And obviously, there's
some constituencies

01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:32.820
where there's no point.

01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:36.410
It would be a fool's errand
to try to change their minds.

01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:37.840
But I think there's a large--

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.372
I'm particularly interested
in the work that you're doing,

01:20:40.372 --> 01:20:41.830
Dr. Cramer, because
I think there's

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:47.830
a large part of our society
who have been left behind

01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:52.180
by the evolutionary
trajectory of our economy.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:56.140
And along with it is identity
things, as you mentioned.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:01.690
And it's a loss of
sense of your status

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.380
in our society,
your personal honor,

01:21:05.380 --> 01:21:09.430
apart from or in addition
to your economic struggles

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:12.520
that go along with
those economic trends.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:18.700
So I think the listening
project that you're initiating

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:24.610
is maybe the key to
helping Democrats

01:21:24.610 --> 01:21:33.730
know how to identify and address
the issues that resulted in--

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:37.400
- Can I just ask
just real quick?

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.300
Sorry, do you have a question?

01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.640
Just because you have
like 30 seconds--

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:39.812
- Yeah.

01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:40.312
OK.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:42.119
Well, Staten is a
really great case,

01:21:42.119 --> 01:21:43.410
because it used to be Democrat.

01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:44.800
It used to be
really progressive,

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.690
and now it has
gone the other way.

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:50.860
So what do you
think you can learn

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:54.640
that would be good counsel
for Democrats addressing

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.352
that population?

01:21:56.352 --> 01:21:59.490
- Well, we're hoping
that the project helps

01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:02.850
politicians of all
stripes better understand

01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:04.350
the people that they represent.

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:08.320
Because one thing-- probably
goes without saying,

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:11.634
but politicians these days
spend so much time raising money

01:22:11.634 --> 01:22:13.800
that they actually don't
have the luxury of inviting

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:17.680
themselves into conversations
in gas stations, like I do,

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.110
which is a real shame.

01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:23.430
So we're hoping that it
lends insights to politicians

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:27.121
of a variety of parties.

01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:27.620
- Great.

01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.375
Thank you.

01:22:28.375 --> 01:22:29.750
I know we're
running out of time,

01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:31.833
but why don't we take just
this one last question?

01:22:31.833 --> 01:22:32.690
I apologize.

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:34.040
- I'm Lewis [INAUDIBLE].

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:36.560
My question goes to economics.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.840
The last two
election cycles have

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.950
occurred during a period of
expansion in the economy.

01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:45.230
Not all people have
participated in that.

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:46.950
That led to resentment.

01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:48.770
It's increasingly
likely we're going

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:52.640
to see a major economic
disruption in the next two

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.880
years.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.760
The closing of
General Motors plants

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:59.780
are just the first two steps in
a radical change in our economy

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.940
that will occur.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:07.160
What impact do you think this
probable economic downturn

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.950
is going to have on
the next election,

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:13.280
since the last two
elections were fought,

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:16.590
whatever people said in
an expanding economy,

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:20.171
and that's highly
unlikely for 2020?

01:23:20.171 --> 01:23:21.630
- It's hard to know.

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:24.040
People are talking about
a recession in two years,

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.820
but when will people
start feeling that?

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.350
So I think that it's important--

01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.850
- Yeah.

01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:30.660
And not to cut you off--

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:31.368
- No, no, no, go.

01:23:31.368 --> 01:23:36.360
- I think there are a lot of
people who work full-time who

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.400
are still poor.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:45.930
And that sense of
not being heard,

01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:48.120
that's why I think
there's such momentum

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.310
around a $15 minimum wage.

01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:54.300
Even a lot of Democrats
have rejected that notion

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.890
as too crazy.

01:23:55.890 --> 01:24:00.840
And now, that is part of the
broad-based platform that's

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:04.140
accepted that minimum wage
won't destroy economy,

01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:06.360
but will help people
who work, as part

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.500
of this near-full employment,
to be able to support themselves

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.300
and their families.

01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:14.430
I think that that's
one of the big things.

01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:17.850
We have a candidate I just read
about, last name Yang, who's

01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:21.270
running his presidential
primary campaign

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:24.210
on universal basic income.

01:24:24.210 --> 01:24:28.690
We have a mayor, Michael Tubbs,
in Stockton, California, who

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:32.100
is doing an experimental
pilot project

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:35.160
on universal basic
income to see if that

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.780
could be part of the solution.

01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.880
He's getting big
backing from tech.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:42.960
So I just want to say that we're
going to see all kinds of ideas

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.232
to deal with the economic
problems that we have.

01:24:46.232 --> 01:24:47.940
We're going to see
those manifest in some

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:49.800
of the campaigns coming up.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.670
We'll know everybody that's
in the field in eight weeks.

01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:56.460
Everyone who's
running for president.

01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:58.410
Because we look
back, Barack Obama

01:24:58.410 --> 01:25:01.860
announced January 18 before--

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:03.150
it's coming up.

01:25:03.150 --> 01:25:06.325
And I think the economic
solution, particularly

01:25:06.325 --> 01:25:07.700
around the working
poor, is going

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:10.110
to be one of the
central issues that

01:25:10.110 --> 01:25:13.050
the presidential candidates
on the Democratic side

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:14.810
are going to have to address.

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:18.877
- We have gone over by a
few minutes, so I am-- well,

01:25:18.877 --> 01:25:19.960
I guess-- what do we have?

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.160
Are you the last question?

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.826
Yeah, why don't we
take that real quick?

01:25:22.826 --> 01:25:23.580
- I'm sorry.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.500
I really would love to hear--

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.220
and Katherine actually
commented about the time

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.740
candidates need to
spend fundraising.

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:35.340
My question is Citizens
United and money spent.

01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.050
And I would be curious
to know if there

01:25:37.050 --> 01:25:42.750
was anything significant
about either 2016 and '18,

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:48.414
but compared to prior elections,
and/or special interest money.

01:25:48.414 --> 01:25:50.205
- The elections are
getting more expensive.

01:25:50.205 --> 01:25:51.070
- Yeah.

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.690
[INAUDIBLE]

01:25:51.690 --> 01:25:53.070
- Period.

01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:56.100
- I would read former
Senator Dingell's article

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.510
that came out today.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.970
And he was like, I was in the
Senate longer than everybody,

01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:02.820
so I'm going to tell
you what we need to do.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.070
One was abolish the
Senate, for your reasons.

01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:07.320
Because he says, undemocratic.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.157
You get these little states.

01:26:09.157 --> 01:26:09.990
I'm from California.

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.830
40 million people.

01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:13.290
We only have two senators,
and so does Rhode Island.

01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:14.530
Now, why is that fair?

01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:15.570
So he says that.

01:26:15.570 --> 01:26:21.330
But he also says, publicly
finance every single campaign,

01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:24.780
so that we take money
out so that we bring

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.400
the public back into service.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.750
I like that idea.

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:29.711
It's a good article.

01:26:29.711 --> 01:26:30.210
- Great.

01:26:30.210 --> 01:26:32.430
Thank you so much to
all of our panelists.

01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:35.180
[APPLAUSE]
