00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.140
Before, at the end of the last
video, I actually said that

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.420
we'd talk about measures of
dispersion or how things are

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.400
distributed, but before I go
into that, I realize that I

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.680
have more to talk about,
especially the mean.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.590
And before I do that, I want
to differentiate between a

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.820
sample and a population.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.250
I touched on this a little
bit in the last video.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.630
Let's say I wanted to
know-- I don't know.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.590
Let's say I wanted to know
the average height of all

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.530
men in America, right?

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.600
So let me make the set
of all men in America.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.180
So that's all men in America.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.740
I know there's 300 million
people in the U.S., and half of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.240
them maybe roughly are men,
so this would be 150

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.360
million men, right?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.120
And it would be nearly
impossible, even if I was

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.620
intent on doing it, to actually
measure the average height

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.100
of every man in America.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.770
Frankly, you know, every few
seconds, one of these men is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.490
being born and one of
these men is dying.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.590
So you know by the time I'm
done measuring everything,

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.950
someone would have died, and
some new men would have

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.760
been born, so it would
almost be impossible.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.510
And if not impossible, it would
be very tiresome to measure the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.930
average, or the mean, or the
median, or the mode of this

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.860
entire population, right?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.240
So the best way I can get a
sense of this, because I'm

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.570
interested in what the average
of the population is, maybe I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.040
can take the average
of a sample.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.970
So what I could do is I can go
up to, you know-- and I'd try

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.100
to be pretty random about it.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.370
I don't want to like-- you
know, hopefully, my sample

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.170
wouldn't be my college's
basketball team because that

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.200
would be a skewed sample, but
I'd try to find random people

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.930
and random situations where it
wouldn't be skewed

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.020
based on height.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.860
And I'd maybe collect 10
heights, and I'd get, well,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.080
maybe-- you know, the more
people I get the more

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.360
indicative it is, but if I got
10 heights, and those 10

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.720
heights were-- I don't know.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.080
I'll do it in, you know, 5
feet, 6 feet, 5 and a half

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.090
feet, 5.75 feet, and, well,
let's say I only do 6,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.140
or let's say in 6 and
a half feet, right?

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
Those are the five people that
I'd sample, and we could talk

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.060
more about what's a good way to
generate a random sample from a

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.820
population so it's not skewed
one way or the other.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.150
But anyway, if I wanted to get
a sense of it and if I was kind

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.230
of lazy, so I only took
five measurements, this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.130
is the way I would do it.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.030
This would be a sample.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.360
This would be a sample
of the population.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.960
So instead of taking the mean--
let's say how I wanted to

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.410
calculate the average by
taking the arithmetic mean.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.540
Instead of taking the
arithmetic mean of this entire

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.890
group of 150 million people, I
might just be happy taking the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.390
mean of this sample, and
that'll be called

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.190
the sample mean.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.540
And I want to introduce you to
some notation, even though it's

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.136
kind of-- so in statistics
speak, the mean, this mu, it's

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:57.450
a Greek letter, essentially the
Greek letter that later turns

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.640
into m, but mu is the
population mean, and this is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.150
just a convention
population mean.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.900
And x with a line over it, that
is equal to a sample mean.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.150
And these are just notations
that people might see, and you

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.820
might have been confused
because sometimes you see

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.500
something-- people talk about
means, and you see this mu, and

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.240
sometimes you see this x with a
line over it, and it's nice

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.020
to know the distinction.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.450
Here they're talking about
the mean of a sample of the

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.100
population, and here they're
talking about the mean of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.500
the population as a whole.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.310
Now, the way you calculate
them is essentially the same.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.180
If you want to figure out the
population mean, you'd go to

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.730
all 150 million people at one
moment and add up all their

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.530
heights, and divide by 150
million to get the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.570
population mean.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.580
The sample mean, you just add
up the numbers in your sample

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.570
and divide by the number
of data points you have.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.375
And the formulas I
want to show you.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:03.000
I think you know how to
calculate averages.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.840
It's a fairly straightforward
operation, and I want to show

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.030
you how it's often written in
statistics books, so that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.960
you're not intimidated
when you see it.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.390
The population mean, they'll
write it as-- so just to do,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.900
you know, the convention.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.300
Each member of a-- well, let
me do the sample first.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.500
Each member of a sample, say
this is the first sample.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.430
They'll call that x sub 1.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.890
They'll call this x sub 2.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.580
They'll call this one x
sub 3, x sub 4, and this

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.750
one x sub 5, right?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.370
And this is just a way
of referring to each

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.310
of the samples.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.260
So in a sample mean, they'll
say, do you know what you do?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.350
You take the sum
of these numbers.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.070
And you know how to do that,
but the fancy way of writing

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.400
it is to say, let's
write a capital Sigma.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.730
That means the sum.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.380
Sum of every x sub n, right?

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.970
Take the sum of each of
these numbers, right?

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.450
This is x sub 1, x sub 2, where
n goes from 1 to-- I mean, you

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.160
could say to the size
of the population.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.700
You know, sometimes-- you know,
in this case it would be 5, or

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.900
sometimes they'd write a big--
they'd write an n like that.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.030
And you'd divide it by the
number of members there are

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.110
in that population,
so divided by n.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.920
You know, when you see this in
a book, you're like, wow, this

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.480
is advanced mathematics.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.540
But essentially, they're saying
take the sum of all the data

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.940
points, just sum up these
numbers, and divide by the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.930
number of numbers there are.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.400
So this would just be 5
plus 5 plus 5.5 plus 5.75

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.050
plus 6.5 divided by 5.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.820
That's all this is telling you.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.680
For the population mean,
it's the same thing.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.160
They just use a slightly
different notation.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.060
They'll say that's equal to the
sum from n is equal to 1 to a

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.240
big N-- and I'll explain why
they write a big N-- of each

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.650
data point in the population,
not just the sample, all

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.560
that divided by big N.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.820
And this is just a way of,
when they're at big N,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.140
they mean 150 million.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.960
They mean, you know, we want
you to get every data point

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.380
in the entire population.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.850
So that's what they mean by--
and then divide by the number

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.090
of the entire population.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.620
While the small n, they're kind
of-- it's just the convention,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.350
the notation, that they say,
hey, we just want you to get

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.700
some smaller number, not
the entire population.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.090
But the way you calculate
them is, you know, they're

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.540
essentially equivalent.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.970
Anyway, I wanted to leave you
with that just because this is

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.710
something that if you don't get
it clarified early on-- it's a

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.630
fairly simple concept-- later
on, it becomes very confusing

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.260
when people want to
differentiate between the

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.170
population and the sample mean.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.260
And you see these formulas
written slightly different.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.560
Sometimes you'll see a mu, and
sometimes you'll see an x with

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.610
a line over it for
the sample mean.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.230
Anyway, I'll see in
the next video.
