Matt, can anything good come from a translocation?

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.790
&gt;&gt; Well, translocations are really serious business, but there are a couple of

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.720
known examples where translocations have had

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.500
a net overall positive effect for humans.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.580
&gt;&gt; Well, like what?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.990
&gt;&gt; Well, let's think of our closest primate

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.140
relatives. Humans are primates and our closest relatives

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.520
are chimpanzees. Gorillas and Orangutans. And how many

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.010
pairs of chromosomes do you think they have?

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.770
&gt;&gt; Well I mean if they're our closest relatives, and

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.010
we have 23, I'd assume they had 23 too, right?

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.100
&gt;&gt; Well, you might think that, but you'd be wrong. We humans are the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.440
exception. We have 23 pairs of chromosomes,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.630
and they all have 24 pairs of Chromosomes.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.810
&gt;&gt; Really? They have one more than we do. Why is that?

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.640
&gt;&gt; Well, take a look at this image here.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.990
&gt;&gt; Wow! It looks like our chromosome two doesn't

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.390
exist for chimps. And they also have two smaller ones.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.310
&gt;&gt; That's right. They have two

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.180
smaller chromosomes, whereas we have one larger chromosome. Now, if we

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.800
look at the sequence information, comparing our big chromosome two to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.510
their two smaller chromosomes that we don't have. And we see

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.970
exactly how their sequences line up. Perfectly beside each other, matching.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350
&gt;&gt; It seems so crazy that that could happen and get passed down.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.450
&gt;&gt; Well, remember. It has to happen in the right cell type.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.450
So you tell me. What's the right cell type that matters most in

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.780
passing DNA on to the next generation?
