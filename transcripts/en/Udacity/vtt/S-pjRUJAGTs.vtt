00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.510
One thing that's much easier to interpret from our line plot

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.520
is any trend in the data.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.265
We can see here the short dips in attendance,

00:00:10.265 --> 00:00:16.390
that occur fairly regularly with some period, these might be weekends.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.040
And we see another fairly large drop towards the end of the year.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.320
And while the flu may be apparent in the tabular data due to the sharp and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.380
somewhat extended decline in attendance.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.070
It is much easier to spot with the visual representation of the data.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.250
And other more subtle patterns, such as weekend dips,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.260
may be impossible to notice from the tabular representation alone.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.330
This is due to the fact that is it not dipped to zero or close to zero.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.780
Let's say because there is weekend classes or

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.410
extracurricular activities, and is only apparent when you

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.620
look at the pattern over time of the periodic activity of ups and downs.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.900
Let's say, however,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.210
that I want to know how many students were in school on January 14.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.620
Since we're interesting in simply looking up

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.720
a specific attendance on a specific day,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.530
the table is much easier to understand as we can look to the exact row we need.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.390
And look across to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.900
the single number that represents the attendance for that day.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.580
Often this behavior of drilling down to a specific datum,

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.220
in this case January 14.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.820
Can be incorporated into a visual graphic through animation and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.120
annotation which is actually what Dimple.js,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.790
the library we will use in just a second allows us to do.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.700
But in this example of a static chart is much easier to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.532
look up the attendance for a single day in the table.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:49.120
Rather than have to look at a potentially large and

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.130
nuanced plot of days and go across to attendance.
