00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:14.610
Whenever a movie franchise breaks new ground
in Hollywood, or looks like the next big fad,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.520
rival studios rush to make sure they have
at least one similar property on the way.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.950
But overseas, where copyright laws, and blatantly
ripping off entire movies are a grey area,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.900
a carbon copy can still be successful.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.279
And sometimes, an adaptation can reach heights
– or depths – that the original could

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.130
never have imagined.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.010
We want to hear your comments about these
so make sure you sound off in the comment

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.010
section below!

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.859
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Amazing Movies
You Won’t Believe Were Made.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:42.859
Turkish Captain America

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.339
Sometimes, a movie looking to profit off of
popular superheroes doesn’t care about story

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.690
as much as it does the costumes.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.879
In the 1973 Turkish movie “3 Giant Men,”
Captain America joins forces with the famous

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.559
Mexican hero Santo – and brings his girlfriend
– to take down the evil Spider-Man taking

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.569
over organized crime in the country’s capitol.

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.750
Next to nothing from the comics is adapted
to the movie, with Cap murdering a version

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.530
of the Spider-Man who can’t really be killed.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.420
Marvel obviously wasn’t happy with the film,
but it released across Turkey anyway.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.420
Brazilian Star Wars

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.060
There’s no movie series bigger than Star
Wars, and success means plenty of big screen

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.350
parodies and spoofs.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.670
Spaceballs put a funny twist on the series
in the States, but Brazil came up with its

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.670
own.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.719
“The Tramps in the War of Planets” put
a trio of Brazilian stooges into a galaxy

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.659
far, far away, complete with a golden Darth
Vader and Chewbacca, too.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.820
Unfortunately, there’s a reason most parodies
of Star Wars fall flat, no matter where they’re

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.820
made.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.820
Indonesian Terminator

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.670
The name of this Indonesian knockoff – Lady
Terminator – says it all, but the Terminator

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.460
rip-off made just years after the original
sticks closer to its plot than most dare.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.500
Replace a futuristic robot with a woman possessed
by an angry sea goddess who uses sex to kill

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.260
her victims, and you’ve got a clear picture
of why Lady Terminator is still fun to watch.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.710
The filmmakers clearly loved James Cameron’s
Terminator, recreating entire scenes and action

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.600
sequences, so it’s hard to judge this rip-off
too harshly.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.250
Especially when the movie is so violent, it
makes Terminator seem like a family-friendly

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.720
adventure.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720
Hong Kong Street Fighter

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.890
The official Street Fighter movie isn’t
exactly a successful adaptation, but an unofficial

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.900
Chinese version of the game’s story made
its way to theatres a year before.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.030
Unofficial means that characters like Ken,
Chun-Li and E. Honda were replaced with knockoffs

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.820
Kent, Chun May and Toyota.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.480
If that doesn’t make it clear that “Future
Cops” was a comedy, its story should: the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.080
hero cops travel back in time from the year
2043 to the distant past of 1993 to keep the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.400
movie’s villain from killing a single government
official.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.120
To be fair, the official movie didn’t make
much more sense.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.129
Japanese Spider-Man

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.319
Marvel’s resident web-slinger may be famous
around the world, but that’s probably not

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.409
due to this Japanese movie.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.130
Ditching the Peter Parker story completely,
the series re-cast Spider-Man as a motorcycle

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.730
racer who stumbles onto a crashed spaceship,
and is injected with blood by the last survivor

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.070
of the Planet Spider.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.319
The superhero uses a magic bracelet to shoot
webs and even command his own battle robot,

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.319
the Leopardon.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.879
It’s a silly idea, but when the series ended,
the production company used the giant robot

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.030
idea in the Super Sentai franchise – the
TV show that would eventually be adapted into

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.099
the Power Rangers.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.099
Turkish Batman

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.939
You’d have to be crazy to make a Batman
movie without actually reading a Batman comic,

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:19.939
right?

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.930
For the Turkish rip-off, the Adam West TV
show was the real basis, following two men

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.540
dressed as Batman and Robin – barely – who
punch, kick, and occasionally shoot criminals

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.540
dead.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.490
When the Dark Knight isn’t randomly bedding
women.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.040
Even so, if you asked comic book fans, they
might not all agree that Turkey produced the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.329
WORST Batman movie they’ve ever seen…

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.329
Indian Superman

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.790
The 1988 movie Dariya Dil isn’t too out
of place in Bollywood love stories, and stories

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.720
of family drama – apart from one stunning
musical number.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.069
As the movie’s hero tries to woo a young
woman, the two are inexplicably shown in costume

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.030
as Superman and Spider-Man, recreating the
flight from Richard Donner’s first Superman

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.030
movie.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.390
No explanation for the change is offered,
meaning the superhero costumes and scene make

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.319
no actual sense in the larger story.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.959
But when the clip finally made its way online,
the sequence – and the movie – found a

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.489
larger audience than the filmmakers could
have ever dreamed.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.840
Turkish Star Trek

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.900
If you haven’t noticed already, the laws
against copyright infringement are pretty

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.760
loose in Turkey, which meant that in 1973,
popular comedy character Omer the Tourist

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.910
made a trip into the realm of Spock, Kirk,
and the rest of the USS Enterprise crew.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.740
The movie recreates an episode from the Original
Star Trek series called “The Man Trap,”

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.870
but with a lost Omer replacing the episode’s
salt-hungry alien menace.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.850
It’s a strange choice for a big screen parody,
but the movie managed to beat Star Trek: The

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.860
Motion Picture to movie theaters by six years.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:38.870
Italian Jaws

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.919
If a killer Great White Shark can take the
American box office by storm, why not release

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.639
a movie with the same plot, but an even bigger
shark, and even more victims?

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.889
That was the thinking behind Great White:
The Last Shark, an Italian movie released

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.000
six years after Steven Spielberg’s Jaws.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.610
But the rip-off actually hit American theaters,
grossing $18 million before Universal had

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.110
it banned for ripping off Jaws.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.270
You can’t call the Italian filmmakers cowardly,
though – in some regions, they actually

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.340
advertised the imitation Jaws as a sequel
in the same series.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.780
Indian Nightmare on Elm Street

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.830
In the world of ‘80s slasher movies, A Nightmare
on Elm Street managed to stand out by setting

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.389
its grisly murders in the dreams of teenagers,
an added twist that made Freddy Krueger an

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.610
immortal horror icon.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.030
The Indian rip-off, The Monster, lifted the
entire plot – and the killer’s bladed

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.260
glove – but with an even better twist.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.889
Since the movie was made in the Bollywood
image, its version of Freddy Krueger got to

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.080
take part in a handful of musical numbers.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.880
So in this case, we’ll leave fans to decide
if the rip-off was actually an improvement

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.449
over the original.

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:37.889
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.570
