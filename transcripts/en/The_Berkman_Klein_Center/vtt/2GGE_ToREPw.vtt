00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.680
Copyrights in music
differ from copyrights

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.580
in literary and dramatic
works in several ways.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.610
Perhaps the most important
is that there are

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.640
two different kinds of
copyrights that involve music.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.770
The more traditional of the two are
copyrights in musical compositions.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.690
As you can see, section
102 (a), refers to these

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.290
as copyrights in musical works,
including any accompanying words.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.620
These have been around
for a very long time.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.820
The second type, which was added to the
federal copyright statute only in 1972,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.350
consists of copyrights
in sound recordings.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.700
As I mentioned earlier,
in most countries

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.860
legal rights to sound recordings
are known as neighboring rights.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.730
In the United States, however,
they are referred to as copyrights.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.210
The legal rights associated with
these two types of copyrights

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.550
and the complex business models
that capitalize on those rights

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.790
are perhaps best seen
by tracing the life

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.300
history of a typical
piece of popular music.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.340
I'm going to tell this
hypothetical story using a slide.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.040
As you'll soon see, the
narrative is complicated.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.580
Don't be discouraged if not all features
of the story are clear right now.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.180
We'll return to it several times
during this lecture series.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.830
Imagine that I'm a pretty good
composer, but not much of a musician.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.540
I compose a song.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.790
It has a memorable melody and some
conventional sentimental lyrics.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.530
I wrote it down on some sheet music,
so I satisfy the fixation requirement.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.890
I thereby, as you know, acquire
a copyright in my composition.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.720
I could if I wanted retain ownership of
my copyright, but as a typical composer

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.000
I lack the business skills or time
necessary to exploit it effectively.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.700
So instead, as is now customary in the
United States, I sign all of my rights

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.100
to a music publisher.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.310
There are tens of thousands
of these in this country.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.430
From this point forward in
the story, the publisher

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.940
will retain the copyright
and the composition.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.830
In other words, the publisher
will not assign it further.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.500
Rather, the publisher will make
money for itself and for me

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.710
by issuing licenses to a
variety of other organizations--

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.320
in other words, permissions
to engage in activities

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.600
that otherwise would violate copyright.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.110
The most important of
these licenses consist

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.800
of the right to make so-called
mechanical copies of the composition.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.320
Typically such a
mechanical license will be

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.010
issued to a record company, which
is interested in making and selling

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.210
sound recordings of my composition.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.520
The independent rights of the musician
who actually makes that recording we'll

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.030
discuss in a minute.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.170
Back to the narrative, the
publisher could in principle

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.020
enter into such a license with
the record company on its own,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.940
but it's customary in
the United States to use

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.020
the services of an intermediary,
namely the Harry Fox Agency.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.350
If the CD and other products
embodying the recording of my song

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.890
is commercially successful, the
music publisher, who as we saw now

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.340
holds the copyright in it, will begin to
exploit other licensing opportunities.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.260
For example, the publisher will
likely issue a reproduction license

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.500
to one of the four major
sheet music printers

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.890
in the United States, which
will then print and sell

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.120
sheet music, which in turn will be
purchased by amateur guitarists who

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.870
want to learn how to play my song.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.920
If the song is sufficiently popular
and evocative that a movie studio wants

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.060
to include in the soundtrack of a movie,
then the music publisher and the studio

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.200
will negotiate a so-called
synchronization, or sync, license.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.640
If there's demand for my
music in other countries,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.670
the publisher will likely issue a
so-called sub-publishing license

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.560
to a similar publisher in
one or more other countries.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.990
The terms of these several
contracts will vary,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:27.020
but it's typical for the music publisher
to turn over to me half of the license

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.280
revenues it earns from
these various sources,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.680
keeping the remainder,
of course, for itself.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.870
So now let's return to the
musician, the performer,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.750
whose recorded rendition of my
song is crucial to the success

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.400
of my composition.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.900
As I mentioned earlier, the creative
contributions of the performer

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.690
will generate a second independent
copyright in the sound recording.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.450
It's possible that the
performer will have

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.090
to share that copyright
with a sound engineer,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.750
but we'll put that nuance to one side.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.130
As was true of the composer, it
would be possible for the performer

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.400
to retain that copyright, but
at least until quite recently,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.920
it was customary for performers
to enter into so-called recording

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.910
contracts with record companies.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.960
Such recording contracts also have
many complex terms, some of which

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.250
are likely to be onerous which
we'll discuss in a few weeks.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.910
The central term, however,
is straightforward.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.050
The performer assigns his
copyright in the sound recording

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.260
to the record company.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.090
By now I hope the color scheme
of this chart is apparent.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.100
The blue figures represent
artists, the people

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.640
who make creative contributions
to the finished product.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.910
These are the folks who, in
the rhetoric of copyright law,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.560
are commonly referred to as creators.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.610
Red designates an
assignee of a copyright.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:03.570
Purple designates a licensee, and
yellow designates an intermediary.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.400
Arrows signify transfers
of legal rights.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.000
As you can see, the legal position of
the record company is the most complex.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.670
For the reasons I've
sketched, the record companies

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.380
occupy two legal positions-- it's
the assignee of the sound recording

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.370
copyright and one of the licensees
of the musical composition copyright.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.430
That's why it's shown in the
chart as half red and half purple.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.590
We're not done yet, however.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.600
The music publisher, which
to repeat holds the copyright

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.980
in the original composition, enjoys one
additional valuable entitlement, namely

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.610
the exclusive right to
authorize so-called quote,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.270
public performances, end
quote of the composition.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.260
Such performances include playing
the song at a park or a theater

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.960
and more importantly, broadcasts
of recordings of the composition.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.880
If the recording distributed by
the record company is popular,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.560
several companies are likely interested
in making such public performances.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.820
They include radio stations, perhaps
television stations, restaurants

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.670
that play music in the background,
and nowadays webcasters.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.360
The publisher could in principle
negotiate individual licenses

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.430
with these companies, but that would
be time consuming and inefficient.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.590
So instead, the publisher
will almost certainly

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.870
use an intermediary to manage
its public performance rights.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.100
In most countries there's only one such
intermediary, but in the United States

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.400
there happen to be three.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.500
They are known as BMI, ASCAP, and SESAC.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.940
They're called Performing
Rights Organizations, or PROs.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:52.310
Whichever PRO the publisher selects
will issue so-called blanket licenses

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.770
to all of the companies
that I mentioned earlier.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.020
The reason these are
called blanket licenses

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.880
is that instead of paying a
small fee for each song it plays,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.130
the licensee pays a flat fee--
typically a small percentage

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.380
of its gross revenues-- to perform
any of the compositions in the PRO's

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.450
repertoire.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.680
The PRO then pays to the
music publisher a slice

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.650
of the total amount
of the license fees it

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:21.150
collects, a slice roughly
proportional to the relative frequency

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:24.000
with which my song is played.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.240
And the publisher in turn
gives half of that slice to me.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.940
The net result-- the
more popular a song,

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.210
the more money flows to the
publisher and to the composer.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.530
Notice again the color scheme.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.750
Yellow indicates an intermediary.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.060
Purple indicates a licensee.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.980
Do the radio and television
stations, restaurants, and webcasters

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.470
shown in the lower
left of this chart have

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.920
to pay license fees not just to
the music publisher at the top

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.150
but also to the record
company in the bottom right?

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.040
In most countries, the
answer would be yes.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.210
After all a radio station
when it plays a song

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.120
is performing not just the
composition whose copyright

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.250
is held by the publisher, but also the
recording of a particular rendition

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.600
of the song whose copyright, otherwise
known as a neighboring right,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.919
is owned by the record company.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.960
It would seem to make
sense for the radio station

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.920
to pay both copyright owners,
and in most countries it must.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.410
Nevertheless, in the United
States radio stations

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.810
engaged in traditional analog
broadcasting do not make such payments.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.720
The reason is that in the
United States, the owner

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.360
of a copyright in the sound recording,
unlike the owners of copyrights

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.860
in other sorts of works, does
not enjoy an exclusive right

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.390
of public performance.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.870
You'll recall, I hope, that I discussed
this unusual feature of US law

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.595
briefly in lecture number
one and the tensions

00:09:52.595 --> 00:09:56.040
it creates between the United States
and the member countries of the Rome

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.370
Convention.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.610
The principal reason for
the anomalous position

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.120
of the United States on this
issue is that in 1972, when

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.050
sound recordings were first given
federal copyright protection,

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.420
broadcasters in the United States
had considerable lobbying power,

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.620
and they successfully blocked
adoption of a public performance right

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.210
for sound recordings.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:23.960
That political explanation is buttressed
by a plausible policy argument.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.880
The broadcasters argue
that they shouldn't

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.950
have to pay license fees
to the record companies

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:34.310
because they argue broadcast of songs
help the record companies by bringing

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.780
those songs to the attention of
potential purchasers of records, CDs,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.510
and so forth.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.420
In other words, the promotional
benefit of broadcast

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.640
substitutes for a license fee.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.480
Record companies not
surprisingly disagree.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.300
In 1996 and 1998, the
record companies succeeded

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:58.650
in obtaining from Congress a partial
modification of this longstanding rule,

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.640
specifically by securing an amendment
to the copyright statute that gave them

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.060
public performance rights
for their sound recordings.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.880
However, that amendment
was limited to performances

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:14.150
that occurred in the form of
a digital audio transmission.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:18.270
The upshot is that today, when
webcasters perform recorded music

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.900
digitally over the internet they
must pay license fees to the record

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.540
companies.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.540
How those license fees are calculated
we'll discuss in lecture number eight.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:32.150
For the time being, you need to know
only that this legal relationship is

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:38.550
managed by yet another intermediary,
the organization SoundExchange.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.190
Record companies have not been satisfied
by this adjustment to the statute.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.300
They want full-blown
public performance rights,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.710
which would enable them to
charge traditional radio

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:54.760
stations, large restaurants, and so
forth who make use of their recordings.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.080
Congressmen sympathetic
to their position

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.754
periodically introduce bills that
if adopted would have that effect.

00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:05.420
The name of the most recent version
of this proposed legislation

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.680
is the Performance Rights Act.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.760
Shown on your screen
is the press release

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.340
by the trade association of the
recording companies welcoming

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.637
the introduction of this legislation.

00:12:17.637 --> 00:12:20.720
Notice the reference to the difference
between the situation in the United

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.820
States and the situation
in most countries.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.830
The broadcasters, for their
part, continue to push back.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.810
Set forth on screen is their
own summary of their stance.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:37.240
Notice that they continue to emphasize
the quote, free promotion, that they're

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.300
providing record companies.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.710
And notice also their
strategic characterization

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.710
of the proposed legislation as a tax.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.285
Finally, you'll see that they too have
a group of sympathetic congressmen.

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:55.980
For better or worse, this is
a reasonably good illustration

00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:00.120
of the way in which lobbying
over copyright typically works.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.070
For more details concerning
the still ongoing negotiation

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.700
over this particular
issue, follow the link

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.860
shown on the left-hand
side of these two slides.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.930
So that in brief is the pattern of
legal rights in the US recorded music

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.730
industry.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:22.920
The arrows, as I've indicated, show
transfers of legal entitlements.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.560
For the most part, money flows between
organizations through the channels

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.520
cut by the legal rights,
with one exception.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:34.680
For a long time, record companies
have paid radio stations

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.230
significant amounts of
money, known informally

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.730
as paola, to induce them to
play the record company's

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.870
recordings over the airwaves,
lending credence to the broadcasters'

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.990
contention that radio play serves
as an effective form of advertising.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:56.540
At its peak, roughly $100 million
a year flow through this channel.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.470
Legal impediments to such payments have
been slowly increasing for decades,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.560
and enforcement of those legal
impediments has also been increasing.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.320
For a while, record companies
evaded these tightening rules

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:13.340
by using third-party intermediaries,
known confusingly as indies,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.800
to make their payments, but
this loophole is also shrinking.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.500
Today much

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.400
less money is flowing
through this channel

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.880
than was true 40 or even
10 years ago, but the river

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.790
has not dried up completely.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.469
One final dimension that this legal
and financial system merits emphasis.

00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:33.260
I mentioned earlier
that the most important

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.370
of the licenses issued
by the music publisher

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.370
is the so-called mechanical license
that it grants to the record company.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.920
Suppose, to return to our story,
that the first commercial recording

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.790
of my song proved so popular
that a second musician affiliated

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:54.160
with a different record company
wants to do a cover of the song,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.260
meaning a new rendition of it.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.850
Does the second record company have to
obtain a separate mechanical license

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:02.090
from the publisher?

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.930
The answer is, you might suppose, yes.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.080
However, the second
record company is not

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.640
obliged to negotiate a voluntary
license with a music publisher.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.300
Rather, so long as the second record
company pays a modest fee just set

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.800
by the government, it's free to
make and distribute a new recording,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.630
and neither I nor the
music publisher can object.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.590
Currently that fee is about $0.09 per
copy sold of the new recording, more

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.490
it's a long song.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.960
Separate fees apply to ringtones and
recordings delivered to customers

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.360
through interactive streaming.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.210
This is the first example we've
seen in this series of lectures

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.750
of a so-called quote,
compulsory license.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.820
We'll see several more
in future lectures.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.070
Not surprisingly, the central
feature of a compulsory license

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.750
is that the copyright owner
is compelled to issue it.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:59.660
It has no choice but to accept
the governmentally set fee.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.520
Typically that fee is
lower than the amount

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.130
the owner would demand if
the license were voluntary.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:09.560
Equally important, a compulsory
license deprives the copyright owner

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.700
of creative control.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.720
Suppose, for example, that I or the
music publisher acting on my behalf

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.080
don't like the second
sound recording artist

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.050
and think he will butcher my song.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.570
As a result, I'd prefer not to
grant him a license of any sort.

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.765
Nevertheless, neither I nor
the publisher can refuse.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.700
To be sure, the statutory
provision that creates

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.150
this rule contains a few
limitations, one of which

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.420
is that the second recording
artist may not quote,

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:47.010
change the basic melody or fundamental
character of the work, close quote.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.287
But that restriction is
construed very leniently.

00:16:50.287 --> 00:16:52.370
Here's an example that
illustrates the application

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.360
of this rule and its cultural impact.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.370
In 1967, Jimi Hendrix composed
the song "Little Wing."

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:03.530
He and his group, The
Jimi Hendrix Experience,

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:09.060
recorded the song on their
1967 album, Axis: Bold as Love.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.490
In terms of our diagram, Hendrix
occupied both of the blue zones

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.020
because he was both the composer
and the performer of the song.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.520
This is reasonably common in rock music.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:25.770
Compositions that fit this pattern
are known as controlled compositions.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.580
The contracts typically used
to handle them differ modestly

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.570
from the contracts we've
discussed thus far,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.250
but not in ways that merit
our attention right now.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.550
I'm going to play the famous opening
segment of Hendrix's composition,

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:42.750
so listen carefully.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.595
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:18:18.176 --> 00:18:25.245
(SINGING) Well she's
walking through the clouds

00:18:25.245 --> 00:18:30.978
with a circus mind that's running wild.

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:32.730
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.810
This song has inspired
generations of musicians.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.340
A few of the many
commercially distributed

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.130
covers are shown on the
slide on your screen.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.080
Some of these covers could fairly be
described as faithful adaptations that

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.870
preserved the essential
character of Hendrix's original.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.390
An example might be the version
by Santana and Joe Cocker.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.980
Here it is.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:00.210
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:07.290
(SINGING) Well she's
walking through the clouds

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:13.107
with a circus mind that's running wild.

00:19:13.107 --> 00:19:14.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.770
Hendrix himself might
also have been pleased

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:19.450
by the extraordinary instrumental
recording of the song

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:24.780
by Stevie Ray Vaughan, one of the few
guitarists better than Hendrix himself.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.120
So if you don't know the
recording, pay close attention

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.300
because this is one of the
best guitar solos of all time.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.000
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.140
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.180
Not all covers come as close
to Hendrix's original vision.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.900
Some would likely have
set his teeth on edge.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.960
Examples include Laurence
Juber's acoustic rendition,

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:30.440
which is technically very impressive
but suburban or new age in mood,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.510
or The Corrs' pop rendition.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.842
Here's a slice of the latter.

00:20:35.842 --> 00:20:38.728
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:52.866
(SINGING) Now she's walking through
the clouds with a circus mind

00:20:52.866 --> 00:20:54.190
that's running wild.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:04.500
Butterflies and zebras,
moonbeams and fairy tales.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.802
All she ever thinks about
is riding with the wind.

00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:15.590
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:18.440
I hope you'll recall
from the last lecture

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.290
our discussion of the powerful bond that
many artists feel with their creations.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.760
That bond, you'll remember,
prompted the sculptor Michael Snow

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.890
to object when ribbons were
hung on the necks of his geese

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.390
and underlay Gary
Larson's plea to his fans

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.780
not to use his cartoons
in their websites.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:40.110
The law, as we saw, often comes
to the aid of such artists,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.620
particularly in countries that recognize
strong versions of moral rights.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:51.040
By contrast, the law, and consequently
the culture, of the music industry

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.260
is radically different.

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.630
Composers know that once they have
authorized the commercial distribution

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.410
of one recording of
their composition they

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:04.380
could no longer enjoy
what in moral-rights terms

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.750
is referred to as a right of integrity.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.910
In other words, they can't
prevent other musicians

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:13.740
from altering their creations by making
and distributing covers, some of which

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.530
will be very different from the
versions the composers had in mind.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.520
Nor may the first
recording artist object

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.300
when a second recording
artist makes a cover.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.440
Interestingly neither
composers nor performers

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.820
seem especially troubled
by this prospect.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:35.270
And the legal privilege of making covers
has an important cultural benefit.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:41.150
Each generation of musicians can test
their skills, can show their chops,

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.430
by attempting their
own recorded renditions

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.990
of the classic works
of their predecessors.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.700
Now to be sure, they have to pay a
modest fee when they sell recordings

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.415
of their adaptations, but they
don't have to ask permission.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.930
Does this seemingly
fundamental difference

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:02.550
between music on the one
hand and other fields of art

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:07.020
reflect differences in the nature of
the cultural products in question?

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.630
For example, the fact
that most sculptures

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:15.890
are unique, whereas sound recordings
can be replicated indefinitely.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.830
Alternatively, have the
feelings and expectations

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:22.220
of composers and musicians
evolved in response

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.790
to the relatively unprotective rules
that govern-- at least in the US music

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.640
industry.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.360
These are hard questions,
and I don't know the answers.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.130
The answers matter.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.160
For example, if the first
explanation is right,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.160
we should probably
reexamine the contention

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.534
of the directors of
black-and-white classic movies

00:23:42.534 --> 00:23:44.450
that they should be able
to block colorization

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:48.560
of their masterpieces, a contention
that some countries, not including

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.430
the United States, currently respect.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.700
By contrast, if the second
explanation is right,

00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.790
we may need to reconsider just how
deep are the psychic bonds celebrated

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.820
by the personality theory of copyright.
