a three in the first one then I thought
 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.279
a three in the first one then I thought
there was like a four in the next one uh

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289
there was like a four in the next one uh
 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:43.900
there was like a four in the next one uh
uh and and then there's like two

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910
uh and and then there's like two
 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.700

time machine I thought maybe the numbers

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080
time machine I thought maybe the numbers
 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.290
time machine I thought maybe the numbers
are not connected there but I like I

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300

okay so this time I was like actually

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419
okay so this time I was like actually
 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.600
okay so this time I was like actually
paying paying attention like yeah yeah I

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610
paying paying attention like yeah yeah I
 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.940
paying paying attention like yeah yeah I
was missing half the jokes because I was

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950
was missing half the jokes because I was
 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.959
was missing half the jokes because I was
paying attention

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969
paying attention
 

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.669
paying attention
and this is of course the one where they

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:36.679
