Do you think
Santa Claus is happy?

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.080

I mean,
maybe he started out happy,

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.022

joy to the world,

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.524

But after he went down
enough chimneys,

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.162
he found out
not everyone likes Christmas,

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:07.066
that some people are
Jewish or Democrats,

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:11.471

shouldn't be about gifts.

at the North Pole,

he underpays and doesn't trust,

if Christmas is good or bad.
