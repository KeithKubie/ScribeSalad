00:00:01.157 --> 00:00:03.240
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
all for stopping by today,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.780
and we have an exciting
talk at Google.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.960
We have Phil Terry, the founder
and CEO of Collaborative Gain.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.700
He runs the Councils, which
is a collaborative network

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.935
of senior digital leaders.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.605
Phil has written
about collaboration

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.980
and the power of asking for
help in the "Harvard Business

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.700
Review" and recently published
the book "Customers Included,"

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.410
which he is here to
talk to us about.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.970
The book details
his 15 years as CEO

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.910
of Creative Good, a
pioneering customer experience

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.670
consultancy, and so he's helped
hundreds of senior leaders

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.920
help each other run better,
more innovative, more

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.980
customer-inclusive companies.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.280
And so he also sits
on the board of Mind

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.010
The Product, which is a global
community of digital product

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.450
leaders, startups
like StellaService

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.910
and universities like the
Harvard Business School's Rock

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.760
Center for Entrepreneurship and
the USC Institute of Innovation

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.240
and Startup Garage.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.620
So with that, please join me
in welcoming Phil to Google.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.820
Thank you.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.739
PHIL TERRY: Thank you.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:58.239
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.185
Whoo.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:00.466
It's great to be here.

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:01.340
Thank you for coming.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.590
Thank you, everyone
on Google Hangouts

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.637
and watching later on YouTube.

00:01:07.637 --> 00:01:09.220
I was thinking today,
when I got here,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.020
I haven't been here
actually since 2002.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.630
It's a little bit changed.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.830
[CHUCKLES]

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.796
Marissa Mayer brought me in.

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:21.310
In the early days, she
was a founding member

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.630
of these Councils
that we run here

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.650
at Collaborative Gain, which--
as Bradley Horowitz, who's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.720
our host today-- said it
brings together executives

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.280
from around the world who care
about the customer experience

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.220
and who want to really
ask each other for help.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.514
I'm a big fan of
asking for help.

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:42.930
So we're going to talk about
my book "Customers Included."

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.350
I want to walk through some
of the stories from the book.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.110
I think the most
important question

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.810
that we ask in
the book is really

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.640
a simple one and
somewhat obvious,

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.940
which is we are not
the first people

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.730
to say the customer
is important.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.230
Right?

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.600
I really think we can
all agree this is not

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.490
a revolutionary new insight.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.340
Wow.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.280
In fact, I trace the history
of customer experience

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.700
and the recognition
that customers

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.050
need to be the focus of
businesses back to 1954

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.380
when Peter Drucker wrote
his first book "Practice

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.600
of Management," and
so it's a long time.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.370
And many other people, including
some of the key leaders,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.240
of course, here at
Google and many of you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.420
here in the audience, believe
the customer is important.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.280
So we all can agree on that.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.220
But I think we can also agree
that we need to sort of look

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.910
closely at-- if we
agree, that everyone

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.160
knows this is important,
more or less-- why is it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.926
that most companies
don't actually do it?

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:50.920
Right?

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.320
So as customers
and as executives,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.200
we know that in most cases,
most products and services

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.300
are, frankly, not that good.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.820
Right?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.650
They go from bad
to OK, and there's

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.980
only a few incredibly delightful
things that are out there.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.730
So why don't more
companies do it?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.750
And one of the-- the talk will
really try to address that,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.100
but one of things I
want you to keep in mind

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.980
is that knowing it's important
is clearly not enough.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.366
We have to think about habits,
we have to think about actions,

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:24.740
and we have to
think about-- what

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.745
are some of the
barriers and obstacles?

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:29.120
Now, I've been on
this book tour.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.120
I've done about 90
talks in the last year.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.440
I'll be at Apple tomorrow.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.930
I'm sort of doing the Silicon
Valley swing this week,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.230
which is a lot of
fun, and it's really

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.350
been great to be out
at so many companies

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.600
talking about these stories.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.680
But it's also been great to
be interacting with people

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.389
along the way, including flight
attendants and taxi drivers.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.930
And in the last
couple of weeks, I've

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.500
had some conversations that have
had a big impact on me that I

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.540
want to actually share
with you before we

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.190
jump into some of the stories.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.690
OK.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.231
This is one of my taxi
drivers in Boston.

00:04:06.231 --> 00:04:06.730
OK.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.490
So I was there a
couple of weeks ago,

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.251
and it was during the big storm.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:11.750
Right?

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.800
It was 25 inches of snow.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
There was travel banned.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.730
Then the next day,
I got in a cab.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.700
And I asked this gentlemen
how long he'd been driving,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.170
and he said, "Oh, about a year."

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.274
I said, "Oh, that's great.

00:04:21.274 --> 00:04:22.190
What'd you do before?"

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.470
He said, "Well, I owned
several car dealerships."

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.250
I said, "Really?

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.350
Wow.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.625
How did you go from car
dealerships to taxi driver?

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:30.740
I mean, those are usually
profitable businesses,"

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.010
and he said, "Well,
I had a"-- and then

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.630
he told me a personal story.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.860
And he had a heart
attack, and he

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.330
was in a coma for three months.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.910
I'm like, "Oh, wow.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.410
OK."

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.400
So that sort of-- I had to
think about that for minute,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.630
and we talked a little bit about
what that experience was like.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.190
You can imagine.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.636
And then I said,
"Why does that mean

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:52.010
you lost your
businesses, though?

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.540
I'm sure your employees
and even customers

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.960
probably rallied around
you," and he said, "Well,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.460
actually, no.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.350
I had been a greedy
and arrogant owner.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.040
I had mistreated
my employees, and I

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.900
had mistreated my customers."

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.080
"And when I got
sick, they all fled.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.900
And by the time I got
out of the hospital,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.773
my car dealerships
were bankrupt."

00:05:18.773 --> 00:05:21.190
I'm like, "Oh, wow.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.354
Really?"

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:24.020
And this is what--
when he picked me up,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.540
he was one of most
gracious, humble people

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.150
I had met as a taxi driver.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.650
Right?

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.340
And then he went on
to say how grateful he

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.160
is for having had
this experience.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.130
I said, "Really?

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.730
Wow."

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.980
He said, "Well, I'm
closer to my family.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.830
My wife, thank God, didn't
leave me during all those years

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.380
that I was kind of a jerk,
and she hung in there with me

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.890
when I was sick.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.190
I'm closer to my children
and now my grandchildren,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.640
and I'm filled with gratitude."

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.960
And I mean, I-- so I posted this
up on some social media sites,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.120
and the response was
enormous, as you can imagine.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.570
And I just feel
so touched by him.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.510
I feel like I'm here
representing his story.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.550
And among other things,
we have to remember

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.040
that customers are real people.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.800
Employees are real people.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.980
When we kind of move away from
the frameworks and the guiding

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.520
philosophy and
the principles, it

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.806
comes down to real
live human beings.

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:20.580
Right?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.270
Like us.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.420
And it's so important
for us to remember that

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.790
and to remember that, when
we treat our customers well

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.210
and we treat our
employees well, they'll

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.880
give us the benefit
of the doubt.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.020
They'll hang in there with
us when times are tough,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.010
when the economy is bad, or
when we're in the hospital,

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.120
like this guy.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.220
But if we take
advantage of them,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.010
if we don't really listen to
and have empathy for them,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.640
well, we won't have
that margin of safety,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.581
will we, when times get tough?

00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:50.080
All right.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.990
So I just wanted to
share that with you.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.860
It's really had an impact on me.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.770
These two housekeepers.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.410
During the Boston storm
and the travel ban was on,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.940
no one could leave their homes.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.847
I was stuck in my
hotel room, and I

00:07:02.847 --> 00:07:04.680
figured they're not
going to clean the room.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.570
I can handle that.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.070
Right?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.540
And at 1 o' clock, these
two women knock on my door.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.190
I said, "What are you doing?"

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.981
They said, "We're here
to clean your room."

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:14.700
I said, "But how
did you get here?"

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.320
They said, "We walked 30
minutes through the blizzard

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.582
to get here."

00:07:19.582 --> 00:07:21.040
Now, there's two
things about that.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.350
One is I thanked them, and
I said, "That's incredible."

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.060
And I gave them each a very
nice tip, and I said, "Wow.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.560
Thank you.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.500
Thank you."

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.400
And then of course, I thought
I'm not happy, actually,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.020
with the hotel.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.650
The hotel should have
paid them to stay home,

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.660
not to risk life and limb
to come and clean our rooms.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.340
We're customers.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.780
We care about how companies
treat their employees

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.960
as much as we also care
about our own experience.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.570
But I think about
them and I sort of

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.510
think I'm representing
them here today.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.010
Right?

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.050
And I bet they're Google
users, by the way.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.070
Right?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.890
OK.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.390
All right.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.960
So let's shift gears and move
into some of the stories.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.330
And then a couple
weeks ago, I was

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.930
at the pre-IPO roadshow
for Shake Shack.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.800
Anybody here Shake Shack fans?

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.300
Yeah.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.010
Awesome.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.470
That's Randy Garutti,
the CEO of Shake Shack.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.419
And when the analysts
at this kind of-- it

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:19.710
was in Wall Street in New York.

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.260
Right?

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.131
So these are hard, bitten,
cynical, skeptical analysts.

00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:23.630
Right?

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.130
Talking about the
numbers and, well,

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.730
what about In-N-Out Burger
and blah, blah, blah.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.230
And Randy says,
"You know, you might

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.050
think we're in the
hamburger business."

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.309
And we are, of course.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:35.570
We make hamburgers, and we
make great custards and shakes.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.070
Right?

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.190
Some of you have had those.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.850
But he said, "Actually,
the business we're in

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.240
is supporting the development of
the leadership of our employees

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.530
and creating an experience
for our customers.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.600
Yes.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.510
Certainly, we make
good hamburgers,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.230
but it's bigger than that."

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.960
And they went on to
talk in a non-cynical

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.850
and really loving, genuine,
authentic, empathetic way

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.280
about their team and
about their customers.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.290
And I was watching
this analyst group

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.702
in Wall Street who were what?

00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:10.202
Huh?

00:09:10.202 --> 00:09:12.710
What are you talking about?
[MUMBLING] This is not right.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.010
You know, it was like
it did not compute.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.610
Right?

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.190
But they understand that it's
not just about the burgers.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.730
It's about the
overall experience

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.890
and the way they
treat each other

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.970
and the way they treat their
customers at a human level.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.470
Right?

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.600
Real, living,
breathing human people.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.900
OK.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.560
So if you hand me a copy
of the book-- thank you.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.170
So the book came out
in October of 2013,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.570
so just about a year ago,
a little over a year ago.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.510
And we walk through
a number of stories.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:49.640
First, of course,
reminding readers

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.220
that, despite the
fact that everyone

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.030
knows we should
include the customer,

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.640
it actually doesn't
happen very often.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.190
And then trying to
answer the question why?

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.770
Right?

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.360
So let's just do a
couple reminders.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.780
So the first case
study in the book

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.790
is about a government
project that

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.060
was politically contentious.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:14.200
And when it launched, it failed.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.150
So here it is.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.860
The 2006 Border Patrol Project.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.500
OK.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.900
So Congress, in its infinite
wisdom, first of all,

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.100
took 10 years to build
a 2,000-mile fence along

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.610
the border of Mexico.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.980
Do we have any
engineers here today?

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:27.480
Yes?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.110
Right.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.610
OK.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.770
So if I told you, let's
build a 2,000-mile,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.797
your engineering mentality
would tell me what?

00:10:33.797 --> 00:10:34.672
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:34.672 --> 00:10:36.330
PHIL TERRY: [CHUCKLES] What?

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:36.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:38.770
If you can build it,
how do you maintain it?

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.310
So then they said, OK.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:41.510
This isn't working.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.130
And then Boeing raised their
hand, and said, oh, hire us.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:44.850
Hire us.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.670
We'll build an electronic fence.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.110
You know, we'll use
that technology stuff.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.200
You know, that cool internet
stuff and, you know,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.050
digital stuff, and
it'll be great.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.340
And so they built it,
and of course, it failed.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.140
All right.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.680
They fired the administrator
from the Homeland Security

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.960
Department who was in
charge of the project.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.890
And they brought a new one on,
and the poor guy's first job

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:16.480
was to go out on PBS and
explain what had just happened.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.290
OK.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:22.500
So the interviewer on PBS
says, oh, wait a minute.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.420
You mean to tell me that
you built this whole thing

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.410
for the Border Patrol?

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:33.070
So Kroft says, you built a
multi-billion dollar project

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.439
for the Border Patrol,
and-- wait a minute.

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:36.980
You didn't ask the
Border-- you never

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.930
spent any time with
the Border Patrol

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.940
to figure out what they
might need or want?

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.672
That seems like a mistake,
and he's like, oh, yeah.

00:11:43.672 --> 00:11:45.590
That was a huge mistake.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.810
So literally, many, many
companies and organizations

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.960
literally don't spend a
moment with their customer.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.300
Even today, even though
we all know we should.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.810
Right?

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.030
Dramatically unbelievable.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.370
Border Patrol.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.890
Let's move to Africa.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.890
So there was an innovator
who wanted to do something

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:07.980
about the water access
crisis in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.480
Right?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.810
This is an important issue.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:10.460
Right?

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.190
So in many parts of rural
and semi-rural sub-Saharan

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.490
Africa, women and
girls-- and it's

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.850
almost always women and girls--
will walk a mile or two a day

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:22.533
to fetch water for cooking,
cleaning, and drinking.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.240
Right?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.880
So I think we can
all agree this is

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.780
problematic on a
number of dimensions.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.650
Right?

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:31.720
So this innovator said
let's do something about it.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.570
Let's build a play pump.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.280
OK?

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.105
So we'll create a
merry-go-round--

00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:39.180
this is a good idea,
it sounds like anyway.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.870
Merry-go-round that
the kids will play on.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.390
Right?

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.690
And this is helpful
because we don't

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.450
have electricity in
many of these areas.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:50.820
So we'll use the action of
the merry-go-round essentially

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.110
to be a pump that'll
pump water from further

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.490
away and up into
this water tower.

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.290
OK?

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.661
Around the water
tower, we'll put ads.

00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:00.160
All right.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.890
The ads will help us
pay for this system.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:05.410
And then we'll just
put a spigot nearby,

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.680
and we'll use gravity to
bring the water back down.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.540
OK.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.010
So it sounds good.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.929
So he goes to the
Bush administration,

00:13:11.929 --> 00:13:12.720
and they say great.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.690
And they write a check.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.830
He goes to the Clinton Global
Initiative, and they say great.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.720
We'll write a check.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.220
All right.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.225
So can you imagine
your next product here

00:13:20.225 --> 00:13:24.150
at Google you get Clinton,
you get Bush, and then Jay-Z?

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.520
Jay-Z says great.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.770
I'll through a
launching party for you

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.030
at Madison Square Garden.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.690
Right?

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.750
Fantastic.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.334
Then venture capitalists,
like Steve Case, pile on.

00:13:33.334 --> 00:13:34.000
The whole thing.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.350
Right?

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.840
So you kind of get the idea of
probably where I'm going here.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.690
So what happened?

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.330
They went out.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.690
They installed this in
some of these communities

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.570
in sub-Saharan Africa,
and it turns out

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.055
that it took water out
of these communities.

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:49.220
It didn't bring water in.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:49.980
What?

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.150
And the Swiss
Resource Center did

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.147
an analysis of what happened.

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:54.730
What happened?

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.980
They said oh.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.580
They literally spent no
time in these communities

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.590
to understand how
these people lived

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.780
or what might work or not.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.320
Right?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.880
So first of all, how
many of you grew up

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.494
playing on a merry-go-round?

00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:08.285
Let me just get it.

00:14:08.285 --> 00:14:09.118
Oh, almost everyone.

00:14:09.118 --> 00:14:10.700
Right?

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.960
So that was a part
of our culture.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:13.740
Right?

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.290
But it was not
part of the culture

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.590
in many of these communities.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.390
So for example, when the donors
and their camera crews left,

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.500
the kids they stopped playing
on the merry-go-round.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.860
They complained it
made them dizzy.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.900
Well, that's the point.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.400
Right?

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.530
You want to get dizzy, but
that wasn't their thing.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:30.390
OK.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.010
So the pumping action's gone.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:32.620
Right?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.456
Now, advertisers.

00:14:35.456 --> 00:14:37.520
Do you think they showed up?

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.020
No.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.920
You know a little
bit about ad sales.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:40.636
Right?

00:14:40.636 --> 00:14:42.420
[LAUGHS]

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.300
That was as hard to figure
out as the 2,000-mile fence.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:45.800
Right?

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.530
OK.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.230
So advertisers didn't show up.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.070
When it was working, it
was five times slower

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.860
than the old Afridev
hand pump that

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.170
was designed in 1934 with a
lot of community consultation.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.920
Right?

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.610
And worst of all,
when they installed,

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.780
they installed it over
the only existing borehole

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.550
that these villages had.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:08.400
So when it broke down, they
literally had no water.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.510
OK?

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:10.730
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.440
Right?

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.290
Now, interestingly, what did
Steve Case say about this?

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.510
Did he say wow.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.960
We forgot to include
the customer.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.851
We all know what
the issue is here.

00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:26.350
No.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.460
He said something
quite different,

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.418
and it's worth reflecting
on this for a moment.

00:15:29.418 --> 00:15:31.220
He said the following thing.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:36.520
You said, you know, "It's just
the very nature of innovation."

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.380
You try something.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.120
Some things work.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:38.869
Some things don't.

00:15:38.869 --> 00:15:40.590
You throw, it up
against the wall.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.560
Right?

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.010
Now, I'm here to
tell you-- and I

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.060
think you believe this
already-- it's not

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.240
the very nature of innovation.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.030
This is one way to do it.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.212
And let's just be clear
for a moment about the math

00:15:51.212 --> 00:15:52.420
that venture capitalists use.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.920
Right?

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.830
And it's a different
math than we

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:56.910
should be using in
our own companies

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.660
and when we're designing things
like play pumps for water

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.672
access in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:16:02.672 --> 00:16:04.880
So when you're a venture
capitalist, the way it works

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.296
is you make a bunch
of investments

00:16:06.296 --> 00:16:08.170
and you only need one
of them to go well.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:08.720
Right?

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.840
And that typically
makes enough money

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.010
for you and your
limited partners.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:16.620
So it turns out, if you make
10 investments as a venture

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.840
capitalist and you want
one of them to work,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.870
you only need each investment
to have about a 40% chance

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.530
or probability of success
before your investment.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.960
So you basically say, oh, look.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.700
That's got a 40%
chance of success.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.200
OK.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.980
I'll invest there.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.700
40%?

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.390
There, there.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.241
You do that 10 times, you're
almost guaranteed one of them

00:16:37.241 --> 00:16:37.740
will work.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.050
You don't know which, but
one of them will work.

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.800
Now, can you imagine here going
to your boss and saying, OK.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.640
Let's spend several million
dollars for this new marketing

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.490
initiative or this new
product here at Google,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.530
and it's got a 40%
chance of success?

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.030
No.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.840
We need to use a
different kind of math.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.600
Right?

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.190
And there's never 100%
chance of success in anything

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:01.600
that we do, of course,
including not doing anything.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.119
There's always a risk with that.

00:17:04.119 --> 00:17:07.950
But these unforced
errors where we're simply

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.680
leaving the customer out
of the equation completely,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.471
let's do away with those.

00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:12.970
OK?

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:14.530
Can we agree?

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.280
OK.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.920
Now, let's switch to the US
and talk about an internet case

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.109
study.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:25.050
So there's a company
that, when it started,

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.859
it revolutionized a whole
category of the customer

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:29.140
experience.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.760
And they had a heartfelt,
emotional connection

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.760
with their customers.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.050
They were passionate about
what they were doing,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.440
and their customers loved them.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.540
OK.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.020
And then a few years
later, they went public

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.580
and they're
investors loved them.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.080
Right?

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.440
Wow.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.250
The numbers are good.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.960
Everyone's happy.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.620
Right?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.700
And then in 2011,
they did a couple

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.600
of things that almost
destroyed the business.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.260
All right.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.320
So what happened?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.680
First, they said, oh, you
customers love us, well, great,

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.340
we love you.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.270
We're all happy here.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.960
We're not changing anything
or adding additional benefits

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.090
to the product, but we are
raising the price by 60%.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.120
So thank you very much.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.090
So yes, you can
imagine what happened.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.640
Right?

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.970
So it's 2011.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.010
Social media has
become mainstream.

00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:18.000
So we were all using
it, but by 2011, so were

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.610
our parents, our
brothers and sisters.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:20.200
That kind of thing.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.860
Right?

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.260
And there's a huge backlash.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:23.860
Right?

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.820
And then the CEO does a sort
of a faux apology, which

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.880
inflames passions even more.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.380
Right?

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.200
So now, I have a little bit of
personal advice for all of us,

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.190
by the way.

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.010
In our relationships--
you know, the people

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.710
we care about, spouses,
friends, whatever--

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:46.580
if we've offended them,
don't do a faux topology.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.450
And you can usually
tell by the word "if."

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.470
If you start with the word
"if," well, you're in trouble.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.110
Right?

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.960
"If I've offended
you, I'm sorry."

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.460
Right?

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.915
How do you feel about that?

00:18:56.915 --> 00:18:57.231
AUDIENCE: Not great.

00:18:57.231 --> 00:18:58.030
PHIL TERRY: It doesn't work.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:18:58.881
Does it?

00:18:58.881 --> 00:19:00.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.380
OK.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.680
So people got even angrier.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.360
Right?

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.200
And then about a
month later, they

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.270
announced that we
know we love that.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:11.540
It's a price increase
and the heartfelt apology

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.040
for how we communicated it.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.640
Well, we have further good news.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.560
We're splitting the
company into two,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.620
and now you need two accounts
to do what you did before.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.420
And then all hell broke loose.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:24.920
Right?

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.350
So you probably now know
who I'm talking about.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:30.550
Do you remember Jason
Alexander from Seinfeld fame?

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.780
He did the Netflix
Relief Fund at the time.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.666
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:33.666 --> 00:19:36.340
On the Funny or Die website.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.060
OK.

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.890
So interestingly, what did
the tech press say about this?

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:42.680
Did they say, Netflix, wow.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.240
You had that
emotional connection,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.930
you created that
great experience,

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.930
you had that loyalty,
and you've blown it.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:49.770
What are you doing?

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:50.270
Right?

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.240
And you remember they lost
800,000 subscribers-- close

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.030
to 5%, by the way,
of their membership.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:59.040
They'd never had anything like
that before, that magnitude

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.110
problem.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.090
And their stock price had been
in the 300s and dropped to $50.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:05.550
Do you remember this?

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.300
And a friend of mine runs
a hedge fund in New York,

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.720
shorted it, rode it
all the way down.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.040
And then interestingly,
by the way, he went long.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:17.262
If I followed him in that,
I wouldn't be here today.

00:20:17.262 --> 00:20:20.858
I'd have flown you down to
my island in the Caribbean.

00:20:20.858 --> 00:20:23.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.330
So what did the tech press say?

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.370
Did they say, Reed
Hastings, you blew it?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:27.870
No.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:28.750
No.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.300
At least some of the tech
press said the following thing.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.601
They said your
customers are dumb.

00:20:34.601 --> 00:20:35.350
They don't get it.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.150
You're being "disruptive."

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.130
Right?

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.980
Now, Netflix had
truly been disruptive.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.700
Right?

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.610
And I'm a big fan of
disruption, but it often

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.520
gets misused-- the
term-- and gets

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.401
pasted over things
that don't work.

00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:51.900
Right?

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.441
And oh, well.

00:20:52.441 --> 00:20:53.264
This is disruptive.

00:20:53.264 --> 00:20:55.430
Well, then, of course, we're
supposed to support it.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.220
Right?

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.040
And I was talking
at a CEO summit

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.160
last week-- a venture capital
summit here in San Francisco--

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.420
and disruption was the word of
the day, as you can imagine.

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.370
And I said look.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:13.140
I like disruption, but only
when it's based on real customer

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.400
insights where we're solving
an unmet need, where we're

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.740
creating a solution
to a real pain point,

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.340
not for its own sake.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.560
And it's taken on a bit
of a life of its own.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.540
And this is in part due
to a professor of mine

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.860
at the Harvard Business School,
who in 1997, put out a book.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.730
OK.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.090
And the book knew-- so you guys
remember what 1997 was like.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.840
I'm thinking maybe
some of you anyway.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.630
And it was the early years
of the first dot-com boom.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.130
Right?

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.860
Yahoo and Netscape
had gone public

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.540
in the previous two years.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:45.400
Google wasn't even alive yet.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.717
Wow.

00:21:46.717 --> 00:21:48.550
But all the entrepreneurs
in Silicon Valley,

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.770
they had gold dollar
signs in their eyes.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:51.270
Right?

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.680
They couldn't wait to build
and flip the next company,

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.000
and the customer was
really-- frankly,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.320
let's be honest--
not in that equation.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.070
OK.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.280
And then my professor put
out a book they basically

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.140
said not only is
it not a problem

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.200
that you are ignoring
your customers,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.030
it would be a problem
if you listened to them.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.100
And you could hear the cheers
going up in Silicon Valley.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.960
Yes.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.960
Wow.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.050
Not only do we not have
to feel bad about ignoring

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.420
our customers, we actually
can feel good about it.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.840
It's intellectual
justification for doing

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.121
what we were already doing.

00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:28.370
And the book, of course--
which you've heard of if not

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.150
read-- is "The
Innovator's Dilemma."

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.010
Now, there's a lot to like in
this book and especially a lot

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.600
to like in his later work,
but the thesis in the book

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.040
essentially is, if you
listen to your customers,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.064
they'll tell you to
do the wrong thing

00:22:43.064 --> 00:22:45.230
and they'll make you
vulnerable to some upstart that

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.540
comes along and disrupts you.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:48.060
Right?

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.040
And interestingly, he amends
his thesis in his later work.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.790
He says actually,
what I meant to say

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.230
is, if you focus on
their unmet needs,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.940
then you can be disruptive.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.890
But you can't really
ask them what they want.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:03.390
Right?

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:05.971
And of course, and I've
believed that for 20 years.

00:23:05.971 --> 00:23:06.470
Right?

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.060
That look, we have a
problem in the world

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.320
of customer experience.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.050
Let's be honest.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.770
Right?

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.390
If we think it's important to
include the customer in product

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.307
development, which I
do-- and I mentioned

00:23:18.307 --> 00:23:20.640
I just joined the board of
Mind The Product, by the way.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.960
It's a great community
of product leaders

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.690
from around the world and
bringing their first event

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.190
to the US-- they started
in Europe, actually--

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:31.670
in San Francisco this
June, if you're interested.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.940
But if you believe it's
important to include

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:37.480
the customer when developing
and designing new products

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.360
and services, then
we have a problem,

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.210
which is we simply can't
ask-- what do you want?

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.499
Because people often don't know.

00:23:46.499 --> 00:23:47.290
Not just customers.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.150
We all have this
problem as human beings.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:51.470
We often don't know we want.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.430
Or we have a sense of it, but
we can't verbalize it very well.

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:57.590
Right?

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.840
So we have to find another way
to get at these unmet needs,

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.660
and we have to find a way
to sort of breakthrough

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.480
the blindness that companies
have about their customers.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.440
That's the focus of
the end of my talk.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.920
But before we get there, let me
finish the Netflix case study.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.280
So what did Reed
Hastings do here?

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:20.490
Did he say yes, you're right.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:21.470
I'm being disruptive.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.780
The customers are stupid.

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.240
Damn the torpedoes?

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:24.850
No.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.349
No.

00:24:25.349 --> 00:24:28.380
Actually, he did something
quite different and quite rare

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.110
for a CEO and,
frankly, a leader here

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.700
in Silicon Valley and something
that I think earned my respect

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.490
and should yours.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.810
He said the following thing.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:45.070
This was "arrogance
based on past success."

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.900
Wow.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.510
That's quite an admission.

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.590
You know?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.990
And look, in the course of human
affairs, if we're successful,

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.630
we become arrogant.

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.070
And a little bit of arrogance
is not a problem, I would argue.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.599
I hope not because I am.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:02.890
I need it to get up in the
morning, put a little spring

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.330
in my step, and I'm
guessing you do as well.

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:08.520
It's just when we get
extreme arrogance.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.190
Well, remember
those plays we read

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.170
in high school, those
old Greek plays?

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:15.072
What was the word that
Greeks had for this?

00:25:15.072 --> 00:25:15.780
AUDIENCE: Hubris.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.020
PHIL TERRY: Hubris.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.370
Hubris.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:20.690
That's what we have
to watch out for,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:22.840
and that's what happened here.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.810
Reed Hastings and the team
at Netflix got some hubris.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:27.480
Right?

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.375
And it blinded
them to the reality

00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:33.640
of the ordinary unmet
needs of their customers.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.600
OK.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.920
So in addition to
disruption, we get excited

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.200
about the word "innovation."

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:38.870
Right?

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.440
And innovation is important.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.870
Absolutely.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.750
Obviously, Silicon
Valley is founded

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.170
on the notion of innovation.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:51.050
Yet, sometimes, it becomes about
something more than innovating

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.405
around the simple unmet
needs of our customers.

00:25:53.405 --> 00:25:55.470
And in fact, what
Reed Hastings said,

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:58.180
not only this-- that he was
arrogant-- but he realized

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:03.400
they had been chasing the
shiny object of innovation

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:08.450
and had lost track of
the ordinary unmet needs

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:09.270
of their customers.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.610
He had lost track
of the housekeepers

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.560
we talked about earlier or
that taxi driver, you know,

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.920
or our sisters and brothers or,
for that matter, for all of us

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.600
in this room.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.010
We are real, living,
breathing human beings.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:24.050
And very often, the
things that we care about

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.230
are not the super exciting,
sexy, glamorous stuff

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.780
that's bandied
about in the press.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.250
It's being able to actually do
the things we want to get done.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.900
Companies frustrate us on the
most basic fundamental level.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.680
Right?

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.090
Prices are too high, or
it's just too difficult

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:40.460
to get something done.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.600
And of course, you
know this at Google

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.735
because you changed
everything here.

00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:48.030
You remember the history.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.840
Yahoo built Google.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.560
Right?

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.492
So in the early days,
when Google came out,

00:26:53.492 --> 00:26:55.700
the founders went around to
these different companies

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.860
and first tried to
sell the search engine,

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.970
and no one wanted to buy
it because Yahoo, Excite,

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.360
Altavista, Lycos,
they all believed

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.180
this is-- we're portals.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.730
We don't want to help
people leave our website.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.970
We want to stick them to
our website, and, in fact,

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.440
that's the word they used.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.490
And as a customer, I've never
wanted to be "stuck" to anyone.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:17.690
Thank you very much.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:21.280
And of course, what was the
single most important and basic

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.860
thing that users of
the internet wanted

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.270
to do in 1999 and, by
the way, still today?

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:33.030
Search and find something,
and search sucked, frankly,

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.020
on those sites.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.590
So Yahoo said, you know, OK.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.770
Why don't you-- you'll
be our search engine.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.440
And so when you
searched on Yahoo

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.610
and you got search
results, it actually

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.770
said "Powered by Google."

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:50.790
Yahoo built the Google brand
because Yahoo had misplaced

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.580
its focus on the
customer and instead was

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.740
focused on its
competitors and on this

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.891
inside the beltway
kind of attitude.

00:27:58.891 --> 00:27:59.390
Right?

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.770
Well, the same thing
happened here at Netflix.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.565
They lost sight of the basic
unmet needs of their customers,

00:28:05.565 --> 00:28:07.600
and so what Reed
Hastings and the team did

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.680
is said let's get
back to the basics.

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.120
Forget about the shiny
object, and they relentlessly,

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.170
relentlessly, relentlessly
innovated around how

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.670
to-- what's your name?

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:17.550
AUDIENCE: Emily.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.258
PHIL TERRY: How do we
make sure that when

00:28:19.258 --> 00:28:20.980
Emily-- and I'm
making this up now.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.730
When Emily puts her kids to
bed on a Friday night-- I don't

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.030
know if you have children--
and she has an hour

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.950
to watch something
on television,

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.260
she better not spend that
whole hour frustratingly

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.930
searching around
Netflix to try to find

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.250
something good to watch.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:35.800
Right?

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.190
And they ended up doing a
project that had actually

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:43.820
started earlier in 2006, but
they put more emphasis on it,

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:48.640
and that is creating subgenres
to help you find things.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.290
Right?

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.560
And so they actually had
a product development,

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.470
and Netflix put together
a-- do you know this story?

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.005
They put together
this big manual,

00:28:58.005 --> 00:28:59.880
and they hired a bunch
of people to basically

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.610
watch TV shows and movies
and to tag those TV shows

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:06.670
and movies along a
number of dimensions.

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:07.234
Right?

00:29:07.234 --> 00:29:09.150
Is this based in the
past, present, or future?

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.854
Is it a happy, sad, or
in-the-middle kind of ending?

00:29:11.854 --> 00:29:14.020
Is it an action film that
has some interest to women

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.540
because it has an unusual
female protagonist?

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.760
Whatever the case may be.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.968
And what's so interesting
is that Hollywood had never

00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:20.580
done this.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.310
Hollywood and the
American film industry

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:23.768
had been in business
for 100 years,

00:29:23.768 --> 00:29:26.195
and they didn't know anything
about their own content.

00:29:26.195 --> 00:29:27.390
Isn't that crazy?

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:32.831
They knew romantic comedy,
drama, sci-fi fantasy, action,

00:29:32.831 --> 00:29:34.580
but holy-- that doesn't
tell you anything.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:35.840
Does it?

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.560
So Netflix ended up creating
what they called "alt-genres."

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.150
I refer to them as "subgenres."

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.650
Whatever the case
may be, and you've

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.220
seen these because
you watch Netflix.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.900
And now, you're going to see a
little bit about my wife and I

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.280
because these are the
subgenres that Netflix thinks

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.030
we think would be interesting.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:55.870
And when the slide
comes up, you'll

00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:02.610
see that it says things
like quirky crime television

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.300
dramas or dramas that dog lovers
home alone on a Friday night

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:07.276
might like.

00:30:07.276 --> 00:30:08.150
Right?

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.787
And I only a little bit
joke about that last one.

00:30:10.787 --> 00:30:11.870
Let me ask you a question.

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.040
Each customer is shown two
or three or four or five

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.420
of these subgenres or
alt-genres in their language,

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:24.150
but how many in total do
you think Netflix created?

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.000
AUDIENCE: Hundreds?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:25.580
PHIL TERRY: Hundreds?

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.704
Emily's going for hundreds.

00:30:26.704 --> 00:30:27.532
AUDIENCE: 2,000.

00:30:27.532 --> 00:30:28.569
PHIL TERRY: 2,000?

00:30:28.569 --> 00:30:29.860
You're going to just go for it.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.360
OK.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:30.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.770
Anyone else?

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.640
76,897.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.740
AUDIENCE: Woah.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:39.490
PHIL TERRY: Crazy.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.880
Right?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.930
Now, again, they didn't
show each customer

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.690
76,000 subgeneres.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:45.940
That would have been terrible.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.000
Right?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.480
Now, if you watch
Netflix, you also

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:55.120
know that this actually didn't
completely solve the problem.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:55.900
Right?

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.667
Because these were kind of fun.

00:30:58.667 --> 00:31:01.000
And once in a while, it would
surface something that was

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.420
interesting, but
often, it didn't.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.740
It's like stuff you'd maybe
seen already or really wasn't

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:05.510
that interesting to you.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.169
Right?

00:31:06.169 --> 00:31:08.210
But they kept it hammering
away on this question,

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.260
and they did this whole
crowdsource development

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.630
of their algorithm, a
new algorithm trying to--

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.580
and that was a very
interesting project.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.140
Don't have time to
talk about it now.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.685
They did this, but they
kept asking that question--

00:31:18.685 --> 00:31:20.310
how do we make sure
Emily has something

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.210
to watch quickly and
easily that she likes?

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.350
Right?

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.000
And then what happened?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.350
Well, they sort of
realized, holy moly.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.780
There's not enough good content.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:30.770
No matter what.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.850
Our navigation or classification
scheme or algorithm,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.160
Cinematch for recommending
TV shows and movies,

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.770
no matter how good
those things are,

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.270
there's a fundamental
problem, which

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.070
is there isn't the content
behind it to bring to Emily.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:44.360
And then they did what?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.610
AUDIENCE: They made their own.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:47.740
PHIL TERRY: They made their own.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.980
They made their own.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.050
And so when the crisis
happened in 2011,

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.900
they had about 20 million
or so subscribers.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.270
They lost close to a million.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.360
Biggest negative, biggest
loss in their history

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.570
on a percentage basis, for sure.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.440
But they started to
get back to the basics.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.190
Right?

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.120
They realized they
had been arrogant.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.190
They were chasing the
shiny object instead

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.830
of the basic needs
of their customers,

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.630
and then they created
the alt-genres

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.860
and then they decided to
get into original content.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:16.510
So three and a half
years later-- only

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.345
three and a half years
later-- how many subscribers

00:32:18.345 --> 00:32:19.170
do they have today?

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.390
Do you know?

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.366
They just came out
with their numbers.

00:32:22.366 --> 00:32:23.240
AUDIENCE: 60 million?

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:23.948
PHIL TERRY: Yeah.

00:32:23.948 --> 00:32:25.470
54.5 in the last quarter.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.217
Yeah.

00:32:26.217 --> 00:32:27.372
Wow.

00:32:27.372 --> 00:32:28.288
That's quite a change.

00:32:28.288 --> 00:32:30.530
Right?

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.700
Now, if we're here
in Silicon Valley

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.060
and we're talking about
product development,

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.560
we're talking about
customers, we're

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.620
talking about great
design, there's

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.123
always one name that comes up.

00:32:42.123 --> 00:32:42.910
Right?

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.856
Well, you're talking about
customers, but what about--

00:32:45.856 --> 00:32:46.730
AUDIENCE: Steve Jobs.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.730
PHIL TERRY: Steve Jobs.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:48.580
Thank you.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.300
So the third chapter
of the book is

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.950
called "The
Misunderstood Mr. Jobs."

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:53.510
Right?

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:57.070
So the myth of Steve Jobs is
that he was a lone genius who

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.670
knew exactly what Emily wanted
before she herself knew,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.660
without talking to
her or anything,

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.170
and delivered it right when
she was ready for it and boom,

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:05.378
hit the ball out of the park.

00:33:05.378 --> 00:33:06.060
Right?

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.429
Well, the myth is partly true.

00:33:08.429 --> 00:33:10.012
Well, certainly,
they hit the ball out

00:33:10.012 --> 00:33:12.380
of the park with the iPhone.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.340
You guys did a good
job with Android, too.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.850
The numbers they
had last quarter

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.220
in the iPhone, unbelievable.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:18.990
Right?

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.120
The problem they have
today is-- what's next?

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.840
But we're not going to
address that right now.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.160
The myth that is not
true is it he was alone.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.970
Obviously, a few
people worked at Apple.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.036
But even more importantly--
and not well-known--

00:33:35.036 --> 00:33:36.660
is that he got out
from behind his desk

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.250
and spent time with customers.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:38.960
OK.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.672
Now, he did not like
market research.

00:33:40.672 --> 00:33:41.380
We all know this.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.110
Surveys, focus
groups, I hope we all

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.670
know-- forget
those methodologies

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.180
when we're developing
new products.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:48.460
That's a waste of time.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.860
We can ask people
what they want.

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.170
But he did know-- he himself
had to get out and watch

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.100
as people used technology.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:56.990
Right?

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.870
Now, to substantiate this claim,
we had a bit of a conundrum.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.790
Like, we have some conviction
and direct experience

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.000
that we can't
relate in the book.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.480
So what do we do?

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.400
And we couldn't find
anything on the internet

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.380
or in the public sphere
until we found finally

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:15.255
an article in "The New
York Times" at the end

00:34:15.255 --> 00:34:17.860
of which a San Jose State
professor said, oh, yeah.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.840
Steve Jobs got out and
observed customers.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.469
Like, ah, finally.

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:23.350
A public thing we can point to.

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:23.850
It's true.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.971
It just wasn't part of
the myth-making machine.

00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:27.429
Now, what I do want
to do is I want

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:31.771
to show you a video
from 1997 of Steve Jobs.

00:34:31.771 --> 00:34:33.520
Now, he doesn't say
he observed customers,

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.094
but you see his passion
for the customer experience

00:34:36.094 --> 00:34:37.719
and it's one of the
clearest statements

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:39.790
that he made in
his whole career.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:40.570
OK.

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:41.205
Now, 1997.

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:43.510
Do you remember what
was going on at Apple?

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.469
Anybody?

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:46.356
Almost out of cash.

00:34:46.356 --> 00:34:47.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.979
PHIL TERRY: Right?

00:34:47.979 --> 00:34:52.142
So Jobs had been fired in
'85, left the board in '86.

00:34:52.142 --> 00:34:54.350
Kind of wandered around in
the wilderness for awhile.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:58.460
Started a company called "NeXT,"
turned out not to be next.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.240
He did, though, buy this
little digital animation thing.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.290
Right?

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:02.940
What was that?

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.430
AUDIENCE: Pixar.

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:04.096
AUDIENCE: Pixar.

00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:05.140
PHIL TERRY: Ah, Pixar.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.640
Pixar.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.190
Fabulous.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.689
Right?

00:35:06.689 --> 00:35:07.570
That was good.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:11.191
But by 1997, he was back
on the board at Apple.

00:35:11.191 --> 00:35:13.190
And essentially, the board
said, well, you know,

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.190
we're going down anyway.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.836
You might as well take over.

00:35:15.836 --> 00:35:16.960
Like, what a great mandate.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:21.100
And the first thing he does is
he shuts down a bunch of stuff.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.480
Right?

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.980
And by the way, that pisses off
a lot of external developers

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.320
who had been working
on things like OpenDoc.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.042
Some of you may remember
OpenDoc, which he shut down.

00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:32.500
And all of the
sudden, the products

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:35.041
they were working on that had
been built to work with OpenDoc

00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:35.880
were orphaned.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.280
Right?

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.470
The video is kind of a
grainy, unauthorized video

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:43.010
from the Worldwide Developers
Conference in 1997 for Apple.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.820
Has anyone been to the
WWDC for Apply, by the way?

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.370
I'm not-- you have?

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:48.870
Right.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:49.370
Exactly.

00:35:52.905 --> 00:35:54.030
But you have a sense of it?

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.530
Right?

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.870
What's it like?

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:58.430
What's your impression?

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.120
Light, sound, you know how
everyone's excited, you know,

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.860
blah, blah, blah.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.359
Right?

00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:03.200
Cult.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.385
Well, that's not what
it was like in 1997.

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:07.860
It was the last 200 people who
were hoping it doesn't die,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.950
but they're demoralized
and they're pissed off.

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:13.660
And when Steve Jobs says you've
got to start with the customer

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.460
experience, you'll
see in the audience,

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.843
people are like-- right?

00:36:17.843 --> 00:36:20.880
[MUMBLING] They pan to the--
[MUMBLING] And then and then

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.217
you hear one person--

00:36:23.217 --> 00:36:24.625
[SLOW CLAPPING]

00:36:25.125 --> 00:36:27.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.100
This is not the cult
that we knew later.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.291
This is the lowest
point in the company.

00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:32.790
Right?

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.830
But it's that moment when he
chooses to make, what I think,

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:38.610
is the clearest statement about
his vision for how you think

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:40.300
about customers and technology.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.770
So let's see if we
can watch this video.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:43.555
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:43.555 --> 00:36:44.800
- --OpenDoc.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.340
And when you're
finished with that,

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.214
perhaps you could tell
us what you personally

00:36:48.214 --> 00:36:50.191
have been doing for
the last seven years.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:57.240
-One of the hardest things, when
you're trying to effect change,

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.730
is that people
like this gentleman

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.200
are right in some areas.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.850
I'm sure that there are some
things OpenDoc does-- probably

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:10.640
even more that I'm not
familiar with-- that nothing

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.270
else out there does.

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:18.060
And I'm sure of that
you can make some demos,

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:22.620
maybe a small commercial app
that demonstrates those things.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:26.400
The hardest thing
is-- how does that

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.820
fit in to a cohesive
larger vision?

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.840
And one of the things
I've always found

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:43.850
is that you've got to start
with the customer experience

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:46.300
and work backwards
to the technology.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.550
You can't start
with the technology

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:52.550
and try to figure out where
you're going to try to sell it.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.240
And I've made this
mistake probably more

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.520
than anybody else in
this room and I've

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.520
got the scar tissue prove it
and I know that it's the case.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:07.660
And as we have tried to come
up with a strategy and a vision

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:16.090
for Apple, it started with--
what incredible benefits

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:17.670
can we give to the customer?

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.000
Where can we take the customer?

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.990
Not starting with let's
sit down with the engineers

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:28.642
and figure out what
awesome technology we have,

00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:30.350
and then how are we
going to market that.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.010
And I think that's the
right path to take.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.820
[END PLAYBACK]

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.900
PHIL TERRY: So I think
we all agree yes.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.630
Start with the
customer experience,

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.360
not with the technology.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.090
And what are the
amazing benefits?

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:46.780
Right?

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.280
And now, we get to the
conclusion of my talk

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.890
and the most important thing
that I learned in 15 years.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:52.460
All right.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.710
So much of the book,
we go through stories,

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.890
and I've shared some of
those with you today.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:38:57.709
They're fairly straightforward.

00:38:57.709 --> 00:38:59.500
You know, there wasn't
anything necessarily

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.980
revolutionary or
different about it.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.460
I learned a lot from others.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.570
Others learned from
me over the 15 years

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:10.910
that I led this customer
experience consultancy.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.640
But there's one thing I learned
that was, unfortunately,

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.390
both the most powerful thing
and the least practiced.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.298
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:19.298 --> 00:39:20.006
PHIL TERRY: Good?

00:39:20.006 --> 00:39:20.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:21.080
PHIL TERRY: OK.

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.902
OK.

00:39:21.902 --> 00:39:23.360
And that's where
I want to conclude

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.550
with because I
want to see if this

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.250
will help you
think in a new way.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.830
So if we agree that
we want to start

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.490
with the amazing
benefits, the problem

00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:35.780
that we, of course,
have is-- how do you

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.110
figure those out, especially
if you can't go ask somebody?

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.990
What amazing benefits
do you want, Emily?

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.860
You're like, well, I--
[MUMBLING] You know--

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.750
[MUMBLING]

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:45.160
You know, we'll say something.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.340
We'll give an answer, but
it doesn't necessarily

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.300
equate to what is, in fact,
really important to us.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.930
Not because we don't want to
be honest, but because we,

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:56.100
as human beings,
often don't know.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.300
So what do we do?

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:02.910
Well, what we learned and
what I learned is, one,

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:07.220
get out from behind your
desk and observe customers.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.580
So yes.

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.580
Is data important?

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.450
I love data.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.730
I love data.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.570
I love big data.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:14.390
I love small data.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:15.303
I love medium data.

00:40:15.303 --> 00:40:16.170
[CHUCKLES]

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.960
I love data of all
sizes and kinds.

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.860
Data tells you what, but it
often doesn't tell you why.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:23.360
Right?

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.690
And you need some observations
of real living human beings,

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:29.440
like the housekeepers
that we were talking

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.230
about earlier, the taxi driver,
or your mother, or whatever.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.830
Right?

00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.170
People that we're
designing this product for.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.440
We need a few of real
life human beings,

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.330
and we need it for two reasons.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.020
One, because it gives us more
of the why and fills out what

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.940
we are looking at in
the data, but we need it

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.300
for a second reason.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.240
OK.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:52.560
And this is not well-understood.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:57.270
When we work inside companies,
within about six months

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:59.040
of working for a
company, we start

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.720
to see the world from the
company's point of view.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.010
We start to absorb the
values and perspective

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:08.130
of the companies that
we're working with.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.580
This is very important
and very powerful,

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.710
but there's a weakness
embedded in it,

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:18.270
which is that we lose the
capacity to understand

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.530
our business from the
customer's point of view,

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.870
from their perspective, to
have empathy for what it's

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.980
like for someone who
doesn't have our knowledge

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.510
and our perspective to use
our products and services.

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:34.650
It happens no matter who
you are and no matter

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.150
which company you're in.

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.310
In fact, you start to develop
a kind of confirmation bias.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.950
Right?

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:43.140
So you guys are
familiar with this term,

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.369
and you know the whole field
of behavioral economics.

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:47.160
I talk a lot about it
in my book because it

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.260
had a big impact on
me, and it really

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.270
helped me understand what
I'm talking about right now.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:58.690
So in 1999-- well, in 1998,
we had worked for Travelocity

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.650
and created the first
Fast Fare Finder.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:01.554
Big hit.

00:42:01.554 --> 00:42:03.095
Then the head of
Product Development,

00:42:03.095 --> 00:42:07.340
a guy named Chuck Geiger, move
from Travelocity to Gateway.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.040
And he called us and said would
you come help us out here?

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.350
We're not doing as well
with our e-commerce,

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:16.350
and we want to be
more like Dell.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.070
OK.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.240
Gateway at the time had a
great case of Dell envy.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.740
Envy is like arrogance.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:22.380
It blinds you.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.050
Right?

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:27.890
So to Chuck, I said, if we
find out from the data analysis

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.039
and spending some time
with your customers

00:42:30.039 --> 00:42:32.580
that you need to be more like
Dell, we'll certainly say that.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.200
But if we find something else
out, we'll tell you that, too.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.824
We're not going to tell you what
you want to hear, as you know.

00:42:37.824 --> 00:42:38.490
He said great.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:38.680
Fine.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.060
And then I had this brainstorm.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.020
It was lucky.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:44.810
I can't tell you
that it was something

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.904
that I had thought about
for years and understood.

00:42:46.904 --> 00:42:47.820
I just-- I don't know.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.080
I ate something good
for breakfast that day.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.280
I said to Chuck--
would you please

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.640
invite some of the other
leaders from Gateway

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.460
to come out with us to observe
Gateway potential customers

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.330
and current customers
researching and shopping

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.790
for a computer online?

00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:04.860
And he said OK.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:05.685
Thank God.

00:43:05.685 --> 00:43:08.060
Because it ended up being the
most important thing that I

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.180
learned.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.470
So we brought
people-- let's say,

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.240
Emily here who was
shopping for a computer,

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.160
thinking about buying
a Gateway, and was

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.660
thinking about buying it online.

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.460
OK.

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.720
You had to, of course,
understand, in 1999,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.470
many people weren't
necessarily buying online.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:25.705
And we brought them
in, and we said, Emily,

00:43:25.705 --> 00:43:27.330
you're in the market
to buy a computer.

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:27.820
We understand.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.270
Great.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.750
And you're thinking OK.

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:29.720
Cool.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.200
Would you just
shop and research?

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.450
We're not going to say much.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:33.150
Don't mind us.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:34.880
Just think out loud.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.014
It's not a usability test.

00:43:36.014 --> 00:43:37.180
We're not going to task you.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.460
It's not a focus group.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.043
We're not interested
in your opinions.

00:43:40.043 --> 00:43:41.160
We're going to watch.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.220
So Emily tools around.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.240
And sad for Emily--
and by the way,

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.670
I say this in all of my talks.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.250
Google wasn't up yet.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:48.940
OK.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:53.080
So she's struggling with bad
search results that Altavista

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.590
and Lycos and Excite
and Yahoo or whatever--

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.560
and she finally
makes it to Gateway,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.193
and the Gateway
homepages a trainwreck.

00:43:59.193 --> 00:43:59.940
Right?

00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.560
And she gets
completely frustrated.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.143
Now, with the leaders
behind the glass

00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:06.980
she types in-- on her own,
without any prompting from us--

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:13.680
Dell.com, and you can imagine
what they-- [MUMBLING]

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.096
And she's not our customer.

00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:16.050
[CHUCKLES]

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.640
I said all right.

00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.100
She struggles over at Dell.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.309
We bring her back to Gateway.

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:22.266
We say let's just go back
there, and we get her

00:44:22.266 --> 00:44:23.019
into the process.

00:44:23.019 --> 00:44:25.310
Now, we learned some important
things-- at that moment,

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.480
important to Gateway.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.020
The most important
thing we learned

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:31.210
is it the paradigm
that gateway and Dell

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.910
had created in the 1980s.

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.310
The way that they sold
computers, which was you

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:37.840
tell us what you want.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.290
You configure it.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.930
We'll build it and send it to
you was not working anymore

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.857
for the Emilys of the world.

00:44:44.857 --> 00:44:46.690
Emily didn't want to
configure her computer.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:47.898
She didn't know what RAM was.

00:44:47.898 --> 00:44:49.320
She just wanted the whole thing.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.660
She doesn't know how to get it,
but she was very frustrated.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.340
And here's the remarkable thing.

00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.100
By the end of two days-- just
two days-- of watching Emily

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.890
and Emily 1, 2, 3,
4, up to Emily 16

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:08.120
and we saw the similar pattern
without tasking or setting

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.009
the context, by the
end of those two days,

00:45:11.009 --> 00:45:13.300
not only had we learned
something important that helped

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.610
foot and explain the data
that we had analyzed,

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:19.410
but more importantly than
that, the leaders of Gateway

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.550
themselves had
changed their minds.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:25.030
They had actually gone
through their own confirmation

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:28.180
bias, which is notoriously
difficult to change,

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.800
and come out on the other side.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.180
They had developed some
empathy and compassion

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:36.530
and understanding for Emily's
perspective on Gateway

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.680
and how to buy a
computer, not their own.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.970
And that just blew my mind.

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.890
Like holy moly.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:43.930
Confirmation bias.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.302
First of all, you don't
know when you have it.

00:45:46.302 --> 00:45:47.760
You don't know when
it's operating.

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.299
OK.

00:45:48.299 --> 00:45:50.840
If you read all the way to the
end of Daniel Kahneman's book,

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:53.048
"Thinking, Fast and Slow"--
has anyone attempted that

00:45:53.048 --> 00:45:54.181
by the way?

00:45:54.181 --> 00:45:54.680
I know.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.430
It's actually a little hard
to read, but it's worth it.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.615
So he's the co-founder
of behavioral economics,

00:45:59.615 --> 00:46:01.240
wins the Nobel Prize,
blah, blah, blah.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.640
40 years of research
proving that we

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.515
don't know what we're
doing most of the time.

00:46:04.515 --> 00:46:08.802
And at the end of the book, he
says, despite all of this-- me

00:46:08.802 --> 00:46:11.010
being a co-founder, that
is, winning the Nobel Prize,

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:14.660
discovering confirmation bias
recently or co-discovering

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:17.640
or doing research around it,
whatever the case may be-- I

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.360
myself, Daniel Kahneman,
have no idea when

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.470
I'm doing all of these things.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:23.700
What?

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:27.260
The world expert, the one
who co-founded the field?

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.010
He himself has no idea?

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:32.099
What are we supposed
to do about all this?

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:33.890
So we have the knowledge,
but the knowledge

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:35.610
doesn't change our behavior.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.990
OK.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:40.550
Well, it helped clarify, for
me-- he then says this, though.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.990
He says, if you're
in a social context,

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:47.590
if you see and connect
with other people,

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:51.610
it starts to expose for
you some of these biases

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.415
in yourself and in others.

00:46:53.415 --> 00:46:54.660
I though, oh.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.320
That's what we learned in 1999.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:59.469
And that's why every
project after that-- the 400

00:46:59.469 --> 00:47:01.760
projects we did, whether we
were working with Facebook,

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.340
helping them figure out-- are
non-college students interested

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:05.970
in Facebook?

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:06.470
Right?

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.965
The early days of Facebook.

00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:10.340
Now, they're trying
to figure out

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:12.410
if college students
are interested.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.997
Hey, you've got
1.3 billion users.

00:47:13.997 --> 00:47:14.705
So what the hell.

00:47:14.705 --> 00:47:16.090
Right?

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:18.760
Whether it's that or working
with a company like American

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.240
Express or whatever the
case may be, I set a rule.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.200
Anyone who has a say on
this product or service--

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.090
and by the way, veto power
over what the team comes up

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:31.760
with in terms of a new product,
like service or experience--

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.470
has to come out and directly
observe some of this research

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.050
themselves.

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:40.950
It's the only way that we
will shift their perspective.

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:43.200
It doesn't matter how
good our data analysis

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.950
is if they already have
a sacred assumption

00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:47.450
about the way they're working.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:50.410
They won't see the
full implications.

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.640
We need this, and it's
such a simple thing.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:57.410
Notice I'm not trying to
create a complicated framework

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:00.030
with a cool piece of
jargon around it and maybe

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:03.160
some copyright, and you have to
license this from me to do it.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:03.740
No.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.590
I'm simply saying get
out from behind your desk

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:08.570
and make a habit of it.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.010
And obviously, you
can't do it all the time

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:11.760
and different people
have different roles,

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.240
but don't let it be a group over
here that does it and reports

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.800
back to you and you
yourself have never done it.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.780
Steve Jobs did it.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.866
Sam Walton did it.

00:48:20.866 --> 00:48:22.990
I have a whole case study
in the book about Walmart

00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.260
that I think you'll find
very, very interesting

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.860
and a colossal
mistake they later

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.030
made because they got
more focused on themselves

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:32.360
and their envy of that
French retailer, Target,

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.470
than on their
ordinary customers.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:38.260
And they lost context
and the ability to see,

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.800
and they didn't
go into the stores

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.557
as much as they once did.

00:48:41.557 --> 00:48:43.140
Warren Buffett, by
the way, does this.

00:48:43.140 --> 00:48:44.160
Little known fact.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.160
Like, Warren Buffett?

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.660
He's a customer experience
leader, a pioneer?

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:48.160
What?

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.390
That guy in Omaha?

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.060
Yes, actually.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.550
That guy.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.360
When he made an all-important
investment in American Express

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.050
in the early '60s, he actually
went out and watched people

00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:58.785
using their American
Express cards.

00:48:58.785 --> 00:49:00.027
You want to know the
only thing he did?

00:49:00.027 --> 00:49:01.760
He did a-- you know,
the guy's a wizard.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.550
He did all kinds of analysis,
but he did that, too.

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.610
OK.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.090
Some of the best
companies do this,

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:11.390
and it's the simple
message that I have.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:15.740
At the end of the day, we'll
end with where we started.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.030
We're dealing with real people,
really human beings, employees,

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.490
customers, real
living human beings.

00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:24.610
And it turns out we human beings
are, despite what we think,

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.090
more similar to
each other then we

00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:30.640
are different in a
vast variety of ways.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.640
The only way we
can remember what

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.140
it's like to be a
customer of our company

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:39.700
is to get out and spend
some time with them.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:41.800
Not in a focus group
where we're giving them

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.020
some artificial construct
or a usability test

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.065
and there's value for those,
but direct observations

00:49:47.065 --> 00:49:52.410
of people searching
or people using email.

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:52.910
Right?

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:56.470
And I know you do this, and
you do this to some extent.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.300
But all of you need
to do this, and you

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.140
need to make a
regular habit of it.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.660
And what I find is that
companies, even those that

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:05.910
know it, forget it
sometimes, and that,

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:09.280
in fact, is the most
important thing that I learned

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.530
and the simplest, simplest
recommendation I have for you.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:14.340
So thank you so much
for having me here.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:16.120
It was really a pleasure.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.680
And why don't we conclude?

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.780
And if there are any
comments or questions,

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.281
we can end with that.

00:50:21.281 --> 00:50:23.030
AUDIENCE: You showed
the Steve Jobs video.

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.410
PHIL TERRY: Yeah.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.405
AUDIENCE: And you just have said
that the customer is the focus,

00:50:25.405 --> 00:50:28.090
and we start with the customer
and go back to the technology.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:28.798
PHIL TERRY: Yeah.

00:50:28.798 --> 00:50:30.320
AUDIENCE: But as
an engineer, if I

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:32.800
have this awesome,
cool technology which

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.846
is awesome for me.

00:50:33.846 --> 00:50:34.970
But it's just a technology.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.020
It's not a product yet.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.228
PHIL TERRY: That's all right.

00:50:37.228 --> 00:50:39.950
AUDIENCE: So like, what
is your advice for me

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:43.035
to go and find the right
customers for such a scenario?

00:50:43.035 --> 00:50:44.660
PHIL TERRY: Well,
you know, it's great.

00:50:44.660 --> 00:50:47.320
And obviously, engineers are
the backbone of Silicon Valley.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:47.820
Right?

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.180
But my message to you is
get out and spend some time

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:52.221
with your end-users.

00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:52.720
Right?

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.950
And there's a lot of reasons.

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:56.409
There's time, people are busy.

00:50:56.409 --> 00:50:58.450
There's a lot of things
that we could talk about.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:00.030
It's awkward.

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.360
Frankly, one of the--
it's emotionally hard

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.134
to spend time with customers.

00:51:05.134 --> 00:51:07.300
It really-- because they
trample all over the things

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:09.390
you care about
without knowing it.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.990
Right?

00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:13.140
And then, you know, this thing
you thought was so important,

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:14.430
they don't give a damn about.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.940
Right?

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:17.890
PHIL TERRY: But I
would say you do

00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:21.700
some unstructured observations--
not even about the technology

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:23.360
necessarily that
you're working on,

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:25.260
although maybe in
that sphere-- just

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:28.360
to try to understand-- where are
some pain points and obstacles?

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.140
And let that guide.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:31.905
You have great--
I'm going to assume.

00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:33.280
We don't know each
other, but I'm

00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:35.571
going-- you know, if you're
an engineer here at Google,

00:51:35.571 --> 00:51:37.120
you've got some
great skill, talent,

00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:40.240
maybe you have some real
insights about some technology.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.340
That's really valuable.

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:43.910
What you may not
have as much of it

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:47.700
is a real empathetic
understanding of your customer.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.624
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:48.624 --> 00:51:49.550
PHIL TERRY: Yeah.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.592
So--

00:51:51.592 --> 00:51:54.090
AUDIENCE: But the
way you suggest--

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:55.925
So if I start looking
at the customers,

00:51:55.925 --> 00:51:58.490
what problems they're
experiencing, and try

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.780
to draw back to the
technology, then

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.450
I might find the technology I
started with wouldn't, like,

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.085
fit that particular case.

00:52:05.085 --> 00:52:05.450
PHIL TERRY: That's right.

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:05.855
That's right.

00:52:05.855 --> 00:52:06.610
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:07.985
PHIL TERRY: Because
maybe there's

00:52:07.985 --> 00:52:10.380
this ancillary technology
or this quarter-inch turn

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.700
you can make that-- wow.

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.680
I didn't even think
about that because you

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.890
can't because you're
inside the company.

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:21.760
It's by nature you cannot
see the customer the way

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.090
the customers see you
and what their needs are.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.490
No matter how smart you are.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:34.030
One of the bottom lines of my
book-- knowledge is not enough.

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:35.970
It's frustrating,
especially for those of us

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.410
who have built
our careers on it.

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.990
It's important, but
it's not enough.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:42.430
We also need empathy.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:44.491
We need the heart and the head.

00:52:44.491 --> 00:52:46.490
AUDIENCE: Around, like,
in larger companies, how

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.990
do you build kind of the
excitement about customer

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:52.029
experience and really
staying customer-focused.

00:52:52.029 --> 00:52:52.570
I know like--

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:53.278
PHIL TERRY: Yeah.

00:52:53.278 --> 00:52:54.470
There's a lot of complexity.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.800
AUDIENCE: YEah.

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:55.240
PHIL TERRY: Right?

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:55.780
Absolutely.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.610
And I don't want to pretend
that's not true, but you know,

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:02.140
what I always say-- I was a
community organizer before I

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:02.990
got into business.

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:05.406
Maybe you picked that up a
little bit in sort of how I am.

00:53:05.406 --> 00:53:06.470
Right?

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:10.926
I really do care about people,
and I care about communities.

00:53:10.926 --> 00:53:12.800
And what you learn, as
a community organizer,

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.470
if you want to change
things in the world,

00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.800
is that it's brick by brick.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.760
It's slow.

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.070
And many people complain
to me, oh, you know,

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:25.780
I can't get the culture here to
change, and my answer to them

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.470
is you've got the
wrong time horizon.

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:29.200
OK.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.700
If you're hoping to have
an impact on the culture

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.590
and the degree of momentum,
excitement, et cetera,

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:36.756
that takes time.

00:53:36.756 --> 00:53:38.375
It doesn't happen overnight.

00:53:38.375 --> 00:53:42.510
Most people quit before
it really happens.

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.570
So we all know a little bit
about the Civil Rights Movement

00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:48.990
and we know about Martin
Luther King's speech in 1963,

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:51.889
but do you know how many
decades people were working

00:53:51.889 --> 00:53:54.180
to create the possibility
for the Civil Rights Movement

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:54.679
to emerge?

00:53:54.679 --> 00:53:56.720
When was the NAACP founded?

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.890
Does anyone else?

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:00.564
If you had to guess?

00:54:00.564 --> 00:54:01.860
AUDIENCE: 1970s?

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:03.485
PHIL TERRY: You're
in the neighborhood.

00:54:03.485 --> 00:54:05.700
It was just the beginning
of the 20th century.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:06.800
Right?

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.510
And of course, there were
abolitionists and others.

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:12.110
I mean, this is--
and in fact, if you

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:13.970
want to really understand
the time horizon,

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:15.970
we're just now, in
the West, beginning

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:18.410
to have a society where
women are more equal.

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.300
Right?

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:21.200
They were always
equal fundamentally,

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.590
but not treated as such.

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:27.620
2,500 years ago, Plato,
in "The Republic,"

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:29.470
calls for the complete
equality of women

00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:35.280
in every aspect of life--
military, political, business.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.970
The whole kit and caboodle.

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:40.140
Then it took us 2,500
years to get to the point

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:42.242
where we're starting
to act on that.

00:54:42.242 --> 00:54:43.450
These are long-time horizons.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.300
Now, I'm not suggesting it's
going to take 2,500 years.

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:51.390
But it's going to be more than a
week and then more than a month

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:53.210
and, more likely,
more than a year.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.030
Right?

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.160
But you can start
small, start somewhere.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.510
Where is there an opening?

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:59.550
Where is there an
engineer who wants

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:01.050
to get out a little
bit from the box

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:02.550
and do something a
little different?

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.530
Work with that person.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:06.110
See if you can develop
some success around that,

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.300
and then keep going.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.620
And get in touch with me if you
ever want some sounding board

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.060
advice or what have you.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.450
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:15.158
PHIL TERRY: Yeah.

00:55:15.158 --> 00:55:15.760
Thank you.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:16.990
Cool.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.625
I know there are
people on Hangout,

00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:21.140
and I don't know if they're
able to ask questions or--

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.370
MALE SPEAKER: Not really, no.

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:22.950
But they'll follow up later.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:23.610
PHIL TERRY: They'll follow up.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:23.990
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:26.531
PHIL TERRY: My email address is
pterry@collaborativegain.com.

00:55:28.342 --> 00:55:32.716
And if that's too long,
it's pterry@gmail.com.

00:55:32.716 --> 00:55:33.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:36.320
By the way, I'll tell you
that-- since I'm at Google,

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.320
I'll just end with this.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.050
So I was one of the
earliest Gmail users

00:55:40.050 --> 00:55:43.010
because of Marissa and
Bradley and others here,

00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:45.380
and I'm so happy to
get that email address.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:45.990
Right?

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.930
Every single day-- I'm
not talking about spam.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:52.280
Every single day, I
get email from people

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.780
all over the world who think I'm
someone else because my email

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.340
address is so simple.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:59.590
I'm Pam Terry, Patricia
Terry in England,

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.720
and all over the world.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.632
I get bank account sign-ups.

00:56:03.632 --> 00:56:06.090
People sign-- and then, "Here's
your bank"-- I'm like, "Oh,

00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:06.860
shit."

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.470
You know, and I'm
like calling the bank.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.256
This is not me, and you
don't want this information.

00:56:12.256 --> 00:56:13.390
[CHUCKLES]

00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:15.840
I have actually a folder
in my Gmail account

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.820
called "Other Phils" where
I have years of these.

00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.805
I might actually
write a book about--

00:56:21.805 --> 00:56:23.430
MALE SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] take it away.

00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:24.050
PHIL TERRY: What's that?

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:25.470
MALE SPEAKER: We can take
it away, if that's a--

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.820
PHIL TERRY: Oh, no.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.200
But I love my email address.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:27.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.062
I love my email address.

00:56:29.062 --> 00:56:29.770
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:30.890
PHIL TERRY: My
only disappointment

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:32.800
is I didn't do phil@gmail,
although, I think,

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.383
actually that was
taken at that point.

00:56:34.383 --> 00:56:36.159
But anyway, so
thank you so much.

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:37.450
Please take a look at the book.

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.910
Let me know what you
think, and stay in touch.

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:40.550
OK.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.140
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.056
PHIL TERRY: Thank you.

00:56:42.056 --> 00:56:44.190
[APPLAUSE]
