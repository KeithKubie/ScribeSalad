00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.600
Fractional exponents can be
a little daunting at first,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.810
so it never hurts to do as
many examples as possible.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.150
So let's do a few.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.720
What if we had
25/9, and we wanted

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.885
to raise it to the 1/2 power?

00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.510
So we're essentially
just saying, well,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.730
what is the principal
square root of 25/9?

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.110
So what number times
itself is going to be 25/9?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.710
Well, we know 5 times 5
is 25, and 3 times 3 is 9.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.520
So why don't we
just go with 5/3?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.560
Because notice, if you
have 5/3 times 5/3,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.850
that is going to be 25/9.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.740
Or another way of saying
this, that 5/3 squared

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.170
is equal to 25/9.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.200
So 25/9 to the 1/2 is
going to be equal to 5/3.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.330
Now let's escalate
things a little bit.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.310
Let's take a really hairy one.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:17.690
Let's raise 81/256 to
the negative 1/4 power.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.211
I encourage you to pause this
and try this on your own.

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.210
So what's going on here?

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.335
This negative-- the first
thing I always like to do

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:26.970
is I want to get rid of this
negative in the exponent.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.530
So let me just take
the reciprocal of this

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.430
and raise it to the positive.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.220
So I could just say that
this is equal to 256/81

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.050
to the 1/4 power.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.210
And so now I can say,
well, what number

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.167
times itself times
itself times itself

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.000
is going to be equal
to 256, and what number

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.960
times itself times
itself times itself--

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.410
did I say that four times?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.200
Well, what number, if I take
four of them and multiply,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.072
do I get 81?

00:01:55.072 --> 00:01:56.530
And one way to
think about it, this

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.800
is going to be the
same thing-- and we'll

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.270
talk about this in
more depth later

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.260
on when we talk about
exponent properties.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.420
But this is going to be
the exact same thing as 256

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.309
to the 1/4 over 81 to the 1/4.

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.600
You, in fact, saw it over here.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.550
This over here was the same
thing as the square root of 25

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.120
over the square root of 9.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.852
Or 25 to the 1/2
over 9 to the 1/2.

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:19.310
So we're just doing
that over here.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.170
So one, we still have to think
about what number this is.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.670
And this is a little bit of,
there's no easy way to do this.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.740
You kind of have
to just play around

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.250
a little bit to come up with it.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.650
But 4 might jump out at you if
you recognize that 16 times 16

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.930
is 256.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.100
We know that 4 to
the fourth power,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.750
or you're about to know this,
is 4 times 4 times 4 times 4.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.490
And 4 times 4 is 16, times 4
is 64, times 4 is equal to 256.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.270
So 4 to the fourth
is 256, or we could

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.360
say 4 is equal to
256 to the 1/4 power.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.230
Fair enough?

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.980
Now what about 81?

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.020
Well, 3 might jump out at you.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.190
We know that 3 to
the fourth power

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.840
is equal to 3 times 3 times 3
times 3, which is equal to 81.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.730
So 3 is equal to 81 to the 1/4.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.916
So this top number, 256
to the 1/4, that's just 4.

00:03:13.916 --> 00:03:17.640
81 to the 1/4, that is just 3.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.590
So this right over here is
going to be equal to 4/3.
