00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, going back to our equations, we see we're going to use the exact same one

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we used last time, because these four variables are the relevant ones,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
except this time we're solving for the height—Δx.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Can you tell me what is the highest point above the ground the ball reaches?

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer in meters to one decimal place.
