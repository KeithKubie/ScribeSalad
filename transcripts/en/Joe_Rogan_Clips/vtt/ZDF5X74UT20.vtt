1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.290
Look,

2
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.710
I used to play quake competitively and if you tell people how quick teams are

3
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:08.000
that their clans,
the Queensland people,
like what?
And then they were like,

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.380
you mean like the KKK?
You're like,
no,
just a group of people like quake.

5
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:16.190
You fucking idiot with a common mentality.
That's it.
Oh,
a group.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.640
A band of people banned.
Yeah,
brothers.
That happens.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.790
People just take over something and then that's something becomes negative from

8
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:24.980
then on.
Well then they have a platform as well,

9
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:28.550
you know that they can then they're like social social justice warriors about
it.

10
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.121
You know,

11
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.900
they're like chairing it from the rooftops and making tweets about it and how,

12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.340
how it's a fucked up situation.
Are they really getting rid of doing that?
Well,

13
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:40.790
you know,
like when if you,
if you were to say any word,
people are like,
oh my God,

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.800
this person said this.
It's racist.
It's like I was just saying clan.

15
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.680
I wasn't saying anything else,
but it's like the Hitler mustache.

16
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.640
You just gotta let it go.

17
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.020
Too tricky is if anybody wants to wear the Hitler mustache now.

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.950
Like you can't really,
you can't.
Who wants to wear it?
Is there,

19
00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:05.240
is somebody wearing it where for awhile?
That's right.
He did.
Oh my God,

20
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.630
he did playing basketball.
That's kind of fun.
If he was playing basketball thing,

21
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.100
he wasn't,
he was retired Hanes commercial or something I think.
Oh yeah,

22
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.850
he hit my God Damn Hitler.
You can

23
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.760
<v 1>praise.</v>

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.870
<v 0>You can't even like when does it become a Charlie Chaplin?
It starts as a Hitler.</v>

25
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.410
Like when it gets to the outer edge of the nostrils.
Is it a Charlie Chaplin?

26
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.260
Well Charlie Chaplin had a Hitler Hee Hee Ma.

27
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.120
He molded it after modeled after Hitler.
Yeah.

28
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.900
Hitler was a huge fan of Chaplin.
Absolutely.
There's,

29
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.930
there's some crossover there.
Chaplain was a huge fan of Hitler.

30
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.220
Hitler was a fan of chaplains and chaplain just kind of,
you know,

31
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:44.550
cause Chapman was a little bit of a rebel man.
So why the chaplain?

32
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.950
Whereas Mustache,
I think it's like a little tongue in cheek.

33
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.080
How Michael Jordan or mustache boosted sales and let me see that photo.

34
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.500
Wow.
Larger.
Okay.

35
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.890
<v 1>That is so</v>

36
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.340
<v 0>crazy.
That is so crazy.</v>

37
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.630
That is while you've been here,
give it up.

38
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.720
Even Michael motherfucking Jordan.

39
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:10.721
What is the second paragraph say Jordan camouflage is the mustaches to a small

40
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.180
extent with a corresponding soul patch under his bottom lip,

41
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.820
but the lip beard appears to be exactly that.

42
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.760
A beard tried to disguise the Teutonic neighbor upstairs.

43
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.580
Great sentence.
Yeah,
that's a great,

44
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:25.610
that's a great sentence to tonic neighbor to tonic neighbor.

45
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.400
That's really good to tonic means.
Do you know what to tonic means?

46
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:31.220
I've never used that word.
Capitalized it.
Hit it.
Hit it.

47
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.790
Maybe like a probably cause it's not a real word and motherfucker thinks it's a

48
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.890
domain of war or something like some,
okay.
Let's see.

49
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.420
It says relating to towns really into two tones,

50
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:46.040
denoting Germanic branch at the Indo European language family definition.

51
00:02:46.041 --> 00:02:50.840
You're like,
what's the tonic?
So go back to that.
Go back to that statement again.

52
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.740
Back to the statement.
Oh,
they were just reading from,
yeah.
Okay.

53
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.870
Choose a beer to disguise.
It's two tonic neighbor upstairs.
How's that?

54
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.760
So maybe those people wore those stashes.

55
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:08.680
Maybe Hitler got it from those people's dramatic,
dramatic,

56
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.630
maybe it was a dramatic mustache.
Yeah,
maybe it was all a mode of the times.
Yeah.

57
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.570
I mean maybe a bunch of people at Hitler's kind of like how there's full beards

58
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:19.590
now.
This is like as a full beard.
The Hitler of our assistant.

59
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.070
Just like a common beard.

60
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.380
Can you imagine if somebody wrote what rolled around with a Hitler mustache

61
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:30.580
today?
That'd be really wild.
You can't,
you can't.
That's too much.
Right?

62
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.580
But here's what's weird,
and I've talked about this on stage too.

63
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:36.580
Why is it okay to dress like kingus Khan,

64
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.360
who's dressing like gang is con?
If you want to do it for Halloween,

65
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.670
why is it okay?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Like it shouldn't be okay being a Nazi.

66
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.750
You can't be Hitler.
Yeah,
that's,
I mean,
that's just won't let you,
well,

67
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.660
it's also kind of lacking creativity.
Like you want to be a Hitler.

68
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.180
It's like dressing up like a sexy baby.
Are we really doing this?

69
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.020
Is this necessary?
No one needs to see sexy babies.

70
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.510
No one needs to see a Hitler.
Slow your roll.

71
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.020
Some girls should definitely dress like a sexy baby.

72
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.300
Girls can dress like sexy babies,

73
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:10.300
but I can't dress like a baby and open up packages on youtube.

74
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.510
You could dress like a baby and open up packages on youtube.

75
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.570
No one's stopping you.

76
00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:17.980
I'm going to look funny doing visible foes cause you just said that it would be

77
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:20.890
Q and now before.
It wasn't when I wanted to do it.

78
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.880
I don't know what you're talking.
