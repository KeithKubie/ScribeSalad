00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.220
Here We Stand.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.410
Behold Our Bounty!

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.840
Let It Be Written that DNews have the Family,
Duty, Honor to be the Light in the Darkness

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.640
-- Guys.The dire wolf.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.640
It's real.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:15.610
And Winter is Coming.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.349
May the light of the seven shine upon you,
I'm Trace, thanks for tuning in to DNews!

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.640
If you're not familiar, in Game of Thrones,
the family symbol of many of the main characters

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.739
who've died thus far in the series -- spoiler
-- is a direwolf; a massive, intelligent species

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.029
wolf common in the wildlands north of the
Wall.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.980
But, and this is just frickin' amazing…

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.469
The direwolf isn't entirely fictional!

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.690
As late as 12,000 years ago, right here in
the good old Americas, there were dire wolves.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.559
Aaaaaand they might be coming back.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.629
Okay, so the direwolf and the dire wolf are
two different things.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.220
The one word direwolf is fictional, and two
word dire wolf or canis dirus was very real!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.500
In the first season of the TV show, direwolf
pups are played by Northern Inuit Dogs, which

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.660
are bred to look like wolves.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.320
In the later seasons the wolves were played
by actual wolves, because HBO does not do

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
half measures.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.240
This is about the best we can do today, because
actual dire wolves are extinct.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.030
The real life Canis dirus lived between 300,000
and 12,000 years ago, which, as it happens,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.140
was the last time perpetual winter happened
for real.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.009
Dire wolves evolved towards the end of the
Pleistocene epoch, the last great ice age,

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.700
when huge glaciers covered up to 30% of the
Earth’s surface.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.790
At their peak, the ice sheets extended as
far south as what is now Kentucky and were

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.729
almost 4 kilometers thick.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.900
This was the age of megafauna like mammoths,
giant condors, giant beavers, and giants sloths.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.700
Pretty much everything had the word giant
in its name.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.590
For warm blooded animals, being larger meant
retaining heat better, which was an advantage

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.840
during an ice age.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.110
So combine giant prey with colder conditions
and you get a Red Wedding made in heaven for

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.689
bigger predators like dire wolves.

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.439
Dire wolves weren’t quite as huge as George
“valar morghulis” Martin makes them out

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.439
to be**.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.969
An average dire wolf was about 80 cm tall,
the same height of modern gray wolves, but

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.050
they were 25% heavier, weighing up to 67 kilograms.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.080
Their skulls were broader and had a large
crest down the midline that was a good anchor

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.450
point for their strong jaw muscles.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.290
Because of that their bite is estimated to
be 29% stronger than a gray wolf’s, which

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.840
already has the largest bite pressure of any
living canid.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.680
Dire wolves and gray wolves coexisted for
about 100,000 years, but the end of the pleistocene

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.230
was marked with a period of extinction that
wiped out three quarters of the large ice

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.230
age animals.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.680
No one’s really sure why, it may have been
due to climate change or humans getting really

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.280
good at hunting or both, but suddenly all
those giant animals died out.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.510
The dire wolves went the way of the wooly
mammoth and sabre-toothed cat and the Starks,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.370
while their smaller, quicker, bigger-brained
cousins, the gray wolves, survived.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.530
So, you can’t have a dire wolf as a pet
because their genetic lineage hit a dead end

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.890
and most of what we know about them comes
from the skeletons we’ve found in the La

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.680
Brea tar pits, where there were oodles of
dire poodles.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.810
But one dog breeder is aiming to revive them,
or at least the fantasy version of them.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.690
The Dire Wolf Project has been breeding larger,
long-lived dire wolf-alikes since 1988.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.540
After spending 20 years Never Resting, and
breeding Alaskan Malamutes, German Shepherds,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.690
Great Pyrenees, Anatolian Shepherd, and English
Mastiff together -- they created what they

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.269
called the American Alsatian a 59kg shaggy
dog.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.340
Still 8 kilos lighter than a true canis dirus,
but still Growing Strong.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.170
Dogs have been with humanity waaay longer
than we thought, but who actually domesticated

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.170
them?

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.170
Did we do it?

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.359
Or did dogs domesticate themselves?

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.409
