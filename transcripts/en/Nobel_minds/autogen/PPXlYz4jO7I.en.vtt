them about this and I was able to get

00:10:19.549 --> 00:10:19.559
them about this and I was able to get
 

00:10:19.559 --> 00:10:21.679
them about this and I was able to get
Hall or Michael Ross Bosch and Jeffrey

00:10:21.679 --> 00:10:21.689
Hall or Michael Ross Bosch and Jeffrey
 

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:30.220

hall but I haven't reached Michael Young

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:30.230
 

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:36.379
so they just got the news I first got

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:36.389
so they just got the news I first got
 

00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:38.720
so they just got the news I first got
hold of Mike the rosebush and he was

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:38.730
hold of Mike the rosebush and he was
 

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.780
hold of Mike the rosebush and he was
silent and then he said you are kidding

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:41.790
silent and then he said you are kidding
 

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:52.449
silent and then he said you are kidding
me

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:52.459
 

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:56.540
is there any other question yeah I'm

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:56.550
is there any other question yeah I'm
 

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.259
is there any other question yeah I'm
that resist go ahead about the dynamics

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:00.269
that resist go ahead about the dynamics
 

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:03.379
that resist go ahead about the dynamics
of this system so if one were to change

that question well we know that there

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:26.429
that question well we know that there
 

00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:29.660
that question well we know that there
are in rare cases there are humans who

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:29.670
are in rare cases there are humans who
 

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.789
are in rare cases there are humans who

clock there are of course animal
experiments and if you disrupt the clock

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:47.610
experiments and if you disrupt the clock
 

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.340
experiments and if you disrupt the clock
in animals you will get effect on

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.350
in animals you will get effect on
 

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.439
in animals you will get effect on
metabolism and on various physiological

00:11:51.439 --> 00:11:51.449
metabolism and on various physiological
 

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:54.919

melatonin which is a hormone that is
 

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.530
melatonin which is a hormone that is
secreted before we go to sleep and that

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540
secreted before we go to sleep and that
 

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.350

it can also be used to

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360
it can also be used to
 

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.539
it can also be used to
for those kinds of problems and some

00:12:22.539 --> 00:12:22.549
for those kinds of problems and some
 

00:12:22.549 --> 00:12:25.929
for those kinds of problems and some
people even use it for jet lag and also

from the scientific community and then
 

00:14:02.119 --> 00:14:04.179
from the scientific community and then
we investigate whether the discoveries

00:14:04.179 --> 00:14:04.189
we investigate whether the discoveries
 

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:05.919
we investigate whether the discoveries
married this price and that's how we

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:05.929
married this price and that's how we
 

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.499
married this price and that's how we
found them the contribution to humankind

00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:08.509

on midsummer day and it probably helps

us to be aware of the fact that we need

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:32.550
us to be aware of the fact that we need
 

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.600

to be in a dark environment to get the

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.910
to be in a dark environment to get the
best sleep and that we shouldn't be

they started their work it was

they started their work it was
understood that it was endogenous and it

understood that it was endogenous and it

understood that it was endogenous and it
was even understood that single genes

was even understood that single genes

was even understood that single genes
could influence the circadian rhythm but

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200
could influence the circadian rhythm but
 

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.289
could influence the circadian rhythm but
nothing was known about the mechanism

nothing was known about the mechanism
 

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:31.209
nothing was known about the mechanism
and there were different hypotheses but

00:21:31.209 --> 00:21:31.219
and there were different hypotheses but
 

00:21:31.219 --> 00:21:34.299
and there were different hypotheses but
they found out if the mechanism that

00:21:34.299 --> 00:21:34.309
they found out if the mechanism that
 

00:21:34.309 --> 00:21:37.690
they found out if the mechanism that
controls the machinery of the clock so

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:37.700

what so first of all they studied they
 

00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:48.549
what so first of all they studied they
used the fruit fly as a model system and

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559
used the fruit fly as a model system and
 

00:21:48.559 --> 00:21:50.619
used the fruit fly as a model system and
before their work there has been a

00:21:50.619 --> 00:21:50.629
before their work there has been a
 

00:21:50.629 --> 00:21:54.579

they had used the fruit fly to ask can

00:21:57.789 --> 00:21:57.799
they had used the fruit fly to ask can
 

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:01.419
they had used the fruit fly to ask can
you identify mutants that arise due to

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:01.429
you identify mutants that arise due to
 

00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:03.489
you identify mutants that arise due to
mutations in single genes so that was

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:03.499
mutations in single genes so that was
 

00:22:03.499 --> 00:22:06.129
mutations in single genes so that was
sort of a basis before our laureates

00:22:06.129 --> 00:22:06.139
sort of a basis before our laureates
 

00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:07.449
sort of a basis before our laureates
started their work and they took

00:22:07.449 --> 00:22:07.459
started their work and they took
 

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.849
started their work and they took
advantage of that because the the gene

00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:09.859
advantage of that because the the gene
 

00:22:09.859 --> 00:22:12.609
advantage of that because the the gene
wasn't known there were mutant strains

00:22:12.609 --> 00:22:12.619
wasn't known there were mutant strains
 

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:16.089
wasn't known there were mutant strains
known who had long or short or no rhythm

00:22:16.089 --> 00:22:16.099
known who had long or short or no rhythm
 

00:22:16.099 --> 00:22:17.979
known who had long or short or no rhythm
at all that were known to map to the

00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:17.989
at all that were known to map to the
 

00:22:17.989 --> 00:22:20.739
at all that were known to map to the
same locus so the laureates useless

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:20.749
same locus so the laureates useless
 

00:22:20.749 --> 00:22:24.609
same locus so the laureates useless
prize and went on to isolate the gene

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:24.619
prize and went on to isolate the gene
 

00:22:24.619 --> 00:22:27.279
prize and went on to isolate the gene
and to determine what gene it was but

00:22:27.279 --> 00:22:27.289
and to determine what gene it was but
 

00:22:27.289 --> 00:22:28.749
and to determine what gene it was but
that didn't prove the mechanism either

00:22:28.749 --> 00:22:28.759
that didn't prove the mechanism either
 

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:31.389
that didn't prove the mechanism either
so what they then did was experiments to

00:22:31.389 --> 00:22:31.399
so what they then did was experiments to
 

00:22:31.399 --> 00:22:34.239
so what they then did was experiments to
understand the function of the system by

00:22:34.239 --> 00:22:34.249
understand the function of the system by
 

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:36.530
understand the function of the system by
this gene and then several others at the

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:36.540
this gene and then several others at the
 

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.150
this gene and then several others at the
in sequential experiments why is

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:41.160
in sequential experiments why is
 

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.320
in sequential experiments why is
circular rhythm important so we need the

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:45.330
circular rhythm important so we need the
 

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.260
circular rhythm important so we need the
circadian clock to anticipate the daily

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.270
circadian clock to anticipate the daily
 

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.110
circadian clock to anticipate the daily
changes not only adapt but anticipate so

oscillator so you build up a substance
 

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.760

actually so an oscillator and the
