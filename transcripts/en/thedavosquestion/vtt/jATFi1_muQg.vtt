&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
This is Traq Krim.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm the founder of NetVibes and now new CEO
of new company called

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.019
Jolicloud and I'm -- I'm pretty excited about
the Obama presidency.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.570
I think there's lots to be told about the
way he won and the way he

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.109
actually puts, I believe are the most important
things in it and the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.159
ecology at the top of the agenda in his administration.
And in a way I just hope that Europe will

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:32.930
be able to have the same kind
of -- Europe and the rest of the world is

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.790
kind of direction.
So I think the -- Obama is the president of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
United States so he's
really gonna focus on this country but I believe

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
that it's the old
world is looking for some kind of calm-down

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.770
period of time.
Now we need to move focus on things without

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.530
more moral and allow that
are really targeted to help the people along

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.400
the world and I think that
part of what he's going to do will definitely

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.400
help the world going
further and obviously there's lots of hope

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.799
in U.S. There's a lot of
hope in the-- in the -- in the rest of the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.810
world.
He's not a musician meaning that he won't

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.920
be able to fix everything but
I think that if you set the standard far very

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.420
high, there's an
opportunity for doing quite amazing things

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.299
and I'm pretty confident
he'll do it.
