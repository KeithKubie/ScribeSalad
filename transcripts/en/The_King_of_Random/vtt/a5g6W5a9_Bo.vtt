00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.510
Hey guys welcome back, thanks for joining us today on the king of random in the past

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.359
We've done several experiments with dry ice and we've had two viewers

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.439
Give us suggestions of other things to try with the dry ice Daniel milage ask

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.460
How does liquid nitrogen compare to a cooling bath of acetone and dry ice?

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.150
YouTube user like 'whoa says put dry ice in your backyard foundry so like whoa and Daniel mileage today

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.420
we're going to be doing two experiments using extreme heat and extreme cold the first thing we're gonna try is using some dry ice and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:33.058
Acetone to make a supercooled liquid that you can use for some experiments if you're having a hard time getting some liquid, nitrogen

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.989
Dry ice is extremely cold, it's approximately 100 9.3

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.989
degrees Fahrenheit below zero

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.149
Acetone doesn't freeze until one hundred thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit below zero so we can put dry ice in acetone it will

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.550
Supercool the liquid down to the temperature of the dry ice but it won't freeze we don't just want to mix the two together

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.590
So first we're going to use this cup to create a barrier between the acetone and the dry ice for a first step

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.109
Let's take a drill and poke some holes in our cup

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.199
I poked a lot of holes into this cup because I want the acetone to be able to flow in and out of it easily

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.070
Next we're gonna break up some of the dry ice and spread it all around the outside of the cup

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.290
All right now load these all up all around our cup

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.879
Our glass bowl is whining

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.099
That's the the dry is vibrating in very small movements all around the glass

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.190
Just sounds like it's complaining

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.000
The next step is to pour your acetone down into the bowl

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.819
And it should fill the cup as well as all the way around the dry-ice

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.080
Force them directly into the cup to make sure it's getting in there

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.409
You go lots of bubbling going on I'm gonna try adding a little bit more dry ice as well

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.119
Some of it seems to have a sublimed off from the heat of the acetone

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.399
All right now we have a bath of extremely cold acetone

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.300
That's fun and in the middle because we have the holes in the cup

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.059
We have a spot that doesn't have any dry ice in it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.739
So we don't have to worry about whether things are coming in contact with the dry ice all right watch

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.279
What happens when I stick the tip of my glove into the acetone?

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.949
That's very very cold it actually makes the Nitro of my glove get a little bit stiff just from freezing it so much

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.229
Let's see what happens if we freeze a carrot

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.250
Please note never use this cold acetone bath on anything you're going to eat acetone is toxic and not safe for consumption

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.289
All right care it into extremely cold acetone this acetone should be about a hundred and nine degrees below zero Fahrenheit

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800
Here goes

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.029
It's boiling in a similar manner to the liquid nitrogen when you pour it in the heat from the carrot is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.340
Heating up the acetone quite a bit. Hopefully the dry ice is keeping it nice and cold

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.090
Set that in there for a minute

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.300
All

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.419
Right our carrot looks pretty good and frozen

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.639
What I'm going to do at this point is take it out and smash it with a hammer to see if it shatters the way

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.199
We expect a really frozen piece of produce to do quickly before I try that let's make it control by smashing an unfrozen carrot 3

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.800
2

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.800
1

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.190
That kind of exploded a little bit more than I expected it to carrots aren't super squishy, so I guess it makes sense

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.339
We've tried smashing the unfrozen carrot. Let's see how the frozen carrot handles listen to that

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.899
That is not the sound of normal carrot 3 2 1 oh

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.519
My gosh

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.870
That is a very

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.180
Frozen carrot, holy cow that sent shards. I mean the other the unfrozen carrot like broke apart would this like

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.450
explode listen to that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.119
That's a carrot it's shattered to I heaven right there bluey

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.760
Is ice carrot

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.049
Now we know what happens if you freeze a carrot in acetone

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.700
That's over a hundred degrees below zero next I want to try and experiment with a rubber band

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.189
When rubber gets too cold, it loses its elasticity meaning it won't stretch out

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.440
But it also means if it is stretched out it won't contract back in and that's what we're gonna try and do today

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:48.460
What I'm gonna

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.930
Do is take this rubber band fit it on the end of the bamboo skewer and stretch it out and while it's stretched

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.160
I'm going to dip it into our freezing cold acetone. Let's see what happens a

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.279
little bits of carrot floating around in there, but that shouldn't cause any

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.680
That's probably pretty good and cold already it stopped bubbling let's take it out and see what happens if I like over the river band

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.909
Look at that the stretched out portion is staying stretched out

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.340
And then as it warms back up it regains its elasticity as it warms back up this time

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.439
I'm gonna see if I can pull the rubber band out and

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.770
Immediately try and bend it and see if it will break in theory

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.009
It should be able to get cold enough for that but it might just warm up too fast

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.610
And I'm not able to get it alright. Let's see what I can do here

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.010
There it goes

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.129
Snapped a rubber band in half and now it's already warmed up enough that it's starting to be stretchy again. Let's try that again

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.120
Broken I think at this point the responsible thing to do is to put the whole rubber band ball in and see what happens

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.419
Hopefully the acetone is getting in between the rubber bands and down into the middle so it's really freezing it all the way through

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.959
Alright, let's see if I can take this out and see if it has any bounce left to it at all I bet it doesn't

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.960
really have any

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.840
That sounded like a rock put this back in for just a second case. It's warmed up then we're gonna try hitting with a hammer

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.709
One two three well

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.280
Bits of it broke off I did shatter some parts you can see little

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.960
destroyed bits of

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.460
Rubber band just sort of sitting around their impact marks with a hammer hit, and I think as this warms up

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.680
this is gonna start peeling away a lot more as

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.410
One last experiment with our freezing cold acetone and dry ice I'm gonna see what happens if I pour a little bit of water into

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.689
It genuinely have no clue what to expect here

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.929
So I think the water dispersed in the acetone, but it also froze

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:17.410
So I'm pretty sure what we're seeing there are tons of separated individual little ice crystals in a pour some more in

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.080
That just kind of builds up on the sides here weird slushy

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.159
I'm guessing that's a mix of acetone and water

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.340
It certainly smells like a stone wool

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.449
That is spraying everywhere isn't it?

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.650
Now we've tested making a cooling bath that takes acetone down to over a hundred degrees below zero

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:00.340
Let's see what happens if we take dry ice and put it in our backyard foundry dry ice is composed of carbon dioxide

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.449
So it's possible that as it heats up and starts turning into a gas it will put out the flame

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.509
That's one of the things you're gonna find out, and if it doesn't put out the flame

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.450
Let's see what it will do

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.090
Our foundry is nice, and hot let's see what happens when we put in our dry ice

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700
Looking at it so far. It's smaller

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.090
It's still extremely cold of course

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.109
Other than that it doesn't look like it's doing anything really special from the heat

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.950
The fire in the Forge doesn't seem to be affected by the carbon dioxide

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:58.759
I think that there's enough flow from the pressure of the propane that it just blows any excess carbon dioxide right out the top

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.579
Let's see if it makes any difference to put the lid on

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:08.000
There's our dry ice down in the foundry with the lid on it looks like it's glowing orange, but I'm almost positive

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.700
That's just from the ambient light lighting it up

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.229
Well there it is it hasn't seemed to change much

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.680
Except that it's smaller so I'd say the heat does make it dissipate faster, but

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.800
Nothing else is really happening to it

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.600
Well, I'm going to try something else

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.089
I'm going to try heating up these tongs until they're glowing red hot and then touch that directly to the dry ice

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.830
All right, let's see what happens

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:47.589
Well not a lot really

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.899
Not a lot happened, I thought it would do a lot more

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:55.489
I thought the red-hot metal might melt its way through the dry ice kind of like it does with normal ice

00:09:55.589 --> 00:09:58.789
But it just cool off the metal and barely left a dent in the dry ice

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.249
Let's throw the rest of it in see what happens

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.019
Well all of our dry ice is gone

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:19.399
It didn't put out the flame it didn't put off a lot of vapors like it doesn't put it in hot water

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:25.008
It just sort of sublimated into nothingness that whole block took about 10 minutes to disappear in our furnace

00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:28.789
Which is much faster than if you just left it sitting on the counter, but it's not very enjoyable

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:36.350
After pouring all of that water into our supercooled acetone bath something interesting has happened. It's turned into a slush

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.579
So I think this is about half water and half acetone

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.999
So I'm going to scoop it out put it on a brick and light it on fire

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:54.690
Not entirely sure what's making it bubble like that here goes

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.429
Oh, it's actually on fire. It's just acetone burning so it's very clear. It's hard to see

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.040
Well that is burning right now

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.260
Burning snow. You don't see that every day

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:19.400
It's still really cold it's on fire, but it's freezing cold like if I touch part of it

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.519
It's very cold to the touch, but it's on fire

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.469
It's freezing cold and on fire at the same time that was freezing my hand and burning my hand

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:33.140
Different parts of my finger at the same time. Oh and now our acetone is all just running off and pouring off and

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.640
We've used this brick for some colored smoke powder before and the acetone has been pulling that off of the brick

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.640
And so we're getting this pink stain as it runs

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.620
There you have it two experiments using dry ice one a method of making an extremely cold liquid bath using

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:56.749
Acetone the other putting dry ice into our backyard foundry with the acetone bath

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:00.830
we were able to supercool rubber and produce and both of them became very brittle and

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.799
Lost all their elasticity when they were completely frozen in the acetone with the dry ice in the foundry it turned into gas

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.320
Faster than it normally would if it were just sitting out on the counter

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:16.339
But it wasn't really very entertaining nothing spectacular happened the co2 wasn't enough to put out the fire. It just kind of

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:23.300
Disappeared a special shout-out to Daniel mileage and likewho for your suggestions on what we should try check your youtube inbox

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.390
We're sending you 25 bucks if you have any ideas for any

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.979
Experiments or projects you want us to try let us know down in the comments if we end up using your idea will send you

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.950
25 dollars acetone is easily available at most hardware stores, so this is an experiment you probably can try at home

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.739
Just be sure you wear protective gloves and eyewear at all times

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:43.579
Thanks for joining us today for these projects and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.469
It's bouncy again, this is cleanup

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.209
Don't let on fire

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:55.969
Three two one hang on I'm going to put my safety glasses on

00:12:58.940 --> 00:12:59.650
Hey guys

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:05.410
Did you know that we're on Twitter Instagram and Facebook as well all at the king of random and every platform has a different purpose

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.710
So go scroll through the histories check out what we're doing. I'll see you there
