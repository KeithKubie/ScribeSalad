00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030
I had done and it's turned out to be
 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.570
I had done and it's turned out to be
very generative for me to have the

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580
very generative for me to have the
 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.300
very generative for me to have the
opportunity to do that it is again

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310
opportunity to do that it is again
 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.100
opportunity to do that it is again
partly because I am germinating new

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110
partly because I am germinating new
 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.830
partly because I am germinating new
projects and so it's it's it's really

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840
projects and so it's it's it's really
 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.990
projects and so it's it's it's really
useful to get to do that so thank you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000
useful to get to do that so thank you
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.339
useful to get to do that so thank you
for the opportunity so indeed one of my

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349
for the opportunity so indeed one of my
 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.600
for the opportunity so indeed one of my
goals tonight is to use that process of

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610
goals tonight is to use that process of
 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.830
goals tonight is to use that process of
reflection to just underscore and tell

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840
reflection to just underscore and tell
 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.420
reflection to just underscore and tell
you a little bit about where

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430
you a little bit about where
 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.090
you a little bit about where
now with my interest in and I think it's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100
now with my interest in and I think it's
 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.370
now with my interest in and I think it's
one that a lot of you share and is

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380
one that a lot of you share and is
 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.850
one that a lot of you share and is
certainly on the agenda for the lecture

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860
certainly on the agenda for the lecture
 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.810
certainly on the agenda for the lecture
series this year to think about whether

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820
series this year to think about whether
 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.480
series this year to think about whether
oral history as a practice could be an

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490
oral history as a practice could be an
 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.650
oral history as a practice could be an
alternative to medicine and one way in

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660
alternative to medicine and one way in
 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.660
alternative to medicine and one way in
which dot has come up I think part the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670
which dot has come up I think part the
 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.330
which dot has come up I think part the
series is connected with the program in

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340
series is connected with the program in
 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.910
series is connected with the program in
narrative medicine and Rita Charan is

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920
narrative medicine and Rita Charan is
 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.010
narrative medicine and Rita Charan is
someone who has had the opportunity to

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020
someone who has had the opportunity to
 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.420
someone who has had the opportunity to
share the podium with us I think in some

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430
share the podium with us I think in some
 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.460
share the podium with us I think in some
of the summer Institute's and her work

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470
of the summer Institute's and her work
 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.310
of the summer Institute's and her work
has been very interesting to me but in

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320
has been very interesting to me but in
 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.770
has been very interesting to me but in
addition to thinking about oral history

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780
addition to thinking about oral history
 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.260
addition to thinking about oral history
as a kind of narrative medicine I would

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270
as a kind of narrative medicine I would
 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.040
as a kind of narrative medicine I would
want to amplify that to suggest that if

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050
want to amplify that to suggest that if
 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.770
want to amplify that to suggest that if
it is medicine of a narrative kind it it

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780
it is medicine of a narrative kind it it
 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.820
it is medicine of a narrative kind it it
like also the value of world history

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830
like also the value of world history
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.190
like also the value of world history
might lie not just in its ability to

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200
might lie not just in its ability to
 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.070
might lie not just in its ability to
produce narrative but its ability to

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080
produce narrative but its ability to
 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.100
produce narrative but its ability to
produce scenes of encounter that include

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110
produce scenes of encounter that include
 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.400
produce scenes of encounter that include
a lot of performative dimensions we were

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410
a lot of performative dimensions we were
 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.230
a lot of performative dimensions we were
talking about this in a little session

think just from even getting a little

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180
think just from even getting a little
 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.740
think just from even getting a little
bit of a sense from some of you in this

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750
bit of a sense from some of you in this
 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.140
bit of a sense from some of you in this
year's cohort of your projects that many

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150
year's cohort of your projects that many
 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.820
year's cohort of your projects that many
of you are interested in the ways in

of you are interested in the ways in
 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.340
of you are interested in the ways in
which oral history might be an

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350
which oral history might be an
 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.409
which oral history might be an
alternative to medicine because of its

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419
alternative to medicine because of its
 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:56.219
alternative to medicine because of its
capacity to build relationships

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229
capacity to build relationships
 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:57.780

communities it's not just about

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790
communities it's not just about
 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.790
communities it's not just about
communities of spending what some of you

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800
communities of spending what some of you
 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.560
communities of spending what some of you
are trying to document but it's also

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:01.570
are trying to document but it's also
 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.690
are trying to document but it's also
about building alternative social

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700
about building alternative social
 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.600
about building alternative social
structures whether because of the

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610
structures whether because of the
 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.070
structures whether because of the
relationships you build in the

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080
relationships you build in the
 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.040
relationships you build in the
engineering process or because of what

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050
engineering process or because of what
 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.170

after the fact so many of us I think try
 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.409
after the fact so many of us I think try
to pay attention not just to collecting

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419
to pay attention not just to collecting
 

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.409
to pay attention not just to collecting
the information but to try to make sure

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419
the information but to try to make sure

it does some work in the world after it
 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.140
it does some work in the world after it

agenda item for the evening is to think
 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:43.529
agenda item for the evening is to think
about that and then the other main goal

about that and then the other main goal
 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:46.350
about that and then the other main goal
in some ways it may supersede the first

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360
in some ways it may supersede the first
 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.270
