We have another question
from the audience.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.658
- [Blake] It's funny though.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:12.492
I thought it was,

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:13.326

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.067
- [Adam] No you, you.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:21.901
No, it's fine, you just.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.002
- Should I go now?

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:23.937
- [Panel] Stay.

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:24.771
- It's me.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.605
- [Adam] Stay you go.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:26.439
- Are you sure.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.273

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:28.107

(audience ahs)

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:37.750
- Well, uh.

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.654
First off, I was really.

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.855
- What the hell happened?

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.057 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What the hell
happened back there?

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.159
That was just a wave
of laughter so far away

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.393
from anything that happened.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.828
- It's like half the
audience saw something

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:49.696
that none of us saw.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:50.563
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:52.031
- Shit.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.600
What's your question sir?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.835
- So first off I want to say
that I was really bummed out

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.004 align:start size:84% position:16%
when I found out
Jet Set passed away.

00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.272
- [Adam] Oh.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.206
- He was one of my
favorite characters.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:00.873
- Way to bring the mood down.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:02.242
- I'm sorry.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:03.309
(audience laughs)

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.143
I'm sorry.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:04.978
- RIP Jet Set.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.145
- RIP Jet Set.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.313 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay but my
actual question is,

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.715
- He was like an extra to Adam.

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:09.782 align:start position:0%
- [Announcer] Thanks for
bringing the mood down asshole.

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:10.984
- It's okay.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.085
- Is it at least a tight?

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:12.885 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Yeah.
- Alright.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.354
- Rest in peace Jet Set.

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:16.422
- We probably wanna take this
and say something serious.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:17.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
Say something serious
about this right,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.591
this must have been a,

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:19.525
- Yeah it was fucked up.

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.960
- Very sad.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.228
- It was.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:23.563
- Finished our like
last day of shooting

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:24.397
- Second to last.

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:25.832
- Second to last.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:27.634 align:start position:0%
- Second to last and then
didn't come up for the last day.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.703 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And Jet Set was always on
set, like on time with a smile

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.071 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then it was like
where's Jet Set,

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.506
something's up?

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:34.674
- You knew something was up.

00:04:34.674 --> 00:04:35.742
- It was a bummer.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.944
- He was the coolest,

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:42.115
we hired him as just like
in an extra casting book

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.486 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we were going
through and we were like,

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:47.487
holy shit.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.488
(audience laughs)

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:49.722
We have to hire this guy.

00:04:49.722 --> 00:04:50.657 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- His name is Jet Set.

00:04:50.657 --> 00:04:51.891
- Coolest stinking man ever.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.626
- He looked like he was
from the future past.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:55.428 align:start size:75% position:25%
Yeah.
- [Anders] Yeah.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.930 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You're like what
generation is this guy from?

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.066 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Homie had a look.
- yeah, yeah.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:01.501 align:start size:84% position:16%
- With a hard K.
- Very particular look

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.671 align:start size:94% position:6%
and his name legitimately
was Jet Set Hudson.

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:05.505
- Yeah.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:06.339
- So.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:07.173
- We had to meet him.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.007
- Very castable.

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:09.442
- Yeah.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:10.643 align:start size:94% position:6%
- But what was your
actual question before you

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.145 align:start size:84% position:16%
blew the whole
fucking mood in here?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.413
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.514
(burps)

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.350
- Adam, Adam, Adam come back.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.052
- [Questioner] My
actual question was

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
I know you guys are
still writing this season

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:23.323
but how percentage could be
reoccurring characters like,

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.490
- Recurring.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.259
Reoccurring, recurring.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.360
- I do that to man.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.895
