00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's do a few more examples of
finding the limit of functions

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.020
as x approaches infinity
or negative infinity.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.870
So here I have this
crazy function.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.110
9x to the seventh
minus 17x to the sixth,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.340
plus 15 square roots of x.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.540
All of that over 3x to
the seventh plus 1,000x

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.320
to the fifth, minus
log base 2 of x.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.500
So what's going to happen
as x approaches infinity?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.810
And the key here, like we've
seen in other examples,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.410
is just to realize which
terms will dominate.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.940
So for example,
in the numerator,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.680
out of these three terms,
the 9x to the seventh

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.660
is going to grow much faster
than any of these other terms.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.460
So this is the dominating
term in the numerator.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.800
And in the denominator,
3x to the seventh

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.220
is going to grow much faster
than an x to the fifth term,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.190
and definitely much faster
than a log base 2 term.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.150
So at infinity, as we get
closer and closer to infinity,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.250
this function is going
to be roughly equal to 9x

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.070
to the seventh over
3x to the seventh.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.899
And so we can say,
especially since,

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.190
as we get larger and larger
as we get closer and closer

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.360
to infinity, these
two things are

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.347
going to get closer
and closer each other.

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:07.930
We could say this
limit is going to be

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.850
the same thing as this limit.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.940
Which is going to be
equal to the limit

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.340
as x approaches infinity.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.640
Well, we can just cancel
out the x to the seventh.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.380
So it's going to
be 9/3, or just 3.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.460
Which is just going to be 3.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.740
So that is our limit, as
x approaches infinity,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.646
in all of this craziness.

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:28.770
Now let's do the same with
this function over here.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.275
Once again, crazy function.

00:01:30.275 --> 00:01:31.650
We're going to
negative infinity.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.310
But the same principles apply.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.940
Which terms dominate as
the absolute value of x

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.420
get larger and
larger and larger?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.960
As x gets larger in magnitude.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.820
Well, in the numerator, it's
the 3x to the third term.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.020
In the denominator it's
the 6x to the fourth term.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.730
So this is going to be the
same thing as the limit of 3x

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.940
to the third over 6x to
the fourth, as x approaches

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.304
negative infinity.

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:57.720
And if we simplified
this, this is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.950
going to be equal to the
limit as x approaches

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.850
negative infinity of 1 over 2x.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.900
And what's this going to be?

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.800
Well, if the denominator,
even though it's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.510
becoming a larger and larger
and larger negative number,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.700
it becomes 1 over a very,
very large negative number.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.930
Which is going to get us
pretty darn close to 0.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.850
Just as 1 over x, as x
approaches negative infinity,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.490
gets us close to 0.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.820
So this right over here,
the horizontal asymptote

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.362
in this case, is
y is equal to 0.

00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:30.820
And I encourage you to graph
it, or try it out with numbers

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.920
to verify that for yourself.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.540
The key realization here
is to simplify the problem

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.100
by just thinking
about which terms

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.979
are going to dominate the rest.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:43.270
Now let's think about this one.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.240
What is the limit of
this crazy function

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.520
as x approaches infinity?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.645
Well, once again, what
are the dominating terms?

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:52.270
In the numerator, it's 4x to the
fourth, and in the denominator

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.500
it's 250x to the third.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.280
These are the
highest degree terms.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.720
So this is going to be the
same thing as the limit,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:08.760
as x approaches infinity, of
4x to the fourth over 250x

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.920
to the third.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.880
Which is going to be the same
thing as the limit of-- let's

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.920
see, 4, well I
could just-- this is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.635
going to be the same thing
as-- well we could divide two hundred

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:19.460
and, well, I'll just
leave it like this.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.120
It's going to be the
limit of 4 over 250.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.730
x to the fourth divided by
x to the third is just x.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.590
Times x, as x
approaches infinity.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.340
Or we could even say this
is going to be 4/250 times

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.170
the limit, as x
approaches infinity of x.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.980
Now what's this?

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.820
What's the limit of x as
x approaches infinity?

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.810
Well, it's just going
to keep growing forever.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.290
So this is just going to
be, this right over here

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.498
is just going to be infinity.

00:03:48.498 --> 00:03:50.460
Infinity times some
number right over here

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.830
is going to be infinity.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.660
So the limit as x approaches
infinity of all of this,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.280
it's actually unbounded.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.541
It's infinity.

00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:59.540
And a kind of obvious way
of seeing that, right,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.800
from the get go, is to
realize that the numerator has

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.921
a fourth degree term.

00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:06.920
While the highest degree
term in the denominator

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.560
is only a third degree term.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.510
So the numerator is
going to grow far faster

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.000
than the denominator.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.964
So if the numerator
is growing far faster

00:04:14.964 --> 00:04:16.380
than the denominator,
you're going

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.769
to approach infinity
in this case.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.555
If the numerator is growing
slower than the denominator,

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:26.530
if the denominator is growing
far faster than the numerator,

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.790
like this case, you
are then approaching 0.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.750
So hopefully you find
that a little bit useful.
