00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.080
Alright. Hey guys, sorry. Hey, we're here now. Peter. Simon, Simon,

2
00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:07.970
how are you man? I'm doing well and yourself? Good.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.110
<v 1>Okay. Uh, who's who? Um, Peter is a DJ. Peter Rosenberg from hot 97.</v>

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.520
Simon Adler is a journalist.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.030
Our Pal Andrew Moran from the New Yorker is also in the room and Robert and I

6
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:18.720
are in the back.

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.420
<v 0>Good. Well, uh, we have all gathered here today to talk about, uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.270
the wonderful world of professional wrestling,

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.493
<v 2>my favorite world.</v>

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.470
<v 1>So yes,</v>

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.440
we're going to talk about professional wrestling for the first half of the show.

12
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:36.810
And we realize there's probably a lot of you out there listening right now who

13
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.340
are like,

14
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.620
<v 0>seriously guys, there are people like, wait, you're 35 years old.</v>

15
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.270
Do you love wrestling? I get this a lot if I'm tweeting about it a lot,

16
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.870
I get tweets that go, you know, it's fake, right? It's like,

17
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.540
we'll do I write you that when you tweet about your favorite movie,

18
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.020
it's entertainment. The awesome thing about wrestling is,

19
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.950
is that there are these random things that are a little bit real,

20
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.710
and sometimes those moments of real, this can just be like,

21
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.890
<v 2>oh, [inaudible],</v>

22
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.363
<v 1>they can change everything.</v>

23
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.803
<v 2>Oh,</v>

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.290
<v 1>now if you're like me and you grew up in the 80s, a,</v>

25
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.830
you might remember wrestling is like, you know how close versus Andre the giant,

26
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:20.200
these epic matchups that were kind of great but also sort of ridiculous and

27
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.120
cartoonish? Well, according to Peter Rosenberg,

28
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.800
there was a moment where wrestling started to sort of tinker with reality and a

29
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:32.330
much more nuanced and a fascinating way. In fact,

30
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:35.510
you could argue that pro wrestling became re instantiation.

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.510
<v 0>I love the Baroque Movement of the 16th century, but the postmodern twist,</v>

32
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.530
I know people who would, and you're going to meet them.

33
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.670
<v 1>I'm Jad. I'm Robert. This is Radiolab. Ed. Uh, according to Peter,</v>

34
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.070
this whole thing's where we're going to start.

35
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:53.510
This whole thing goes back to this moment called the Montreal screw job.

36
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.140
The Montreux screw job was above anything else that had ever happened or that

37
00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:00.260
will ever probably ever happen again because it was odor,

38
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.260
reality transpiring right there in the ring.

39
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.400
I mean it was when real life just came and tore a hole

40
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.963
<v 2>in the fiction.</v>

41
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.230
<v 1>That guy you just heard is David Shoemaker.</v>

42
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.380
I write about professional wrestling for Grantland and the guy you're about to

43
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:23.370
hear is journalists, Simon Adler. He will take the story from here. Okay,

44
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.420
<v 0>so the moment in question really centers around this one guy named Brett,</v>

45
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.350
<v 3>they hit man hug.</v>

46
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.890
Brett Hart is seen by many to be the greatest entering performer of all time.

47
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.860
He was one of the good guys. I am

48
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.920
<v 2>the [inaudible]</v>

49
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.330
<v 3>business. They call him a baby face. Is that what you call the good guys?</v>

50
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.160
A good guy in wrestling. He's the baby face.

51
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.320
He was my favorite wrestler as a kid. I didn't understand why at the time,

52
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.070
but now I do. It's because he did everything

53
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.440
<v 4>so well and in that era,</v>

54
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.170
the mid to late eighties when I fell in love with him.

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.130
So many guys were just big and hawking and a little bit clumsy,

56
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.460
but Brett did the kind of work that you could show to someone who's,

57
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.080
who's never watched wrestling.

58
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.320
I think they could see the art and I think they could see how it's,

59
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.470
it's like ballet or a million other arts

60
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.040
<v 0>forms. What he means,</v>

61
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.130
and you can kind of see this when you watch all Brett Hart matches on youtube.

62
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.840
He's gliding through the air, bouncing off the mat, off the ropes,

63
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.360
<v 5>tell stories brilliantly within the way he executes a map.</v>

64
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.820
<v 0>So wrestling is scripted, but there's a lot of improv going on there.</v>

65
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:45.660
The set beats,

66
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.490
he knew how to take those moments and in that Improv make you think,

67
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.830
oh shoot, he's about to lose. And then, yeah.

68
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.730
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

69
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.650
<v 0>he was a natural born wrestler,</v>

70
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.830
<v 5>you know, his father was a, was a legendary wrestler. His brother, Owen</v>

71
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:05.900
<v 6>legendary wrestler</v>

72
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.700
<v 7>comes from this Canadian wrestling royalty.</v>

73
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.260
Me As a kid growing up,

74
00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:17.261
I had the ability to watch the A or had the fortune to watch these varied

75
00:04:17.871 --> 00:04:20.210
wrestling styles and techniques and stuff.

76
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 0>That's Brett Hart. In an interview in 2000 on fresh air.</v>

77
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.460
And he says it's some of his earliest memories as a kid.

78
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.520
Were these massive dudes showing up to his house and hanging out in his basement

79
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.443
with his dad?

80
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.920
<v 7>No. Even then my dad was, you know, I'll say 60,</v>

81
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.660
<v 0>who is teaching them how to be wrestlers,</v>

82
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.720
<v 7>pull on these old wooly tights.</v>

83
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.520
And then he would wrestle with these guys and he would literally put them in

84
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:47.580
wrestling, holds these submission wrestling holds, which is his obsession.

85
00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:48.414
And uh,

86
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.340
he would torture these big huge football players for hours and they would scream

87
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.040
literally these high pitched screams. It was terrifying.

88
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:58.320
I'd be upstairs in the room above it and as I got older,

89
00:04:58.321 --> 00:05:01.920
I would go down and actually venture into the room and sit on the bench and

90
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:02.850
watch. And uh,

91
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.410
he would sometimes these wrestlers would run out when my dad finally let them

92
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:09.750
go. They'd actually run out, tear out of the,

93
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.520
out the doorway and out the outside, sometimes in the snow and run out with the,

94
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.390
in their bare feet. And you won't even see them again.

95
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.490
<v 5>I mean there's a legendary, so many legendary stories about the Hart family,</v>

96
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:21.600
but you, you know, my favorite among many is, uh,

97
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.590
the bear that lived in their backyard during the summers because at the time

98
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.030
wrestling a bear was a thing that would actually happen from time to time. No,

99
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:36.010
really. And, uh, Brett tells a story in his book, um, about,

100
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.610
you know, just sitting there and letting the bear lick his toes. I mean,

101
00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:43.990
like this is, this is a life that they, that he lived and he was, he was so in,

102
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.280
it was so ingrained in him.

103
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.710
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

104
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.700
<v 6>so in the early eighties, Brett was working for his dad's company up in Canada.</v>

105
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.330
And while that's going on in Canada, there's this guy, Vince McMahon,

106
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.510
back in the u s who is building kind of this wrestling empire. It basically,

107
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.530
he's buying up all of these small promoters from across the country and

108
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.970
eventually goes up into Canada and buys out breads, dad's company.

109
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.260
<v 7>I bought it in 1984. They paid them a certain amount of money to stop running,</v>

110
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.940
just to kind of go out of business. And then they took on, uh,

111
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.440
some of his better wrestlers at the time,

112
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.500
which was myself and I had a couple of brother-in-laws.

113
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.480
<v 0>And shortly thereafter,</v>

114
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.593
<v 9>Jared,</v>

115
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.250
<v 0>the WWF comes under fire,</v>

116
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.270
<v 10>Paul Kogan and other world wrestling federation stars have taken the offensive</v>

117
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.540
against accusations that many have been steroid abuse,

118
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.310
monster mentality,

119
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.310
red to widespread steroid abuse in the world wrestling federation. So

120
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.190
<v 6>there's this big steroid crisis.</v>

121
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.220
Vince has to deal with all of this litigation and he kind of needs to rebrand

122
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.790
his organization. He needs a new good guy, a new champion, a new baby face.

123
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.920
And he looks to Brett

124
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.620
<v 0>for that for a couple of reasons. According to David Shoemaker.</v>

125
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.480
One is that he's a traditionalist, sort of a throwback to an earlier time too.

126
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.110
He's not that big. So when you see him, you don't think steroids guys,

127
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.290
definitely, yeah. Roid rage. And so he saw all that in Brett Hart.

128
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.100
So during the 90s, Vince makes Brett a really big star.

129
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.093
<v 9>Hey Scott,</v>

130
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.010
<v 11>face of the company. I mean, he was on the Simpsons. He was a really,</v>

131
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:25.150
really big star. You know,

132
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:27.760
there are people who criticize Brett for saying he wasn't that fun or he took

133
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:30.670
himself too seriously, but he was a serious worker.

134
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.280
He took wrestling very seriously for myself.

135
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:38.281
Really fighting hard to actually survive and come out of it could actually come

136
00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:43.681
out of the wrestling profession someday is as a success rather than a wrestling

137
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:47.780
tragedy, which is what so many of them turn out.

138
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.350
<v 0>Okay. So fast forward to 1995, 1996 at the time,</v>

139
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.330
a major rivalry was starting between the WWF that is Vince McMahon's company and

140
00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:05.070
the WCW, um, which was ted Turner's company, Ted Turner,

141
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.480
multichip air.

142
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.960
And one of his big tactics is I'm just going to start buying all of the

143
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:13.350
wrestlers from the WWF, from Vince McMahon's organization.

144
00:08:13.351 --> 00:08:14.790
So he's offering them more money,

145
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:18.420
he's offering them longer contracts and he was just like flooding it with money

146
00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:22.080
to steal all the stars from WWF. And then in late 1996,

147
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.150
Brett got an offer. [inaudible] really went in for the kill from WCW.

148
00:08:27.151 --> 00:08:29.970
That was huge. Two point $8 million.

149
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.370
<v 9>I mean you have to show us the common sense, you know,</v>

150
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.720
first of all you've got to do what's right for your family, but I mean,

151
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.660
how much money do you need?

152
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:40.430
Sometimes I find myself torn between trying to do the right thing for my family

153
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.500
and at the same time show my loyalties.

154
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.660
<v 0>It's a clip of Brett talking in a documentary that was being filmed at the time</v>

155
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.760
called wrestling with shadows, which is fantastic.

156
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:53.170
The filmmaker Paul Jay was nice enough to let us play some clips. In any case,

157
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.630
Brett gets this offer and he's kind of this terrible decision to make because

158
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.390
Vince gave him a lot. You know,

159
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.400
he really gave him his life and initially Brett decides there's no way I'm going

160
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:05.270
to leave. You know?

161
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.720
I think my relationship with with Vince McMahon was always sort of like a father

162
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.030
and I sort of saw myself. If I left,

163
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.790
it would have been a little bit like leaving my dad,

164
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.650
especially when the chips are down.

165
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.040
He really did see Vince as a father figure. So Brett goes to Vinson,

166
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.310
basically says, convince me to stay. They went back and forth.

167
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:27.890
There was conversation about him signing a long term deal,

168
00:09:27.891 --> 00:09:32.450
a 20 year deal with WWF. Not for as much money, but for guaranteed security.

169
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.000
Vince said, I can't afford to pay you that.

170
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.550
<v 9>Just talk to Vince. Nope.</v>

171
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.030
<v 0>In the documentary, Brett and his wife, they're sitting at a kitchen table.</v>

172
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.010
<v 9>Are you saying he goes,</v>

173
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.660
nobody wants Brett Hart more than Minspeck man. Why is he letting you go?

174
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.950
He can't afford to compete with Turner. He said,

175
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.420
turners hell bent on trying to put them out of business.

176
00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.790
I got to think about everything. I got to think about everything.

177
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.480
Just see what makes sense. Call Eric.

178
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.490
Can we cut this off now for a little while? Okay.

179
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.710
<v 0>Ultimately it became clear that Brett would have to go take the money.</v>

180
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.140
I can't help but feel really heartbroken and disappointed though,

181
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.160
<v 9>dawn, that I left this company.</v>

182
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:27.803
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

183
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.470
<v 12>so this really gets to the heart of it. Once Brett decides he's going to leave,</v>

184
00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.050
they have to figure out how, how are they going to make his exit?

185
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.950
This is really the pivotal question behind all of this.

186
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.320
<v 0>Yeah. You know the, it's a very, very delicate situation.</v>

187
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.330
That's Vince Russo and this was sort of his problem to solve because he worked

188
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:55.310
for Vince McMahon. You know,

189
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:58.230
you could say I was his right hand man because I was writing the show.

190
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.320
He was part of the team that scripted. Who would win, who would lose,

191
00:11:01.321 --> 00:11:03.460
how it would happen, you know, I mean, I was, you know,

192
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.080
literally putting this show on paper, oh, you know, once a week. Wait,

193
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:10.350
why is this a hard question? I mean, can you just pick up and leave? Well,

194
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.860
because he's the champion. He has the belt, the physical belt,

195
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.390
the giant golden like belt buckle thing and that belt is the symbol of the

196
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:22.020
company and everybody in it, everybody working behind the scenes,

197
00:11:22.021 --> 00:11:24.570
everybody who was trying to support their family,

198
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.800
that belt was a representation of all that.

199
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.890
That the worst thing that could happen is your champion walking away with the

200
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.450
belt, driven up to the new company,

201
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.470
holding up the championship from the old company where they could just defile it

202
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:40.260
if they wanted to. That was not an option for Vince McMahon.

203
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.600
This isn't a perfect comparison,

204
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:47.310
but the closest thing I've come up to in my mind is it would be like Lebron

205
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.310
James quitting his contract with Nike and then showing up in an commercial and

206
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:58.480
taking a piss into a pair of Nike's. So you know, Vince,

207
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.330
at the end of the day, he just had to get that belt off of bread.

208
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.340
So their initial thought, their first plan was probably the simplest option.

209
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:11.230
There was a match coming up, this big event, a paper view event in Montreal,

210
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.960
Brett being the champion of the company,

211
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.230
he should just lose to the number two guy in the company, Shawn Michaels.

212
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.550
Vince loved Sean. I mean really thought Sean was a mega star,

213
00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:23.190
which he was right about. Clearly Sean was next in line.

214
00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.330
So they pitched this idea to Brett and Brett was like, I can't do that.

215
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.470
Okay. For one, he thinks Sean is an idiot.

216
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.970
<v 13>It's got this premadonna personality. I mean,</v>

217
00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.840
he thinks he's better than everyone else and is simply very arrogant.

218
00:12:36.841 --> 00:12:37.800
And I'm noxious about him

219
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.770
<v 3>cause he was, he was a showman. He would hump the ring,</v>

220
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.550
just like do ridiculous things and like to be

221
00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.600
<v 0>Brett. Shaun was the triumph of style over substance. Also,</v>

222
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:52.690
you're asking Brett to wrap up his career in the WWE with a loss in Montreal in

223
00:12:53.751 --> 00:12:55.820
Canada where he is a national hero.

224
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:56.840
<v 13>I described the events.</v>

225
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.460
I'd just assume blow my brains out would be the same what you're asking me to do

226
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.270
from a character standpoint, that's what I would be doing. Brett, the hit man.

227
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.650
Hardwood. Blow his brains out.

228
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.250
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

229
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.780
<v 13>Oh, the whole thing's been hard. Okay.</v>

230
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.033
<v 3>Day of the match.</v>

231
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.580
Still nothing has been decided as to how the match is going to end.

232
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.110
Brett is backstage and eventually he goes to Vince to have a conversation.

233
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:29.410
Right.

234
00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.880
I gotta just talk the documentary crews filming all of this and at this point

235
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:37.390
Vince says, no, I don't want any cameras in here. Get those Outta here.

236
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.190
And so Brett actually ends up wearing a wire to document the conversation that's

237
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:43.030
about to happen.

238
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.710
<v 13>I never ever want to leave here with any kind of bad feeling,</v>

239
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.010
but this week has been a bad week for me. I feel kind of betrayed a little bit.

240
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.380
Well, I go to a little bit, and again I'll,

241
00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:53.480
we're talking about really is check turnaround.

242
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.050
That's what's coming between you and me and that's all.

243
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.600
I can't tell you how appreciative I will always be for everything you've done.

244
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.150
I didn't want to leave with any problems and I actually didn't want to leave it

245
00:14:02.151 --> 00:14:05.360
all and then it's a point where there was no other choice but to go the way this

246
00:14:05.361 --> 00:14:07.040
whole thing has been depicted.

247
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.580
It's really hard for me as a hero here to come up short this weekend.

248
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:13.970
What would you want to do today then? I'm opening a new,

249
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.610
I think what I'd like to do is get through today.

250
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:18.840
I think tomorrow I should just go in and do my,

251
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.120
<v 3>so Brett suggests that this ends in disqualification, right?</v>

252
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.110
Usually what that means is something called a laws or whatever you want.

253
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.500
Typically in a Shmata,

254
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.470
the ring is just flooded with a bunch of wrestlers and chaos into the referee

255
00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:34.900
usually is thrown out of the ring

256
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.640
<v 0>and it ends in some sort of draw.</v>

257
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.770
Brett would then appear on Monday night raw the next day and turn over the belt.

258
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.840
That is what he planned on doing too.

259
00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:46.450
That way he could turn over the belt but not lose. Exactly.

260
00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.330
And eventually Vince says, okay, fine.

261
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.753
<v 13>I'm anyway,</v>

262
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.850
<v 3>like I said before on the term well</v>

263

286
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.823
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

287
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.110
<v 3>Oh, the drama. So around nine,</v>

288
00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:33.140
20:00 PM 20,000 people in the stands,

289
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.070
countless television screens across the country. Shawn Michaels come

290
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:42.570
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

291
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.970
<v 3>he comes out singing his own theme side. I think I'm cute. I know.</v>

292
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:51.050
Unsexy singing karaoke style. It's prerecorded of him singing.

293
00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:54.800
That's an approach. Yeah, he's got his hair in a ponytail.

294
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.770
He's wearing his trademark black spandex pants,

295
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:02.360
but hearts all over them like he is the manifestation of everything that Brett

296
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:07.340
despises. And then outcomes.

297
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.010
Brett Hart waving a Canadian flag

298
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:12.850
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

299
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.390
<v 3>and he walked into the ring to, gets in, takes off the championship belt,</v>

300
00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:19.720
hands it to the ref. And before the match even officially begin.

301
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.820
Shawn flies it Brett and just start

302
00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:32.843
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

303
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.400
<v 3>John and Brett, they're going at each other.</v>

304
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:36.400
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

305
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.100
<v 3>it's sort of like real ferocity pretty quick. They're outside the ring.</v>

306
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:45.850
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

307
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.683
<v 3>picks up Shawn,</v>

308
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.990
Chuck's him over the security railing into the from John

309
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.790
[inaudible]. Then there's this moment where Brett picks Shawn up to that.

310
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.270
Sean's legs are straight up in the air and then

311
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.780
<v 2>rent just slams him on his back.</v>

312
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.230
In. All of this is script.

313
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.300
<v 3>Yeah. Everything I know about it is like they're following the,</v>

314
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.520
the narrative arc, but like they know, okay,

315
00:18:15.521 --> 00:18:18.990
we're going to fight her out outside the ring for a while and then x, y,

316
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.600
z will happen, and so

317
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.990
<v 2>eventually Brett throws Sean back into the rain</v>

318
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.820
and then

319
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.730
<v 3>you get to a point when the match,</v>

320
00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:32.660
which feels very early in the match where Brett climbs onto the turnbuckle,

321
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.960
which is the corner post of the room. He gets up on top of that.

322
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.260
<v 2>Canada pulls himself off the turnbuckle</v>

323
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:43.070
<v 3>Rudy air towards Sean. Mike, Super dramatic.</v>

324
00:18:43.071 --> 00:18:44.750
He's kind of floating in the air there for a moment.

325
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.510
<v 2>And then [inaudible] hitman.</v>

326
00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.980
<v 3>What Sean does right before bread is about to come and hit him,</v>

327
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:58.910
he pulls the referee in between Brett and Sean,

328
00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.150
a human shield of sorts. Brett hits the referee,

329
00:19:02.151 --> 00:19:05.300
the referee hit Sean and all three men are lying.

330
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.470
<v 2>Is that a disqualification? It might be if good. I'm Paula.</v>

331
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.000
Oh here we are. Right? This could, this could be the moment, but no,

332
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.460
before the referee can get up. Sean gets up,

333
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.650
walks over to Brett and then look at that. Sean. Oh, you're kidding me.

334
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:32.460
Brett in the sharp shooter, which is Brett's signature finishing move.

335
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.090
Basically Sean pretzels up bread's legs and sips and within seconds

336
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.453
the bell rings,

337
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.150
<v 4>Sean Slides out of the rain, grabs the belt, runs to the back, takes off things,</v>

338
00:19:52.151 --> 00:19:55.780
work a certain way in wrestling matches, right? Like no one gets the first pin,

339
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:59.320
the second match starts and no one puts someone in a submission hold and they

340
00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:00.250
instantly submit,

341
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.250
especially not bred heart and it just did not appear like the time the match was

342
00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:05.920
supposed to end. The crowd is kind of shocked.

343
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.350
It's strangely quiet

344
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.760
<v 0>and there's this one moment where the camera is zoomed in on Brett's face while</v>

345
00:20:15.761 --> 00:20:16.594
he's lying,

346
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:21.780
chest down on the mat looking up and there is just this bizarre,

347
00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.220
amazing look on his face.

348
00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.030
Confusion is an emotion that almost never exists in pro wrestling.

349
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.550
There's the cartoon confusion of like everything's crazy and your arms are going

350
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:34.770
like wild. Your eyeballs pop out of your head.

351
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.000
The real confusion is one of the most compelling emotions of all.

352
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.410
That's what you see on his face in its most pure form.

353
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:47.343
Genuine

354
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.250
[inaudible]

355
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.420
<v 5>and then anger. Brett gets up, puts his arms on the rope,</v>

356
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:01.000
looks down, sees it, and says man and spits right in Vince's face.

357
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:06.770
He then proceeds to get out of the ring and basically destroy everything in

358
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:10.330
sight. He goes over to the announcer's table, starts ripping it apart,

359
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.740
he destroys the monitors, throws the headphones out into the crowd.

360
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.120
He goes pretty nuts

361
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.300
and in maybe the moment that truly made you go, what is happening?

362
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.040
Brett gets back into the ring.

363
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:29.070
He takes his hand in the air and draws with his finger in the air as big as he

364
00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:30.004
can.

365
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:35.010
W C W which is where he was going to be leaving to go work w c w and keeps doing

366
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:44.350
that walking across the range of signaling w c w to the crowd.

367
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:47.830
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

368
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.720
<v 0>the match. Brett heads back into the locker room looking for a,</v>

369
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.690
<v 15>let's get up, tells the cameras to shut off.</v>

370
00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.370
<v 0>And then to make a long story short, he clocks Vince in the face,</v>

371
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.890
knocks him out. Now the WWF has a real problem on their hands.

372
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.010
Vince has a black guy and the fourth wall has just been torn down and they need

373
00:22:16.211 --> 00:22:20.620
to figure out how or if they're going to build it back up. And um,

374
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.560
the next day, this again was the head writer at the time, Vince Russo,

375
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.840
we had a television taping right after the, you know, you,

376
00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:31.430
you have roar on Monday, you know, you, you'd do your paper view on Sunday.

377
00:22:31.431 --> 00:22:35.630
You have roar on Monday. So they all huddled in a room to discuss their options.

378
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:40.520
And Vince says that everybody in that room, that first knee jerk reaction is,

379
00:22:40.521 --> 00:22:43.310
well, we're going to sweep this under the rug and not even talk about it.

380
00:22:43.311 --> 00:22:43.791
I mean that,

381
00:22:43.791 --> 00:22:47.690
that was almost just assumed because you have to understand there's this old

382
00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.973
principal in wrestling called [inaudible]

383
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.450
<v 16>Kayfabe and basically what this is,</v>

384
00:22:51.451 --> 00:22:56.220
is this law of the wrestling God passed down since time eternal that says,

385
00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.280
you don't talk about the fact that it's fake.

386
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.640
Everyone knows that it's scripted and that it's fake,

387
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.790
but you damn well better not mention that ever. Why?

388
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.920
Because everybody has a better time when everyone is under the spell of it.

389
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.350
Uh, and I was like, wait a minute,

390
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.550
<v 0>Vince is walking around with a black eye.</v>

391
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:22.660
The boys has a black guy and one of the boys punch them in the face.

392
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.710
Russo is saying, I understand Kayfabe but we have to address this.

393
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:31.180
We can't not acknowledge this. And that doesn't have to be a problem.

394
00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.050
That can be an opportunity for us. I mean it like, I hate to say this,

395
00:23:35.051 --> 00:23:38.740
but like it doesn't get any better than this. Rousseau says,

396
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.780
this discussion got very heated.

397
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:45.870
It was passion filled and in the end nobody really knew what Vince McMahon was

398
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:47.324
going to do.

399
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.630
Why the time red hearts depth center stays for his match up with Shawn on.

400
00:23:52.631 --> 00:23:56.410
Eventually Vince McMahon decides I'm going to break with Kayfabe.

401
00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.100
Now keep in mind he's always been the owner of the organization,

402
00:24:00.101 --> 00:24:04.900
but very few people actually knew that too. Most fans of professional wrestling,

403
00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.560
he was just an announcer that night on his own TV show.

404
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:12.040
He comes out not as Vince McMahon, the ringside announcer,

405
00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:15.310
but as Vince McMahon, the owner of the company.

406
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.230
<v 15>Let's cut right to the chase seven days ago with the survivor series.</v>

407
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.130
Did you or did you not screw Bret Hart?

408
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.100
Some would say I screwed Bret Harte.

409
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.460
Bret Hart would definitely tell you I screwed them.

410
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.860
I'll look at it from a different standpoint.

411
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.760
I look at it from the standpoint of the referee did not screw Brett Hart.

412
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.890
Sean Michael Certainly did not screw Brett Hart,

413
00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.800
nor did Vince McMahon screw bad heart.

414
00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:46.050
I truly believe that Brad Hart screwed Brett Heart.

415
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.310
And you can look in the mirror and know that I'm sure in some parts of the

416
00:24:50.311 --> 00:24:54.030
country right now there's a collective groan that you orchestrated the situation

417
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.820
and the fact that uh,

418
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.610
people are not going to understand what you mean by

419
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.420
Brett Hart Screwed Brett Hart. So what do you mean by that?

420
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.430
There's a time honored tradition in the wrestling business and when someone is

421
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.323
leaving,

422
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.900
they show the right amount of respect to the WWF superstars in this case who

423
00:25:15.571 --> 00:25:20.571
helped make you that superstar you show the proper respect to the organization

424
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.840
that helped you become who you are today.

425
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:30.230
It's a time honored tradition and Brett Hart didn't want to honor that tradition

426
00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.950
and the less that was Brett's decision, Brett

427
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.200
<v 3>breath and everything changed from that point on.</v>

428
00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.800
And according to Peter,

429
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.580
after the Montreal screw job and after this speech,

430
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.530
the writers of the WWF started blurring the lines on a different level.

431
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.650
Vince McMahon, the chairman of the WWE, Ladies and gentlemen. [inaudible],

432
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.870
<v 2>Mr Nick,</v>

433
00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.630
<v 3>Mr McMann, the character, the number one villain in the company.</v>

434
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.080
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

435
00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:15.000
<v 4>There were no more ridiculous, you know, stupid, unbelievable,</v>

436
00:26:15.001 --> 00:26:18.420
childish, ignorant, immature characters.

437
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.780
Every character we had was basically an extension of themselves.

438
00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.093
<v 2>So</v>

439
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.510
<v 4>you know, stone cold,</v>

440
00:26:28.511 --> 00:26:33.490
Steve Austin was Steve Austin 1000 times magnified.

441
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.300
You know, the Rock was rocky.

442
00:26:37.301 --> 00:26:40.930
My via 100 times magnified.

443
00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.400
And as a result,

444
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.540
<v 0>that was the beginning of the biggest boom in the history of the wrestling</v>

445
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:53.340
business as far as business goes. This was huge for the WWF and Vince McMahon.

446
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.030
They came roaring back in the ratings war.

447
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.660
They destroyed Ted Turner in the WCW. They won.

448
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.360
And if you ask Vince Russo, why this approach,

449
00:27:03.361 --> 00:27:08.100
this new aesthetic was so successful, he said simply the truth.

450
00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.930
That was great TV, plain and simple. The fans just want something true.

451
00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:17.790
Just tell the fans what happened. But Peter says two things.

452
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:21.240
One, it's way more complicated than that. It's not just about the truth.

453
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:25.920
You still have these writers who are scripting the show and wrestlers who are

454
00:27:25.921 --> 00:27:30.480
getting that script and following it. So it's not like it's now a true world.

455
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.520
I think it's something more like there are these tiny

456
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.180
<v 16>injections of truth into this world in really unexpected moments.</v>

457
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:44.310
What that does is it puts everyone on high alert all the time for those moments

458
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.150
and when everyone is on high alert for those moments all the time,

459
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.640
every moment has the potential to be true,

460
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:55.050
has the potential to have a little bit of that injection into it and when you

461
00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:56.790
are watching for those injections,

462
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:02.100
it completely changes how you are engaging with the art form,

463
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.940
with the entertainment and that creates an entirely new type of fan,

464
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.740
<v 0>what they call a smart fan, a smart mark,</v>

465
00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:13.460
a smart as they're known people who love the wrestling business but really love

466
00:28:13.461 --> 00:28:17.320
the behind the scenes of the business. So what now? What was this smart mark?

467
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.140
Smart Mark. Here's where you can get a little lingo. Crazy.

468
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:23.800
The lingo part of wrestling is a huge,

469
00:28:23.801 --> 00:28:28.801
huge part of it and a mark is someone who doesn't know that wrestling is fake or

470
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:33.990
using another piece of jargon here that it is a work. Yes,

471
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.230
a work is anything that's not real as opposed to a shoot,

472
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.860
which is something that's real, like the Montreal screw job. Yes.

473
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.490
Our shoots by definition, something that's not supposed to happen

474
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.630
in the ring. A shoot should never happen.

475
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.010
But then there's something called, of course, a work shoot.

476
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.970
And that's something that does happen. What is that where you, uh,

477
00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.230
script it to seem like it's totally unscripted and it may even be real life that

478
00:29:05.231 --> 00:29:06.064
they're injecting into it,

479
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:09.310
but it with plant was still all discussed that this is what would happen.

480
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:14.430
And so watching wrestling becomes this game of hunting for the truth according

481
00:29:15.071 --> 00:29:19.150
to David Shoemaker, and not just any truths, but the authentic truth,

482
00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.000
the true truths, the true truth. Even if you know that it's fake,

483
00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.480
there's some point where the guys are really going at it in the ring that you're

484
00:29:25.481 --> 00:29:28.270
just like, wow, maybe it's real. Just that right there.

485
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.270
And that's what makes wrestling so powerful.

486
00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:35.980
It's the never ending search for the reality within the unreal,

487
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:39.370
the fact that we get to blend these things together. I mean,

488
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:44.860
another example that's just is um, in the early two thousands,

489
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.120
there was edge,

490
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.180
Matt hardy and a girl named Lita Lita and Matt Hardy were legitimately in love

491
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:56.200
dating for years. Edge and Matt Hardy were legitimately best friends

492
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:57.883
<v 2>and then</v>

493
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:04.060
you make your life miserable. Edge ended up with leader.

494
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.550
Took his best friends. Yeah. How do you read, you're like, this will too.

495
00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.170
Something that unfortunately happens in life sometimes I thought dob don't mean

496
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:17.330
guy kills and it was turned into a storyline.

497
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:21.200
Man had fought over women since the beginning of time and we are hooked up to

498
00:30:21.201 --> 00:30:23.090
see an epic battle over one right now.

499
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.220
I find it incredible that you could go out into the rain

500
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.260
and pretend to beat the hell out of someone.

501
00:30:33.261 --> 00:30:37.250
You want to beat the hell out. To know that you have to go out there,

502
00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.560
<v 0>work really hard against someone you legitimately hate and also absolutely have</v>

503
00:30:43.681 --> 00:30:47.340
to protect. How can we not find that? Fascinating. That's awesome.

504
00:30:47.341 --> 00:30:51.210
That's incredible. It's like watching Fleetwood Mac go on tour. Exactly.

505
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.000
That's what I was going to say next. That's Andrew Morantz by the way,

506
00:30:54.001 --> 00:30:56.850
from the New Yorker and play all their songs cause all their songs.

507
00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.190
They all had these love quadrangles.

508
00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.890
They all were married and left each other and wrote songs about,

509
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.130
I'm so pissed off at you because you left me for the guy who is standing right

510
00:31:05.131 --> 00:31:05.520
there.

511
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.550
And then they go out on tour and Lindsey Buckingham is standing right next to

512
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.790
Steven x playing the song that he wrote about, you betrayed me.

513
00:31:11.791 --> 00:31:16.080
I hate you so much. It's crazy. It right after night. Super Fascinating. Yeah.

514
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:21.110
I just think there's a part of the human brain that wants to be confused between

515
00:31:21.781 --> 00:31:25.530
those boundaries that wants to be slipping in between. What's real,

516
00:31:25.531 --> 00:31:27.180
what's fake to feel that confusion.

517
00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.080
I feel like that's why Jimmy Fallon was so successful on Saturday night live,

518
00:31:31.081 --> 00:31:35.250
not because he was the greatest sketch comedian, but because he broke a lot.

519
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.520
And you, you can't do that in wrestling because those moments are the best.

520
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:40.470
You have to save them. You have to save them.

521
00:31:40.471 --> 00:31:44.160
And when people acknowledge a moment and you can tell they look around at the

522
00:31:44.161 --> 00:31:46.140
crowd and they're acknowledging like this is,

523
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:50.670
or someone says one line that everyone kind of knows is like, Whoa,

524
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:55.170
that's kind of real. Those moments are special and you have to save them. Yeah.

525
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:59.240
Hold on one second. I'm sorry. Hey, what's up? He's on the way. All right.

526
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.610
I'll be leaving shortly. Peaceful. Sorry guys. I'll share away. It's,

527
00:32:02.611 --> 00:32:04.800
come on guys. We want a real quick question. What have you, of course,

528
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.360
what happened to Peter, Brent, Brent Hart after this? It's a,

529
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.460
did he go off to WCW and have a big career? Well,

530
00:32:11.461 --> 00:32:14.940
that's sort of the interesting thing is that after the Montreal screw job,

531
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.050
a few weeks later,

532
00:32:16.051 --> 00:32:21.051
Brett showed up on WCW television and it never really worked out for Brett.

533
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:27.740
<v 6>In 1999 just two years into his contract with WCW during a match,</v>

534
00:32:28.591 --> 00:32:31.920
he got kicked in the head and suffered a severe concussion

535
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.620
<v 0>and it, it, it was the beginning of the end that same year.</v>

536
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.010
<v 2>Well, Ladies and gentlemen, uh, something gone terribly</v>

537
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.750
<v 7>wrong.</v>

538
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:45.040
<v 12>Brett's brother Owen Hartman who was wrestling for the WWF.</v>

539
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.760
Um, during one of his entrances to the match.

540
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:52.960
He was entering from the ceiling and something with the stunt went terribly

541
00:32:52.961 --> 00:32:57.961
wrong and he fell 50 feet into the ring and he died.

542
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.470
<v 7>Anything, this is not a part of the show. This is real life.</v>

543
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.340
Oh one mark is being attended to right now by host. I went through,

544
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.650
I right away. I said, I could never, I don't think I can ever go back.

545
00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:15.760
Brett Hart spoke with Terry Gross about a year after this incident.

546
00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:18.790
You think of all these sort of contrived storylines that they have in wrestling.

547
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.661
You know,

548
00:33:19.661 --> 00:33:21.790
this guy's going to come in and he's going to do that and he's going to,

549
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.370
he's going to say this about you or they're going to, I just thought I heard.

550
00:33:24.371 --> 00:33:28.300
Anything you can possibly imagine is so pathetically meaningless when you relate

551
00:33:28.301 --> 00:33:31.090
to the, the real life horror. What happened with my brother,

552
00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.630
<v 12>he would retire shortly after saying that.</v>

553
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.100
<v 17>[inaudible] uh,</v>

<v 1>so thank you to, um, to Simon. Uh, what did we decide?</v>

557
00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:31.470
His wrestling name was Simon Simon, the growling gruyere. Adler Adler.

558
00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:33.890
It says he's from Wisconsin,

559
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.020
so you have to be like a fierce cheese cheese and thank you also as a very

<v 19>we're back. Luke, tell us who you are.</v>

582
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.960
I am Bruce Burningham and where do you teach?

583
00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.920
I teach at Illinois State University. This is Radiolab. I'm Jad. I'm Robert.

584
00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.140
So Bruce, he's a a scholar,

585
00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:51.160
a language professor and I called him up because Jared and I were having a

586
00:36:51.161 --> 00:36:54.790
little disagreement, friendly one. Okay. We're having an argument here.

587
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:59.110
I said that when you get to hip hop and the wrestling and the novels and all

588
00:36:59.111 --> 00:37:01.720
that, you're getting a sort of a a moment,

589
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.830
contemporary moment where people are fascinated by authenticity.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.780
And then Jad my partner says, I don't know,

591
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:12.220
maybe people have always been interested in authenticity and this is just comes

592
00:37:12.221 --> 00:37:17.080
with being a human. It's nothing about now, it just about us. I mean that's,

593
00:37:17.081 --> 00:37:17.660
that's,

594
00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:22.660
it's new in the sense that this generation of which we belong has become very

595
00:37:23.261 --> 00:37:26.590
interested in these kinds of questions. But Bruce told me this preoccupation,

596
00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:29.530
it's not really new. In fact, at least in book form,

597
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:34.510
it goes back way longer than you think. 1605 well,

598
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.770
before wrestling and before Fleetwood Mac and before Jimmy Fallon began laughing

599
00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:43.510
at his own jokes, there was Miguel Servon, his book. Don Quixote. Yeah.

600
00:37:43.511 --> 00:37:47.890
So the first book really is about authenticity from like from the get go,

601
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:51.760
you opened this book Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.

602
00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.290
And right away the narrator says,

603
00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:56.710
I'm going to tell you a story which I actually gathered from other authors from

604
00:37:56.711 --> 00:38:00.790
a bunch of different historical documents. So I'm not really the author.

605
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:05.320
He says things like, well, some books say the first adventure was this,

606
00:38:05.321 --> 00:38:07.840
and some say it was that. So even from the start,

607
00:38:07.841 --> 00:38:11.530
you have a very unreliable narrator who then proceeds to tell the story of a

608
00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:15.690
very unreliable, if not completely crazy, he character don Quixote,

609
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
who is dry with capricious and filled with in constant thoughts.

610
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.470
Never imagined about anyone else.

611
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:28.510
So Don Quixote believes that he has been set on earth to rescue widows,

612
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.290
Princesses, and pee and be kind to orphans. He's like a delusional,

613
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.070
totally delusion. He is. He's essentially a WHO's, who's

614
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.460
<v 20>read too many Zane Gray novels and decides he needs to be a cowboy.</v>

615
00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:42.440
<v 19>He thinks herds of sheep are attacking armies.</v>

616
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.610
He thinks windmills are giants at the same time, he has this savvy assistant,

617
00:38:46.611 --> 00:38:49.040
central Ponsa who seems to know what's really going on.

618
00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.160
And they're constantly arguing about what's real and what's not.

619
00:38:52.161 --> 00:38:56.870
And then in chapter eight, something really strange happens one day,

620
00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:00.650
Don Quixote and Sandra Panzer are traveling down the road and they see a

621
00:39:00.651 --> 00:39:04.730
carriage with a woman inside. Just an ordinary woman going, you know,

622
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:09.470
to meet her husband, Donkey Hook. Hey, whatever, for no reason at all, uh,

623
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.310
decides that she is a woman in distress, needs to be rescued.

624
00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.320
And he spies this man standing right next to the carriage. He's,

625
00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:17.243
he's [inaudible]

626
00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:20.410
<v 20>Basque guy sees this guy and he decides that he's a,</v>

627
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.920
he's an enemy who needs to be confronted. And so they start fighting.

628
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.880
Don't get caught. They was charging the wary, bask with his sword on high,

629
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.020
determined to cut him in half and the Basque was waiting for him.

630
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:36.190
He sword also raised and in mid swing when both swords are in the air,

631
00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:39.610
the narrator's stops and says, and I don't know where this goes from there,

632
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:44.170
I've run out of material and you just sort of stop scenario and this is what?

633
00:39:44.171 --> 00:39:47.960
16 oh something 1605 stops. Just stopping.

634
00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.870
That's the end of the book. Well No.

635
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.110
So you turn the page and you're in a new chapter and now the narrators is

636
00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:54.730
telling you how as luck would have it,

637
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:58.960
he found this manuscript one day when I was in the [inaudible] market in Toledo.

638
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:01.170
<v 19>Crazily enough, he's out of bizarre, I guess,</v>

639
00:40:01.171 --> 00:40:05.130
sort of a shopping kind of place and he sees this pile of old papers and books

640
00:40:05.131 --> 00:40:09.600
together in a basket and he's just rifling through it and he sees a picture of

641
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:10.683
Don [inaudible].

642
00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:14.380
<v 20>I was astounded and filled with anticipation. Very Paz,</v>

643
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.860
apparently I real historical account in which the stupendous battle between the

644
00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.640
gun and busk and the Valeant man chicken is concluded.

645
00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.700
The problem was it was in Arabic and so then he hires a local Maurisco who is a

646
00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:31.400
Christianized more to translate it for him. All right,

647
00:40:31.401 --> 00:40:35.060
so you now got a guy who's writing a book from historical sources.

648
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:36.850
He's run out of one, he's found another,

649
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.730
but now that one has to be translated and on top of that you frequently inserts

650
00:40:40.731 --> 00:40:44.300
commentary about the translation and we'll say stuff like, well,

651
00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:49.310
CDM met day says this, but we all know that Arabs can't be trusted. So you know,

652
00:40:49.311 --> 00:40:50.300
take that for what that's worth.

653
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.730
<v 19>How does, I'm reading it. I'm thinking, wait a second.</v>

654
00:40:52.731 --> 00:40:57.731
This was written in 1605 what did people make of a book that didn't seem to have

655
00:40:57.831 --> 00:41:01.780
any author had author upon author upon author, like were they horror?

656
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.020
What the book was a bestseller. It was hugely popular.

657
00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:10.970
Apparently people found all these layers and these ambiguity's a laugh riot.

658
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.970
Oh yeah. They gobbled up and they left as hard as they could.

659
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.670
This is Howard Manson, a savant.

660
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:20.690
These scholar at Purdue and doe Chiota was translated into English and 1612 into

661
00:41:20.691 --> 00:41:25.310
French in 1614 into Italian in 1622 everybody read it,

662
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.990
including in the new world by the way,

663
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.710
many copies of the first edition of donkey hilltoppers were shipped to the

664
00:41:30.711 --> 00:41:34.730
colonies. Wow. So the book is a wide bestseller,

665
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.410
maybe the first of its kind and then 10 years later, 10 years later,

666
00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:40.970
sort of Andres writes a sequel,

667
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:46.690
which kicks up this narrative weirdness to a completely new level in part two to

668
00:41:47.210 --> 00:41:51.290
don Quixote of Lamont. He introduces a new character named Samson Carrasco.

669
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:57.410
He actually visits Donkey Hill Day in sand show to tell them that part one

670
00:41:57.411 --> 00:41:59.420
exists. It's a bestseller.

671
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.720
And so in the very early chapters of part two donkey,

672
00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.750
how this would be like walking up to huckleberry Finn says, oh, by the way,

673
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.420
you're living here in Hannibal, Missouri, but you're now a famous boy.

674
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.240
That's exactly what happened. Everybody he meets,

675
00:42:11.241 --> 00:42:14.450
knows who he is because they've read part one and now it gets even stranger.

676
00:42:14.451 --> 00:42:15.620
Because in real life,

677
00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.800
during that 10 years that it took surveys to write his second book,

678
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:22.040
a person who goes by the pseudonym of Alonzo Fernandez,

679
00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.170
they have of [inaudible] published his own second part of donkey. They,

680
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.820
before Serantes could get his own second part out. Wait, so this is,

681
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:32.150
this is an unofficial part two today. We'd recognize it as,

682
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:34.430
as sort of fanfiction or,

683
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:38.990
or somebody attempting to steal George Lucas's idea and come up with their own

684
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.460
star wars installment. So there's this unauthorized part to floating around.

685
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.250
Miguel survived days is very annoyed by it, I'm assuming.

686
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.970
So in his official sequel to Don Quixote,

687
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:55.070
there is this scene where Don Quixote is at an inn and he overhears a character

688
00:42:55.071 --> 00:42:59.490
talking about his relationship with, with this, suppose that donkey hood.

689
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.650
They wait. So this guy,

690
00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:03.710
this guy that Simon Adler who sat in on the interview with me,

691
00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:08.180
this guy existed in the fake Quixote.

692
00:43:08.181 --> 00:43:12.650
Number two is a character in that, in is now appearing in the real [inaudible].

693
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.910
Number two Serantes serantes steals him. If you're gonna steal my character,

694
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:21.110
I'll steal yours back. Right? So now you've got the real donkey. Okay,

695
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.690
he's bumping into a character stolen from a fake book of donkey owed,

696
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:29.390
so, so why don't you to, it then decides to confront this person.

697
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.280
He marches right up to the guy and he says,

698
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:31.951
<v 20>I am.</v>

699
00:43:31.951 --> 00:43:36.060
Don't go to have Lamont Cha the same one who is on the lips of fame and not that

700
00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:40.080
unfortunate men who has water to use [inaudible] my name and bring honor to

701
00:43:40.081 --> 00:43:43.920
himself with my thoughts. And so it, and it's the climax of that scene,

702
00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.660
which is just wonderful, is he?

703
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.950
He forces this other character who he stolen from the unauthorized SQL who

704
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.850
serantes has stolen to admit that the donkey haute that he knows from the

705
00:43:53.851 --> 00:43:55.620
unauthorized sequel is not the real one.

706
00:43:55.890 --> 00:43:58.970
And that the one he's currently talking to is the real one. I am coolio.

707
00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:03.510
Grace for the sake of what you owe to your being a gentlemen to please make a

708
00:44:03.511 --> 00:44:06.240
statement to the magistrate of this village. And as a matter of fact, he,

709
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.410
he forces him to sign an affidavit to that effect. Perfect.

710
00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.970
<v 19>Okay, so he busts him, he busts him right in the novel, in the novel.</v>

711
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:20.050
But you've got a story about a guy that then becomes in part to a story about

712
00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:25.390
the story about the guy including false guys inside the story about the false

713
00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:26.900
guys from another book. That right here.

714
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.680
So why even bother trying to out what's real. Right.

715
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:34.990
Has anything like this come before?

716
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:35.470
<v 20>No.</v>

717
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:40.390
He's really sort of inventing this whole meta-narrative game that that is so

718
00:44:40.391 --> 00:44:44.770
popular today that you met a narrative. What, what of, well up until that point,

719
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.120
most stories are simply, they purport to be what they are.

720
00:44:49.121 --> 00:44:51.630
I'm telling you a story, but donkey haute,

721
00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:53.830
they pretends to be something other than what it is.

722
00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.610
It really is the start of modernity, our modern sense of the world.

723
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:59.550
<v 19>So you'll get with Jad Ben, and this is like this.</v>

724
00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.390
This is not co Waxton Wayne this particular year or cause I think, well,

725
00:45:04.391 --> 00:45:05.880
it has what? It has waxed and waned.

726
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:09.960
I mean th Don Quixote has been read by different generations for different

727
00:45:09.961 --> 00:45:10.650
reasons.

728
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.890
Bruce says he thinks the people who were reading the book originally at the time

729
00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:18.150
have survived this. They actually reveled in, in the multilevels of fiction.

730
00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:22.230
They loved the metastatic during the romantic period and and well into the early

731
00:45:22.231 --> 00:45:23.130
20th century.

732
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.490
People were less interested in all these narrative layers and they were more

733
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:31.020
just in thrilled by the romantic dunk EOD or the dream or Don Quixote.

734
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:36.300
<v 20>This generation of which we belong has become very interested in this terrain</v>

735
00:45:36.341 --> 00:45:38.200
that serantes charted a long time ago.

736
00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:42.550
<v 19>You see it in the cinema of the late nineties in movies like the Matrix.</v>

737
00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.320
Then later adaptation of an inception or exploring the concept of the dream

738
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:48.483
within a dream.

739
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.880
<v 9>See it in Seinfeld, what's going on,</v>

740
00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:55.710
what we're going to shoot the pilot and then it's going to be on TV to follow.

741
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:56.544
Anyway. Yeah, no,

742
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.760
there's this Canadian Jerry Seinfeld who's playing a character that happens to

743
00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:00.960
be called Jerry Seinfeld,

744
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:04.440
who's making a show within the show about a character who's,

745
00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:05.850
who's Jerry Seinfeld.

746
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.720
<v 20>And so you have reality nested three times.</v>

747
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.750
But I guess I'm interested in this idea of why is,

748
00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:15.050
how is this happening again and why is it happening again? Well,

749
00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:20.051
my sense of things is that both of these moments are moments of intellectual

750
00:46:20.151 --> 00:46:24.230
crisis back in servant. This time coming out of the renaissance,

751
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.310
you have all of this new scientific knowledge that is calling into question the

752
00:46:28.311 --> 00:46:31.640
foundation that everybody was building their lives on.

753
00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.700
So suddenly the earth is no longer the center of the universe.

754
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:38.210
It's now just one planet amongst several orbiting the sun.

755
00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:43.310
So you have people coming to terms with a worldview that they can no longer

756
00:46:43.311 --> 00:46:47.990
sustain. And as for us now, in the last hundred years, you have Darwinism,

757
00:46:47.991 --> 00:46:50.480
you have relativity, you have quantum physics.

758
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.480
I mean cognitive scientists are telling us that we have no free will because

759
00:46:53.481 --> 00:46:57.450
they can sort of chart the chemical reaction that happens milliseconds before

760
00:46:57.550 --> 00:46:59.300
we, we think we decided to do something.

761
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:03.440
All of these things tell us that the world that we think we see is not what it

762
00:47:03.441 --> 00:47:07.420
is. And I think that inspires people to then start asking these questions. If,

763
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:11.900
if what I'm seeing is not real, what is, who am I?

764
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:14.870
And so I think to a great extent it's,

765
00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.800
it's a reaction to a moment of intellectual crisis. Wait, but okay,

766
00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:21.110
let's say that I liked professional wrestling a lot.

767
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:25.310
I don't know anything about any of the research you're telling me about why the

768
00:47:25.311 --> 00:47:28.400
hell do I like professional wrestling and why did I like it more when they

769
00:47:28.401 --> 00:47:32.380
started blurring these lines? Hard question.

770
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.580
Well, I would say humans are humans and one of the things that we do is,

771
00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.910
is as opposed to as far as we know,

772
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:44.470
what other animals on this planet do is we are aware of our own contingency.

773
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.100
Meaning we can imagine radically different possibilities.

774
00:47:48.101 --> 00:47:52.570
We could imagine worlds where we don't exist or maybe we only think we exist.

775
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.600
I can remember being a child four and five years old and going to a fabric store

776
00:47:58.301 --> 00:47:59.111
with my mother.

777
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:03.520
And there were two mirrors set against opposite walls and I was just fascinated

778
00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:07.300
at standing in between them and watching the infinite regress go in each

779
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:11.260
direction. Um, you know, and I, I had not even started kindergarten yet.

780
00:48:11.261 --> 00:48:12.040
So I think,

781
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.930
I think humans have this fascination with infinite regress and with embeddedness

782
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.600
and with the questions that it forces you to consider,

783
00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:25.330
like where does everything begin and where does it all come from? I mean,

784
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:27.390
the question at the heart of Donkey Haute,

785
00:48:27.391 --> 00:48:31.690
they realizing that he's a character in a novel is who stands above you.

786
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.940
The author stands above you.

787
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:37.660
And so that author has a kind of godlike relationship to you,

788
00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:43.150
but that very question starts to make you ask who stands above that author?

789
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:46.930
And if you start asking that question, it goes on forever and every direction.

790
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.823
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

791
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:29.580
<v 19>[inaudible] thank you to Rupert Boyd for coming and playing the Spanish guitar</v>

792
00:49:29.581 --> 00:49:30.414
for us.

793
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.690
[inaudible] on very short notice and two recorded books for giving us permission

794
00:49:33.691 --> 00:49:37.770
to use George Greenhouses. Wonderful read of the book.

795
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.700
Thank God that I'm on a journey. He's really good. Okay, well,

796
00:49:41.701 --> 00:49:44.700
I guess we should go then. We should say you should go goodbye. Say Goodbye.
