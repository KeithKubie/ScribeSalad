00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:07.760
LAURENCE MORONEY: Today,
I'm meeting with Janice Wong

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.080
to talk about Android
for Work and how you can

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.030
get started with business apps.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.044
So, Janice, you're PM
on Android for Work,

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:16.960
and I know we've spoken
about it a little bit,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.910
but could you tell
me a bit more.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.940
What really is Android
for Work all about?

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.439
JANICE WONG: Not
only are we putting

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.450
a lot of the great
features, part of Android,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.230
on the framework
side, but it's also

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.070
unleashing the capabilities
of our partners,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.200
whether it's our
OEMs, carriers, or we

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.666
call them enterprise
mobility management partners.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.540
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.123
JANICE WONG: But you
think about this.

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:38.140
Traditionally, Android
is very consumer focused.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.420
LAURENCE MORONEY: Sure.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.750
JANICE WONG: But we
want to really unleash

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.670
this for the workplace so that
people can bring their Android

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.644
devices to work and
be just as productive.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.310
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's a win-win, right,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.850
because you get to use the
cooler consumer-oriented device

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.802
in the workplace, and
the workplace doesn't

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:53.010
have to provide devices to
workers, or maybe they do,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.510
but if you bring
your own device,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.177
then you can choose
what you use, right?

00:00:56.177 --> 00:00:56.926
JANICE WONG: Yeah.

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.650
So we really want to
give all our users

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.067
choice, whether you're
at work or not at work.

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:02.900
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
what kind of scenarios

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.530
are there for different types of
apps or different form factors

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.140
or something like that in
the workplace, because I

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.560
know there's lots of different
ways that it can be used.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.910
What have you encountered?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.580
JANICE WONG: We call them BYOD--
Bring Your Own Device to work,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.680
so that mean you don't
have to carry two phones.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.554
You don't have to worry
about carrying a work

00:01:18.554 --> 00:01:19.890
phone and a personal phone.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.223
And then there are other ones
we call corporate liables,

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:25.212
so the company issues a phone
for a specific use case.

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:26.670
But then there's
also another kind,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.400
which I find very interesting.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.060
We think about it
as the kiosk mode.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.620
It is single use,
usually tablets,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.860
or you can think about when
you go to a cashier nowadays,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.570
it could be a tablet
in front of you.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.240
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, yeah.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.100
JANICE WONG: You pay, right?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.410
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right
or at a hotel, right?

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.730
Like a digital
concierge-type thing.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.440
JANICE WONG: Exactly.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.690
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.050
JANICE WONG: All
need to be managed.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.570
And we have to make
sure we optimize it.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.540
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, so that just

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.820
can't be any old tablet there.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.480
That has to have whatever it
is that the corporate log in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.646
and the corporate security,
all that type of thing.

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:53.100
JANICE WONG: Right.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: So how
does that get managed

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.680
and what are we doing in
Android for Work to help that?

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.770
JANICE WONG: So we work
with our EMM partners--

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.580
our mobility
management partners.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.120
They are in the world of
managing all these devices,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.889
but we provide the
framework, the OS,

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.970
to make it even easier for them.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.010
For example, the
kiosk situation.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.680
You don't want one
of your customers

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.790
be in the middle of check
in and then suddenly they

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.810
have to take an update.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: [LAUGHING]

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:21.250
JANICE WONG: Right?

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.510
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.940
JANICE WONG: So
IT can say, OK, I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.389
want to do this at 3:00
AM for all my devices.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.430
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610
JANICE WONG: To provide a
really cohesive experience

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.970
but also manage it
in a secure way.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.710
You get updates.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.150
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.000
Now, switching
gears for a second.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.857
Developers.

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:37.190
Obviously, there are things
that developers need to know

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.750
and developers need to learn
to be able to take advantage

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.300
of the work that you're doing.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.790
So where can developers
go to learn about what

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.374
they need for Android for Work?

00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:47.540
JANICE WONG: I think a great
place to start is to go

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.620
to developer.android.com/work
where they can learn a lot

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.140
about the use cases and examples
that other developers have done

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.725
already and also testing tools.

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:57.850
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, cool.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.800
JANICE WONG: But
honestly, just think

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.360
about developing on Android,
because you give the user

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.360
a lot of choice, different form
factors, phones, tablets, price

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.270
points.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.610
You can even think larger,
like digital signage.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.712
It all can be managed.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:12.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.470
So if I want to start
writing some enterprise code,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.589
I know where to go.

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:17.630
JANICE WONG: Sounds good.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
thank you so much, Janice.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.260
This has been a blast,
and I've learned a lot.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.310
I really appreciate it.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.060
JANICE WONG: Yeah.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.760
Thank you for having me.
