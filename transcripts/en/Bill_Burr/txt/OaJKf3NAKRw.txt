Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burn? It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday.

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:12       just checking in on you. Just checking in on you. See how you're doing. You having a good week? Hmm? Are you enjoying yourself? I hope you having a good fucking week. Uh, I hope it's going better than my week. I hope it's going better than my week. Uh, uh, I don't know if I'll fuck it. I'll get right into it. Uh, unfortunately a, a great comedian, great friend. Just one of the best people I've ever met, uh, passed away yesterday, Charlie Murphy and um, can't fucking believe it, man. Really cannot believe it. I had, um, hadn't talked to him in about a year and I had no idea that, um, that he was sick to that level. So, uh, I think it's still hitting me, man. It's unbelievable. I'm so sick of fucking hilarious. Great people dying. I was actually talking with a friend of mine the other day. I was just like, dude, to hacks ever die. Like what? When was the last time somebody who truly sucked at standup comedy died? It's fucking unbelievable. What a hex eat this. If I was, if I had the fucking money, I swear to God I'd get, I get to man, you know, maybe it's all, you know, it's funny, I actually realize halfway through this and I'm still alive so, and I kind of shitting on myself.

Speaker 2:          00:01:34       Somebody's got to put together the hack diet, whatever that is. Those motherfuckers lived to be like 85 90.

Speaker 2:          00:01:42       Um, anyways, another just giant. I mean you're talking about somebody who, when I met him in 2004 had already lived like four lifetimes. He had four unbelievable books from his childhood to his teenage years and early twenties living in Brooklyn and all this shit that he did to go into the navy, to his brother blowing up and then him getting out of the navy and working security on the tour and then morphing in to like a screen writer and actor. And then he gets on the Chappelle show to just was sitting around is what was told to me. Just telling these stories of, you know, back in the day, hanging out with everyone from prince to Rick James, you've seen all those things, stories about Whitney Houston, he just sugar ray Leonard, Oj Simpson. He just like that sketch, which to this day I'm telling you is I think it's the greatest sketch of all time that Charlie Murphy, True Hollywood story about Rick James.

Speaker 2:          00:02:50       And uh, I remember him telling me afterwards, I was just like, dude, how true is that shit? And he goes, well yeah, obviously we exaggerate. Like, you know, he didn't, when he hit me in the head, I didn't have a unity, you know, thing on my head. But he's like, yeah he did. They were like in the back of the limo or something. And you know, Rick just kind of went to, he was trying to be like friendly, but I was like, ah, they kinda hit Charlotte like hard enough in their head that I guess Eddie and his friends were waiting for Charlie react cause they knew her. Charlie was Charlie Kinda got mind fuck for half a second thinking like, you know, I'd stomped the shit out of anybody who did this to me, but it's Rick James. And it kind of took them like an hour before he was like, fuck this.

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       And uh, you know, obviously didn't kick them up on a dresser, but he did fucking rough them up a little bit in the back room. And then when the security came in, he did bring them over to the window and said that he was going to throw them out. They came anywhere near him. So, um, yeah, man, it's just really a really a sad day. And that guy was just, he was such a great guy. I told you guys this story before he saved my fucking ass one time. Um, I was trying to get in shape, right as always, as I always am. I was living in New York City and uh, I started going down to Gleason's gym out in Brooklyn, you know, cause I didn't want to get all fucking, you know, I was Joe billary swank is I believe what I was calling myself or they will give me shit cause I just went down there and an actor performer kind of way to get in boxing shape without ever fucking, you know, getting my head kicked in.

Speaker 2:          00:04:32       So when I told Charlie that I was going down to Gleason's gym, he goes, I just to go going, oh yeah, okay, okay, I'm going to tell you what's going to happen because you can be, oh they have about six weeks and out of nowhere he goes, some dude's going to come up to you and start telling you and be like, ah, how long have you been boxing for? Really are man, you nice man. You know, Shit, we had a spar some time. He goes, he's going to fucking, he's gonna amp you all up to get you into the ring. So he can try out a bunch of shit that he does that he's not dumb enough to try out on a professional boxer and he's going to beat the fuck out of you. And I was just saying, and he just started laughing at me.

Speaker 2:          00:05:10       I'm like, yeah, I get the fuck Outta here. Get the fuck I do. I'm telling you. I was like, whatever time he said, three weeks or six weeks, it was like right on the nose. I'm sitting there, you know when the heavy bag, like the comedian slash sometimes actor, I am hitting the bag like [inaudible] right in this fucking, this black dude shredded comes over. He's like, Yo man. He goes, oh, how long have you been a long bit box before it was like, it was almost like Charlie's head was on the guys head. He said the exact same thing. Oh Man, you're nice man. You gotta to get in the fucking ring and all this shit. And I just started laughing. I just started laughing. I was like, I go man, fuck, I'll fuck. I'm a fucking comedian. Um, horrific. I'm not getting in there. So you can try out all your new shit on me. And the guy just started laughing, threw his head back, laughed, and then walked away. And it was so weird. I was like, that guy was going to beat the fuck out of me. So then I told him to Charlie thinking that he would be amazed

Speaker 2:          00:06:09       that you know, you know, like, like dude, I called it, what the fuck did I say? And he was just like, yeah, he's like, I told you he did that like a million times. Like he just had this, um, I dunno, he had like this fucking 6 cents. And I tell you some of those other stories, the Oj one in the Whitney one, but I just feel like those they hit, those were his stories to tell and if you wanted to share with me would have, but um, so I can only tell you the ones I remember when we won that Chappelle show, it was me, you know, Don, Al Ashy, Larry and him. And Charlie was the guy who actually showed me that you could write a new hour of material in two months. Because I saw him do it cause he blew up, you know, on on the second season with that, that Rick James Story and um, all this Darnell came up with the idea for the tour.

Speaker 2:          00:07:06       He was like, you know, your son, we should go out on tour, blah blah. So, you know, we'll have bill open up, you know, we'll bring you out Charlie, you can host it. And then Donna would close and um, I think Charlie maybe did, this is the fucking balls this guy had, I think he did maybe six shows before we did our first show and I believe it was Dayton, Ohio. And we didn't even have an agent and Donald book the thing. And uh, so we went out there. I was like the only white guy in the room, in the theater and we went out there and Charlie hosts anyone out and just went [inaudible] you know, uh, I'm Rick James Bitch or something like that place went fucking nuts. He told like two more jokes brought me out and everybody's looking at me like, who the fuck is this guy?

Speaker 2:          00:07:54       Is this one of the writers? This is one of the creators. Is this the agent on the tour? Nobody had any idea who the fuck I was. So I did my bullshit. Charlie came out and told another couple of jokes and then don [inaudible] close to show. Everybody had a great time. And um, afterwards we went into the back room. Okay, now we're in the green room and there's like 20 people in there and we don't know anybody. Once again, I'm the only white dude in there. Me, Don Allen Charlia sitting at this table and all of a sudden these two guys come up. What was it? One Guy, I can't remember, and just had like a fucking bag of cash from that night's Gig Ngo. He had it all bandaged up and just threw it on the table and it all spilled out and it was just sitting there and I was sitting there like, what the fuck?

Speaker 2:          00:08:44       And Don Allan, Charlie didn't move so I didn't move. And I was just sitting there as a white dude, like going, I guess this is how black people pay each other. Give them 20 complete strangers in the fucking room, drinking and partying and then just a bunch of cash because I felt like we robbed a bank or something. So we sat there, I swear to God for at least one more mob, deep song of whatever the fuck was playing at that time. The Thong Song, I can't remember whatever it was. And uh, finally I forget it was either done l or Charlie just soda casually sat up and just took the money, put it in the bag and then put it down by this side, which made me relax a little bit more. And I was just like, I was sitting there going like, I don't think I'm ready for this fucking tour. This is not the way you get paid at the funny bone.

Speaker 2:          00:09:36       So we stayed there maybe for like another half hour and then we finally go up to get up to leave and we're just walking out and you just feel in eyeballs, honest cause we got this big bay, it's just cash and we out go out. We get into the fucking, they had rented this fucking Limo Force. We got in the car in the second the car doors closed and we start driving away. Darnell just goes, Yo, what the fuck? And Charlie was just freaking out and I just started and I was just like, just the epiphany that they were actually freaking out too. And I had no idea. You'd never know looking at their face. I'm sure everybody in the room knew that I was fucking uncomfortable. And um, suffice to say, after that we got ourselves an agent and uh, we got, we got paid by check after that.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       It was just us in the room. Um, and that was that infamous tour where they would always make fun of, that's where that Joe came from. You know, this motherfucker got five shirts. Um, that's where that one came from because they always made fun of my clothes. And that was that time when I was hung over and I just didn't want to get in the car and deal with this shit. And they had taught me about the Itis, which was basically when you eat like a food that's rich in flavor but low and fucking nutrition, your body, you end up taking a quick cat nap cause your body literally has to shut everything else down to figure out how to digest what you just put in your stomach. So I was standing outside this hotel hung over as hell and I just saw, oh my God, we were doing that.

Speaker 2:          00:11:08       He used to be the, uh, it was the Chicago Zany and then you do Mount Vernon. And then, uh, Saint Charles who was his three Gig run through Northern Illinois, I forget where we go eat. We just on detainees and I was too drunk. I had a fucking headache. And I'm walking out trying to get fresh air going. I'm going to deal with these two fucking assholes all the way up to this club. It's a two hour drive. The nonstop going to be fucking hammering me. And I looked down the street and there was a Popeye's and I just remember them telling me about the itis and I said, fuck this. And I went down there, I got a bucket of chicken biscuits with the mashed potatoes, gravy, all of that shit. And I brought it into the end of the fucking limo and I was like, hey guys, I got some food that Ah, Greg, you know, and they dug and they started eating and I didn't have one piece of it and swear to God within 20 minutes they were both asleep. And I had, they, they slept the entire fucking ride. I basically poisoned. Yep. Temporary, well, he's in him and it worked like a Goddamn charm. And, um, I dunno, I just, I had to say something about Charlie. It's still too sad to really get into the, the feelings all this, but um, he truly was one, not only one of the most amazing just lives of anybody who ever lived. He just was truly one of the best guys that, um,

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:12:32       That I haven't met in this business. So, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       All right. That's it. No getting emotional on the podcast. Okay. So let's get back to the rest of this stuff here. Um, the fucking Bro, what's up? Finally, the first time all year we beat the auto was senators. All right. Beat him when it counts. Like I didn't even realize they beat us all four times this year. We'll congratulations Ottawa capital of Canada, you know? But unfortunately your full game winning streak came to an end, right when it counted. You got the weirdest part of that game was, was listening to a loud, Otto was senator fans. You know, I actually know something. I used to think that their fans would just land. But the real reason is Ottawa is just like Washington DC, you know, it's the capital. So there's a bunch of people from all over the fucking country. So there's a bunch of cannot fans, flames, oiler fans, all I bullshit.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       They're sitting there, they don't give a fuck about the senators, you know? So it's not the people, the Ottawa, they're great people. They got a little fucking river that they freeze over. Yay. Skate to work does not. They made, it's like a fucking fantasy land up there. It's one of my favorite cities. I actually like it for some reason. They say, Otto, we're the city. That fun. Forgot. Well, you know what? I always have a great time when I write go there. Um, and um, what a fucking great game though. Ottawa play great. I by no means think that victory means that we're going to win the series. I think it's gonna I think it was two to one. I feel like the whole series is going to kind of go like that and it's going to get even uh, not even shippy. I think it might get a little ugly. Um, Brad Marshawn back from his suspension doing what he does. Score and big goals and big games. Um, hey nia, come here. I didn't know that. Brad Marshawn. Where are you?

Speaker 1:          00:14:39       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:14:39       I had never heard this nickname. Brad Marshawn. They call them nose face killer because, and I thought I was being so original when I called that guy on a fuck. That's because he sounds like Ghostface killer. I'd call them pot roast. Pot Roast. Face killer. Is that one on one? Yeah. Here I am on my hat. Look at that parallel thinking parallel thought. There you go. Is that what it's called? What? Do you know what more than I do? Is that what said behind my back? No, I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right. The Bruins one. I haven't been on the podcast in a while. No, you haven't. Once you grab the mic, grab a microphone. Come on in here. I'll hit pause. All right, we're back. I got the microphone and everything like that. The lovely Nia alo. How they hell? Hell, how the Hell You Ben?

Speaker 2:          00:15:31       I know. Long time. No fuck no podcasts. No, I don't think you've really been on that much since. Uh, we had the little princess here. That's right. Who's sitting here. You know what's funny is because you know her hair still shorten everything and all of our friends had boys and they just gave us all their clothes. Everyone keeps thinking it's a boy and she just came in. Now she's got a little shirt on that is like a classic that looks like a 1955 Chevy pickup truck on itself. Yeah. So a everyone, yeah, everyone thinks that she is a buoyant, but that's okay. She will not be defined by her gender, right? Yes. She will put on a dress for God's sakes. I liked the little play close though. I think they're so cute. Well, yeah, I mean I don't care either way. You know you look good to me.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       That kiddo. Yeah. She doesn't have to be like all frilly and princess looking. I'm not really into that anyway. What are you saying? What do you mean? Well, at some point you mean you've got to put her with some girls clothes, right? Yeah. I have plenty of girls clothes for her. Okay. You scared me there. Okay. Why? What do you, why? Why are you scared? Well made at some point. You can't say ever walking around and like, you know Pete Carroll, dockers and stuff. You know who will now we're not going to do that. But like I think cause she's daddy's little girl. Little girls look cute and like little boy clothes, like the little tomboy. Look, I think that's cute. You know what is? Yeah. As long as she has clothes on and two diapers clean at this point, I'm happy. Right. I believe, I don't care what it is exactly, but now, so anyways, she wore a cute little dress on Easter, remember? Oh yes, she did. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:17:11       she went to East to west. So these two born it. Yeah. Suddenly we go to church or anything like that. We're heathens. Oh, by the way, Leah, did I tell you about that great band I saw the other night? Oh you mean the one with Dave [inaudible]? Yeah. Uh, gave a ticket drum lessons from one of the best drummers in the world right now. Shout out to Davy. That's right. He plays drums in this band called the night game. Or they have a new single out. If you want to check it out its own iTunes. It's called the um, yeah, I'll field and uh, I saw them play like a quick half hour set the other night. Right. Uh, over capitol records were across the street from that. Remember when I walked over and then had my, my issue, have you done in x period? Your issue? I've been doing cardio like a madman. Maybe in some, some readers can to ease of advice about this.

Speaker 2:          00:17:56       I blew cardio like a madman, but like Jordan shorts on and I don't know what happened. My balls, my ball, one of them was just, I just did too much walking in one day and I had a little chafing issue on one side of the old bag there. And uh, it did not affect my enjoyment of the band cause the, I walked like, it's like a two mile walk over there or something. Right. What are you doing? You're looking at me or you're looking at her two miles over and then two miles back in that way after I'd already done an hour of cardio. So the next day, uh, I was walking like I wrote a horse for like six weeks straight. But anyways, I went over and saw this show and they have a singer, rr Martin Johnson, amazing singer, and then two killer guitarist. I hope they say these names right.

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       Uh, Karen, Jay, you go colonian Max Bernstein. And then they had a guy sitting in on base, uh, Andrew Peruzzi and uh, two days solid fucking admit. It's really like poppy type stuff, but the level of musicianship, how great they all sounded live. Um, definitely check it out. Once again, it's called, uh, the name of the band is the night game in the single is the outfield and that is out right now. So can we talk about your chief balls? Huh? Oh, it's done. It was just, it was one and done was one day of uncomfortableness. Oh, you're okay now. Oh yeah. Oh good. Okay. I was suggesting that bill get gold bombs medicated powder because I just felt like that was just something that you just dust on your balls a little bit. He kept saying, you know, like when those great chefs put the powdered sugar on top of the confections, do that little, no, I think that's your balls a little bit to keep it.

Speaker 2:          00:19:37       That's not for chafing. It's not, no, that's, but I thought that's what people who have itchy balls, itchy balls, and they're sweaty and so therefore it's all going have like a culture. Like you're going to make bread, but it's your ball red ball. That's disgusting. No, this is just a, yeah. Chafee, you know what I mean? Gary Chafee. All right, chairman in here, the third Mike. Um, anyways, anyways, yeah. So that is uh, that is all, but this is gonna be difficult and he now when you know, we got the third, but I don't know, well this is why Peter, the heads me why, you know, on sweater, like we haven't been on the podcast and while, because they, you know, I have, I have to watch her. Yes, she is. Look how happy she is. She's such a happy baby. I'm actually psyched that she's really chill and so people keep saying she's a really relaxed, happy baby, which is unbelievable considering she lives with me and I've been doing, I've been going really hard with the whole trying to be chill.

Speaker 2:          00:20:36       Right. You want a good job? I'll go and really hard with the Chili. Yeah. Hey, go ahead and take it to the extreme. I know you said to me the other day of did you, have you been meditating lately? That's what I know. I'm getting a little up to the precipice there. Press a piece. Yeah. So I got a, I got a fucking, I got to handle that type of stuff. So, um, hey, the Celtics got the number one seat, the number one lead number one seat in the east. So we get some seed, s, e, e, d c like what I put in you to have that baby step. This is like, um, this is, yes, that's a good point. The balls are going to definitely be tough. We're not trying to look past him and, uh, it's just, was a great night as far as, uh, you know, considering the tragedy of yesterday, the broads when the Habs lose weight.

Speaker 2:          00:21:22       But tell me what a seed is again, just like, you know, they'll have whatever, there's 10 teams, you just ranked the number one seat and each other the best record. Why do they use the word seed? You know what? I don't know. All I'm saying that right. It's not easy. Yeah. The number one seat. Yeah. The uh, I don't know why they call it that is what is the position, what do you want to call it? And then when you get to the class, you're rewarded for having your best for having the best record where number one gets to play, the lowest person that just made the playoffs. So you get to kind of go in easier way to go to class and it's also, it kind of makes it so when you get to the later rounds that the best teams are playing in, the stakes are even higher.

Speaker 2:          00:22:01       This is to go to the NBA final. Gotcha. This is to go to the, uh, you know, this is the when the whole damn thing, except in hockey, hockey of course they do everything weird where, you know, for whatever reason, um, like Pittsburgh has to play the blue jackets. And I would have thought that I was like the capital's, I would've thought they would've got Toronto. I Dunno, I don't get how they do it over there, but that's definitely hockey. But we won, we won the shit in a, sorry, I'm all distracted today. Um, I have to read some advertising. There's anything you want to give me. Shit about. My balls are better than it was only one of them. Good. Well I'm glad you used what I gave you for them. And I'm also like a, a a, a, I'm like a plane. You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          00:22:44       Like one of those big jet planes, they can lose one engine still fly. So I'm fine. I'm fine. Actually. I know. Why was it only the one ball? I don't know. Why is one ball vaguer than the other? Is that why it's like rubbing a little bit more? No. Is it like how problem your boobs are different sizes now? It probably has more to be with my awful posture, my back being fucked up on one shoulder in front of the other one. I'm just a mess. I'm all for all this year as a hanging onto the anger and not stretching. Um, just to twist it up, mess. But I'll tell you, I have been stretching. I would go to a chiropractor and of of, uh, I'm a sous regularly for almost like a year. And had I not done that, God knows what would have had, I probably would have lost a nut.

Speaker 2:          00:23:30       Why still need to know. Cause I asked you and you weren't sure what a jock strap is used for. Jock strap is using as a cup now control it. It, it, uh, it holds all your, your junk, but just has no consideration whatsoever for your ass. I've never understood them. I've never run a storm. It's sort of the male thong. And if you don't want like guy underwear lines, I don't know why your ass is all the way out. I don't know what it is. I don't know what the fuck sports though. It's called a jockstrap. It's for a job. Well, let's look it up. Let's have this on my search engine. What's the deal? What's the deal with what's with y? Jock straps. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:24:19       All right. A jock strap is also known as a Jock, jock straps, straps, supporter or athletic supporter. It is an undergarment for supporting the male genitalia during cycling sports or other vigorous physical activity. Oh, it's a sports bra for your penis. Yeah. For your junk. So now flop all over the place. Yeah. But evidently you don't mind if your ass is hanging out and now commonly worn is everyday underwear. Fashion jobs perhaps appear in variety of colors. Do they? You say dope when now you got to go image Nia. Here you go. Do you want to look at some designer jock straps? I actually really do like, oh hey. You'd go, wow, there's one for you. It's a great asset. And that guy, I'm like, God, that was like reversed Victoria's secrets. That was fucking horrible. All right. And as your answer, if you had a nice ass, it's like you have to have a nice ass if you've got a model, those things, right?

Speaker 2:          00:25:16       Yeah. It's like if somebody wants to look at, you know, the same way a woman with the flat ass and the Thong is one of the worst things you could ever see. Yeah. You need to do literally see you don't like it doesn't disappear. You can see the hole. He can see the whole thing. MMM, that's right. All the way to the front. Okay, well I got to do some sort of a, I've got to do a little reading out loud and I don't want my daughter to know how dumb I am. So if you guys, I'm not kicking you out but I'm just saying if you want to block your ears, ear muffs here. Um, you read to her all the time. He reached great. I actually do a good job with those books, but you know, he also ad Lib throughout the entire book.

Speaker 2:          00:25:55       Kind of like the way you do advertising. You don't have to make weight links. Let's was like this weird thing where the guys, the ducks, like an absent seat father, he has like six kids with their, he's that guy taken off going to Boston common, I'll meet you over there. I was like, I trust you. You're a good mother. And she's just like, yeah, well you know, I am. She did everything but say, yeah, this is where I belong. And granted the book was working in like the 30s to the forties and then the little mermaid. Yeah, the little mermaid anywhere. Yeah, that whole thing was weird.

Speaker 3:          00:41:32       Guts. Hey, what's going on? It's still paper and it is the Monday morning podcast for a Wednesday, April 15th. That's when I'm recording this. Anyways. And a buddy of mine tomorrow is going to help me upload this fucking thing onto my computer and then onto the GCAT thing. And hopefully they did it. And if they did, you're actually listening to it, you know? And uh, this is my new recording device. How does it sound? Huh? You like this? You'll like it to sound good. It's stereo mother fuckers. Finally, after years of you people bitching at me about the sound of my cell phone and you know, the tapping of my computer and all that type of shit, I am 90% there to have an, a really great sounding podcasts. I'm going all out, you know, I'm getting a microphone. This thing has the ability that you can actually stick a cord in there, have a microphone and a, I'll be able to walk around like Mike Douglas when I do these.

Speaker 3:          00:42:36       And uh, I think it's just going to help the quality all the way around. I hope it sounds good. I hope that, uh, you know, I listened back to a couple of years. You can literally hear the echo in my room. Um, because that's the way I lived my life. Very sparsely, very sparsely furnished apartment, you know, I uh, yeah, that's how I live my life. I throw shit out all the fucking time. You know, you ever see like these people, uh, by the time they're 60 years old, you know, the fucking sleeping on their roof because every time they went to a baseball game and it was headband day, they, they, they just took it. You know, you don't have to take that shit. I always just say I don't want it. And they look at me like, what do you mean you don't want it? I'm like, I don't like clutter.

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       You know, I don't need a fucking Baltimore Ravens towel to wave in the fucking air. I don't, you know, maybe I'll take it and hold jerk off in the super eight later out. Bill. Why, why? You know, it was so family friendly right up until that moment. No, I'm just saying I don't have a, I don't have a lot of stuff, you know, but the stuff I have as quality and it means something to me. I've noticed something about myself. Anytime I say anything kind of sensitive, I have to say it in a gay accent to mask the fact that I feel uncomfortable opening up, you know? So anyways, let's get on with this. This is the Monday morning podcast. I do one of these every single week unless there's a little sort of glitch with my host, which is the first time it's ever happened. So just bear with me and just go with this. I do one of these every week. I think. I think I've earned the right to say that. All right, Andy. I answer people's questions. People send me their list of overrated, underrated. They asked me for advice for some God knows reason. And, uh, lately don't send

Speaker 3:          00:44:32       sending me a stories about revenge, but here's a new topic that I guess this guy was trying to say. I introduced and I kind of dropped the ball on it, but, um, I dunno. This is pretty good. He's talking about songs that annoy him, which are basically any top 40 songs, just songs you hear all the time. And uh, or maybe like, I think the topic he was talking about was annoying things in sports. And I brought up how at the red sox home games, they play sweet Caroline. I believe during the seventh inning stretch, that's how much I hate that song is, I'm a huge red sox fan and I don't even know when they play it. I believe that's when they do it. I always just, I just turned the channel. I can't, I can't handle it. And you know, I know I'm from there and I don't, shouldn't be trashed and red sox fans, but I don't give a shit.

Speaker 3:          00:45:29       But if you go to Fenway park and you start singing along to that song with your arm around your girlfriend and y'all look up in the air and you go, Bob, Bob, Bob, you're a fucking embarrassment. You were fucking embarrassments stopped doing that. Isn't it bad enough that we have a mascot now for the Red Sox? You know what I mean? Maybe it's because I don't have any fucking kids, but you know, can we be men, you know, is that like against the rules? Now do you know a long time ago, I might have talked about this before, but a long time ago, back in the day, I want to say it was in the 70s. This is why the Internet is great because you can look this up. I swear to God, they tried to have a mascot. Okay. It was called the Fenway freak. I swear to God.

Speaker 3:          00:46:17       This is true. And the thing lasted about three days, three days in one trip out into the bleachers. And I don't know who that poor bastard was that was inside that fucking suit. But uh, he got pelted mercilessly with any, now that's back in the day when, when it was bad day, you actually got a bat. You've got a full size fucking bat. They wiped out a whole acre of rainforest for every fucking row of people. And this guy got the shit kicked out yonder. We got beat up. But he, you know, it was definitely expressed that we don't need a fucking mascot. You know, this is back in the day too, when a foul ball came into the stands, he didn't give it to a kid. You stepped on a kid to give yourself another foot of height so you could steal it from some other fucking guy.

Speaker 3:          00:47:02       That's how it worked, you know. But now you know, we've got to give it to a kid. Fuck the kid. Give it to a kid. He did. He pay for his ticket. Is He paid for parking? Hasn't he gotten enough? You know, you have to realize how lucky you are. I was a kid. You ever think about that shit when you were like, remember that when you were like six years old, you just had no money. You went outside to play with no ID, no money, no keys to the house, just empty pockets and you just fuck it. Went outside and somehow you know it all worked out. Try doing that as an adults. Walk out of Your House without your keys, identity or any sort of fucking money. And I, I challenge you to walk around the block away from where you live without collapsing in a full panic attack. These fucking kids, I don't know how good they got it and they're going to get a foul ball on top of it. Fuck you. God Damn it. I hate that.

Speaker 4:          00:48:02       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:48:02       I Dunno. I Dunno if I hate kids or I hate their parents. I don't know what it is. I like kids. You know what I like? I like a, I saw a kid the other day, this toddler, you know what's funny about toddlers, you know when they're like two years old is you know, parents always have, I'm like running around shirtless. They always have like that little beer belly. It's the funniest fucking, I cannot not laugh when I see that shift because what I love is this. So like not even self conscious, anybody I was a gutter we subsidize in. But when you're two years old, you know, give a fuck, just walk. They look like little truck drivers. I just think the shit's hilarious. So anyways, what am I talking about? So, uh, so this dude was basically talking about, uh, just talk about, you know, the new topic.

Speaker 3:          00:48:48       Maybe it's things that annoy you in sports. And for me, I mean, I picked on my own team, um, and I, I also, I think I mentioned, I can tell that this guy was bringing it up or if a, I hadn't mentioned it before, but let's, I'll give him credit and agree with him is when they have that old cop come in and he sings, God bless America in Yankee Stadium. Like I've never wanted to throw a toaster through a flatscreen more when he gets up there and he does that whole long beginning [inaudible] and just fucking goes on for like 19 minutes. It's Ah, it's just the worst. Yeah. I, I dunno, I hate that whole thing. I will say hate how the Yankees play New York, New York, whether they win or loose. It just seems bizarre to me. And it was really funny the night when the red sox finally beat him and hung the biggest show can professional sports history around their fucking necks. And the second it's over. The Red Sox had jumping all over their field and that play in that fucking song. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:50:03       sat spread the news. Is everybody up teary-eyed? I don't, maybe it's a tradition. I have no idea, but I'm speaking of which ESPN recently did a top 25 chokes of all time and the Yankees of 2004. We're nowhere on the list. They had like Greg Norman. I was really surprised by that. But I guess it's because you know, when you dominate an entire century, you know, eventually you're going to have a bad year. So I kind of understood it. And of course the red sox made the list. I think we were a number seven through 18. I think we were the top. We have the top 11 fucking jokes of all time. Um, but anyway, speaking of that, did anybody watch the masters? I actually, uh, played nine holes of golf, a par three. And I've never given a shit about golf. I never kept score. I used to sneak into a private golf course when I was a kid with my buddy during the wintertime.

Speaker 3:          00:51:10       You know, when it was no snow on the ground and we would play golf, but it was more like a, it was more like Polo, you know, it wasn't a stroke thing. It was more like a who could get the ball in the hole first. So there was a lot of uh, you know, standing in front of somebody off to the side as they were shooting and you were shooting two and he fucking slices it in the hitching your back. Uh, you know, that kind of shit. And then you play like five holes and then you don't give a fuck and then you just start trying to drive golf balls at the building next to the golf course. We played golf like that. So anyways, long story short, uh, I actually had a good time on this par three course and I actually part one of the holes and I started to be like, man, I think I might want to play this fucking game.

Speaker 3:          00:51:57       So I got fucking, I'll watch the master's, I'll see what's going on. You know, I bet a little money with my good friend Keith Robinson, who a, he's part of my, my, uh, I think he made the first row of my top 9,000 friends. And, uh, he's, he's a man of African descent, so, you know, I'm sick of them talking about tiger woods and I'll fucking Grady is and all this shit. So I call up Keith and I tell them that, you know what, I'm, I'm willing to bet against tiger. I'm willing to put my money on a fucking white man to a beat the, uh, tiger woods, you know, so he goes, I'll take it if at 20 bucks I picked Phil Mickelson and I beat that motherfucker by one stroke. So anyway, so I get totally into this master's and I'm watching the end of it thinking it's going to be this very cool thing.

Speaker 3:          00:52:43       It was the most unsatisfying winning of a championship I've ever experienced as a fan because the Guy Kenny Perry, 48 years old, he had the fucking thing one. Okay. He burned, he's 16. He's up by two strokes with two holes to go. He bogeys 17th. Bogeys the 18th and then loses a two round playoffs. It was, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen and it's like, what I really realized is golf is the worst sport to choke in because you choke in anything else. Let's take the red sox. The ball goes, who bucked is like, how long did that take? How long did that take? Like what fucking two and a half seconds, dude. This Guy Kenny Perry choked for like 90 minutes. An hour and a half on national television, slicing it, hooking it, going into the trap in front of his whole fucking family.

Speaker 3:          00:53:40       The show in his family that dying a slow death. His fucking wife couldn't even look at them at the end of it. It was just, it was, it was fucking horrible. I actually woke up the next day thinking about going, God, if he just chose a different club. I don't know if you're a Kenny Perry fan or, you know, I, I feel real bad for that guy was one of the worst fucking things I've ever seen in my life. So I don't think I'm ever going to watch golf again. I'm done with it. Although I might start playing it and thus complete the circle of being a a a white man, you know? Isn't that what I'm supposed to do? Cross my legs with penny loafers and start pontificating like I know how shit works as I wait to tee off isn't the one I'm supposed to be doing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:24       You know? Certainly by the time I'm 50 dress like I'm in the in a three stooges sketch level. They always do address like in there in the 1920s and they were one of those black panther berets, but it has a palm palm on it. All right. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let's get back to this kid's list. This kid made a list of his top eight which I love, who if people do a top five top three top 10 who does a top eight I'll tell you who this motherfucker, he's doing his top eight songs that just, he never needs to hear again. He basically said, if I were all powerful, I would begin by outlining these things, which I think is a great new topic to another new topic. Okay? Not only do you got the things that annoy you in sports, how about what if you were a dictator and you could make laws?

Speaker 3:          00:55:13       What would you outlaw? And this, he's, this kid's just going with music. All right, number eight. He said, sweet Caroline, as I just went off on, um, number seven, hotel, California. He goes, I don't give a shit where you're living it up. You overrated Pansy. He's got a lot of anger towards all these artists, hotel California. Can we, can we admit that that song never needs to be played again? Piano man, horrific song, horrific song. He know. What's the worst part of the song is? I think it's in three four isn't it saying [inaudible] two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one. And everybody starts fucking rocking back and forth. Like the Red October fest as that's the fucking, you know, it's a great moment in a bar and I swear to God, it's right out of a Benny Hill sketch. You have see somebody with a beer in their hand and they check to see what time it is and their watches on the same hand is, it's never not funny.

Speaker 3:          00:56:17       I saw a guy we would drink and after an la kings game and you don't like when you go to make a point like, you know what the fuck can you kind of throw your hands out to the side. He did that with a full bear in his hand and literally just threw like, it looked like a lake of bear onto this table where there was like, you know, three women sitting at, which made it even funnier. You know what I mean? Cause they were all just like, well I never, um, anyways, anyways, let's, let's continue weight number number five, living on a prayer. Absolutely. I would say the entire Bon Jovi catalog other than, uh, that wanted song, that's a guilty pleasure. It's on my fucking iPod. I'm not apologizing for it. And I actually learned how to play the beginning on the guitar and uh, and it made me happy.

Speaker 3:          00:57:08       I'm such a fucking loser. All right. Number four, sweet home Alabama and it's still one that's on the fence. It's such a good fucking song. But yeah, they've really played the hell out of it. And I love how, uh, I think somebody wrapped over that. I think I talked about this before. Some rapper rap to that sample and it's been in a couple of movies and I noticed black people kind of start bobbing their heads when that song comes on. And uh, if you're black, you should really look up the lyrics to that song and I don't think he'd be bobbing your head. You'd probably be shaking it. Um, all right. Number three. Mustang Sally. Yeah, that song's for like cougars chicks to start fucking shaking. They're dusty muffs too. You know, it's a grind up on some fucking 20 year old kid who really wants to bang you because he's got some sort of weird issue with older women because his mother didn't stick around. That whole cougar seen is just the creepiest, it's, it's every bit is creepy is the 50 year old guy date and that the fucking 18 year old chick, that whole daddy thing going on, it's just, it's really a, it's creepy, but I'm not gonna lie to you. If I was 50 and single and I could, ah, how long would you go? Do you ever think about that? Like right now I'm 40 going to be 41 in June. Uh, 25, 25 is my cutoff. Uh, maybe 24. She listened to jazz.

Speaker 3:          00:58:36       She seemed mature. Um, yeah. All I know is you can't be in college. I remember one time when I was 35, I hooked up with a 21 year olds in, in the process of air quotes here seducing her. I actually said, so what's your major? And I almost, I almost pulled the plug right there. But fortunately my dick was running things at that point and I was able to see the mission through. All right, number two, uh, brown eyed girl. I don't mind that song. Fam Morrison, you know, maybe it's, is that Fan Lorcen Jamar Brown? I do. Do you remember when? Oh yeah. You know, that's one of those songs that everyone sings in a bar and it just makes you hate humanity. I'll give you that one. And is number one song is a American pie. Oh yeah, that's the, that's a song that's like really dramatic for no reason.

Speaker 3:          00:59:33       Even though I know this, they're singing about, uh, the big bopper and Ritchie Valens and a buddy Holly all dying. This wasn't the guy to do the song. He just, he just really slow. And you know, Madonna did a cover, that song. Talk about, you know, two horrific worlds colliding. I'll tell you this, if I, if I could, if I could pick my top, I'll just give you my top three. Um, number three is the entire beyond say catalog. And that includes all of her work with destiny child, Destiny's child. I think she's a beautiful woman. She's a great dancer, but she cannot sing. I think she's singing too high and then, and then it's just, Ugh, those fucking, I haven't heard hooks like that since the last time. J Lo had a fucking album. I'll I that song she had out and they just kept playing that saxophone over and over again.

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       Nah, Nah, it, it did. It did. It did. It did. It did. It did it.

Speaker 3:          01:00:35       And you just wanted to fucking smash or glass into the person next to you. Like they like punish you with the music. That's what like Beyonce songs are like, I don't get it. Like Beyonce. Sing as high as you can and then sing the same thing over and over and over and over and over again.

Speaker 1:          01:00:56       Be like an 80 man. Hey Man. I mean, 20 minutes later, hey, ugh,

Speaker 3:          01:01:02       all her beauty goes down the fucking drain. The second she starts singing Jesus, I'm in a mood. So all her entire catalog, um, anything by kiss. And I'm going to pause here to let everybody be like, oh Jesus Christ. Kids. Come look man. Just Guy Detroit, rock city. It all sucks. It's horrific. And you can take fucking Bob Seger with them. It's a lot of bad white music coming out of Detroit. I'm telling you. Um, and the number one would be thin Lizzy. The boys are back in town and uh, they should be like a contest. Like to just see how long you can listen to that song. It's like they just singing about these fucking, this group of Douche bags that just like thinks they're bad asses. I guess. You know, I haven't, I talked about this before. I can't even fucking remember. I've done some of these podcasts. They got the, the boys are back in town and they get that hope the ball. If the boys want to fight, you better let them really or else what

Speaker 2:          01:02:11       you know

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       man, man, that chick slap Giani in the face. Man, we fell about the place. You know, like everyone's just sitting around this town waiting for these fucking douchebags to show back up. You know, come back into town, you know, all fuck the boys are back in town, hide the women least fucking nerds are back in town and if they want to fight you better. Let them, whoever wrote that song should seriously consider killing themselves. You know, it's right up there with Woodrow Wilson Pushing through the Federal Reserve Act. That's number one. And number two is whoever wrote the boys are back in town. That's how I see that shit. All right, so let's move on here. Let's get on with the podcast. Uh, what do we got here and what do we got here? All right. This here is not really a revenge story. This is actually a, dare I say, kind of clever.

Speaker 3:          01:03:11       What this guy did to fuck somebody over he a, this is what he did. He took us, I don't know a lot of this computer stuff, so I'm going to try to read this slowly and God knows, we all know I suck at reading out loud at this point. All right. He says, uh, I took us. Basically what I did was I took a screen capture of my friends desktop when he left his computer on attended, which basically means he took a picture of, of the guys desktop. I guess he didn't have anything on the screen. He just took a picture of it. He goes, I then hid all his desktop icons and set the background as the screen capture I just took. So basically it looks like all his, all the folders and icons are still there, but they're not. So when the dude comes back, you'll be clicking till his fucking mouth start smoking and nothing will happen.

Speaker 3:          01:04:06       May come on, man. You gotta give this guy an a for effort. That's, that's pretty, uh, I think that's kind of ingenious. So anyways, I guess this is how it plays out. He goes, I waited for the guy to return to see his reaction. He goes, I stood off in the distance, like a fucking stalker. He goes, at first I could see the really confused look on his face, but it very quickly turned to frustration and then anger. He began mumbling shit like fucking piece of shit. And it escalated to him pretty much yelling and saying, I'm going to smash this mother fucker. He goes, I couldn't believe it. He was pounding the keyboard and slamming the mouse. I was laughing so hard. That's not what's coming out of my nose. So they do concluded that he had a virus, soy. He took the computer to the it department. They figured it out in five minutes and told him he's an asshole.

Speaker 3:          01:04:56       What do you think that I do? Good. Or Am I the Douche bag of the week now? Dude, you did great. That's fucking hilarious. That's a great idea. I wish I knew something about computers. I would try that on somebody. I tried that on my girlfriend. That's the kind of guy I am. Um, no, you're not a Douche to, that's a, I don't know if he came up with that, but that's pretty, uh, that's pretty ingenious. So I gave you a thumbs up on that one. And everybody at work, go ahead. Go try that on your boss. No, I don't do to your boss because some will end up ratting you out. And eventually, even if they didn't rat you out, they could figure out that you were the one who did it because you would be doing that. You know that laugh and you didn't in school when you were a kid, you weren't allowed to laugh and you would hold your nose.

Speaker 3:          01:05:38       So you'd start making those duck noises. That usually gives away that you're the one who fucking did it. All right, let's get on with revenge stories. Um, before I get on with the revenge stories, uh, some woman was letting me know why females are better at revenge than guys. And she wrote a pretty interesting thing here. Uh, she says, cause I guess I was asking all my uh, podcast a couple of weeks ago, how come his revenge only a guy thing? How come I'm not hearing from women? And believe me, if you hear the stories this week, uh, I really opened the floodgates because the f the, the women, the ladies, they came in strong this week. So before I read all the women revenge stories here, uh, this woman has this, a little preamble setup she gives me, she goes, Bill, you've only read one revenge story from a female.

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       And I'll tell you why. Guys are idiotic and deal with anger. So stupidly is stupidly a word. Is it a geyser idiotic and they deal with their anger in a stupid way. I don't know. I'm too fucking stupid to know, but that would be hilarious. If stupidly is not a word, you know, because you just made yourself look like an ass and if you didn't, I apologize. Let me continue. Uh, fucking up. Someone's car is pathetic. This kind of revenge is temporary. Doing something like that would just make someone think of you as a cock suck and jackass and then I'll move on with their lives. Women can and will remember my new details and situations that guys will forget when we want to know, wait, when we know how someone works, we know how to use it against them. Physical is temporary. Psychological is permanent.

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       Women can do the most damage with the least effort. We don't aim to screw someone over or to do something to piss someone off. We aim for resentment. Resentment is much more powerful because it places you in a higher status and when someone resents you, it's most likely that you have something that they don't and that you are just better than them. In some way. So my point is that lashing out at someone as stupid and only makes you feel better and doesn't really have or accomplish much long time effect on the other. All right, now I want to tell you something, you guys, that paragraph right there is why I've never gotten married because I realize that women have that, you know, they got that in them. You know that expression Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. That's the deal. It's this weird thing that when they're dating you and they want to know everything about you, it's this odd thing where half of it is so they can love the whole you and the other half is like, it's collateral in case the thing goes bad.

Speaker 3:          01:08:20       They have all this fucked up information that they can use against you. So, uh, I don't know, that was pretty chilling to read that. And uh, I don't agree with their definition of resentment saying that it, it, it, uh, it means that you have something that they don't or that you are just better than them in some way. Uh, I don't think, I think they resent you because you fucked him over, you know, not because you drive a better car. Right. I Dunno. Why don't I shut the fuck up and read the first revenge story? All right, his, now this is all from the, this is all from women this week. And I gotta tell you something. They really, really take it to the next level. And, uh, yeah. All right, let's just get on with this. All right. And, uh, this one, I'm not going to tell the street.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       There's a couple of names and street names, and here I don't want to get anybody in trouble. So here we go. Fill this story is actually not mine, but, um, I was a participant. Um, you know what? I'm going to say the name squeeze. I'm not going to try to fuck remember fake names. I'm just not going to say the name of the street. All right. Right after I graduated from college, I moved to, okay. I can't say that my roommates were still college students, sometimes their friends, which were also my friends, we all went to the same college. They'd, uh, they'd stay over. One of our friends, uh, Jess, who still lived in the dorm, was having problems with a roommate. Gale, her roommate knew she had an eating disorder and was spreading rumors about her writing things on our mirror, like, you're fat.

Speaker 3:          01:09:47       We let just stay at our apartment. And we started plot, started to plot revenge. One of the things we did was crank called gale. So in case you got lost in that, I guess Jess is the anorexic one and Gail is the content. All right. Okay. Let's continue on. One of the things we did was crank call Gail. We, we use the voice from my roommates Mac computer and typed out some evil shit. There's definitely made, just feel better and I guess inspired her to pull the ultimate revenge. Jess was a team model before she went to college. This is the anorexic girl. While in college she worked at a high scale, a high scale salon on something, something street. Shortly after we crank called Gail just ran into gales boyfriend after work. According to Jess, she brought Gail's boyfriend back to her. Their dorm room, fucked him in Gail's bed and then called Gail right after to tell her all the details.

Speaker 3:          01:10:46       Just ended up staying in our apartment the rest of the semester and bought us a $200 bottle of champagne to celebrate the act of revenge. At the time, I thought Gail got what she deserved. But in hindsight, it made me realize that women are evil, manipulative bitches. Yes. Many women hate being called fat, but it ceases to amaze. But it never ceases to amaze me that women, what women will do to others, other women to get back him. Wow. You know what I mean? They take it to that level. Uh, I don't know who deserved what in that story, but I think the real winner is a Gail's boyfriend.

Speaker 3:          01:11:32       You know, you have a one that if you're a guy, you ever wonder if any girl was fucking you oughta revenge just to get somebody back. You know? I don't think that's ever happened to me. I don't live that exciting a life, but I can't imagine what is, what do you say is the guys, she's sitting there banging you. Yeah. That'll show her flip over and I'll bust it on your face. You really taught her a lesson. Hey, anytime you want to teach and teach her a lesson again, just let me know. I really, I really, I'm really down with you. I understand your point here and I think you're very justified. You know, you know, really make really drive the point home is you, let me, if you let me bang you again, you know, and did you really want to get the ultimate, ultimate revenge?

Speaker 3:          01:12:18       You'd let me put it in your ass. You know, I'm just throwing these ideas out there. I mean, this is, this is your world, you know, I'm just, I'm just here to help. Okay. So that's revenge story number one. Um, and I can see, you know, in order it is, it's not that she's fucked the girl's boyfriend, it's that she called him up. I called her up and told her about it. You know, that's one of the advantages of women is for the most part, they don't have to worry about the other woman coming over and just beating the shit out of her. Because as a guy, if you ever tried to get back and another guy and you banged his girlfriend, you'd never call the dude because I don't even care if you could beat the guy in a fight on a normal basis.

Speaker 3:          01:13:00       You know what I'm saying? The level of anger that he would have, he, I think he'd still win. Right? Does that make any sense? All right. Let me plow ahead at Jesus already up to 31 minutes. Let me get through these here. All right. Hey Bill, here's my story of revenge. Everybody knows that women hate each other, hate other women. And I have a great story about women's revenge. Um, I was roommates with two other women in college. One was very average looking and one was very beautiful. The type of beautiful that makes all the other girls around our hater. Um, she got whatever she wanted throughout her life because of, because of it. Guys, money, grades, you name it. And she was a bitch. She used everyone around her. It was never said no to. Um, so I was casually dating a guy and brought him back to my house.

Speaker 3:          01:13:46       So both my roommates were there. We hung out with them for awhile and everything was cool. I didn't notice anything unusual. A few weeks later, or a year from a mutual friend and my roommate, I guess the hot one was out with my guy after seriously interrogating my guy, he finally spills his guts and tells me the truth. I would have loved to have seen that guys have the worst liars ever. No one was the to doing fucking 12 seconds later. All right. All right. You got me. I was fucking her. Anyways, he goes, uh, she had, uh, the hot girl had bumped into the, her boyfriend on campus one day and I guess they hit it off and started seeing each other by my back. Um, naturally I dump his ass, but I'm so much more pissed at her. I kinda read that weird. So it's her boyfriend.

Speaker 3:          01:14:36       Um, okay. So anyways, uh, I come up with a brilliant plan to get my revenge on her and enlisted my other roommates for help. She agrees because all average girls secretly hate pretty girls. This is really eye opening about the, uh, these psycho inner worlds of women. This is like an HBO undercover. So anyways, here's that revenge. Uh, we had an an advantage because the hot girl, she drank a lot and we'd get ripped almost every other night and I mean really, really ripped. We'd wait until she gets, uh, so one night we waited until she got loaded one night and it was the most wasted I've ever seen her. It was like all the stars were in line for our plan. She had beautiful long corn. Silkair uh, oh, here we go. Here we go. She had beautiful long corn. Still Care was straight off the ass of a golden retriever.

Speaker 3:          01:15:30       I bought two boxes of black hair dye and after she passes out, we start in. I really wanted to make a statement, so I part her hair down the middle and only die half of our head. Jesus Christ. After I start, I turn into this crazy die hungry freak. I couldn't stop myself. I started dying. Any part of her body that could, that I could find. I did our eyebrows, the peach fuzz on her chin and lip her fingers and her arms. I'm embarrassed to say that we even died a lightening bolt in her pubic hair. The funny part was is she kept waking up telling us to leave her alone, but we kept going. Jesus, this, this sounds like a fucking date rape story. It's just that as women. So I guess is, it's still funny. Anybody else getting creeped out here? Um, let's continue here.

Speaker 3:          01:16:24       Of course, we were too lazy to wash it out, so if we just go to sleep and leave the black hair dye on our roommate for about seven hours, I wake up the next day to her in a towel towel. Her hair was soaking wet and she was beating the shit out of me with a shampoo bottle. It was fucking hysterical. The dye had stained or skin along with their hair. So she had dark brown patches all over her face and body. She looked like the bastard child of Cruella Deville and Richard Grieco. I don't know who that is. I was so proud of my work. You would think that I got my revenge, but this is a story about her revenge on me. So the fucking long one here, plot twist, she actually called cops and they fucking came and arrested my roommate and me. The evidence was stacked against us because our hands and arms were also stained with black hair dye. Her bed where the crime was committed was covered in black dye. It looked like an octopus had been raped in there.

Speaker 3:          01:17:25       She tried to charge us with sexual assaults. Pump a pubic hair, lightening bolt. Yeah. You know, you pull somebody's pants down, start dying their genitals or at least the area. Yeah, you're going to get in trouble. So anyways, after spending all day in the police station, we were finally let out and the charges were dropped. But when we got back to the house where you're greeted by campus security and our parents were there too, trying to explain to your dad why you died. Some other girl's pubic hair, not fun. The fucking bitch got is kicked out of the house and we put on strict probation. It was a big deal. We almost literally almost got kicked out of school. The worst part was when we were moving out of the house. About a week later she shows up with my ex boyfriend and she looks amazing. She had died the rest of her hair black and cut it in this cute short Bob style and whack stuff.

Speaker 3:          01:18:15       All the body hair. She was as beautiful as ever. And then she writes in capital letters con I felt like such an ass, like there was no way to get back at this bitch. I guess my life isn't over. So someday I will get her back. I'll make sure to fill you in. Okay, well I know you haven't asked my advice, but uh, I think you should just let that one go there. A sweetheart. I think, uh, you know, sometimes you just gotta say fuck it. Uh, isn't that unbelievable? I mean, things like reverse that. And if, if you, if you did that as a guy, if you did that same thing as a guy, you would literally be in a prison shower right now with half a mop handle trying to fight off five rapists. But if you know you have a vagina, all you get it, you just get kicked out of your house.

Speaker 3:          01:19:14       Fucking incredible. I still a bit about that shit. How having a vagina just keeps you out of jail. You know, like, like you have us, he like when a mob boss gets arrested, you know, they never take the wife, you know, like she doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. Oh, I just thought he was a baker. I thought he was really, really good at making cookies. And that's why I had 20 furs and lived in a, lived in a mansion. You knew what the fuck he was doing, you know, and you spent all that blood money in you and you don't end up fucking going to jail. It's a, there's something about it. Like they just don't, uh, like remember that movie monster's ball, not monsters balled up monster with eight, literally turned a serial killer into this sympathetic fucking person. I just didn't, you know.

Speaker 3:          01:20:02       Yeah. He had a rough childhood. You know, you got molested. What are, you know, who didn't go right? Some fucking jokes. You don't get a gun. And starts shooting fucking people. And if you do, you go to jail. They don't ever see that movie was the worst fucking movie ever with those cartoon character, male characters that they had in that. Did you see? You remember that part where she goes into apply for the law office job or something? She comes in there looking like this strung out hooker, and somehow she's not ushered right out of the fucking office. She actually gets in to the lawyers office and he's just like, let me tell you something. You fucking skank. He's like, there's over the top. I really hated that fucking movie. Kind of hate when beautiful actresses don't wear makeup. And then the, everybody falls all over themselves and talks about how brave it is.

Speaker 3:          01:20:54       He was so brave. He was so brave. All right, let's continue on here. All right. Let me read the last one here at bill. Uh, for the past two weeks I've made my girlfriend listened to your podcast. Incidentally, she loves it. This past week she told me about how she got revenge on her ex boyfriend off. This one is brutal and it's, it's very, uh, there's, there's no fat on this one. This one's great because she doesn't get caught. There's nothing, you know, I don't wanna ruin here, but just listen to this. After that messy breakup, she logged onto their shared jet blue, a cow, you know, they're going out. You know, I give a deadly that taking trips. So they got this jet blue account and they evidently, they both had the password, so she logs onto it and she saw that the Douche bag and his new girlfriend had booked a vacation.

Speaker 3:          01:21:41       Well, the morning of their scheduled trip on the morning of the scheduled trip, she logged on and canceled the flight. Can you imagine what a pain in the ass that must've been for them anyways, she never saw any activity on the account again. I thought that this was pretty funny. A lot more subtler than king someone's car, like a little bitch and whatever and whatever. That other more on, wait, I'm reading this wrong and whatever that other more on girl did on the other weeks podcast. Wow, man, that is dead is dirty pool right there. If the guy cheated on you, yeah, I can see that. But if you just had a messy breakup, that's uh, that's vindictive. That's really fucked up. A lot of these things are really a really fucked up. You know that die in that girl's pubic hair. That's, that's really, uh, you need a hobby at that point.

Speaker 3:          01:22:35       All right. Why don't I stop judging people? I asked her you fucking revenge stories. Now I'm judging you. All right. Whatever. This gets overrated, underrated, a overrated karaoke. Hate it. Terrible Song Sung by people who can sing you, which are usually fat chicks and gay guys, and the off chance that you and your drunk friends find yourself at a karaoke bar singing eighties hair metal songs. There's always those douchebags and interrupt the fun with a serious gay country song. You know what I love about this guy? He says, Garrick Karaoke is overrated. Like people actually love it. Okay? Then he says that it's socks and then in the middle of it, he admits doing it. But evidently when he and his douchebag friends go up there and sing eighties hair metal songs, that's totally fine, you know, but when someone comes up to sing us, kick a country song, they're gay.

Speaker 3:          01:23:27       Dude, I hate to tell you this, but you're part of the fucking problem. I'm actually, you know what, actually if you sing an eighties hair metal song and a karaoke thing, I'm going to laugh my ass off. And uh, I liked that better. Just as long as someone doesn't go well, what are the, what are the fucking tunes? Those chicks I always end up singing. Uh, what does that song that guy sings about losing his virginity? That oh, what a knife that sounded lay it is in La Vega and 63 for some reason women love that fucking song. And uh, there's, there's nothing worse than the female voice, like 12 of them all singing in a really high voice. It's like a car alarm going off. All right, I think we're done for the week. And Are we, what are we up to? 42 minutes. All right.

Speaker 3:          01:24:16       As bill is. This is this podcast petering out here. I think I'm doing too much reading and not telling enough stories. All right, let's, let's, let's read this one here. Um, okay. Bill. Uh, I'm almost 26 and a bunch of my friends still love going to the clubs at night and on weekends. Uh, now I'm not sure that I'm, if I'm getting too old for it or just, or if I just can't stand people, but I absolutely hate going to these places. I know as a guy supposed to go in there and get girls, but I just can't take it anymore. No matter which place it is. It always feels like she should get a mandatory penicillin shout when you leave because a group of sweaty skanky people crammed into a room, grinding to crappy techno music is just disgusting. That combined with the guys with the sonic, the hedgehog haircut just drives me crazy, especially when they're the ones getting all the girls.

Speaker 3:          01:25:06       Um, is it me or these places? Truly horrific. And what stage, uh, and what, and what age were you officially the old fuck at the club? Um, all right. All right, dude. Now you're being too hard on yourself. First of all, you're only 26 years old. You're in the prime of your life. You should be going out and talking to women. You just doing it in a, in a bar that's not you. You know what I mean? Like basically everybody's a douchebag. Okay. But you got to hang out with the same kind of Douche bags so you feel comfortable. You know what I mean? Like me, I'm a loner psycho Douche bag. So I used to hang out in dive bars and, uh, who the fuck am I kidding? Did I that I don't think I ever picked up a girl in the bar. I always met him at gyms, amend them on the subway a lot in New York.

Speaker 3:          01:25:59       Um, I, I meet them when they're not ready. You know, like women don't have their guard up sometimes, like on the train, they have that guard up to get mugged, not to be hit on, I guess. I don't know, maybe I just felt like, you know, I would never did well in those singles bars. Like, you know, it's almost like as a comedian, someone goes, you're a comedian. All right, say something funny. It's just like you've ruined the moment. So I would, I would still go out, just find, uh, you know, find, find the right place to hang out. You can't hang it up to 26 unless you live in the middle of Kansas and you might as well fucking read a Bible and knock up some broad and have eight kids and vote for a fucking retard over and over again for eight fucking years.

Speaker 3:          01:26:47       Okay. That was a little mean. All right. Uh, question of the week. Uh, Bill, I was wondering how you handled two shows a one night I was part of the lake crowd tonight and you killed what was, was it the same scenario in the earlier show with a joke said bombed in the earliest show where their jokes in the, in the earlier show that bombed that you skipped on the second show. Uh, no. You know, if it bombed, I'm too stubborn. I'm going to keep doing it, but I'm doing two shows in one night. I try to switch it up, you know, I just don't want the waitstaff and everybody to know exactly how am I actually going to go. Um, because that's a big thing on the second show and your three, three days into your weekend gig. If, uh, you see like the waitresses smiling and stuff and laughing as they're bringing drinks over to the table, that's like one of the best compliments you can get because, uh, nobody sees more comedy or listens to more comedy than comedy club waitresses because as a comedian, if I see a comic and I don't like what he's doing, I can walk out of the room.

Speaker 3:          01:27:56       But as, as a waitress, you have to, you got to keep going back in, you know, and uh, so you can get the, you know, so they get jaded really quickly as far as like, what's funny that I'm so, um, I don't even know if I answered your question, but, no, I don't really, I know what I'm going to start with and I know what I'm going to finish with. I don't really know what's going to be in the middle, but I definitely switch up the jokes just so I don't feel like, like that groundhog day thing where everything's the say. So. Uh, all right. There's that. All Right, Bill, I've been listening to your podcasts and I watched you perform because it's nice to hear to someone use the word cunt every five minutes. You don't seem to curse as much when you're performing, but you're getting to be like, uh, some of the other dirty comics out there on your podcast. I think it's quite hilarious how you use the word to describe anyone that's pissing you off through unnecessary though, unnecessary most of the time. Um, in addition, I'll wait a minute. I already read this. I already read this tonight. This is, this lady asked me about Saint Patrick's Day. That was from Cleveland. I already read that. All right, so I guess that is end of the podcast

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       for this week. Um, please give me the feedback. What do you think about the new, uh, the new stereo sound? I know I need to make some adjustments. I know I might've been too close to it a couple of times and I know that there's like an echo in the room now and I'll put some empty egg shell crates on the fucking side of my walls, but whatever. So, uh, so that's the deal. I'm just to let you know, uh, my upcoming gigs, I'm going to be at Iowa state this weekend, April 18th, and that is a private show. That show is only for the students of Iowa state. You need a student Id to get into the show

Speaker 5:          01:29:40       or

Speaker 2:          01:29:42       if you kind of look young and you have a baseball cap, maybe you can sneak your way in, but you didn't hear that from me. Um, the following weekend I'm going to be at the funny bone in Columbus and the weekend after that it'll be a Caroline's in New York City. Um, young Joe de Rosa will be for a opening for me on both of those shows. And then if you'll notice on my, uh, my website, I had to blow out a number of dates. Tempe, Ireland, Cleveland and Atlanta are all being rescheduled. And I can't really tell you why as of yet. I'm going to leave you hanging. How do you like that?

Speaker 5:          01:30:23       Huh?

Speaker 2:          01:30:24       Like one of those old fucking Batman and Robin's when they're stuck in a machine and they're going to fucking die and you got to wait until next week. Yeah. I can't really tell you. I can't actually, I can't tell you for a minute. I kind of a, something may or may not be going on and I needed to free up my schedule and at some point actually in June I'll be able to let you know. So that's the deal. That's the Monday morning podcast. And if you like this, the device I'm using is the Olympus ls 10 this fucking thing is a, it's pretty incredible and I'm going to have a, a my own mic next weekend up. Me and Joe de Rosa are going to be continuing our uninformed show as a podcast on the uh, myspace.com/uninformed radio. And we're going to be using this device with a couple of microphones, and I think we're going to be doing an episode next week and we're going to put it up there and it's going to sound lovely and that's it. And I feel like I'm born yet, so that's it. Everybody. Thanks for listening and please keep the questions coming and feel free to keep sending me, you know, things from past topics and if you want to do them for the, uh, the new ones, songs, your top fucking, your top eight songs that annoy you and shit in a sports that bugs you. All right. That's it. Everybody have a good one.
