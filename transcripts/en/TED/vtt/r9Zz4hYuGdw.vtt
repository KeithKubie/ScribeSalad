00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.976
Something happened

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:19.038
while I was studying in the seminary

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:22.198
and training to be a priest.

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:27.258
I came in contact
with a different idea of life.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:33.528
An idea of life that contradicted
the main teachings of religion --

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:34.702
humanism.

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:40.499
Some of you may be wondering,
what on earth is humanism?

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:44.609
Humanism is a way of thinking and living

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:47.566
that emphasizes the agency
of human beings.

00:00:48.712 --> 00:00:52.157
Humanism stresses the fact
that we, human beings,

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:54.344
are capable of changing the world.

00:00:55.014 --> 00:00:58.895
That we have the power
to make a difference in our lives,

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:01.625
both individually and collectively,

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.182
without recourse to some outside force.

00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:10.910
It may interest you to know
that the best humanist lessons I learned

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:13.585
were not from reading philosophy books

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.813
or from poring over humanist
manifestos and declarations.

00:01:18.363 --> 00:01:20.061
No, not at all.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:25.394
The best humanist lesson I learned
was from the life of my own parents.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.633
My parents come
from a poor family background

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:32.005
in Mbaise, in southeastern Nigeria.

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.136
They had limited opportunities.

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.419
But my parents did not allow
the circumstances of their bad upbringing

00:01:40.443 --> 00:01:45.512
to determine the ambition and dreams
for themselves and for their children.

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:50.395
My father worked part-time,
trained as a teacher,

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:54.077
and rose to become a headmaster
at a local primary school.

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:57.330
My mother dropped out
of school quite early,

00:01:57.354 --> 00:02:02.801
because her mother, my grandmother,
could not afford her education.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.418
As a parent, my mother worked very hard,

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:12.710
combining farming, petty trading
and taking care of my siblings and me.

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:15.314
By the time I was born --

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:18.251
that was shortly after
the Nigerian civil war --

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:22.148
life was very difficult,
a struggle day by day.

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:25.387
My family was living in a hut.

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.299
With the eye of a child,
I can still see water

00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:31.497
dripping from the thatched roof
of our house when it rained.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:36.110
My father reared goats
to supplement the family income.

00:02:36.712 --> 00:02:40.506
And part of my duty
after school hours or during vacation

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.196
was to feed these goats.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:46.592
There was no electricity,
no pipe with water.

00:02:47.387 --> 00:02:50.520
We trekked to fetch water
from the nearby streams.

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.792
That was an easy work in the wet season,

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:56.415
but kilometers when it was hot and dry.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:59.525
Through hard work and perseverance,

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.484
my parents were able
to erect a block apartment

00:03:02.508 --> 00:03:04.889
and send my siblings and me to school.

00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:08.817
They made it possible for us
to enjoy a standard of living

00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:10.221
which they never did

00:03:10.245 --> 00:03:12.380
and to attain educational levels

00:03:12.404 --> 00:03:15.221
which they only imagined
when they were growing up.

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:20.982
My parents' life, their story,
is my best lesson in humanism.

00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:25.133
So as a humanist,
I believe that human beings

00:03:25.157 --> 00:03:28.228
are challengers, not prisoners of faith.

00:03:28.252 --> 00:03:32.426
Our destinies are in our hands,
not predetermined.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.514
And it's left for us to shape
our lives and destinies

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:38.855
to reflect our best hopes and aspirations.

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.336
I believe that human beings have the power

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.387
to turn situations of poverty
into those of wealth and prosperity.

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.701
We have the capacity
to alleviate suffering,

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:52.948
extend life, prevent diseases,

00:03:52.972 --> 00:03:56.331
cure debilitating ailments,
reduce infant mortality

00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:58.022
and preserve our planet.

00:03:58.442 --> 00:04:03.124
But we cannot accomplish all these goals
by wishful thinking with our eyes closed

00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:08.504
or by armchair speculation
or by expecting salvation from empty sky.

00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:14.377
In contrast, millions of Africans
imagine that their religious faith

00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.306
will help their dream come true,

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.522
and they spend so much time
praying for miracles

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:22.479
and for divine intervention
in their lives.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.228
In 2009, a Gallup survey in 114 countries

00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:34.005
revealed that religiosity was highest
in the world's poorest nations.

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:39.553
In fact, six of the 10 countries
where 95 percent of the population

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:44.661
said that religion was an important part
of their daily lives, were African.

00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:50.172
In some cases, religion drives
many Africans to extraordinary length:

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:53.656
to attack other human beings,
to commit ritual killing,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.379
targeting those living with albinism,

00:04:57.403 --> 00:04:59.077
those with a humpback,

00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:02.085
and as I recently learned,
those with a bald head.

00:05:02.109 --> 00:05:04.990
In Africa, superstition is widespread,

00:05:05.014 --> 00:05:07.291
with so many people
believing in witchcraft,

00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:10.585
something that has no basis
in reason or in science.

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:16.472
Yet alleged witches, usually women,
children and elderly persons

00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:19.877
are still routinely attacked,
banished and killed.

00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.593
And I've made it part of my life's mission

00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:27.021
to end witchcraft accusation
and witch persecution in Africa.

00:05:27.045 --> 00:05:31.245
So as a humanist, I believe
in a proactive approach to life.

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.863
The changes that we want
cannot be achieved only by dreaming

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:37.879
but require doing as well.

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.776
The challenges that we face cannot go away

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.751
if we recoil and retreat into our shells,
wishing and imagining

00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:48.375
that those problems will somehow
magically disappear.

00:05:48.926 --> 00:05:53.011
The good life that we desire
will not fall like manna from heaven.

00:05:53.442 --> 00:05:57.926
My parents did not erect a block apartment
by wishing and dreaming.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:02.180
They worked hard, they failed,
they tried again.

00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:04.371
They toiled with rolled-up sleeves,

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:07.236
with their hands deep in debt,
they plowed ahead,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.569
growing their dreams into reality.

00:06:10.133 --> 00:06:15.161
So as a humanist, I believe
we must be adventurous and even daring.

00:06:15.504 --> 00:06:19.466
The path of success is paved
with risk and uncertainties.

00:06:19.807 --> 00:06:24.203
We have to muster the will and courage
to do what people have never done.

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:26.562
To think what people have never thought.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:28.791
Envisage what people have never imagined.

00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:31.244
Go to places human beings
have not been to.

00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:34.611
And succeed where people
have tried but failed.

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.672
We must be ready to explore new frontiers
of knowledge and understanding

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:41.426
and attempt doing
not just what is possible

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.791
but also what is seemingly impossible.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.656
But I realize that at the end of the day,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.164
our efforts do not always
yield our desires.

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:56.442
We fail, we suffer
disappointments and setbacks.

00:06:56.863 --> 00:07:01.180
Some problems, such as wars and conflict,
poverty and diseases

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.577
and other natural and human-made disasters

00:07:03.601 --> 00:07:05.868
seem as if they may never go away.

00:07:06.538 --> 00:07:10.125
Solutions to old problems
have led to new dangers,

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:13.121
new cures to diseases
have resulted in new health risks.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:15.918
But the fact that these problems persist

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.823
and that solutions sometimes
create their own problems

00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:22.045
is not a reason for us
to give up or to resign.

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:26.307
It's not a reason for us to think
that our efforts are of no consequence.

00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:29.045
In fact, there is fulfillment in striving,

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:32.196
and trying to provide
answers and solutions

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.212
to the problem humanity faces

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.969
even when the likely outcome is failure.

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:42.552
So as a humanist, I believe
we must not despair for humanity.

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:45.894
Even in the face
of overwhelming difficulties

00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:48.632
and in the bleakest of circumstances.

00:07:48.656 --> 00:07:50.856
Human beings are creative beings.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:57.672
We have the power to generate new ideas,
new solutions and new cures.

00:07:57.696 --> 00:08:01.443
So why despair when the unexpected
knocks on the horizon?

00:08:01.776 --> 00:08:05.458
It is in our nature to create anew,
to be inventive and innovative,

00:08:05.482 --> 00:08:10.082
so why languish in idle expectation
of a savior from above?

00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:14.125
So it is time for us Africans
to take our destiny in our hands

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:16.688
and realize we have agency
in the scheme of life.

00:08:17.006 --> 00:08:19.935
We need to put an end
to this game of blame

00:08:19.959 --> 00:08:23.751
that has prevented us from taking
full responsibility for our own lives.

00:08:23.775 --> 00:08:27.522
For too long, we have been
prisoners of our past.

00:08:27.546 --> 00:08:30.776
We have allowed despair
and pessimism to drain us,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.299
drain our energies,
limit our imaginations

00:08:33.323 --> 00:08:36.855
and dim our vision
for a better and brighter future.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.387
We have let this continent flounder.

00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.720
Why passing the buck like a Frisbee?

00:08:41.744 --> 00:08:44.903
We've blamed slavery, colonialism
and the new colonialism

00:08:44.927 --> 00:08:48.831
for the woes we experience,
including our own self-inflicted wounds.

00:08:48.855 --> 00:08:50.481
We have conducted ourselves

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:53.703
in ways that seem as if Africa
is damned and doomed.

00:08:53.727 --> 00:08:55.979
And that all these experiences in history

00:08:56.003 --> 00:09:00.403
have irreversibly, irreparably foreclosed
the chances and possibility

00:09:00.427 --> 00:09:04.330
for Africa to emerge, thrive
and flourish.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:08.117
We must realize that there is
no part of the world

00:09:08.141 --> 00:09:11.950
that has not been colonized
or enslaved in the past.

00:09:12.323 --> 00:09:15.466
And if other parts of the world
have moved on,

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.211
why can't we, now?

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:22.315
So as a humanist, I believe
that the past is gone;

00:09:22.339 --> 00:09:24.736
we cannot change it, we cannot alter it.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.736
But the future beckons us on
with limitless possibilities

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.879
to recreate, reshape
and remake our destinies.

00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:35.275
So let's all of us seize this opportunity.

00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:39.212
And as my parents did,
begin the urgent task

00:09:39.236 --> 00:09:41.966
of rebuilding Africa, brick by brick.

00:09:42.323 --> 00:09:45.077
Let's give free reign
to our ideas and imaginations,

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:49.593
as demonstrated at this TEDGlobal 2017.

00:09:49.617 --> 00:09:51.617
Let's open our hearts and minds.

00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:55.934
And exert our energy,
intelligence and ingenuity

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.403
and begin the urgent task
of rebuilding Africa

00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:01.799
and of transforming this continent

00:10:01.823 --> 00:10:05.572
into a citadel of unrivaled
prosperity and civilization.

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:10.712
This is what I believe as a humanist,
as an African humanist.

00:10:10.736 --> 00:10:11.910
Thank you.

00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:18.484
(Applause)
