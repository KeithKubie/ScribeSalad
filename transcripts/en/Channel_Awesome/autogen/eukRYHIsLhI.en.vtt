that other stuff make sense
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.999
that other stuff make sense
so I was saying in the other episode

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
so I was saying in the other episode
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.890

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.850
was like you know I didn't have horror
movies that were full of black people I

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
movies that were full of black people I
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.110
movies that were full of black people I
didn't have horror movies that were full

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
didn't have horror movies that were full
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.729
didn't have horror movies that were full
of people who looked like me and also I

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
of people who looked like me and also I
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:20.960
of people who looked like me and also I
didn't have horror movies where people

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
didn't have horror movies where people
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.970
didn't have horror movies where people
just made the right decisions and I

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
just made the right decisions and I
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.949
just made the right decisions and I
thought that on that a lot and there was

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
thought that on that a lot and there was
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.120
thought that on that a lot and there was
just one moment where I was like well

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130
just one moment where I was like well
 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.949
just one moment where I was like well
I'm gonna argue that Jordan Peele

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
I'm gonna argue that Jordan Peele
 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.410
I'm gonna argue that Jordan Peele
because she goes into the funhouse she

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420
because she goes into the funhouse she
 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.509
because she goes into the funhouse she
sees the man holding hands and she walks

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519
sees the man holding hands and she walks
 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.759
sees the man holding hands and she walks
into the funhouse and I'm like why go

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769
into the funhouse and I'm like why go
 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.170
into the funhouse and I'm like why go
back to your family

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
back to your family
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.050
back to your family
what are you doing here go back and then

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060
what are you doing here go back and then
 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.819
what are you doing here go back and then

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829
if he I mean it makes total sense that
 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.979
if he I mean it makes total sense that
she's the copy and so she goes she's

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
she's the copy and so she goes she's
 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.839
she's the copy and so she goes she's
going down there to find the real one

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849
going down there to find the real one
 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.210
going down there to find the real one
who has been the copy this whole time

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
who has been the copy this whole time
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.960
who has been the copy this whole time

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.780
it's so well done I think it it really
pieces some things together that are

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.740
already made sense for the most part in
them and then for them to even make more

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
them and then for them to even make more
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.140
them and then for them to even make more
sense it's so exciting it's like that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150
sense it's so exciting it's like that
 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.610
