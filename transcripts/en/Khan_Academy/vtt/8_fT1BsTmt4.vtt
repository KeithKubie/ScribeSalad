00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.730
We have 7,329 minus 6,278.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.550
So let's go place by place
and see if we can subtract.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.270
6,278 is clearly
less than 7,329,

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.140
so we should be able to do this.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.750
So first, we go
to the ones place.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.200
We're subtracting an 8 from a 9.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.630
That seems pretty
straightforward.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.980
That's just going to be a
1, a 1 in the ones place.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.450
It literally just represents 1.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.490
Then we go to the tens place.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.910
And we're trying to
subtract a 7 from a 2.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.580
And this is really
representing 70.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.530
And this is really
representing 20.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.390
Well, now we're hitting a
bit of a stumbling block.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.800
So we're going to have
to regroup or borrow.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.610
And to understand
what we're doing,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.010
let's rewrite both
of these numbers.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.380
So 7,329-- 7 we can rewrite
as being equal to 7,000.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.670
Plus 300-- so this 3
in the hundreds place

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.350
is representing 300.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.580
The 7 in the thousands
place is 7,000.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.430
3 in the hundreds place is 300.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.690
The 2 in the tens place,
that's two 10's, or 20.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.760
And then the 9 in the ones
place is just going to be 9.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.340
So this is another way
of representing 7,329.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.310
And then down here, we have
the 6 in the thousands place.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.200
Well, that's going to be 6,000.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.800
And we're subtracting,
so minus 6,000.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.692
And then here, we have a
2 in the hundreds place.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:31.150
And once again, we're going to
be subtracting all of these.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.060
So we're going to
be subtracting 200.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.099
And then here in the tens
place, we have our 7.

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:39.140
And we're subtracting it.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.560
So seven 10's, that's 70.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.670
And then we are
subtracting that 8.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.870
And what we've already
done is said, hey, look.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.260
Subtracting 8 from 9?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.576
That's just going to be 1.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:58.200
But then we got over
here, and we said,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.400
hey, how are we going
to subtract 70 from 20?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.380
And the key here is to regroup
some of the value up here

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.940
and give it to
the tens place, so

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.100
that we can subtract 70 from it.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.920
And the most natural place to
go is one place value above.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.640
So we could take
100 from the 300.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.740
So then it will become 200.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.800
We're going to give 100--
we're going to give that 100

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.010
to the tens place.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.670
So it is going to become 120.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.340
Notice, 200 plus 120 is 320.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.220
300 plus 20 is 320.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.320
We have not changed the
value of the number.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.470
We've just changed what place
we're representing it in.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.830
If we wanted to do it
here, we could say--

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.140
and when you think of it this
way, this is really regrouping,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.660
and this is really
what's happening.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.993
But if you want to think of
it in a borrowing framework,

00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:55.420
you could say, hey,
let's take 1 from the 3.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.670
Although it's a 300, so
you're really taking 100.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.030
That becomes a 2.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.320
And you give that 1
to the tens place.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.030
And so that becomes a 12.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.670
Now, what was really
happening is you took 100.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.880
You gave it to the 20.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.170
It became 120.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.480
But now you can subtract.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.240
Here, you'd say, well,
what's 120 minus 70?

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.970
Well, 120 minus 70
is going to be 50.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.630
Over here you could say,
well, what's 12 minus 7?

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.039
Well, that's 5.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:23.830
But it's still representing
the same thing.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.880
12 10's is 120.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.590
Seven 10's is 70.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.720
And they give you five 10's,
which is the same thing as 50.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.110
This 5 represents that 50.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.010
And then we can go
to the other places.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.180
You say 2 minus 2.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.860
Well, that's zero 100's.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.660
And then 7,000 minus
6,000 is 1,000.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.770
And once again, right over here,
200 minus 200 is zero 100's.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.880
And then 7,000 minus
6,000 is 1,000.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.010
So this is going to be
1,000 plus 0 plus 50

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.559
plus 1, which is the
exact same thing as 1,051.

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.100
The important thing
is to visualize--

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.135
you don't have to write
this out every time.

00:04:03.135 --> 00:04:04.926
But to make sure you
visualize in your head

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:08.464
that this 3 is representing
300, that this 2 represents 20,

00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:11.610
that when you're taking
100 from the 300,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.480
then you would represent that
as a 2 in the hundreds place.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.740
And then when you give
100 to the tens place,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.307
it's essentially that the
two 10's will become 12 10's.

00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:23.890
Because you're giving
it 10 more 10's.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.100
You're giving it 100.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.810
So hopefully, that
makes some sense.
