(students talking)

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.700
- At Fall Hamilton, our common
goal here is the children.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.115
Sometimes kids are in crisis,

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.691
and it's just emotionally
draining as a teacher.

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.095
But at the end of the day,
you know that these kids

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:22.678
rely on you, so we also need
to take care of ourselves.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:30.495
We know you can't help others
until you help yourself.

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.277
Sometimes you just need a minute.

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:36.542
You need to step out of your
own room, take a deep breath.

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.483
- As educators, we may
be having a rough day,

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:42.146
and sometimes we get frustrated too.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.761
So we have a tap-in,
tap-out strategy here.

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.630
If something happens in the classroom,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.738
teachers have the ability
to contact someone

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:52.238
on the text chain.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.181
If there's a student that
needs some extra support,

00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:58.397
if the teacher needs extra support,

00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:01.230
then someone else is able
to come in and provide that.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.532
(phone rings)

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:05.324
- [Natalie] If you need a
minute, you can text someone

00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:06.832
and be like, "Hey, can you cover my class?

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:08.568
Can you give me a second?"

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.188
And we will gladly cover one another.

00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:15.375
- In terms of faculty support,
we feel more supported

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.973
here in this environment because

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:18.980
we know that it's a collaborative effort

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.153
and everyone is going to be heard.

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:22.486
- This is great!

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.430
- You sometimes just need to
ask for help, and it's okay,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.493
and it's really accepted
here, and it's promoted.

00:01:31.493 --> 00:01:34.229
No one's alone, we're a
ship and we run together,

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.062
and there's someone
always that has your back.
