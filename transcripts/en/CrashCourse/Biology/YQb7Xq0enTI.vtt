00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.649
Hey there, I'm just hanging out
with some distant relatives here.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.400
I've got to say I've got
a lot of respect for these guys,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.670
because they are some of the most
successful organisms on the earth.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.700
We think we run things
on this planet, but we don't.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.679
They do.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.129
On one acre of cultivated land,
annelids like this earthworm

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.470
process about 16,000 pounds of
soil a year, which makes plant life

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.749
and our lives

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:23.589
therefore, possible.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.669
And not only are there about a
billion billion arthropods

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.180
like this in the world, that's
10 to the 18th power by the way,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.329
but also 80% of known
animal species are arthropods.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.969
Now, don't get me wrong,
even though bugs and spiders

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.620
and worms and shrimp totally
outnumber us humans,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.870
we are far more complex than them.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.339
When it comes to arm
wrestling and guitar playing

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.749
and long division,
we'd totally school them.

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.899
But complexity like ours
had to start somewhere.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.579
And it started with
a very special trait

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.519
that we share with these animals.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.600
Can you see the resemblance?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.600
Last time we talked about how,
in the very simplest animals,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.159
there are two traits that indicate
an animal's relative complexity:

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.170
there's how many germ layers they
develop when they're embryos

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.860
and whether or not they
have a coelom, or body cavity

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.250
that holds their organs.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.399
So it's in the next two phyla,
Annelida and Arthropoda, where we

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.290
find the new big thing in animal
complexity: segmentation.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.369
Segmentation is the repetition
of anatomically identical units

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.890
that can be added to and modified
to serve different purposes

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.090
as animals evolve.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.899
And evolution is the
way to win it, folks.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.820
In fact, the three biggest and
most diverse groups of animals

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.430
in the world are the ones
that display segmentation:

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.729
Annelida, Arthropoda and Chordata,
which includes the vertebrates.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.229
All segmented animals
have a common ancestor

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.479
that probably lived about
600 million years ago.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.759
That's how long ago it was
when one of your grandparents

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.289
and one of the
earthworm's grandparents

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.259
and one of the
beetle's grandparents

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.460
all played on the
same softball team.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.570
Pretty crazy.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.490
Segmentation has proven
to be unbelievably useful

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.990
from an evolutionary perspective.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.460
In humans, you see anatomically
identical pieces repeated

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.410
along an axis from
our butts to our heads.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.190
They can be a little hard to see
because they're so highly modified,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.630
but think about our vertebrae:
They're segments!

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.200
Our ribs are segments!

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.520
The cartilage around our
trachea? Those are segments!

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.030
Even the folds in
our brains are segments.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.880
They're crazy-evolved segments,
but segments just the same.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.970
Among today's animal phyla, the
earliest to display segmentation

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.190
is Annelida, which includes
leeches, earthworms and lugworms.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.950
See how their whole bodies look
like rings fused together?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.440
Segments!

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.430
In fact, the word Annelida comes
from the Greek for "little rings,"

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.140
and when you look at any
annelid, you see that they're all

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.100
really obviously segmented.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.670
Now, this segmentation
is a great example

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.510
of synapomorphy in annelids.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.440
Synapomorphies are traits that set
one group of animals apart from its

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.960
ancestors and from other groups
that came from the same ancestors.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.480
So unlike their flatworm
and nematode cousins,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.770
Annelids are segmented and
they've also got little bristles

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.800
on their bodies called chaetae
that provide traction

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.260
and help them move
through the dirt.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.110
These are both little extra
somethings that annelids' have,

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.790
that less complex relatives
don't have and that their common

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.330
ancestors didn't have.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.550
Synapomorphies, literally
"shared derived traits,"

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.320
are usually the defining
traits of a phylum.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.220
But you can also learn something
about an animal's lineage

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.080
by comparing plesiomorphies,
very basic traits

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.180
that are shared by animals
with a common ancestry.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.750
So, between the Platyhelminthes,
the Nematodes and the Annelids,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.130
one plesiomorphy is that
they're all worm-shaped,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.300
which tells you they have a
common, distant, ancestor

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.230
that was wormy-lookin'.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.830
So as we talk about these phyla
and the classes within them,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.380
notice how they're similar
and different from each other.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.120
For instance, within Annelida,
there are three different classes.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.490
Everybody's favorite, of course,
is the oligochaetes, the earthworms

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.020
Their name refers to the
synapomorphy I just mentioned:

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.480
they have "chaetae",
or bristles,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.270
but only an "oligo",
few of them.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.070
And they're everyone's favorite
because they eat soil and crap

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.420
it out the other end,
allowing air and water

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.020
to circulate in soil.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.580
Plus their poo is rich in things
that plants need to grow,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.110
like nitrogen, calcium,
magnesium, and phosphorus.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.870
And now i'm going to
go wash my hands.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.590
Now on to the class
Hirudinea, the leeches,

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.599
a lot of which are parasitic
and, you know, eat

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.409
blood and other bodily fluids.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:21.299
A synapomorphy of leeches
are their powerful suckers

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.270
they've got them on
both ends of their body,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.180
the posterior one being used
to anchor itself while the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.210
anterior one that surrounds its
mouth attaches to its host.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.000
All leech species are carnivorous
and they are hermaphrodites

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.879
like earthworms.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:38.879
Now, the Polychaetes are bristly
worms, hence a synapomorphy

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.539
of this class is their "poly"
(many) "chaete" (bristles).

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.020
Almost all of these
are marine species,

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.300
and they're really diverse,
but the ones you've probably seen

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.389
evidence of are the lugworms,
the ones that dig holes

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.169
at the beach and leave
piles of castings on the sand.

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.360
Okay, I know you've
had enough of worms.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.520
Now we've got Arthropoda
to talk about, and that's not

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.389
very easy to do because
there are A LOT of them.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.120
Like I said, they
totally outnumber us.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.879
Just to put things into
perspective, there are more

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.240
insects in a square mile of
rural land than there are

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.620
human beings on the earth.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.550
One reason scientists think
arthropods do so well has to

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.530
do with theirâ€”

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.780
you guessed it!

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.020
-segmented bodies.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.110
Fossils of early arthropods
show that there used to be

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.259
very little variation between
segments, but as they evolved,

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.310
segments fused and became
specialized for different

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.520
functions, which led to
crazy amounts of diversity.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.639
So much diversity that Arthropoda
includes stuff like scorpions,

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.580
butterflies and lobsters.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.569
Which...I know.

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:36.999
Seems like maybe a
bit of a stretch.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:40.050
But here are the synapomorphies
that make them all arthropods:

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.210
1. They have segmented bodies that,
in most cases, are broken up into

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.469
three segments: head,
thorax and abdomen.

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.879
And check this out:
Here, segmentation in arthropods

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.310
is a good example
of a plesiomorphy.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.360
It's a basic, ancient
trait that they share

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.379
with annelids and us
chordates, for that matter,

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.139
dating back to that softball
game our forebears played

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.870
some 600 million years ago.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.240
2. All arthropods have an
exoskeleton: a hard outer shell

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.080
made out of chitin, which is a
really tough carbohydrate that's

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.259
chemically similar to the cellulose
that you find in plants,

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.969
and in order to grow bigger
they have to shed it.

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.460
And be glad that you
don't have to do that.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.029
Because it looks like kind of
a traumatic experience for them.

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:22.349
3. Finally, they've all got paired
and jointed appendages,

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.509
which is actually where
their name comes from:

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.830
arthropod means "jointed feet."

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.069
But it's not just their legs that
are jointed. Some of them have

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.669
claws and jointed antennae,
and they all have these

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:34.990
external mouthparts
that are also jointed.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.759
So that's what all arthropods
have in common, but they are

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.710
grouped into 4 subphyla,
based on how they differ

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.629
from each other.

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:45.759
First, and perhaps most terrifying,
you have your Cheliceriformes,

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:48.789
which includes spiders
and scorpions, but also

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:50.430
horseshoe crabs
which are kind of nice,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.779
and ticks, which aren't

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:54.400
and mites, which don't
bother you at all,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.960
probably...

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.090
they might.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.499
Cheliceriformes comes from the
Greek for "arm-lips," which--

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:01.129
Whatever, Greeks...

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.889
refer to their long
fang-like pincers.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:06.550
Unlike a lot of arthropods,
they have simple eyes with

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.270
just one lens, not compound eyes
like flies, and they lack antennae.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.789
Most Cheliceriformes are
landlubbers, but the fossil record

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.029
tells us that a lot of them were
marine back in the olden days.

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.189
Sea spiders and horseshoe crabs
are the only ones left now.

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:21.939
The largest class of
Cheliceriformes are

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:25.180
the arachnids, the group that
includes spiders, scorpions,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.469
ticks and mites.

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:29.479
They have what's called a
cephalothorax, which is a

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:32.909
head segment and a thorax
segment fused together,

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.689
with eight legs and
an abdomen behind.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:38.629
Most arachnids are carnivorous
or parasitic and they're

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:39.699
very skittery.

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:40.999
Just sayin'.

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:44.749
Next, Myriapoda, or "many feet,"
includes what you would expect:

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:47.680
the millipedes and centipedes,
these are where the arthropods

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.319
were like "let's see
how far we can take

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.029
this segmentation
thing, shall we?"

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:54.589
All Myriapods are terrestrial
and have antennae and sort of

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:56.680
scary jaw-like mandibles.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.289
Millipedes are vegetarians,
and they may have been some of

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:00.779
the very first animals to
live on land, where there

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:04.409
were mosses and primitive vascular
plants for them to munch.

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.870
Also, although millipedes have a
crap-ton of legs, they don't have

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.029
as many as a thousand,
as their name implies.

00:08:10.029 --> 00:08:13.930
They've actually got anywhere
between 94 and 394 legs,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.129
depending on the species.

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:18.259
Centipedes, whose name is a little
more apt as they generally have

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:22.249
between 20 and about 350 legs,
are carnivores and have

00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:24.509
poisoned claws to
paralyze their prey.

00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:26.849
So, if you're looking to
cuddle with a Myriapod,

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:29.889
I'm going to advise you
to go with a millipede.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:34.030
But please, save some love
for Hexapoda, or "six feet,"

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.900
most of which are insects.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.650
The synapomorphies they share
are three-part bodies,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.900
consisting of a head,
a thorax, and an abdomen,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.820
three pairs of jointed legs
that come off the thorax,

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.090
compound eyes,
and two antennae.

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.580
Now, think of any random
way you could put these

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.220
characteristics together,
and you'll probably come up

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.900
with something that exists.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.150
Because, you guys, there are so
many damn insects out there

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.400
you have no idea.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.900
There are more species
of insects than there are

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.220
all other animal species COMBINED.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.690
Which is why I'm taking
this opportunity to do a...

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:14.690
BIOLO-GRAPHY, The Insects Edition!

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.600
Very little is understood about
the evolution of insects,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.690
but scientists think that
they probably split off

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.470
from their crustacean cousins
about 410 million years ago.

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.320
And for tens of millions
of years, insects and some

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.390
little skittery invertebrates
were about the only land

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.540
dwelling animals.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.370
About 320 million years ago,
thanks to the high oxygen

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.350
levels of the Carboniferous
period, some insects grew to be

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.240
terrifyingly big, like the
Meganeura, which looked like a

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.550
dragonfly with a two-foot wingspan.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.360
But since an insects'
size is restrained by

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.310
their respiratory systems,
as oxygen levels went down,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.580
these massive insects couldn't
circulate enough oxygen

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.780
to keep their gigantic bodies
going, and they died off.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.240
The next major milestone
of insect history occurred

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.150
around 120 million years
ago, which is when

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.750
most flowering plants
evolved, and with it the

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.140
sweet spirit of cooperation
that insects and flowering plants

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.840
still share to this day.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.440
In fact, some insects
and flowering plants have

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.280
co-evolved really neat
pollination strategies

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.690
so that they basically
evolved together,

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.360
which I think is really sweet.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.560
And as a result of
insect pollination,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.150
flowering plants are now the
overlords of the plant world.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.080
And thus, everything smells
nicer and looks prettier.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.190
Thanks insects!

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.070
Insects are the only
arthropods that have developed

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.950
the ability to fly, and
it has served them well.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.880
Insect's wings are just extensions
of the cuticle of the thorax,

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.100
so unlike birds and bats which
have to sacrifice walking legs

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.150
in order to evolve wings,
insects are just as graceful

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.150
on the ground as
they are in the air.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:45.630
But in order to be so awesome,
insects had to develop

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.270
this crazy thing
called metamorphosis.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.310
In partial metamorphosis,
the young, called nymphs,

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.080
look exactly like the
adult of the species,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.490
and undergo a series of molts
which allows them to get bigger

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.420
and bigger, but they look
basically the same the whole time.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.040
Most other types of arthropods
do this, and some insects,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.690
including grasshoppers
and cockroaches.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.040
However, complete metamorphosis
is the process unique to some

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.220
insects that lets them
completely change shape.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.350
Maggots turn into flies,
mealworms turn into beetles,

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.240
caterpillars turn into butterflies.
The baby insect, called larva-

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.860
I have one right here,
this is a rhinoceros beetle larva-

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.290
pretty gross!

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.990
hangs out and eats
until it's time to

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.660
build a little case around
itself called a pupa,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.990
this is the rhinoceros beetle pupa,
which is exceptionally creepy

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.540
[creepy laugh]

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.980
and the when it comes out of
the pupa, it's fully grown.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.360
Rhinoceros beetle! It's like, soft
at first and then it's chitin

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.140
hardens up and it
becomes the adult.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:45.970
So insects are basically wizards,
but not as delicious as Crustacea,

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.760
the insects of the sea!

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.630
Crustaceans include crabs,
lobsters, shrimp, and barnacles,

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.140
and like insects, they have
three body segments:

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.780
head, thorax and abdomen.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.130
Although some, have a
cephalothorax like spiders do.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.700
While most other arthropods
have learned to love the land,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.310
very few crustaceans have.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.340
They have decided to put
their energy into developing

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.350
other amazing characteristics.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.110
For instance, lobsters and crayfish
are like walking multitools:

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.630
they have 19 pairs of appendages,
some of which are claws,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.670
some are mouthparts, some are
regular old walking legs.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.780
Some shrimp have
evolved bioluminescence,

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.220
which is pretty much the
most amazing thing any animal

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.660
can do as far
as I can tell.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.360
And this Yeti crab...
looks like a Yeti.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.590
And we've covered most of the types
of animals on earth in, what?

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:30.460
10 minutes?

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.730
Well hopefully now you can see the
resemblance between these guys.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.050
I love my caterpillar.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.870
Thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Biology,

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.020

there's a table of contents

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.070
that you can click on.

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.440
Thank you to everyone who
helped put this together

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.920

us out with this.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:53.660
And if you have any
questions or ideas,

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.630
and tell me what you think
we should name this one.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.190
That's all. Bye!
