1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,740
This is Radio Lab, I'm Jad Abumrad
[inaudible] today on the show,

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:05,210
14 meditations,

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:10,270
1211 1111 meditations on the moment
of death and what happens after now?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,660
Number eight nine nine a
title which simply escapes me.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,920
Boo-Yah Mozart from producer Lulu
Miller. Hi there. Can you hear me?

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,820
Okay, great. So I called up this
guy at the University of Leicester.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,880
Yeah, Deli ceviche. I'm a,

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm a ecologist who basically
works from Earth history,

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,440
but in his spare time he's
been studying what he called

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,550
future fossils.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,050
Like let's go ahead.
Hundred million years,

12
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,820
which is roughly at the time that
separates us from the dinosaurs.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,120
We will be dead. All the species
that are around us will be dead.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,310
So I asked him, well, any of
our stuff, the books we write,

15
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:50,250
the buildings we make, well,
any of that still be here.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,353
And here's what he found.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,710
[inaudible] concrete is probably
going to preserve pretty well.

18
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,130
Glass will preserve, but it
will probably turn opaque.

19
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,440
It's a brickwork corroded piping, some
types of plastic and a rubbish dumps.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,530
Oh, pretty good camps.
It would be preserved.

21
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,100
What about paper do we know is again,

22
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,880
we can treat that paper is plant
material. It will carbonize

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,980
because when we see fossil plants,

24
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,760
they can be preserved for tens or
even hundreds of millions of years.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,140
So the shape of paper will
be preserved almost forever.

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,140
Uh, but the print, the print on
paper will almost certainly be lost.

27
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,840
If you have a book preserved, it
will be a, like a little piece of,

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,100
of oblong coal.

29
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,750
So the ideas that we produce
that I cannot see surviving us,

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,440
you know, so Shakespeare and Gerta and
all, all the people we call the mortals,

31
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:54,810
you know, Mozart Music, um,

32
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,340
that information I think
will be lost forever.

33
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,013
[inaudible]

34
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,290
oh one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10 psi.

35
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,020
Bertrand city, Sydney. It's a,
it's a word of our own coinage,

36
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,500
cyber trinity and it comes to
us from producer Emily Voit.

37
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,620
This story is about dealing with death
in a world where no one really dies.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,660
At the center of the story
is the guy named Wyatt Amman.

39
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,590
I knew I, and uh, I
consider him my best friend.

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,100
That's Donald Dover. Why hadn't, I
both had office jobs at the same time.

41
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,280
And together we decided that this wasn't
enough because both of us were spending

42
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,270
so much time in front of the computers.

43
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,670
So the goal was going to
be to join the Peace Corps.

44
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,590
And we had talked about doing
the Peace Corps together,

45
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,230
but why it got things going.
First he quits his job,

46
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,800
he signs up for the Peace Corps and
within a few months was headed off to

47
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,420
Zambia.

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,190
He called me to see him often. Um,

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,450
we sat there and sat there and sat there
sort of avoiding the fact that he was

50
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,650
gonna actually have to leave.
Um, finally he's like, all right,

51
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,770
you need to go home. I need
to get on a plane. So, um,

52
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,500
he walked me to my car and, uh,

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,250
gave me a big hug and I said, yeah.

54
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,680
He said, uh, she's been a
great friend of mine, Donald.

55
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,230
I said, yeah, you too. Why
not? He said, don't worry,

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,830
I'll be back in two years.
Nobody's going to die.

57
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,920
But 10 weeks into the trip,

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,020
why it was hanging out with some friends
on the fourth floor of a hotel and he

59
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,460
leaned back against a window,

60
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,420
a almost floor to ceiling
and the play glass gave out.

61
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,280
He fell four stories and he bled to
death. His lungs filled with blood.

62
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,690
He never regained consciousness.

63
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,920
When the Peace Corps called it, I just
said, I don't believe it. Who is this?

64
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:55,210
What are you, what kind of sick thing are
you doing? This is m and why it's mom.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,980
He said, fatal injuries. I said, what
do you mean fatal? What does fatal mean?

66
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,460
[inaudible]

67
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,250
I couldn't, my mind would not
comprehend what that word meant.

68
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,050
[inaudible]

69
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,060
I, I felt so betrayed by God. Um,

70
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,350
I had prayed for why at and had felt that
God would keep him safe. And you know,

71
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,630
it isn't, it's, it's such a crock

72
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:27,770
[inaudible]

73
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,090
so two years go by

74
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,040
[inaudible]

75
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,550
and right at the time that why it would
have been returning from the peace

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,680
corps, something happened.

77
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,420
Jeanie, can you tell me
about getting the letter?

78
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,200
Yeah, I remember.

79
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:45,580
So clearly Greg and I were both home and
we went to the mailbox and walk to the

80
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:48,590
kitchen and um, we ripped open the,

81
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,960
the envelope and inside
was a letter from Wyatt.

82
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,040
We were really unsure what was going
on. It's hard to describe. It was,

83
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,150
um, it was really incredible.

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,440
So what happened is
this before why it died,

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,070
he had been playing around on the
Internet and he went to this site called

86
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:15,330
future May, a website where you can
send a letter to your future self. Why?

87
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,190
I wrote his right before
he joined the Peace Corps.

88
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,580
And the idea was that the site would
hold onto it and email it back to him in

89
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:25,110
two years. But of course why it
wasn't there to get the letter.

90
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,560
But Donald, his friend
found it and sent it.

91
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:32,850
And so Greg and I both stood there at
the counter and we read the letter. Okay.

92
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,780
So what did it, what does it say
dear future me, I'm leaving DC.

93
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,830
So far I've managed to do pretty much
everything other than what I needed to do.

94
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,890
You know, it's about the fact that
he's leaving for Zambia. First of all,

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
I have no idea what to expect.

96
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,170
He talks about his ex-girlfriend
sometimes love is like crack.

97
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,730
How he hates his office job.

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,900
I truly believe that I was meant to be
a semi transient being, you know, he's,

99
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,610
he's sort of being a little
melodramatic. I want the Sistine Chapel,

100
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,030
not a ranch style home in the suburbs.
That letter really captured who,

101
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:05,180
why it was my life is my canvas, you know,

102
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,230
with all his ramblings in
these grandiose things already.

103
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,840
Schizophrenia really colorful,
intricate and dizzyingly amorphous.

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,610
He knows that he's seeing too much in
that. He kind of has to humble himself.

105
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,460
How pretentious is that?
And that's what he was like.

106
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:21,440
He was always keeping a check on yourself.

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,560
One thing's for sure I'm
capable of rambling on and
on and on and on and on and

108
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,330
on and on. I have the same problem.

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,200
I just remember feeling,

110
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,590
yeah,

111
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,520
I felt like w y had had just sent us a
letter. Greg shook his head and he said,

112
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,710
that kid, you know, and um,

113
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,990
it was like a part of him was still alive.

114
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,360
[inaudible]

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,930
Emily [inaudible] let me just
interrupt for just a second. Okay.

116
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,810
Because it will be easy to hear.
The story is just like a fluke,

117
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,730
like a letter shows up from
a kid who died and liquid.

118
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,460
It means to the mom
and his friend. But no,

119
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,780
this might be where we're all headed
because he internet, you know,

120
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:07,614
it's always on.

121
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,260
And one of the things that's happening
is that there are sites that are popping

122
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:15,261
up that allow people to speak from
beyond the grave and to keep on speaking.

123
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:19,260
In fact, David Eagleman,
who we heard from earlier,

124
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:22,560
the guy who read those stories and
a neuroscientist, he started one.

125
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:26,190
So I started the company DEF
switch.com. This is a real thing.

126
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,310
There are hundreds of subscribers.
Yeah, no kidding. Oh yeah.

127
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,610
The way it works is you sign up for the
site and then you keep checking in with

128
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:35,220
the site to prove you're alive.
And if you disappear for too long,

129
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,440
the computer deduces you are dead.

130
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,340
Then it sends out all those emails
that you told it to your company,

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,800
telling them what the
passwords are to your family,

132
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,570
telling them where the gold is buried,

133
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,580
or even just to remind
them that you loved them.

134
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,300
And he says that these switches, these
desk switches are going off all the time.

135
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,380
But lots of people tested the deaths,
which is to make sure that it works.

136
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,230
So they might not be real yet,
but they will be pretty soon.

137
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:00,000
So it's easy for him to imagine.

138
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,520
I'll let her like this happy
87th birthday. It's been
22 years since my death.

139
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,730
I hope your life is proceeding
delightfully, which may sound funny,

140
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:11,010
but imagine that that's
you in the kitchen,

141
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,610
getting a letter from your mom or
from someone that you lost too early.

142
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,183
How would you feel?

143
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,930
Um, it was like a part
of him was still alive.

144
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,690
So after genie gets the
letter, what happens? Well,

145
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,070
Jeannie's starts writing
Wyatt as if he hadn't died.

146
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,720
What do you mean writing and where? Well,

147
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,770
Y had been a huge blogger and Jeanie
discovered that a lot of his blogs were

148
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:42,280
still active. One of them was even
updating his age. It shows his age,

149
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,280
his what he'd be now you know, it
doesn't know that he's not here anymore,

150
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,500
so she goes on and leaves him comments.

151
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:51,730
My latest one was on November 5th of this
year. Do you want me to read that one?

152
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,970
That'd be great. Why?

153
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,780
It feels like you are still here living
in Zambia and it is 2005 I feel frantic

154
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,680
to do something to stop the 17th from
happening in your mind when you comment on

155
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,260
a blog, oh Wyatt, another
holiday without you.

156
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,530
Where do you picture that
it's going well, I think,

157
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:11,380
I wish you could just let me know what
is like and how you feel now. Maybe.

158
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,360
I think I just figure it's like on a
screen and somehow he's getting it.

159
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,933
Why it's dead

160
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,123
for Donald.

161
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,450
Getting the letter was just a reminder
of that [inaudible] had died and Zambia

162
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,730
and in fact the idea that
technology could keep them around.

163
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,700
I guess I'm sort of, that
just didn't work for Donald.

164
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:34,410
I sort of feel that the way I imagine
why it felt in his letter he talks about,

165
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,210
um, not being static.

166
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,960
I want to learn and grow and see how
other wants to continue moving and seeking

167
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:43,770
and building and growing. And I will
not rest. It can be kind of frustrating.

168
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,510
Like he's, he's stuck in
a 24 year old. Why it, um,

169
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,640
before I died we had, um,
we decided we were Luddites,

170
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,980
we were anti-technology. And um,

171
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,350
the hilarious part is that then wild
then googled luddite to find out things

172
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,000
about Luddites. Um,

173
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,720
but initially the plan was to
leave to meet Wyatt and Africa.

174
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,210
And when Wyatt died, I knew that
I still needed to make that break.

175
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,283
So we did

176
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,010
[inaudible].

177
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,420
I left my office job to go live on a
small island in the middle of Chesapeake

178
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,090
Bay to 200 and [inaudible]

179
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,120
40 Acre island.

180
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,860
Here's Peter Ward.

181
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,030
I'm a paleontologist and professor of
biology and earth and space sciences at

182
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:20,030
the University of Washington.
In 7 billion years,

183
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,190
our son will

184
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,670
okay

185
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,870
suddenly go red giant

186
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:28,690
[inaudible]

187
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,160
and the earth is just burned to a crisp.

188
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,970
Is that happened like one morning or does
that happen over several hundred years

189
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,260
or, yeah, that's good. After
you take a few thousand years,

190
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,020
but the oceans will have
been actually long gone.

191
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,730
The oceans are going away in 2 billion
years. Oh dear. Because the sun,

192
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:49,760
that nasty old sun just keeps getting
brighter and brighter and brighter,

193
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,150
and about 50 to 60 centigrade, we
rapidly lose in the ocean, in the space.

194
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,730
This is the opposite of Noah's flood.

195
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:02,210
Instead of the gas descending
into the giant oceans,

196
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:05,390
now the oceans pick up and go
back into the sky. Exactly.

197
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,520
And then things get worse from there
because 5 billion years after the oceans

198
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:15,390
are gone, the sun starts
to expand and it happens in

199
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,513
pulse.

200
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,650
There are actually four to five
pulses that are gonna take place.

201
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,780
The first four pulses will not eat up
the earth, but it will certainly sterile.

202
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:26,850
Yeah.

203
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,683
Why is it

204
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,680
the whole surface will
melt. It'll be glowing.

205
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,280
The last one, the sun
just keeps expanding.

206
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,880
Our Sun will expand be
almost to the orbit of Mars,

207
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,960
and so the earth is totally gone.
I mean you've just got snuffed out.

208
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,260
But the nice thing is that your
Ropa will become the new Maui.

209
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,773
Ooh,

210
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,740
yeah. Jovian satellites. If
you buy real estate there now,

211
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,630
and I hear as jerk sheet, that
will be the tropics, Jovian Moon,

212
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:03,840
Jovian Moon. How many of
your candidates for Maui's?

213
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:08,400
There's Europa and Ganymede
and io, not so much,

214
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,050
but he's in Europa. When the ice
melts on Europe as is just an,

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,600
isn't it an all watery is just gonna be
a nice warm ocean would just be a ball

216
00:13:15,601 --> 00:13:19,110
of water ball of water. A hundred
mile deep water too at that.

217
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,860
That's regular liquid water. H Two
o yes. Oh, it's beautiful stuff.

218
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,800
Taken the view. Think of the views
of Jupiter under he so spectacular.

219
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,860
The downside with these Jovian moons
is that you couldn't breathe there

220
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,180
when you left that out.
Minor detail burry,

221
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,770
that foggy that you can
certainly go water skiing.

222
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,010
It's just have a little respirator on.
Oh, that was a small little asterisk.

223
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,780
Come on now. Just compare it to the
end of the world. That's minor detail.

224
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,960
I see. All right. So now
let's go further out.

225
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:02,050
At what point does any possibility
of solar system existence and oh,

226
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:07,550
that one's tougher. That one's very
tough because after the red giant,

227
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,330
we become a m mclass or a dwarf,

228
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:16,470
which means the Sun after being this big
now expanding Redstar Ridge giant sinks

229
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:21,730
back into itself and becomes much, much,
much smaller and much, much cooler.

230
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,950
So Europa, our little little
paradise now freezes. Exactly.

231
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,980
And then the only thing left is things
like voyager, things that you, um,

232
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,580
you sent. Oh off. There's
still going off somewhere.

233
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,870
Bits of us. They're going
and going and going and gone.

234
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,920
And the chance that they'll ever
intersect, the star is very small.

235
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,560
The end, the end.

236
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,510
Now, the final end of course,

237
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:58,511
is way off into the future because
the universe keeps expanding.

238
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:02,720
That means eventually Adams'
themselves get pulled apart.

239
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,260
[inaudible]

240
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,670
little protons and neutrons.

241
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:10,020
They get ripped away from one
another and we're somewhere else.

242
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:11,970
Something else somehow else.

243
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,410
And then everything that is isn't

244
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,870
[inaudible]. Goodbye. Well, goodbye.

245
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,570
Goodbye. Proton. Goodbye. Neutral.

246
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,770
Good bye everyone.
