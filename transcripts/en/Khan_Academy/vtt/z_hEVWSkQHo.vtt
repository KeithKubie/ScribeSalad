00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.810
I have some data here.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.570
It says a golf ball is
hit down a fairway.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.120
The following table shows the
height of the ball with

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.610
respect to time.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.200
The ball is hit at an angle of
70 degrees with the horizontal

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.620
with a speed of 40 meters
per second.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.680
And then they give us a bunch
of, essentially data samples.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.590
At time 0, we're at 0 meters.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.300
At time 0.5 seconds, we're
at 17.2 meters.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.440
So they give us a bunch
of data points.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.390
And what I want to do is use
these data, or use these data

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.250
points, to essentially find a
quadratic function that fits

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.270
it best. Or I guess to view it
the other way, I want to model

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.630
this data or I want to model
this phenomenon, I want to

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.810
model the golf ball being hit
down the fairway, or the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.190
height of the golf ball using
a quadratic equation, or

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.175
quadratic function.

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:49.040
And we're going to do it using
a graphing calculator.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.830
And actually, you know, if you
do a little bit of physics,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.250
you can figure out what
the actual equation

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.330
would be in a vacuum.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.370
But this is actual data taken
from a golf ball hit in air.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.310
And that changes things a bunch,
it makes the physics

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.320
really complicated.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.900
So we'll actually look at the
measurements and then try to

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.695
figure out what the actual
function is.

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.320
And actually, the calculator
is going to do most of the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.160
work for us.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.490
I won't go into the details
of what the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.090
calculators algorithm is.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.810
I just want to show
you how to do it.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.210
It's safe to say that this is
going to be well approximated

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.910
by some type of quadratic
function or a parabola.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.970
So let's try to fit
a function to it.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.540
So what we want to do is we
want to hit stat on our

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.900
calculator.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.850
You hit stat, then
you hit edit.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.010
That's what we use to input
our information.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.350
We can click enter twice.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.600
This just says these are the two
variable names for where

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.680
we input our data.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.400
I'm just hitting enter twice.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.450
And now I can start
entering the data.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.140
And I'll use my keyboard
to do this.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.560
So the first data point is 0.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.960
Enter.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.350
The x is 0, y is 0.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.320
Press enter again.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.540
The next data point,
0.5 and 17.2.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.330
I'm just looking at this right
here, 0.5 and 17.2.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.900
Next data point.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.110
We have x is 1.5.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.000
When x is 1.5, y is 42.9.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.640
When x is 2, y is 51.6.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.940
When x is 2.5, y is 57.7.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.720
When x is 3, y is 61.2.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.250
I just keep pressing
enter every time.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.660
When x is 3.5, y is 62.3
meters in the air.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.630
When x is 4, y is 61
meters in the air.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.060
And when x is 4.5, y is 57.2.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.250
So I've entered all
of the data.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.790
And then the next thing I
want to do, I'm going

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.660
to plot all of it.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.440
But before I plot all of this
data, I want to make sure that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.970
I have the proper range
on my display.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.730
So I'm going to go to
graph, hit range.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.700
And see.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.780
My x minimum, I want
it to be 0.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.610
That's the lowest value here.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.090
And my x maximum, I could
set it actually,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.950
a little bit lower.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.710
Well, I set my x maximum,
that's fine.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.190
I'll go up to 7 seconds.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.460
I'll make the scale, that's
the measurements on the

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.500
x-axis, as 1.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.380
y minimum is 0.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.350
y maximum, 70 looks
pretty good.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.280
It seems like it'll cover all of
these numbers, and some of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.550
these get pretty close.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.370
They're in the 60's, so
70's pretty good.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.220
And I'll make the y scale 5.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.870
I don't have to make any changes
here, but you could

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.390
make changes if your calculator

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.510
isn't set to this already.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.000
And so we can go back to stat.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.480
And then what we want to do is
have the calculator calculate

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.420
a quadratic function that
matches these points as well

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.620
as possible.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.530
So we'll go to calc.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.890
I'm assuming that means
for calculate.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.940
This is saying, where
is the data?

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.400
It's the same variables we used
to input the data, so

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.940
I'll just click enter.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.400
And enter twice.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.970
And now here are the
different types of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.330
regressions we can do.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.530
We can do a linear regression.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.710
We can do an exponential
regression, power regression.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.650
You click more and you'll see
a power 2 regression.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.370
This means a second
degree regression.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.870
So here, we can literally
click-- we

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.260
just select this option.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.670
That means a quadratic or this
would be a third degree

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.010
regression, a fourth
degree regression.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.400
So we're just going to do
a quadratic regression.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.279
And it figured out the
coefficients of the quadratic

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.670
that best matches this data.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.600
So I'm going to write it down.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.080
So it's negative 5.2.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.490
It's negative 5.2.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.190
Scroll over a bit.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.890
35.99999.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.560
And then 0.292514.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.950
So let me write these
down over here.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.980
So let me take it off
the screen so I can

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.900
keep looking at it.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.750
And so we have-- it's telling
us, the calculator has told

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:52.700
us, that if the quadratic is
equal to ax squared plus bx

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.010
plus c, it's telling us that the
first coefficient, a, is

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.270
negative 5.20128.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.990
I'll probably round that
off a little bit.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.980
It's telling us b is equal to
35.9-- let me scroll over my

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.532
calculator a bit-- 993.

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.590
I'll probably round these.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.060
9934.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.070
And it's telling my c values
that it calculates for the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.170
best fit quadratic is 0.2925.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.540
Which is interesting.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.670
Before I did this problem, I
actually figured out what this

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.030
quadratic would be
in a vacuum.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.510
I just used kind of some of
the physics principles.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.760
And then you have this
number in a vacuum.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.920
If you didn't have air
resistance, this number would

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.300
be negative 4.9.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.410
This number I think turned out
to be something like 37.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.120
And this number turned out to--
well, this was 0, because

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.720
you start at the ground.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.560
But this is interesting.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.410
This is actual data and actual
data is always going to be a

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.030
little bit different, or
sometimes a lot different than

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.990
the theoretical ideal, if you
had no air resistance.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.010
So that's what we're
getting right here.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.860
And so we can now use this.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.570
This is telling me, my graphing
calculator's telling

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.970
me, that the quadratic I should
use-- you know, y is a

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.980
function of x-- is negative
5.2x squared

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:25.260
plus 35.99x plus 0.29.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.700
I rounded them off
a little bit.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.840
So now we can use this
information, or maybe I

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.670
should say of t.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.570
I could have made this-- well,
x is equal to time.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.076
I could have made it
t instead, but I

00:06:34.076 --> 00:06:35.140
think you get the idea.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:38.150
And now we can use this
information to figure out what

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.900
the ball was probably doing
at other points in time.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.330
So, for example, if we wanted
to know what was

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.870
happening at time 5.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.280
What's y of, let's say
5.2 seconds into it?

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.140
So what happens a little
bit further off?

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.400
We're extrapolating, we're going
beyond what the data

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.370
that we have right here.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.470
So y of 5.2.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.320
We can do it two ways.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.110
We can look at it graphically.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.270
So now that we've calculated
this regression, here are the

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.530
coefficients again.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.450
As you see here, I'm just
scrolling to the left.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.300
It gave me the coefficients.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:17.100
Negative 5.2, 35.99, and then
it gave me the 0.2925.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.580
So now that it calculated, we
could actually plot all the

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.970
points and draw the
regression.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.330
I want to pick this draw
option up here.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.090
So I can either exit and
then I pick draw.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.570
And first I'll just
draw the data.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.430
So that's scattered.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.610
It'll make a scattered plot
of all of the data.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.520
I select it there.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.730
And notice, it drew the data
points as they were given.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.750
That's the data points
right there.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.340
5.2 is going to be out
here some place.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.790
And now I can draw the
actual regression.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.270
This is draw the regression
using these

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.850
coefficients right here.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.070
So draw regression.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.880
And you see it actually
fits the data very,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.960
very, very, very well.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.330
So let's use this function that
seems to fit the data

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.170
very, very, very well to
actually come up with how high

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.050
was the ball at 5.2 seconds?

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.600
So let's exit from here.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.670
And let's just calculate it.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:23.490
It is negative 5.2 times
5.2 squared.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.450
Just by coincidence, I picked a
time that equals that first

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.610
coefficient.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.670
Therefore, it's the positive
version of it.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:36.650
So 5.2 squared plus 35.99 times
5.2-- remember, we're

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.900
dealing with when time is equal
to 5.2, or where x is

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.659
equal to 5.2-- plus 0.29.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.510
So we're just going to evaluate
this function at time

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.600
or at x is equal to 5.2.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.870
And we get 46.83 feet.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:01.580
So it's equal to 46.83, or
I should say 0.83 meters.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.370
So I hope you enjoyed that.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.620
I just wanted to show you a
quick thing of how a graphing

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.580
calculator is useful.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.160
Maybe in the future, I'll make
a more advanced video on the

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.580
actual algorithm or the actual
process that the calculator

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.160
used to figure out
this best curve.
