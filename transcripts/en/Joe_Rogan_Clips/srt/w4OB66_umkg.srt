1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,461
Jamie,

2
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:04,090
was it you that was telling me yesterday
about the guy who was the EMT who sees,

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,200
tell me,
tell me what you told me.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,670
He's Ah, he said he was listening
to the podcast we did with Louis J.

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,180
Gomez about people getting head
injuries. Uh, and he has been doing,

6
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,890
I believe for like 15 years or so.

7
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,680
Like doesn't do it every single day
because you don't work every single day,

8
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:19,680
but on a three day basis or so,
every day he works,

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,680
he sees at least one person
dead from a head injury,

10
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:26,370
whether it's an elderly person
that slipped on ice or something,

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,990
people fall and hit their heads. Oh
yeah. Like that's why please folks,

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,630
if you're listening to me and you want
to punch somebody in, knocked him out,

13
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:36,710
please don't do it. Just go to a
gym, get your frustrations out.

14
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:37,670
Don't fight on the street.

15
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:42,080
You could kill somebody or you can
get killed at even accidentally,

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,890
even if you really don't hate the guy
that much, you punched him in the face.

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,590
They go unconscious, their head hits the
ground. People die all the time. I mean,

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,820
I've told the story about when Kevin
James used to work as a bouncer in Long

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,530
Island, a guy that he was
working with punched the guy
and killed him, right? Yeah.

20
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:58,820
Kevin.
Kevin wasn't there,

21
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:03,050
but he knew the guy and the guy
accidentally killed a drunk guy drunk.

22
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:06,290
I was coming at him. He punched him. I
guess I'm, I don't know the whole story,

23
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,210
but that shit happens all the time. I've
seen guys, it's not about punch though.

24
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,990
It's about when they hit their head
after the fuck getting hit by the world.

25
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,230
Think about that. Think of the
world. Just drop on your head.

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,730
That's what it's like.
Your body mass bouncing off a completely,

27
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,050
especially concrete. There's no
gift. So your head just clock.

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,760
It sounds horrible.

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,180
Why listen to someone's head bounce
off concrete is one of the scariest.

30
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:34,340
Fucking sounds horrible.

31
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,190
Even if you do it to somebody
and you want it to hurt them,

32
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,450
when you hear their head bounce off
concrete, you like, oh shit. Like,

33
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:46,310
that's not as simple as like you punched
them, you punched him and then you know,

34
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,840
whatever, they weigh 190 pounds
with all of the mass of grass,

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,020
the other mass and gravity pulling them
towards the ground with nothing slowing

36
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:54,740
it down.

37
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,210
But meat and head bang bone I shoulder.

38
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,680
That reminds me when I was 10 years old,

39
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,100
I was sitting on the curb and this is
the first time I saw death in real life

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,120
from a head injury.

41
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,540
I was sitting with my friend on the curb
and a guy was driving a motorcycle and

42
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:13,140
he was speeding up and down the street
and right on iris would and Houston,

43
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:17,340
Texas, he's flying down a
car, pulls out and he hits it.

44
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,780
Back then they didn't wear helmets,

45
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,430
so he literally flew up in the air
and landed about 20 feet from us.

46
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,390
His head hit first and
exploded like a watermelon.

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,710
And this is like, I was 10 years old
watching this. So the next morning,

48
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:35,460
you know the police come, my parents get
me to tell me, don't look at it too. I,

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,790
I'm, I go out there the next day,
it's just bless stains everywhere.

50
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,480
And his wife is picking up his
hair that's stuck to the concrete.

51
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,190
And I remember it so vividly.

52
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,600
I was next door neighbor was Eric and we
were sitting on the curb watching this

53
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,920
lady pick up her husband's
hair that will stop in.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,990
And that's the first time I ever saw
death. And it, it, it was, oh fuck.

55
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,300
And it was a gnarly death too.
It was like that facing death stuff.

56
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,950
Like it was bad. It was bad. They never
wrote her motorcycle because of that.

57
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,293
Yeah. There's, yeah,

58
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,050
there's not a lot of reasons to ride a
motorcycle other than it's awesome. Yeah.

59
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,650
Just fuck the fucking danger.

60
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,480
I took a motorcycle safety classes
and then two of my friends, uh,

61
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:23,550
wiped out. One of them got hit by
a car and one of them fell, uh,

62
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,810
going around a corner and fucked
his shoulder up. I, uh, I,

63
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,700
after that accident, probably
about six years later, you know,

64
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,760
when three wheelers were big back then,
and my friend,

65
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:37,600
same friend that was on the curb,
we were f three willing and,

66
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:39,910
and where I grew up there
as bunch of ditches.

67
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,470
So where it going and he thought he could
go down in the ditch and come up the

68
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,430
other side, but I think he forgot that
his flat on the bottom of real ditches.

69
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,700
So literally we're going
and we hit the bottom.

70
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,420
And I flew up in literally half
my face was like, just wreck.

71
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:57,140
I was in the hospital and,

72
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:02,440
and we didn't have helmets at that time
cause we're young and dumb and just

73
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,570
wanted to like stupid stupid.
