A monkey just mind controlled another monkey,
so basically we now live in a nightmare future

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:08.935
where no monkey's actions can ever fully be
trusted.

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:18.034
Anthony Carboni here for DNews and a team
at Harvard Medical School implanted a chip

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:23.124
into the brain of a monkey that monitored
the activity of 100 neurons in its brain.

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:27.605
A second, sedated monkey had 36 electrodes
implanted in its spinal cord- and the two

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:32.505
were hooked up via computer, allowing the
first monkey to control the movements of the

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:32.895
second.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.345
The sedated monkey held a joystick, and the
master monkey was able to make it move that

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:42.884
joystick towards goals on a screen with 98%
efficiency. The goal, of course, being an

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.584
army of mind-controlled monkey assassins.

00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:48.264
Okay, no- the goal is to help people suffering
from limited or full paralysis due to spinal

00:00:48.264 --> 00:00:53.285
damage to regain full range of motion. Do
more testing and refinement, make more advanced

00:00:53.285 --> 00:01:00.195
and smaller versions of the chip and electrodes,
and put them into a human. That. Is. Amazing.

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:04.345
Also sorta creepy at first thought. Someone
with... a less than optimistic view of human

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:08.515
nature might think this could be used as a
form of mind control. The team says that because

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:12.455
this just controls basic movement, not thoughts
or intentions, and because an able-bodied

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:16.585
person would still have their own brain-spine
connections and control their own muscles,

00:01:16.585 --> 00:01:20.425
no one's going to be hijacking anyone else's
body anytime soon.

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:22.905
Or maybe that's what the monkeys told them
to say.

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:27.035
This sort of augmented brain/body control
has seen a lot of advancements in a really

00:01:27.035 --> 00:01:31.205
short amount of time. In 2008, University
of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon researchers

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:35.655
were able to use a cruder implementation of
this technology to have a monkey control a

00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:41.205
robot arm, and in 2012, Brown University showed
paralyzed people using a more advanced version

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:43.895
the the same brain/robot arm combo.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:48.194
The chip in the brain is connected to a person-
or primate's- motor neurons, which send directions

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:52.404
to the limbs and body. Researchers check what
directions the motor neurons send and how

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:56.615
a functioning body responds- and try to make
the chip and electrodes match up to the same

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:57.535
call and response.

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:02.404
This is the first time it's worked in a living
thing- and even though the team is optimistic,

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:07.365
they say a full brain/body control system
with precise, natural movement is really far

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:07.654
off.

00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:10.645
Hey, Anthony, why'd they use two monkeys and
sedate one?

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:13.945
Good question, Catie Wayne from Animalist
news. They used two monkeys because they didn't

00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:16.575
want to paralyze one for life just to run
the test.

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.985
Seems legit. But I wonder how humane testing
like this is overall.

00:02:19.985 --> 00:02:23.755
You... you already have a video about that
at Animalist News, don't you?

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:24.065
YYYYYUP

00:02:24.065 --> 00:02:27.475
Well, then, I guess this is where I tell eveyrone
to check it out over on youtube.com/animalists.

00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:29.745
YYYYYYYYYYYYUP

00:02:29.745 --> 00:02:33.515
Will you make some Avatar references, since
I didn't?

00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:34.835
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYUP

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:38.515
