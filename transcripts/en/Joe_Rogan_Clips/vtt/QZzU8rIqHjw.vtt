1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.610
The Joe Rogan experience.
I'm too busy for bigfoot ideas.
Yeah,
that's roughly,

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.470
and that might've been a real thing.
Yeah.
It was a real animal creature.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.980
Yeah.
There was a real creature called Jack handle [inaudible].

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.440
It was a real animal,
just like eight foot tall by Peto.
Hammad absolutely exist.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.800
Probably.
Yeah,
like a giant,

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
not giant eight due to some sort of guerrilla didn't exist.

7
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:26.070
Imagine seeing a gorilla,
right?
Like Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is that thing?

8
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:28.110
Six foot 600 pounds,
king,

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.230
huge hairy black beast with a giant chest and enormous arms and pounds on his

10
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.490
chest runs on all fours and you're like fucking fangs.

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.700
When they fly through the air at each other and clash.
It's crazy.

12
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:45.510
Smash into each other and fight.
Holy Fuck Man.
If you didn't know that was real,

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.620
I know.
And you ran into a gorilla,
you'd be like,
what the fuck?
And she,

14
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:50.041
by the way,

15
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.090
they didn't know mountain gorillas were even a thing until the early 19 hundreds

16
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:58.470
their religion.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
When was the discovery of mountain gorillas?

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.580
Don't think they have those giant chimps in the Congo or are hybrid.
No,

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.740
they don't anymore because they have DNA.

19
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.060
They're the only chimpanzee species or subspecies.

20
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.480
Cause she'd say that they found that heads a crest on its skull like a gorilla.

21
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
1902 bro.
Damn.
Yeah.

22
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.160
A German explore at Captain Robert Vaughn better Inge,

23
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.670
the mountain gorilla was named the Great Barrington g in honor of the captain.

24
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.960
Yeah man.
Fuck.
Looking at,
imagine that thing.
How about those?

25
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.490
That guy who was an anti poaching agent,
he helps,
uh,

26
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.680
protect gorillas from poachers and he got them to pose standing up in a selfie.

27
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.450
And even better,
there's video of him tickling the gorillas and the gorillas.

28
00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:49.110
Laughing,
laughing like a person too.
That's crazy.

29
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.420
So was there a,
a big foot?
Fuck yeah,
there was a big flood.
Yeah,

30
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.910
it was a real thing.
That's why there's so many stories about it.

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.290
And it probably died off 100,000 years ago or something,
you know,

32
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.160
every meat or that just,
they're just vegetarian.
No,
gorillas are,

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.910
we are closer to chimpanzees than chimpanzees or gorillas.

34
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.900
Is that true?
Yeah.
Wow.
Well,
the,

35
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.730
I think it's interesting in Goma where those groups of mail chimps expand their

36
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:18.564
territory,

37
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.900
they kill other males to move their women and children into the area that they

38
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.860
annex.
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?
Vicious?
They just as groups fall down,

39
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.720
fall on the smaller,
you know,
tribes of,
of chimps and decimate them.

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.210
They have so many,
so many similarities to humans.
So many,
yeah.
But these,
um,

41
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.050
Bondo apes,
they call them.
This is the,
um,
the giant chimp.
There's these neat,

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.800
they nest on the ground to like gorillas.
Are they as violinists?

43
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.610
They live in large communities like chimps,
the little boy,

44
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.190
the locals have two names for chimps over there.

45
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.170
They have one that they're called tree beaters.

46
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.320
Those are the regular size chimps.
And the other ones they call lion killers.

47
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.970
There's so big,
they've,
they've,

48
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.420
they've got videos of these things eating a leopard.
What?
Yeah.

49
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.970
They don't know if it,
yeah,
there are enormous champs.

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.200
So they don't know if it killed the leopard or if the Lebert died and then

51
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.000
they're eating it.
They don't know what they do.

52
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.920
No one was eating a fucking leopard.

53
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.300
So you gotta think Yummy Kitty cat when they're standing up.

54
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.760
They're taller than me.
I'm five eight there are six feet tall.

55
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:24.730
You're six feet tall.
Yeah.
So the your height.
Yeah,
your height,

56
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.970
but a chimp and a Jack Champ.
God,

57
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.450
it's probably 250 300 pounds.
Well,
they say they're 400 pounds.

58
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.290
The ones in that they have some in,
I don't believe Kansas City Zoo.
No,

59
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.310
I don't believe they do.
I think they do know they have two giant chimps.

60
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.520
If you look at it as big chimps,
those are just big chimps.
They're huge.

61
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.120
They're like they do.
They've had chimps that are over 200 pounds.
The ved,

62
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.770
some enormous champs,
but they've never had one of these,
did this.

63
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.060
They live in a very specific area of the Congo,
but they've seen them.
Yes,

64
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.890
they have video of them.
They have photographs of them.

65
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.070
You can see videos and UC camera trap photos.
There are real animal.

66
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.760
It's a really big animal man.
It's a really big chimp.
It's amazing.

67
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.680
Imagine to see at a six foot chimp.
No Dude.
No,
I'm,
they'd know.

68
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.190
They eat your face in your genitals.
No thanks.
Imagine standing there,

69
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.170
you turn a corner and there's a chimp as tall as you looking at you disaster.

70
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.290
Yeah.
I have to go low.
If you ever see,
yeah,
you're not going low.

71
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.460
It doesn't matter which one was that.
Do what they had up.

72
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.750
There was a traveling circus when they had a a chimp and they would muscle it

73
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.460
and they'd have any man,

74
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.550
the biggest man that just to hold the chimp down for six seconds.

75
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.490
If you could do that or three seconds and no man has ever able to do it.

76
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.820
They just worse,
there's just,
this is hotter than 50 pound chimp.
Yeah,

77
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.900
and you wouldn't even,
even if it was muzzled man,
it gets to rip your arms off.

78
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:41.450
Like what are you doing?
Yeah,
you're made out of Jello.
I've you ever held a,

79
00:04:41.451 --> 00:04:45.680
I've held a small one.
A baby one I held,
it was playing with my puppy and it was,

80
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.170
I was his back felt like would,
would,
yeah,
like what,
like perfectly describe.

81
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.100
That's exactly like Dan Henderson probably feels exactly like that.
Hadn't been,

82
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:58.330
he's,
he's gotta be part chimp.
Yeah.
But I had a two one two year old,

83
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:02.740
one once a on a fear enough your factor news radio.
And when we're on the set,

84
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.440
the scene actually got cut out.
We never wound up using the scene,

85
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.870
but there was a guy who was like an animal trainer and he had a couple of

86
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:10.600
different animals with them and one was a baby chimp in diapers.

87
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.590
And this baby chimp got on my back and beat beat on my back a couple of times

88
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:18.490
and I was like,
what the fuck?
It was like you hitting me.
I was like,

89
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.600
wow,
this fucking little tiny thing just wailed on me.

90
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.970
She said they're so strong through it.
Yeah.
They're a little,

91
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.830
bodies are just hard,

92
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.970
like corded no neck take crazy punishment.
Yeah.
