00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.640
So, our setup link.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; There we go.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.710
&gt;&gt; And I've become a huge fan of this little search box.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; Oh man, life before that search box was really rough.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.810
&gt;&gt; Who wants to navigate all this nonsense arrows and business?

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.040
Alright, so chatter. Chatter mobile, new. Is that what we're doing?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.598
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:17.598 --> 00:00:18.028
[LAUGH]

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:21.670
Under build &gt; Chatter, and then Feed Tracking.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.060
&gt;&gt; Okay, so just to give you a brief synopsis

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.300
of what we're looking at, this is showing you all of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.410
the different objects that you have within your org. Both

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.700
the standard objects that are included, and the stuff we've created.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.060
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.300
&gt;&gt; Now what we want to do, is we want to enable our stage

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.140
object for feed tracking, so that people can collaborate on a stage record.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.540
&gt;&gt; And so what this means, Enable for Feed Tracking,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.370
means it's going to put a Chatter feed at

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.100
the top of our stage record, for people

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.350
to either follow the record if they want

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.930
to or just, you know, make post-songs record.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.420
&gt;&gt; So, we want to look for the stage object over here.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.910
&gt;&gt; Stage, over here?

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.050
&gt;&gt; Yep. And so if we enable this for feed tracking.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.783
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:06.960
&gt;&gt; We can also select whatever fields we want to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.730
show up in the feed if they were to change.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.950
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.660
&gt;&gt; Like for example, if we were to choose the stage manager field.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.310
If we checked the stage manager field, whenever the stage manager gets changed.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.310
&gt;&gt;

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.595
[CROSSTALK]

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:17.721
Mm-hm.

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:20.010
&gt;&gt; Or reassigned. That's going to automatically post to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.525
the chatter feed, hey, the stage manager's changed from.

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:22.915
[CROSSTALK]

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:23.040
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.780
&gt;&gt; Blah to blah.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.290
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, I don't know let's follow the stage manager.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.730
And if the size of the stage changes, he'd want to know.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.400
&gt;&gt; I don't really think anything else would change enough to need it.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.070
&gt;&gt; That looks good to me and then just click

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.660
Save. So you can configure this for any of the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.650
objects in your organization if you say, just want to

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.740
get updated or collaborate on any of your custom schema.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.963
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:47.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.830
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.020
so we've enabled Chatter. What can I do now? Go back to stage?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go back to the Stage Record.
