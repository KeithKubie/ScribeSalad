00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:03.046
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we have the fraction 9/10,

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:08.046
and I want to add to
that the fraction 1/6.

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:13.039
What is this, what is this going to equal?

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:14.827
So when you first look at this, you say,

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.602
"Oh, I have different denominators here.

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:18.599
It's not obvious how I add these."

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.038
And you'd be right and the way to actually

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:23.546
move forward is to find
a common denominator,

00:00:23.546 --> 00:00:26.181
to convert both of these fractions into

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.536
fractions that have a common denominator.

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.498
So how do you think about
a common denominator?

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:32.125
Well, a common denominator's
gonna have to be

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:36.478
a common multiple of these two
denominators of 10 and six.

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.638
So what's a common multiple of 10 and six?

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:41.436
And it's usually simplest to
find the least common multiple,

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:43.502
and a good way of doing that
is start with the larger

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.312
denominator here, 10, and say,
okay is 10 divisible by six?

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:50.978
No. Okay, now, is 20 divisible by six?

00:00:51.588 --> 00:00:56.005
No. Is 30 divisible by six?
Yes. 30 is divisible by six.

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:57.722
So I'm just going through
the multiples of 10

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.556
and saying, "Well what is
the smallest multiple of 10

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.644
that is divisible by six?"
And that's going to be 30.

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.639
So I could rewrite both of these fractions

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:07.605
as something over 30.

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:10.296
So nine over 10. How would I write that as

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:11.898
something over 30? Well I multiply

00:01:11.898 --> 00:01:15.984
the denominator, I'm multiplying
the denominator by three.

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:19.617
So I've just multiplied
the denominator by three.

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:22.088
So if I don't want to change
the value of the fraction,

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:23.586
I have to do the same
thing to the numerator.

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:26.186
I have to multiply that by three as well

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:29.854
because now I'm just multiplying
the numerator by three

00:01:29.854 --> 00:01:31.433
and the denominator by three,
and that doesn't change

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:32.954
the value of the fraction.

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.751
So nine times three is 27.

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.549
So once again, 9/10 and 27/30

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.964
represent the same number.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:43.564
I've just written it now
with a denominator of 30,

00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:45.631
and that's useful because
I can also write 1/6

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.100
with a denominator of 30. Let's do that.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.621
So 1/6 is what over 30?

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.724
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:52.724 --> 00:01:53.850
and try to think about it.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.149
So what did we do go from six to 30?

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.248
We had to multiply by five.

00:01:59.908 --> 00:02:01.628
So if we multiply the denominator by five,

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:04.623
we have to multiply the
numerator by five as well,

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:09.623
so one times five, one times five is five.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:13.749
So 9/10 is the same thing as 27/30,

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:16.453
and 1/6 is the same thing as 5/30.

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:20.226
And now we can add, now we can add

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:21.817
and it's fairly straightforward.

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.267
We have a certain number of 30ths,

00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:25.335
added to another number of 30ths,

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:30.062
so 27/30 + 5/30, well that's going to be

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:35.062
27, that's going to be 27 plus five,

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:40.201
plus five, plus 5/30,

00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:43.583
plus 5/30, which of course

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:47.361
going to be equal to 32/30.

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:50.781
32 over 30, and

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.321
if we want, we could try
to reduce this fraction.

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:56.805
We have a common factor of 32 and 30,

00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:00.196
they're both divisible by two.

00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:03.505
So if we divide the numerator
and the denominator by two,

00:03:03.505 --> 00:03:06.118
numerator divided by two is 16,

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:08.902
denominator divided by two is 15.

00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.640
So, this is the same thing
as 16/15, and if I wanted

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.215
to write this as a mixed
number, 15 goes into 16 one time

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:17.574
with a remainder one.

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.255
So this is the same thing as 1 1/15.

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:22.534
Let's do another example.

00:03:22.534 --> 00:03:27.018
Let's say that we wanted
to add, we wanted to add

00:03:27.018 --> 00:03:31.881
1/2 to

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:36.881
to 11/12, to 11 over 12.

00:03:36.893 --> 00:03:38.033
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.864
and see if you could work this out.

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:42.502
Well like we saw before, we wanna find

00:03:42.502 --> 00:03:43.883
a common denominator.

00:03:43.883 --> 00:03:45.102
If these had the same denominator,

00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:46.264
we could just add them immediately,

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.527
but we wanna find a common denominator

00:03:48.527 --> 00:03:50.222
because right now they're not the same.

00:03:50.902 --> 00:03:53.468
Well what we wanna find is a multiple,

00:03:53.468 --> 00:03:55.794
a common multiple of
two and 12, and ideally

00:03:55.794 --> 00:03:58.164
we'll find the lowest common
multiple of two and 12,

00:03:58.164 --> 00:04:00.264
and just like we did before,
let's start with the larger

00:04:00.264 --> 00:04:01.901
of the two numbers, 12.

00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:05.291
Now we could just say
well 12 times one is 12,

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.949
so that we could view that
as the lowest multiple of 12.

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.632
And is that divisible by two? Yeah, sure.

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:12.790
12 is divisible by two.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.855
So 12 is actually the least
common multiple of two and 12,

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.213
so we could write both of these

00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:19.013
fractions as something over 12.

00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:21.625
So 1/2 is what over 12?

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:24.446
Well to go from two to
12, you multiply by six,

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:27.104
so we'll also multiply
the numerator by six.

00:04:27.104 --> 00:04:30.588
Now we see 1/2, and 6/12,
these are the same thing.

00:04:30.588 --> 00:04:33.954
One is half of two, six is half of 12.

00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:38.485
And how would we write
11/12 as something over 12?

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.855
Well it's already written
as something over 12,

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:43.258
11/12 already has 12 in the denominator,

00:04:43.258 --> 00:04:45.029
so we don't have to change that.

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:48.268
11/12, and now we're ready to add.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.350
So this is going to be equal to six,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.820
this is going to be equal to six plus 11,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.510
six plus 11 over 12.

00:05:02.378 --> 00:05:06.021
Over 12. We have 6/12 plus 11/12,

00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:09.318
it's gonna be six plus 11 over 12,

00:05:10.728 --> 00:05:15.087
which is equal to, six plus 11 is 17/12.

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:16.504
If we wanted to write
it as a mixed number,

00:05:16.504 --> 00:05:19.487
that is what, 12 goes
into 17 one time with

00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:24.487
a remainder of five, so 1 5/12.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.710
Let's do one more of these.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.007
This is strangely fun. Alright.

00:05:29.007 --> 00:05:31.043
Let's say that we wanted to add,

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:35.894
We're gonna add 3/4 to,

00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:40.584
we're gonna add 3/4 to 1/5.

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:43.974
To one over five.

00:05:43.974 --> 00:05:44.659
What is this going to be?

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:46.157
And once again, pause the video and

00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:47.870
see if you could work it out.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.291
Well we have different denominators here,

00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:52.052
and we wanna find, we wanna rewrite these

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:53.457
so they have the same denominators,

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:54.792
so we have to find a common multiple,

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:57.095
ideally the least common multiple.

00:05:57.095 --> 00:05:59.738
So what's the least common
multiple of four and five?

00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:01.862
Well let's start with the larger number,

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:04.718
and let's look at its
multiples and keep increasing

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:07.061
them until we get one
that's divisible by four.

00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:10.064
So five is not divisible by four.

00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:13.622
10 is not divisible by four,
or perfectly divisible by four

00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:14.702
is what we care about.

00:06:14.702 --> 00:06:17.059
15 is not perfectly divisible by four.

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.763
20 is divisible by four, in
fact, that is five times four.

00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:23.514
That is 20. So what we
could do is, we could write

00:06:23.514 --> 00:06:27.460
both of these fractions as
having 20 in the denominator,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.714
or 20 as the denominator.

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:32.266
So we could write 3/4
is something over 20.

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:35.319
So to go from four to
20 in the denominator,

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.949
we multiplied by five.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.466
So we also do that to the numerator.

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:41.398
We multiply by three times five to get 15.

00:06:41.398 --> 00:06:44.183
All I did to go from four
to 20, multiplied by five.

00:06:44.183 --> 00:06:45.820
So I have to do the same
thing to the numerator,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.736
three times five is 15.

00:06:47.736 --> 00:06:52.658
3/4 is the same thing
as 15/20, and over here.

00:06:52.658 --> 00:06:55.004
1/5. What is that over 20?

00:06:55.004 --> 00:06:58.358
Well to go from five to 20,
you have to multiply by four.

00:06:58.358 --> 00:06:59.995
So we have to do the same
thing to the numerator.

00:06:59.995 --> 00:07:03.861
I have to multiply this
numerator times four to get 4/20.

00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:07.181
So now I've rewritten this
instead of 3/4 plus 1/5,

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:10.815
it's now written as 15/20 plus 4/20.

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:12.973
And what is that going to be?

00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:17.932
Well that's going to be
15 plus four is 19/20.

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:22.024
19/20, and we're done.
