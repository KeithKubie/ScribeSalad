00:00:02.878 --> 00:00:05.839
&lt;i&gt; [traditional Japanese music]&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.758
- Hmm.
[camera shutter clicking]

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:10.385
- Going to send this one
to ninjabuddy08.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:13.222
Slide up in that bitch DMs
like haha.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:15.140
You know you like it.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.226
And look at the size of--
[clatter]

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:17.935
[clears throat]

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.186
Has the target
been spotted?

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.897
- Yes, sir,
the mob boss Franky Fingerstink

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:25.234
and his entourage meeting in
The Tea Bagger fine china shop.

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.319
- Clearly a front
for their true hideout.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.863
- This is to be done
in the true ninja way--

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:34.326
quickly, discreetly,
and, above all else, silently.

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:37.996
Send the "dispatchment" team
in now.

00:00:37.996 --> 00:00:41.667
- Uh, sir, there is already
an assassin on the scene.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.086
- Yeah, we, uh, told him
we had it,

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:45.629
but he kind of insisted.

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.758
- Yeah, uh, in a rather
loud manner.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.177
- Oh, Lord, no.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.597
- All right, all right.
This meeting will come to order.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:58.433
First order of business--
anybody caught posting selfies

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:00.686
on the organized life
in crime style Web page

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:02.646
will be immediately shot
in the face.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.022
[click, people grumbling]

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.565
- Wha--what the hell?
What the hell just happened?

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.151
- I bet you spaghetti-slurping
mother[bleep] wondering

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.695
what the hell
just happened, huh?

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:11.071
- Well, yeah,
which would explain

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.531
why I just asked,
"What the hell just happened?"

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.950
- You're asking yourselves
"Where did the lights go?"

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.202
"Why am I suddenly
shrouded in darkness

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.121
being tormented
by the angel of death?"

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.580
Why?
- Oh, shit.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.958
Hey, while that guy was yelling,
I found the light switch.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.835
[people murmuring]
- Right, now, where was I?

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.212
Oh, yeah--
tormented by the angel of death,

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:29.298
waiting in darkness
to be slain by the greatest--

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:31.258
God damn it.
- Hey, I got the sandwiches.

00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.427
You guys sitting around
in the dark for?

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:34.428
- Holy--

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:35.887
- Your time in near!

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:39.099
All you bitches will taste
my cold mother[bleep] steel!

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.310
- Why's he yelling?
I thought ninjas were

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.562
supposed to be, like, quiet
and stealthy and shit.

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.772
- Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing.

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.441
And why is he wearing
fluorescent colors?

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:49.192
You can see this guy coming
a mile away.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:51.194
- Yeah, not very stealthy
at all.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.821
Pretty shitty
as far as ninjas go.

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.072
- Yeah, pretty shitty,

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:55.282
By the way, I am impressed

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:57.034
with your usage of the word
"stealthy."

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.077
- Yeah, I've been doing
a bit of reading lately,

00:01:59.077 --> 00:02:01.872
you know, in between beating
guys to death with baseball bats

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.999
and shooting people
in the head and whatnot,

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:05.375
you know, trying to be
a better me, you know?

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.544
- Yeah, I definitely see
a difference.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.880
- Well, thanks for noticing.
- Don't mention--

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.090
- My sword is making
you all his bitch!

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.508
I'm in your ass
with no kiss!

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.718
- Is he rhyming?

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.178
Is this guy rhyming
while talking?

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:17.721
God, that's annoying.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:20.223
This is easily the most annoying
ninja I have ever dealt with.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.684
Well, I mean,
it's the only ninja I--

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.936
- Death is my business, bitch,
and business--

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.188
Oh, shit, my foot.

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:28.607
- Is this guy serious?
He's the ninja?

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:30.901
The [bleep] ninja tripping
over things in the dark?

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.194
- And business is good!

00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:33.737
- Yeah, and I'm pretty sure

00:02:33.737 --> 00:02:36.198
that's a catch phrase
from some movie or some shit.

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:38.950
- What you gonna do when
I lay my vengeance down on you?

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.285
- He just mixed Hulk Hogan

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.496
with Samuel Jackson
from "Pulp Fiction."

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:43.538
I can't take no more of this.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.457
- You shoot me, I shoot you?
- Deal.

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:47.334
Sweet relief.
