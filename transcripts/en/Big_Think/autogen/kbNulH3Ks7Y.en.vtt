sort of could replace a cup of coffee so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
sort of could replace a cup of coffee so
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960
sort of could replace a cup of coffee so
it sort of stimulates you and wakes you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970
it sort of stimulates you and wakes you
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.929

up so there's a lot of focus on things

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
up so there's a lot of focus on things
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810
up so there's a lot of focus on things
that are taking feedback from the body

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
that are taking feedback from the body
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.719
that are taking feedback from the body
and then stimulating the body and so it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
and then stimulating the body and so it
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.870
and then stimulating the body and so it
could be the body or the brain one of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880
could be the body or the brain one of
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120
could be the body or the brain one of
the things that is coming is a lot of

the things that is coming is a lot of
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.109
the things that is coming is a lot of
vagus nerve stimulation and the on the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
vagus nerve stimulation and the on the
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.069
vagus nerve stimulation and the on the
medical side there's research that's

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

part of the of the brain that you try to

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230
part of the of the brain that you try to
 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.890
part of the of the brain that you try to
stimulate through the surface and so

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900
stimulate through the surface and so
