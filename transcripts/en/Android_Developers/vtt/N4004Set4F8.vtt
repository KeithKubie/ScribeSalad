00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.180
LARRY YANG: Let's start with a
recap of some of the benefits

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.660
that Play Billing brings.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.700
We help you in four areas.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.450
First, we give you access
to users around the world.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.930
Second, we give
you choice, choices

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.080
in how to monetize in your app.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.800
Third, we give you tools in
how to optimize your purchase

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.570
experience.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.110
And lastly, we make
it all effortless,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.723
so you can focus on building
a great user experience.

00:00:31.723 --> 00:00:33.390
Let me walk you through
a few highlights

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.420
in each of these areas.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.500
First, let's talk about how
Play Billing gives you access

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.930
to buyers around the world.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.820
Google Play reaches billions
of users around the world

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.220
in over 190 countries.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.310
That makes Google Play
one of the world's largest

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.810
mobile payments platforms.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.890
Since we've met last year, we've
grown in a number of areas.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.560
We've added seller
support in 31 new markets.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.120
Now, developers in 112 countries
can now sell on Google Play.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.180
We continue to add
new payment methods.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.280
We've extended our
eWallet support

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.890
to over a dozen countries now.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.020
And in India, we're
in the process

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.620
of rolling out Unified
Payments Interface, one

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.000
of the most popular digital
payments platforms in India.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.450
And lastly, we continue to
invest in our carrier billing

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.010
relationships.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.450
We now have partnerships
with over 170 carriers,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.150
reaching over a billion
active mobile devices.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.430
That means you can now sell
to over a billion users

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.660
on mobile devices
with mobile accounts.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.370
They don't need a credit card.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.930
They don't need a bank account.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.280
They just need their phone.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.570
Now let's talk about how we give
you choices in how to monetize.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.850
For a long time
now, we've given you

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.960
support in selling
in-app purchases, where

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.770
you can sell one-time items,
such as gems or swords.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.850
We offer subscriptions so you
can grant continued access

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.980
to your content or service.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.710
And you can sell
paid apps, where

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.880
you collect a one-time payment
upfront before your user can

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.440
download and install your app.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.440
A couple of months ago, we
launched rewarded products.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.390
Over 1,000 of you
have already started

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.060
using rewarded products.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.870
With rewarded products, you
can now sell items to a user

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.170
by having them complete
a monetizable action--

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.270
for example, watching a video.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.230
Rewarded products is powered
by our AdMob technology,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.760
but because it's now
built into Play Billing,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.460
there is no extra SDK
you have to integrate.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.680
Rewarded products is
currently in open beta.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.650
Next, let's talk
about how we help you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.860
optimize your
purchase experience.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.680
The Play Console gives
you tools and reports

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.670
that help you convert your users
into buyers and your buyers

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.910
into repeat buyers.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.130
If you're a
subscriptions developer,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.230
we give you tools to
help you understand

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.800
who's staying on your service,
and for those who are leaving,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.880
why they might be leaving.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.940
Angela will share more about
these subscription tools later.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.430
And finally, we
make it effortless

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.540
for you to earn
money with your app.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.330
Instead of you having to build
a payment flow from scratch,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.750
we do it for you.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.570
And because users now see a
consistent payment experience

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.540
throughout all of Play and
all of their Play apps,

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.940
they learn to trust our service.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.100
And research has
shown that the more

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.500
users trust a service, the
more likely they are to pay.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.200
We store the user's
payment information,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.230
so they don't have to enter
their payment credentials over,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.820
and over, and over again.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.100
And because we store
the information,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.550
you don't have to,
because after all, you

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.560
don't want to have to
worry about securing

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.660
such sensitive
information, do you?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.480
We take care of all the
important details in over 100

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.620
markets around the world.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.270
For example, did you know
that in the past 18 months,

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.170
there have been a number of
tax and regulatory changes

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.680
in over 30 different
taxing authorities?

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.110
You probably didn't know
that because we took

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.430
care of those details for you.

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.720
And that frees you up to
doing what you do best--

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.032
building a great
user experience.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:03.490
So you probably already know
about all these awesome things

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.730
Play Billing does for you.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.420
So you're not here to listen
to us rest on our laurels.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.340
So let's get to the good stuff.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.550
What's new with Play Billing?

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.070
First off, Stephen
will come up and share

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.130
a number of exciting updates
with the Play Billing

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.760
Library, the simplest way to
integrate with our billing

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.330
platform.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.940
After that, Angela
will come up and share

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.120
a number of new features on
our subscriptions platform.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.510
Subscriptions is the fastest
growing monetization model

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.070
on Google Play.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.368
Stephen.

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:41.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.740
STEPHEN FULWIDER: Thanks, Larry.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.550
Let's talk about what's new
with the Play Billing Library.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.530
To get started,
let's quickly recap

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.630
what the Billing Library is.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.930
It's an abstraction on the
Android Interface Definition,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.970
or AIDL, which was
the previous way

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.890
to integrate with Play Billing.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.170
It helps to enforce
best practices

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.990
and ensure you're implementing
the API correctly.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.970
This provides the
best experience

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.140
for you and your users.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.820
And it greatly simplifies
staying on the latest version.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.310
Instead of copying a
bunch of reference code,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.130
you simply change your build
target to the latest version,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.670
and you're good to go.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.030
Since our initial launch we've
gotten lots of great feedback

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.680
on the Play Billing Library.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.050
Developers who have
adopted it into their apps

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.160
have called it a
dream come true.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.120
And we've already seen
many of you successfully

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.040
using it in production.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.550
We recently crossed $2
billion in transactions

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.010
from apps using the
Play Billing Library.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.010
In short, it's the best way
to integrate with Play Billing

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.330
into your application.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.950
We want to continue to
build on this success.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.580
That's why I'm so excited today
to announce the Play Billing

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.830
Library 2.0.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.970
It's chock full of new features
to help you grow your business.

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.610
First, we'll help you
to access more users

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.780
across more surfaces.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.230
We'll provide a choice
of new business models

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.870
to help you maximize your
existing revenue streams

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.850
and to explore new ones.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.820
We're providing new APIs
to help you understand more

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.190
about your purchases,
as well as adding tools

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.870
to help you monitor
in real time.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.330
And finally, we'll
cover how we're

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.030
making all of this available
now and in the future

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.160
to make things easy
and predictable.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.510
First, let's dive into how we're
helping you expand your access.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.310
Earlier, Larry
mentioned that we've

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.000
expanded to over 170
carrier partners worldwide.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.510
But that's not the only
payment method we're expanding.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.000
Today, we're launching support
for an entirely new class

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.360
of payments that we're
calling pending transactions.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.860
Unlike traditional
forms of payment,

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.040
like credit cards, which can
be authorized immediately,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.750
delayed payment methods
require the user

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.880
to take some additional
step in order

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.730
to complete the transaction.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.590
So let's take a look
at this in action.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.180
In this purchase
flow, you can see

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.790
the user's chosen to
complete this transaction

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.670
at their local SAL
convenience store.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.680
Instead of the normal
Tap to Buy button,

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.870
the user is given a
payment code, which they

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.820
can use to finish the purchase.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.090
They simply take the code to
the nearby convenience store

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.420
in order to finish the payment.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.090
And once they pay, the
transaction we mark complete,

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.050
and their fabulous [? yak ?]
adventure will be underway.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.110
So now you see how a delayed
transaction would work.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.110
Examples of delayed transactions
include cash and bank transfer,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.480
such as direct debit
and net banking.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.289
Cash is available today to
top up in Japan and Mexico.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.530
And we're expanding to
in-app purchasing soon.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:38.720
By implementing
Billing Library 2.0,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.059
you get access to these and
all other delayed payment

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.490
methods absolutely free.

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.020
It just works.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.610
We're also expanding
the surfaces

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.620
where you can engage
with your users

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.900
to purchase your
content with support

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.510
for out-of-app
subscription sign-ups.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.390
We work together with you to
surface your subscriptions

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.700
directly on your
store listing page

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.370
and allow users to subscribe
and install your app

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.782
in a single, seamless flow.

00:09:04.782 --> 00:09:06.990
And we're not just thinking
about subscriptions here.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.032
We'll also be bringing
this out-of-app experience

00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:10.590
to in-app purchases.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:14.130
Imagine, for example, being
able to sell a special game pack

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.530
directly on your live ops page.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.200
We want to offer your
content to your users

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.310
where it's most
convenient for them.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.290
This includes Android TV, Google
Assistant, Search, and Google

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.480
Home, just to name a few.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.090
Angela will be going into
more details on this feature

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.110
in a little bit.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.940
Now, as we expand
to more services

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.590
with out-of-app
purchases, we want

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.300
to make sure both
you and your users

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.490
continue to have a
smooth transaction

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.100
experience, between
finishing a purchase

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.690
and getting their content.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:48.100
To help facilitate this,
we've added functionality

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.280
to allow you to acknowledge all
purchases with the Google Play

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.200
Billing Library or through
the Google Play Developer API.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.170
This gives Google a signal
that you successfully

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.010
granted a purchase made in-app
or out-of-app to your user.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.150
If the user claims they
never received a purchase,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:09.300
we now have a definitive
signal to verify this.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.480
We can also automatically
fix any purchase

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.577
which was made,
but never received,

00:10:13.577 --> 00:10:16.160
in order to reduce the number
of users who have a bad purchase

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.690
experience.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.900
Out-of-app purchases and
purchase acknowledgment

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.220
work hand-in-hand
to give you access

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.530
to a wide array of
new purchase services,

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.080
simultaneously ensuring
your users always

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.810
have a good purchase experience,
no matter what they buy

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.410
or where they bought it.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:35.140
Next, let's talk about some of
the new choices of monetization

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.100
that are available in
the Billing Library.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.010
We know that
promotional limited time

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.040
pricing can be big drivers
of purchase conversion.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.900
Until now, we
haven't offered you

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.990
the ability to tell us
about those promotions.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.910
Now we're extending
the API to support

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.350
returning both original and
promotional prices to your app.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.020
And when we can, we can
show the promotion directly

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.590
in the Play buy flow.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:02.010
This means users will get
a consistent experience

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.400
or consistent offer between
your app and our cart.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.863
We've also added support
for custom SKU icon,

00:11:07.863 --> 00:11:09.780
and we plan to continue
expanding this feature

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.050
to support even more
consistency between your app

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.400
and our buy flow.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.410
We're currently testing
this feature and plan

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:20.312
to make this more
widely available soon.

00:11:20.312 --> 00:11:22.520
So next, let's talk about
some of the intelligent new

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.640
features we've added to
Billing Library 2.0 to help

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.370
you optimize your integration.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.120
First, we've made optimizations
to render the purchase screen

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.470
more quickly.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.650
As we all know, latency
is the conversion killer.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.480
And in Search, for
instance, we found

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.970
an additional 500
milliseconds of latency

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.090
can cause as much as a
20% reduction in traffic

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.650
and revenue.

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.960
Last year, we launched
a feature to cache

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.480
and instantly serve
the cart, as you

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.380
see on the right
side of the screen.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.920
However today, we're only
able to offer this experience

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.450
about half the time.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.010
With Billing Library
2.0, we've refactored

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.560
the API to ensure that you
get the zero latency purchase

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.780
at no additional cost to you.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.180
It will result in a better
experience for your users

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.110
and increased purchase
conversion for you.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.820
Next, we've revamped
the developer

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.310
payload to allow you
to attach your own data

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:17.230
to any purchase made in-app.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.980
This can be used in many ways.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.770
For instance, you
can attach data

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.320
about experiments that are
running for an A/B test,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.080
or you can attach information
about an encrypted user

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.230
identifier to associate
a purchase to a user.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.140
However you choose to
utilize the feature,

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.588
it's now available in
Billing Library 2.0.

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:36.880
And it can be attached while
consuming or acknowledging

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.590
any purchase.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.960
Now, by show of
hands, how many of you

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.860
have ever shipped a
bug to production?

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.490
OK, so about half of
you raised your hands.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.920
And the other half of you
are probably in denial.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.510
We all know that bugs happen.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.740
The best way to handle them is
to make sure that when they do,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.170
you can quickly
diagnose and recover.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.030
To that end, we've
greatly improved

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.920
the error code and
debug messages that

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.540
are available in the library.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.730
Instead of returning
a generic error code,

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.510
we now expanded the API to
return specific, granular error

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.360
messages for each
class of exception.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.550
This change will help you
minimize your debug time

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:19.617
and get things back up
and running quickly.

00:13:19.617 --> 00:13:21.950
So now that we've covered a
lot of the great new updates

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.562
available in
Billing Library 2.0,

00:13:23.562 --> 00:13:25.520
let's talk about how
we're changing the release

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.282
process to make it effortless
to stay up to date.

00:13:29.282 --> 00:13:31.490
We've heard from you that
our current release process

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.560
has some areas for improvement.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.680
First, releases are
ad-hoc and unpredictable.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.540
This leads to
confusion on when you

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:40.790
need to be updated to
the latest version.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.250
Further, there are two ways to
integrate with Play Billing.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.900
We haven't previously defined
an official best practice.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.030
So it's hard to know
which one you need to use.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.850
We know we can do better here.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.160
That's why starting today,
we're excited to announce

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.070
a predictable, yearly
release cadence.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.930
Every I/O, starting
with this one,

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.170
will be releasing a new
major version of the library.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.718
Each release will contain the
latest features and API changes

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:05.510
to ensure you have
access to everything you

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.822
need to keep your monetization
strategy at the cutting edge.

00:14:08.822 --> 00:14:11.030
We're also announcing that
the Billing Library is now

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.240
the official way to
integrate with Play Billing.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.040
Going forward,
these releases are

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.740
intended to be effortless
to adopt into your app

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.020
by simply updating
to the latest version

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.740
with your build
target each year.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.520
So you'll know when
updates are coming,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.130
so you can plan your roadmap
around this predictable

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.300
release.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.700
Of course, no talk would
be complete without a note

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.020
from the lawyers.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.420
So as a reminder, any
of our roadmap features

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.260
are just that--

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.170
a roadmap.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.000
They should not be construed as
a guarantee of future releases.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.355
I think I've done my diligence.

00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:45.730
But we know that
simply releasing

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.355
a new version of the
library every year

00:14:47.355 --> 00:14:48.730
isn't the whole story.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.760
Current versions of the API
have an unpredictable support

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.280
window, which means you don't
know when you need to update

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.680
to the latest version.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.900
We think predictability
is really important,

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.460
and that's why
starting today, we're

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.920
announcing the deprecation
of previous integrations

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.870
with Play Billing, AIDL,
and Billing Library 1.x.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:10.090
But further, we're announcing
this predictable and consistent

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.340
deprecation and
sunsetting schedule.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.700
Each year, the API version
will advance by 1--

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.430
as we mentioned, a new
major release of each I/O.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.340
Within one year following
each major release, new apps

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.140
and app updates
will need to target

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.675
the latest version of the
Billing Library or higher.

00:15:25.675 --> 00:15:27.550
So each release will
continue to be supported

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.830
for an additional year to
give you time to integrate

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.510
to the newest version.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.400
And again, going
forward, this process

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.110
is meant to be very lightweight.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:37.870
Simply change the build target
to point to the latest version,

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.300
and you're good to go.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.150
So here, you can see
the two-year lifecycle

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:45.070
of each major version
of the Billing Library.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.337
And because we are announcing
a new release cadence,

00:15:47.337 --> 00:15:49.170
we want to make sure
you have plenty of time

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.360
to migrate your
existing integration.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.685
Whether you're currently using
AIDL or Billing Library 1.x,

00:15:54.685 --> 00:15:56.310
we're giving the full
two years for you

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.140
to migrate your integration.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.780
Next year, you can see the
plan to release Billing Library

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.597
3.0, which will be supported
as well for two years.

00:16:05.597 --> 00:16:07.930
And two years from now, you
can see that Billing Library

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.300
2.0 will reach its end of life.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.120
And all new apps and app updates
should be using Billing Library

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.800
3.0 by that time.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.980
This release and support cadence
will continue each year going

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.800
forward, with each I/O featuring
a new major release being

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:27.580
available and releases from
two years prior no longer being

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.238
supported for new
apps or app updates.

00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:31.780
And again, the
lawyers do need for me

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:35.460
to remind you that
this is just a roadmap.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.460
So as you can see, we've added
a lot of great new features

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.350
to Billing Library 2.0.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.710
There's new ways to pay, new
purchases to surface from,

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.228
new models to monetize.

00:16:45.228 --> 00:16:46.770
And this is all
brought to your users

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.930
faster with improved
debuggability

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.530
and experimentation.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.740
And the predictable
release and support window

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.700
allows you to plan your roadmap
to keep your app up to date.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.940
A Java version of the library
is available right now

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.270
at g.co/play/billinglibrary.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.310
And C++ and Kotlin
are coming soon.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.270
If you're interested,
send us an email at these

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.970
so we can get you on the list.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.740
Now let me hand it
off to Angela to cover

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.317
what's new with subscriptions.

00:17:12.317 --> 00:17:16.529
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:16.529 --> 00:17:18.460
ANGELA YING: Thanks, Stephen.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.079
So you just learned how the
Billing Library gives you

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:24.740
access to more users, different
choices with your monetization

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.410
models with an
optimized offering,

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.570
and all in an effortless way.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.220
And now I want to
deep dive into one

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.890
of the fastest growing
monetization models we have--

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:35.840
subscriptions.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.900
So just a show of
hands, who here

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.380
currently offer subscriptions
in their app or are planning to?

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:41.890
Wow.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.015
That's, like, a lot of you.

00:17:43.015 --> 00:17:45.600
That's like 3/4 of you.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.420
So we've been talking
about subscriptions

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.970
here at Google I/O
for a few years now.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.760
And that's because users
continue to love subscriptions.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.420
They love it as a way
to try out new services,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.740
while having the flexibility
to cancel whenever they want.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.650
And because users
love subscriptions,

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.820
our business also
continues to grow.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.790
Between 2016 and
2018, developers

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.180
like you have earned
four times more revenue

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.100
from subscriptions.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.440
Now, you might think
this might just

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.910
be from all the big
developers getting bigger.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:23.180
I mean, we can't all make
a Game of Thrones, right?

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.590
But guess what?

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.980
The number of apps with at
least 10,000 subscribers

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.628
also grew four times in
the same time period.

00:18:31.628 --> 00:18:33.170
And so what that's
telling us is it's

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.580
not the big developers
getting bigger.

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.790
It's our entire
ecosystem getting bigger,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.700
with more developers like
you successfully offering

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.710
and selling subscriptions.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.730
So how can Google help
you grow even more?

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.490
Today, I'm going to cover
the new capabilities we built

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.690
in the subscriptions platform to
help you reach new subscribers,

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.150
as well as retain them.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.070
So let's start with reach first.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:03.450
Today, all subscriptions
are sold in-app.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.620
And you might think,
well, obviously,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.780
subscriptions are sold in-app.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.620
But consider this probably
very familiar situation.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.660
A user installs your app.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.700
They get to a paywall.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.200
They're like, I don't
know what this is.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.620
So then they uninstall your
app and post a one star review

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.510
on your store listings page.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.120
And they've never
even tried your app.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.000
Or consider this other
familiar situation.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.180
A user is using your app for
years using the free content,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:34.090
and they never even realize that
you had a subscription with all

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.470
this amazing content behind it.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.100
And so what if we could help
you surface your subscription

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.430
earlier, and maybe help the
user subscribe earlier, too?

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:48.320
So I'm super excited to announce
today Subscribe and Install.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.710
This is a new feature to
help the user discover

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.930
that your app has
a subscription,

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.330
subscribe directly
from the Play Store,

00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:00.670
and then we will auto install
your app in the background.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.500
How does this work exactly?

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.550
Well, you tell us which SKU
you would like to feature on

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.470
your store listings page.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.080
We'll offer the SKU
and change the button

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.730
where the user installs.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.940
If it's a free trial, we'll
say Free Trial and Install.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.710
And when the user
clicks the button,

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.730
they'll be asked to
buy the subscription.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.510
And when that's
successful, then we

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.153
will auto install the
app in the background.

00:20:23.153 --> 00:20:24.570
Now, as Stephen
mentioned earlier,

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:28.390
this does require the
new Billing Library.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.580
We've been running an EAP
for Subscribe and Install

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.460
for the last few months with
over a dozen developers,

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.740
and we've seen some
amazing results.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:40.127
We've seen an average of 34%
increase in paid subscribers.

00:20:40.127 --> 00:20:41.710
And keep in mind
that this is actually

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:45.010
after their free trial.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:49.540
In fact, photo editor app Pixart
tried Subscribe and Install,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.320
and they saw an increase in
both free trials, as well as

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.490
free trial conversions.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.980
So speaking of free
trials, free trials,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:02.270
again, are a super common way
for you to acquire new users.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.580
Over 70% of new
subscriptions are actually

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.470
coming from a free trial.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.470
But today, free trials are
kind of one size fits all.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.390
When you set up your
subscription SKU,

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.810
either everybody on that SKU
gets a free trial, or nobody

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:16.350
gets a free trial.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.500
But so what if you want
to be more targeted?

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.590
For example, what if you want
to offer a free trial only

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.370
to users who churned
six months ago?

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.860
So I'm super excited to
announce promotion codes

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.970
for subscriptions.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:31.460
In the Google Play
Console, you'll

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.280
be able to generate
one-time promotion codes.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.880
It's super simple.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.360
You tell us how many
promotion codes you want,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.120
and we'll give you a
bunch of one-time codes

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.500
and a CSV for you to distribute
to your users via email,

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.670
via in-app purchase
or other channels

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.810
that you can reach the user.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.100
And so how it works is if
the SKU doesn't have a trial,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.900
users with a promotion
code will get a trial.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.470
If the SKU already has a
trial, then those users

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:00.390
will actually get an
extended free trial.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.740
So this is great for targeting
specific sets of users.

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.960
Imagine if you can
send a promotion code

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.660
to a user who just
abandoned your buy flow,

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.420
or to a user who churned
after never having

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.840
engaged in your most
primary feature in your app.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.980
So that was the new acquisition
tools within subscriptions.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.990
But once you acquire
subscribers, of course,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.480
you need to retain them.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.110
And so let's dive into the
new features within retention.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.910
Today, when a user
says I'm going

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.030
to manage my subscription,
what they really mean is

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:34.190
they're going to cancel
your subscription.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.110
And frankly, there's
not much else they

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:39.770
can do once they get to
the subscription center.

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.630
And as a result, some users
tell us when they're canceling,

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.045
I'm just canceling
because I needed a break.

00:22:45.045 --> 00:22:46.670
Or I'm canceling
because I can't afford

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.730
the subscription this month,
but I'll be back next month.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:50.570
Guess what?

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.490
Some of those users
don't come back.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.120
Some of those users forget.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.150
And so I'm happy to announce
that now you can let your users

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.920
pause their
subscription instead.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.440
When you enable Pause on
the Google Play Console,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.480
it will surface a
prompt in the cancel

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.300
flow asking the user if
they would rather pause,

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.550
instead of canceling
their subscription.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.880
Users can also pause directly
from the subscription center

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.380
for up to three months on
a monthly subscription.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.410
This is a great way to
save on potential churners,

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.990
especially for users who
are leaving temporarily.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.700
So let's dive into a
specific case study.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.480
Brazilian medical app PebMed
integrated with Pause,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.550
and they saw an
immediate voluntary churn

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.960
reduction of 24% with very
little integration work.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.780
This is a great
result. Now because I

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:46.820
have to deliver a
message from our lawyers,

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.837
your mileage may vary.

00:23:47.837 --> 00:23:48.920
This is just a case study.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.280
So how do you know if Pause
is going to work for you?

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.500
Well, last year, we
announced a cancel survey

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.420
that we would show when
the user's canceling

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:00.590
their subscription.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.605
But this was only
available via the API.

00:24:03.605 --> 00:24:05.480
And so that made it
difficult for many of you

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.340
to be able to
aggregate those results

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.820
and make sense of
the information.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.230
So now we've built new reporting
in the Google Play Console.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.930
You can access these reports
in the cancellation reporting

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.550
section.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.050
You'll be able to see both
the aggregated fixed responses

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.880
and to look at trends over
time, as well as download

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.150
a CSV of the free form
responses users put

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.410
in when they answered other.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.990
Both of these together should
give you actionable insights

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.200
for why users are leaving and
how you can improve your app

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.930
to keep them.

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.720
In fact, language
exchange app Tandem

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.560
used the cancellation survey
to identify and implement

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.520
new pricing optimizations.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.880
Brain training app
NeuroNation found out that

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.670
through the cancel survey,
that one third of their users

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.028
were churning due to
cost related reasons.

00:24:59.028 --> 00:25:00.570
And as a result,
they're now thinking

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.270
about new win-back strategies
using real time developer

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.800
notifications.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.590
So I encourage you all,
please open your console

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.510
and check out the new
cancellation reports.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.213
What you see might surprise you.

00:25:11.213 --> 00:25:12.630
Ultimately, it's
going to give you

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:15.300
a better understanding
of who your users are

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.880
and why they're leaving.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.340
So we've talked a lot
about voluntary churn.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.440
Let's talk involuntary now.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.420
So involuntary
churn is when a user

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.980
churns due to payment issues.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.470
For example, your
credit card got stolen,

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:31.530
or your carrier billing
has a low balance.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.270
This is a super
common reason why

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.150
users churn from subscriptions,
and it absolutely

00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:40.260
can be addressed, sometimes
with even dramatic impact.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.080
So we currently offer a feature
called Grace Period, which you

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.160
can set to three or seven days.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.310
And right after a
payment decline,

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.190
you will give access
to the subscription

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:53.230
to the user for three or seven
days while in the background,

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:56.670
Google's retrying the
user's payment method.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.550
But why is Grace Period
only three or seven days?

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.350
For a lot of you,
it might actually

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:03.420
be worth it to give
the user a little bit

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.970
more time in your
app in exchange

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:10.830
for extending that retry window
we have to recover the payment.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.780
And so we've released
two new options

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.200
for Grace Period,
14 and 30 days.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.140
Both of these will give
you a longer retry window,

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:22.413
so that you can reduce
your involuntary churn.

00:26:22.413 --> 00:26:24.080
And the best thing
about this is there's

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.240
no integration required.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.900
It's just checking a box.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.230
So let's recap what's
going on in subscriptions.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.970
We've announced
five new features

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.190
to help you both
reach new subscribers,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:40.520
as well as retain your
existing subscribers.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.920
The features in bold
are available today,

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.450
while the others
are coming soon.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.020
Now let's hand it back to Larry.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:55.060
LARRY YANG: Thanks, Angela.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.850
Phew.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.030
OK, that was a lot
of stuff to remember.

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.050
So let me go through a
quick recap of what you just

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:03.870
heard today.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:07.200
We're giving you additional
access to reach new buyers

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.190
by adding a new capability
of supporting delayed payment

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:14.040
methods, where the user
can now leave your app

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.370
and go complete the transaction
possibly with cash or bank

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:18.850
transfers.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.280
We're letting you start selling
items outside of your app.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.550
So for example, via
Subscribe and Install,

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.500
where they can sign up
for your subscription

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.180
directly from the
store listing's page.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.190
We're improving the choices that
you have in how to monetize.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.580
We'll now consistently
reflect your promotional offer

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.320
in our purchase flow.

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.150
For subscriptions
developers, we're

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.660
adding a new acquisition tool
by extending promotion codes

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.340
to subscriptions.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.290
And we're helping subscriber
retention with new tools,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:54.290
such as Subscription Pause
and longer Grace Periods.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.120
We're giving you new tools to
help you optimize your purchase

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.200
conversion.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.440
We're bringing developer payload
to the Billing Library now,

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.990
so you can add metadata
to your purchases

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.430
to do further analysis
and experimentation.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.050
And once you've integrated
with the Billing Library,

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.410
you should start seeing faster
or improved purchase conversion

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.255
because the purchase flow
now completes more quickly.

00:28:18.255 --> 00:28:20.630
We're going to help you launch
faster with improved error

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.300
codes, and now
subscription developers

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.550
can understand better
why your users might

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.055
be leaving with the new
cancel survey reports.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.340
And lastly, we're making
it effortless to keep up

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.840
with all of our changes.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.490
By integrating with the
Play Billing Library,

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.150
you now will have confidence
that you're always

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.540
getting the latest and greatest
version of our billing API.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:49.240
