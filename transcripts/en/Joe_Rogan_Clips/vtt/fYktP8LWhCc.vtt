1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.630
The Joe Rogan experience bouncing checks.
Yeah.

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.290
They found them in California again off the coast after.

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.810
They haven't been here for 30 years and they just started showing up again off

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:12.560
to San Francisco and or whatever.
What the fuck are those?

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.240
They swim through like little schools of fish and they just swallow them all.

6
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.310
I've seen that.
So basking shark.
Giant mouth.
Yeah.
Wow.
Looking thing.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.540
Just like a funnel for the ocean.
How many bottle caps are those things?
Swallow?

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.350
Yeah,
he goes,
you want to talk about plastic straws?
30 feet long.

9
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:33.351
Imagine what kind of shit impacted like six pack tops are assholes.

10
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.320
So many Olympians have Colin Miller lite,
blood streaming,

11
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:43.260
either asshole when this shit,
those six got up.
They'll say,

12
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.240
you've gotta be able to handle anything after all these years.

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.030
They've swallowed so much bullshit.
Yeah.

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.780
Boots and fucking license plates should vote to build both parts.
Bones.

15
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.550
Yeah.
All that shit.
Yeah.
Creepy shift from the bottom of the fucking ocean.

16
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:01.050
Whale found dead with 13 pounds of plastic in its stomach.
Holy Shit Man.

17
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.880
13 pounds were so gross.
So there was a guy named that.

18
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:09.210
You see that?
What does this flip flops and 115 drinking cup.

19
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.710
They can't say Red Solo Cup,
but that's what that is.
People out there partying,

20
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.310
partying there on that boat.
And I'm sperm whales.
Wow.
Damn,
that's fucked up man.

21
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:20.040
I'm lip flops.
I've probably had one of those flip flops.
I've lost so many pairs.

22
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.740
I'm one of mine is in his sperm whales.
So did you see the video?

23
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:27.390
That Beluga whale returning the girl's cell phone?
What you did?
Okay.
Yeah.

24
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:31.020
It's fucking crazy.
If they set this up it would have been an amazing setup.

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.640
But I'll show you the video.
Whoa.
Returning it girl stuff.
Here you go.

26
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.340
The whale understands objects are important to you.

27
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.030
She knows iPhones are expensive and there's nothing on how far it got dropped

28
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:43.800
down in the water.
But I'll pull it up here.

29
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.410
It's going all over Instagram and Twitter.
You can easily find the video.

30
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.710
I mean it's coming from the depths of the water.
So like,

31
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:54.450
I don't know how the fuck you could make this a fucking God holding onto her

32
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:59.070
phone and it brings it up.
Like,
I don't know how you would fake that.

33
00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:01.860
Oh my God.
Holy Shit.
Well,
you don't look like trainers.

34
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:03.300
It doesn't look like it's in like a,
you know what I mean?

35
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.810
Like it looks like it's in the water and it says it's the one that was captured

36
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.240
last week.
I don't know if that the same one.

37
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.530
That's split part I think is fake about it,
but oh,
how do they know?

38
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.560
How would they know it's the same one or the other ones that have it?

39
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.900
I think that's,
that's how I initially saw the story and I don't lie.

40
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:22.110
Don't believe that person,
they're tagged and tracked and by the white whale,

41
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.930
the white whale that we posted about last week,
well it stuck around.

42
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.080
He's been staying in Hammerfest and then,
well maybe it's a different one.

43
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.950
Maybe it's a whale that they saw and not the one that was captured with the

44
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.910
harness.
I think that's what's wrong.
They're just,
well,

45
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.010
what did they post about last week?
Go to go to their,
uh,
the one,

46
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.670
this is where that story came from and that's the part where I was like,
oh,

47
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.460
it is the same story.
Yeah.
It's even trained.
Yeah.
It's a trained well,
yeah.

48
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.500
Maybe you wanted food,
man.
Yeah.
I just thought it was gonna get something.
Fish.

49
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.260
Bitch.
She,
that's so funny.
Here's your phone.
She'd be like,
thank you.

50
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:57.000
And he's like,
no bitch.
Just like the monkeys,
man.
Give Up.
Give up the food.

51
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.220
You Bitch to steal you.
I'm stealing.
Oh,

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.880
that was the other thing that we got Margarita's and we left like a pitcher of

53
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.320
Margaritas out and they dumped the pitcher over and drank the Margarita.
Yeah.

54
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.340
I like to party.
So the monkeys are probably partying on our porch.

55
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.220
Don't leave.
Margaret is out,
dude.
They're going to fucking say,

56
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.660
I'm wondering if the mood hammered.
They get wasted.

57
00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:19.720
They must get so hammered like a picture of mark.

58
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.630
I don't know how much they slapped up after it spilled.
Right,
right.

59
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:24.400
I imagine they probably just drank every drop.
