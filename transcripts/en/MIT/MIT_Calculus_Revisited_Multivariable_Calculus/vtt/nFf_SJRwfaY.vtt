00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:33.157
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:35.240
There's a cute book called
The Point and the Line.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.670
It was also made it
into an animated cartoon

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.570
that ends with the line, "To
the vector belongs the spoils."

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.730
And in this particular
course, we're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.500
going to find that both the
traditional meaning of vector,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.920
plus a modern meaning
of vector, plays

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.450
a very fundamental role
in the study of calculus

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.070
of several variables.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.930
In fact, the modern definition
which we will ultimately

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.700
get to later in the
course, is the one

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.820
that will be of utmost
importance to us.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.420
But in the meantime,
to better appreciate

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.840
what this will be like, we will
start with a more conventional

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.580
treatment of vectors.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.430
Hopefully one fringe
benefit of this

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.860
will be to revisit what
vectors really are.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.560
And to get on with this,
let me again point out

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.670
that we will be giving an
overview of what the unit is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.910
all about in this lecture.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.100
And the details
will again be left

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.670
to the supplementary notes,
the text, and the exercises.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.270
I call this lecture
"'Arrow' Arithmetic."

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.830
And the reason for calling
this "'Arrow' Arithmetic"

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.040
hopefully will become
clear in a moment.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.000
For the time being,
let's very quickly

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.650
review what a vector is.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.290
I think most of us
know this, but just

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.620
to make sure there are
no misinterpretations,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.840
a vector is any quantity which
depends on a direction as well

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.870
as a magnitude.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.020
In other words,
a vector quantity

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.960
is one which in order
to specify uniquely,

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.980
we must tell what its
magnitude is-- its size;

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.070
we must tell what
direction it's in,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.520
and finally something which
I call the sense wherein

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.050
I distinguish between the
same direction being traversed

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.650
in two different ways.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.340
And perhaps the best
way to emphasize this

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.340
is in terms of a
one-dimensional analogy

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.200
that we have already
studied very, very early

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.040
in our mathematical careers.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.720
I'm thinking of the idea of
visualizing signed numbers

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.920
in terms of the number line.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.730
In other words, recall that
the number line was essentially

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.240
the x-axis.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.560
And starting at some origin,
which we called say, 0,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.650
we numbered 1, 2, et cetera

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.110
if we moved in the left-to-right
direction; and negative 1,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.460
and negative 2, et cetera, if
we went from right to left.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.820
In other words, even though
the direction of the x-axis

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.730
is still the same,
whether we go from left

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.850
to right or from
right to left, we

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.400
distinguish between the
two motions in terms of--

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.380
and this is what we mean
by the sense of a vector.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.950
Some people say,
well the direction

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.450
includes the sense; I prefer to
have these two words dangling

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.970
around, so I can put them
at my disposal in any way

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.300
that I see fit.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.710
But roughly speaking then,
this is all a vector is.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.860
Now the idea is why arrows?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.490
And the answer is-- and
here's a little ratio

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.300
I put down here-- an
arrow is to a vector

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.384
as a length is to a
scalar, whereby scalar, I

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:00.800
mean a number,
something which has

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.910
a magnitude, but no direction.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.340
Remember when we
first started talking

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.520
about numerical
arithmetic, and talked

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.410
about graphing, and
visualizing numbers as lengths.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.040
We picked the length to
represent the number,

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.040
and at that particular
time, since there

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.880
was only one degree of
freedom-- namely the x-axis--

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.760
we didn't emphasize direction.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.490
But the idea is to carry
this analogy further.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.260
What one does is when
one has a quantity which

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.920
is a vector, an arrow--
a traditional arrow--

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.020
a directed line segment
with a given sense.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.200
The arrowhead
indicating the sense

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.130
is perhaps the
best way of drawing

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.210
what we mean by a vector.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.900
Namely, I have just a
few random examples here.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.960
Here's a collection of
things which are arrows.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.530
They're line segments
in a given direction,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.990
and the arrowhead indicates
a particular sense.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.960
Notice by the way, that
the concept of a vector

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.390
does not depend on
an arrow, anymore

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.360
than the concept of a
number depends on a length.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.110
The arrow is simply a convenient
geometric representation

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.330
for visualizing the vector.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.990
Now hopefully, in
terms of the last unit,

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.890
you now have the feeling
that in mathematics,

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.640
to have an arithmetic,
one needs more

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.380
than a collection of objects.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.190
That to have a structure,
one needs a collection

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.190
of objects together with
certain rules, and definitions,

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.300
and what have you.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.560
And consequently, it
becomes rather mandatory

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.160
that somehow or other we be able
to categorize a pair of vectors

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.460
as to whether they shall
be called equal or not.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.410
See, what shall we
mean by even saying

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.770
the two vectors shall be equal?

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.480
The equality of vectors.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.260
And I claim the
following-- and let

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.510
me just state this
cold-bloodedly

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.940
until we come to
the end, and show

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.420
what we're driving at again.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.270
To say that the vector A
equals the vector B means

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.480
that first of all, the magnitude
of A equals the magnitude of B.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.570
By the way, again as in the
one-dimensional case-- when

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.580
we called the absolute
value the length--

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.570
we do the same thing
in terms of arrows.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.710
We abbreviate the
magnitude of an arrow

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.660
by writing the absolute
value of the arrow.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.640
In other words, the
absolute value of A

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.430
must equal the
absolute value of B.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.540
Secondly, the arrow A must
be parallel to the arrow B.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.330
And thirdly, A and B
must have the same sense.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.950
And again to show
you what this is,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.810
remember I said to you a moment
ago that the arrows are just

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:42.980
a convenient pictorial way
of representing a vector.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.870
Let's observe that these
three properties here

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.390
juxtaposition very nicely with
these three properties here.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.080
In other words, notice that
our definition of equality

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.010
of arrows captures exactly
what three ingredients go

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.180
into defining a vector.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.780
Since all we're talking about
is magnitude, direction,

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.310
and sense, how can we
distinguish validly

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.910
between two vectors other
than in terms of magnitude,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.491
direction, and sense.

00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:15.990
OK?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.800
By the way, let's be
very careful about this.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.470
As long as the only way
that we can determine

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.620
the difference between
two vectors-- or arrows--

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.730
is in terms of their
magnitude, direction,

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.590
and sense, what this
means is that if you

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.290
have two vectors
which are parallel,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.180
have the same
length-- two arrows,

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.580
same length, same direction,
and the same sense,

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.970
they must be called equal.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.270
You see, in other
words, vectors do not

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.680
have to coincide to be equal.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.690
Unlike the case
of straight lines.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.000
In other words,
if I were to draw

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.570
a pair of parallel lines
here of equal length,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.130
these would be called
different lines.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:05.360
As soon as I do this these
are called equal arrows.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.130
Why?

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.300
Because of our
definition of equality.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.690
And if somebody says, "But I
don't like that definition,"

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.064
well this is the
same as the rule

00:08:12.064 --> 00:08:13.890
that three strikes is
an out in baseball.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.056
If somebody doesn't like
that rule, you say to them,

00:08:16.056 --> 00:08:18.250
lookit, go and
play your own game,

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.067
and make as many strikes is an
out as you want, but don't call

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:23.650
that game baseball, because that
will confuse it with the game

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.800
that we're playing here,
which is different.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.440
In other words, we make
up our rules to govern,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.679
as I said in the last lecture,
what we believe to be reality.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.380
And we believe that for how
we're going to use vectors

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.990
this is a very, very
natural definition.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.440
And this is not the
first time in mathematics

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.049
that we've done
something like this.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.710
Way back around the third
or fourth grade, here's

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.750
a little analogy, you get
used to saying 1/2 equals 3/6.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.000
But obviously, the ordered
number pair 1 comma 2,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.330
and 3 comma 6 look different.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:58.580
It certainly makes a
difference physically

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.120
whether you cut a pie in
half and take one piece

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.680
or cut the pie into six
pieces and take three of them.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.400
The physical process
is different.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.180
The two fractions
don't look alike.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.970
Why do we call them equal?

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.460
And it means that in terms of
what we want ratios to mean,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.640
the number which you must
multiply by 2 to get 1,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.100
is the same number that you
must multiply by 6 to get 3,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.870
and consequently,
let's just keep

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.580
the equality in that sense.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.340
Who cares whether they
look alike or not?

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.920
Let's call them
equal if they capture

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.289
the important characteristic.

00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:31.830
And that's the way
this game is going

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.350
to be played all the time.

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.160
We will make up our
definitions to fit our mood,

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.710
and hopefully the mood that
suits me best will suit you

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.210
best, because I will try to pick
the reasons that you yourselves

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.250
would have liked to
have seen motivate

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.270
why we did the
things that we did

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.920
or that we're going to do here.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.680
So let me talk about the
"addition" of vectors,

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.020
and let me put the word
"Addition" in quotation marks

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.560
here to indicate that all I mean
by the addition of vectors--

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.340
and perhaps I should still
say addition of arrows--

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.010
is I would like a rule that
tells me how to combine two

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.660
arrows to form another arrow.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.400
Now again I can make up hundreds
of rules that tell me how,

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.390
for two given arrows, I'm
going to form a third arrow

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.990
from the given two.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.040
But since our aim is to solve
problems of the real world,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.810
why not pick a definition?

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.890
Why not pick a definition
that has already

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.590
been used in physics and
in other applications?

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.110
The thing called the resultant.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.370
For example, given a
point O, and two forces,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.670
represented as arrows, A and B,
acting at O, we have agreed--

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.660
or you may recall-- that
the resultant force is

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.870
the vector that
forms the diagonal

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.650
of the parallelogram which has
A and B as consecutive edges.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.600
In other words, this vector
here was what in the old days

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.970
was called the resultant.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.860
Because that has
such a nice usage,

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.625
I am going to call that
the sum of two vectors.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.770
By the sum of two vectors
I mean what physically

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.510
used to be the resultant.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.790
And a very nice way of
remembering the rule,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.390
is remember that this vector
B is equal to this vector,

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.150
because this is a parallelogram.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:22.300
These are equal in magnitude,
parallel in direction,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.820
and have the same sense.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.320
Notice that if I want
a quick recipe that

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.560
was convenient for adding two
vectors A and B, you say what?

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.430
Place the tail of the second
next to the head of the first,

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.220
and then draw the
vector-- the arrow--

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.030
that goes from the
tail of the first

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.270
to the head of the second.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:45.640
And this will be the definition
of the addition of arrows.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.630
And again, this is done in
much more detail in our written

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.010
material.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:54.440
By the way, notice
again, a parallelism

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.660
between the structure of
vectors and the structure

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.470
of ordinary arithmetic.

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.230
In the same way that, given
two numbers, they have one sum,

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.090
but that a given
sum can be formed

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.350
by different
combinations of numbers,

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.800
that two given vectors, which
I call here x_1 and y_1,

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.620
give A as a sum, but notice
also that the vector A that is

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:25.590
sum of the vectors x_2 and y_2.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.100
To generalize this,
if I picked any point

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.240
I wanted on the blackboard here,
and drew any two lines, one

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.060
going from the tail
of A to this point,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.180
and one going from this point
to the head of A. Notice

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.900
that the resulting
two vectors here--

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.970
this vector plus this vector, by
definition of vector addition,

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.080
head to tail, from
the tail of the first

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.200
to the head of the second,
would still be the vector A.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.270
In other words, in terms of the
diagram that I drew originally,

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.550
notice that A can be
written as x_1 plus y_1,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.430
it can also be written
as x_2 plus y_2.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.460
And notice again the
similarity of the structure

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:10.140
between arithmetic and vectors,
and notice the arbitrariness

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.780
with which we make
up our definitions.

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.740
We make up the definitions
to be our servant,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.620
rather than for us to become
the servant of the subject.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.330
We model the
definitions-- the truth

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.240
that we call-- after what we
believe happens in real life.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.110
By the way, a very
convenient coordinate system

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.380
is our old friend the x and y
Cartesian coordinate system.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.310
And the reason for
this is as follows.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.620
Given any vector
A, we can always

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.110
assume that the vector
originates at the origin.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.790
And the reason for
that is we've already

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.100
seen that two vectors
are equal if they

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.650
have the same magnitude,
direction, and sense

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.100
so wherever A was in the
plane of the blackboard,

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.610
we can shift it
parallel to itself,

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.740
so its tail starts
at the origin.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.980
Let's assume that the
vector A, the arrow

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.010
A, which starts at the origin,
terminates at the point

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.140
a comma b.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.760
Let i be a unit vector--
meaning a vector that

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.610
has one unit of length--
in the direction

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.340
of the positive x-axis.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.860
Let j be a unit vector
which is in the direction

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.340
of the positive
y-axis, and our claim

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.360
is that our definition
of addition-- and you've

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.290
all seen this, I'm pretty sure.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.750
Is that the vector A can
now be written as what?

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:39.340
A is equal to a*i plus b*j.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.330
Where you see, if you've
seen this notation before

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.080
notice that in
terms of our game,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.200
we are now forced to
introduce a new operation.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.710
Because we claim in our
game that it's validity

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.890
that's important.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.760
Validity, not truth.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.130
If all I can use are the rules
of my game, for the first time,

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.690
what do I see here?

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:00.650
I see a number
multiplying the vector.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:02.800
And if I don't have
rules of my game

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.870
that tell me what a number
multiplied by a vector means,

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.670
in terms of the logic
machine, the logic machine

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.730
can't do a thing to give
me inescapable conclusions.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.380
Without assumptions, without
rules, there can be no proof.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.760
So I must make up
a new definition,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.670
and this definition is
called scalar multiplication.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.010
And it's going to tell me how to
multiply a scalar-- a number--

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.120
by a vector.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.750
If c is a number, and V
is a vector, by c times V,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.210
I mean a vector, which
has-- I have to be careful,

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.320
see c could be a
negative number.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.500
And since you think of
length as being positive,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.390
I take the absolute
value of c just

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.431
to get the magnitude
of the number in here.

00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:43.930
You see?

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.960
In other words, this
is a vector which

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:53.260
has the magnitude of c times
the magnitude of V. Meaning it's

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.660
c times as large as
V if c is positive,

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.590
and minus c times as large
as V if c is negative.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:03.110
The same meaning of
absolute value as always.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.400
For example, 2 times V would
be a vector whose magnitude

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.050
was twice that of the vector V.
Negative 2 times V would also

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.590
be a vector whose
magnitude is twice

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.621
that of V. The other
property is what?

00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:19.120
I've just told the
magnitude, I also

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.410
have to give you the
direction and the sense.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.680
c times v is in the same
direction as V. Minus 2 times

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.380
V, and plus 2 times V both
have the direction the V,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.300
and both are what?

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.990
Twice the magnitude of V.

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:36.680
The only difference
between the minus is this.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.810
That c times V has
the same sense.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:42.290
Same sense as what?

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.960
Same sense as V,
if c is positive.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.330
That means if c is negative,
it has the opposite sense.

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.980
In other words, for
example, 2 times V

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:59.890
has the same sense as V; minus
2V has the opposite sense of V.

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:02.210
But the important
point is this--

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.670
that vector arithmetic shares
many structural properties

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.300
of regular arithmetic.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.920
That is very crucial
to understand.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.250
I have a friend of
mine who doesn't

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.140
like teaching students
who are having

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.619
a few problems with
ordinary arithmetic,

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:20.970
and likes to teach
advanced courses.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.375
And he often has
said that the trouble

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.000
with the average high
school curriculum

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.150
for the average student,
is that by the time

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.590
the student is through,
he knows three things:

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.290
If you see a sign, change it;
if you see a decimal point,

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.902
move it; and if you see
a fraction, invert it.

00:17:34.902 --> 00:17:36.610
But he should have
gone one step further:

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.620
when the average
old-time engineering

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.566
students saw a vector, he
only knew one thing about it.

00:17:42.566 --> 00:17:44.190
And the one thing
that he knew about it

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.640
was, if you see a vector,
break it down into components.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.390
And after that, that was the
end of what they ever did

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.870
with vectors in the old days.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.430
But the thing that is
crucial to understand here

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.590
is that we will use
vector arithmetic

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.240
in a far more powerful way.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.090
We will use the structure
of vector arithmetic.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.120
In the same way that
we formed algebra

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.370
from numerical
arithmetic, we will

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.360
form vector algebra,
and vector calculus

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.486
from vector arithmetic.

00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:15.610
Let me give you an example.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.900
We already know that
for two numbers a and b,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.130
a plus b equals b plus a.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.940
My claim is that from
our definition of arrows

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.200
and the like, it
should also be a rule

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.310
that for arrows, A plus
B should equal B plus A.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:34.140
Or, for numbers, we already
know that A plus B plus C equals

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.800
A plus B plus C.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.200
That doesn't look right.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.420
By the way, what I wrote
there wasn't false,

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.620
it was certainly true.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:45.766
But it was too trivially true.

00:18:45.766 --> 00:18:47.390
I guess what I wanted
to emphasize here

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.610
was that the voice inflection
made no difference.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.470
Now again, notice how we
verify the rules of the game.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.040
I have to make up rules that
I will call basic truths.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.240
Those rules-- or
axioms-- will be

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.640
modeled after what I believe
to be true in reality.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.980
Now, notice in reality
I've formed this whole idea

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.640
in terms of what?

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.390
Arrows.

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.240
I defined what addition meant.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.060
Let's take a look and
see what A plus B means.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:22.520
If this is the vector A, and
this is the vector B, then

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.200
what is the vector A plus B?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.690
By definition of how
you add two vectors,

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:35.240
this vector here would be A
plus B. On the other hand,

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.230
I could take the vector
A, which is down here,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.520
move it parallel to itself
so it originates here,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.040
mark it off the same length.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.950
This is still the vector A.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:51.320
If I now draw the arrow
that goes from the tail of B

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.250
to the head of A,
what vector is this?

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.840
Well by definition,
it's B plus A.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.180
How are B plus A and
A plus B related?

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.490
They are opposite sides
of a parallelogram,

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.400
therefore they have the same
magnitude, and same direction.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.510
And the picture shows us that
they have the same sense.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.180
Since this is true
in the picture,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.130
why not claim that
one of the rules

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.050
of our game of
vector arithmetic--

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.620
even though legally you
shouldn't use pictures,

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.380
but pictures do give
us the motivation.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.140
Why not say, OK,
we'll accept the rule

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.300
that A plus B
equals B plus A. How

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.250
about our second rule over here?

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.100
Let's take three vectors.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:37.990
Let me take A over here,
let me put B over here,

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.729
and let me put C over here.

00:20:39.729 --> 00:20:41.770
And I hope that this will
come out legible enough

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.830
for all of us to see.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:47.170
I claim on the one hand
that I can think of A plus B

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.010
plus C in two different ways.

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.900
In other words, to use the way
that says A plus (B plus C)

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.860
from this diagram, how do
I get the vector B plus C?

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.570
Since B and C are lined up
in the right position head

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.850
to tail, the vector
B plus C is the one

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.970
that goes from the tail
of B to the head of C.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.700
So I call this vector B plus C.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.010
Now, what is A plus (B plus C)?

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:18.110
It's this vector plus this one.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.150
In other words, this
vector here could

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:28.080
be labeled A plus (B plus C).

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:32.660
On the other hand, what
is the vector A plus B?

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.760
A plus B is this vector.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.090
Because it goes from the
tail of A to the head of B

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.100
and consequently,
(A plus B) plus

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.850
C is the vector that goes
from the tail of A plus B

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.800
to the head of C. In other
words, what vector is that?

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.910
It's this vector, but
what name does that have?

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.050
We just saw.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:04.080
That's (A plus B) plus
C. And now we see what?

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.100
We have two different
names for the same arrow.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.630
In particular then, these two
different names represent what?

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.630
Two arrows which have the
same magnitude, sense,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:16.030
and direction, and
therefore they're equal.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:18.680
And that's why we make
up rules like this.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.160
And by the way, the
analogy continues on,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.345
and this is done in much
more detail in our notes,

00:22:24.345 --> 00:22:27.560
but I just thought I would
like to say a few more

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.960
words in general.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.530
For example, one talks
about the zero vector.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.540
And I write that with a
0 with an arrow over it,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.410
to indicate the zero arrow.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.690
Maybe your intuition tells you
that the zero vector should

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.930
somehow be connected
with a zero number,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.870
but the point that
I want to drive at

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.200
is an analogy to what we did
in the previous lecture, when

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.840
we showed why b to the 0
has to be defined to be 1.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.280
The idea is that an
ordinary arithmetic, what

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.640
is the beauty of the number 0?

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.930
The beauty of the numbers 0 is
that with respect to addition,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.590
it does not change the
identity of any number.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.510
Any number plus 0 is
that number back again.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.390
In particular then, why not keep
the same structure for vectors?

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.580
And it's our choice to make.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.990
We would like to say OK, let's
define the zero vector to be

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.680
such that if A is
any other vector,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.880
A plus 0 will still
be A. Well let's

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.510
get an idea of what that means.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.060
Let B denote the magnitude
of the zero vector.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.570
What this means is what?

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.880
How do I add 0 to A?

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.890
I start with the vector
A, and it originates here.

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.650
And terminates at the point p.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.500
Now how do I add
on the zero vector?

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.920
The zero vector, all I know
is it's going to start at P,

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.010
and be length b.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.570
So the surest
thing I can say is,

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:52.000
lookit, let me draw a circle
centered at P, with the radius

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.500
equal to b.

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.360
In other words the
radius of this circle

00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:00.100
here, the radius of
this circle is b.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.750
All I know is that whatever
the zero vector is,

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.790
if its magnitude is b, the zero
vector must originated at P,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:09.290
and terminate someplace
on this circle.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:12.740
Because that's the locus
of all vectors of length b

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.250
which originate at P.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.390
For the sake of argument,
let's say that the zero vector

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.540
happens to be PQ.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:27.200
Then A plus 0 is the vector
that goes from this point to Q.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.340
But A plus 0 must be A.
And since A and A plus 0

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.597
originate at the same
point, the only way

00:24:33.597 --> 00:24:35.430
they can have the same
magnitude, direction,

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.060
and sense, is that
they must coincide.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.670
In other words, in
particular, P must equal Q.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:45.850
And as soon as P equals Q, the
magnitude of the zero vector

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.210
must be the number 0.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.280
In other words, in terms of
our game structure again,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.260
if we want this
structural to be obeyed,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.350
and again I must emphasize this:
The choice is ours to make.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.920
But if we want the
structural rule to be obeyed,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.100
we must define the zero
vector to be the vector which

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.400
has zero magnitude.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.952
As natural as it
seems, that's not

00:25:07.952 --> 00:25:09.160
the real reason for doing it.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.910
We do it because it gives us
the structure that we want.

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.710
The same is true, for example,
about the additive inverse.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:20.040
Remember in ordinary
arithmetic, the additive inverse

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:20.810
meant what?

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:23.160
The number that must be
added to the given number

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.860
to give the zero number.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.540
Or the number 0.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:30.240
In vectors, we should
define negative A

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.620
to be the vector
which when added to A

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.270
gives the zero vector.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.330
Well, lookit, any
vector that I add to A--

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.490
let me call that
vector B. Any vector

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:49.780
that I add to A-- which I call
A plus B-- looks like this.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.680
Well what is the only
way that the vector A

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:55.680
plus B can be the zero vector?

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.640
Well the zero vector
has no length.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.780
That means the only
way that's possible

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:03.280
is if the tail of
A plus B coincides

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:07.690
with the head of A plus B. And
the only way that can happen,

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:10.190
is if B terminates right here.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:14.250
In other words, the vector
that we call negative A

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:20.380
is going to be the vector
which has the same magnitude

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.090
and direction as A,
but the opposite sense.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.990
And we're not saying
it's self evident.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.730
All we're saying
is look-- if you

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.060
want this structural
property to be true,

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.460
you have no choice but to
define negative A to be

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.100
the vector which has the same
magnitude and direction as A,

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.550
but the opposite sense.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.680
And by the way, as
soon as you do that,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.350
there are no more guessing
games involved in how

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:43.940
you subtract two vectors.

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.060
For, just in the same
way that we did it

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:49.820
in ordinary arithmetic, we
define the difference of two

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.670
vectors A minus B
to mean the vector

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:57.800
A added to the vector negative
B. And what is negative B?

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.230
The vector which just has the
opposite sense of the vector

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.450
B. And again, these
computational details

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:09.090
are left to the notes,
and to the exercises.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.850
But the main
overview that I want

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:13.140
you to get from this
lecture is to see

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.960
that there are more to
vectors than dividing them up

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.150
into components.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.910
That there is an
arithmetic imposed on them,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.590
and that arithmetic
that's impose on vectors

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.590
is just as real
as the arithmetic

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.610
of the ordinary real numbers.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:29.160
And to reinforce this,
in our next lesson,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.310
we will talk about vectors in
three-dimensional space, where

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.860
the geometry becomes
tougher, but the structure

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.720
remains exactly the same.

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.020
But until next time, good bye.
