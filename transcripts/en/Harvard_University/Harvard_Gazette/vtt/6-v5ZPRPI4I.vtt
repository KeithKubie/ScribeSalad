00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.960
Falls are about the sixth or seventh

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.799
leading cause of death in this country

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.770
and this is a very critical area of

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.320
research because it is so common and it so

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.919
often results in serious injury. One of

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.630
the exciting interventions that we are

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.750
studying is Tai Chi for its effect on

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.540
balance and mobility. We introduced

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.440
Tai Chi in our housing facilities, did a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.300
12-week intervention in which they

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.280
practiced Tai Chi for two days out of

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.370
every week and compared their function

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.050
at the end of this 12 weeks to a group

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.640
of people who just sat in educational

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.219
classes. And lo and behold, Tai Chi not

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.010
only improved gait and balance, but

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.200
improved their overall functional ability.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.660
I found the benefits for Tai Chi for me

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.320
was relaxation, lowering my blood

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.210
pressure for sure. The movements are slow,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.270
it keeps me mindful of what I'm doing

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.160
all the time and it helps your

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.420
thinking, I feel.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.560
So we want to improve

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.500
the brain's ability to adapt to our

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.430
local environment and we're doing that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.440
many different ways, but one of the most

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.270
exciting areas I think is electrical

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.280
stimulation of the brain. It doesn't hurt,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.320
it's as though you've taken a little

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.690
small battery and you've applied it to

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.480
the forehead. This electrical stimulation

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.930
can have great impact on mobility, on

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
balance, on the ability to think and to

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.260
do two tasks at the same time, so that

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.490
someday I'll be sitting at this desk

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.920
feeling tired, perhaps after a meal, and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.900
all I have to do is just attach a little

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.680
battery to my forehead to get a boost.
