00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.840
I was born in 1947, a long time ago,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.040
and when I was 18 months old, I had polio.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.576
I was in an iron lung for three months

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.120
and in and out of the hospital
for three years.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.376
Now, we had lots of neighbors
in our Brooklyn neighborhood,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.720
and some of them were really
very helpful for my parents.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.016
Some of them were really
afraid of contagion,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.256
and they wouldn't even walk
in front of our house.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.080
They would literally
walk across the street.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.656
I think this was a time
when my family really began to realize

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.136
what disability meant to some people:

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.360
fear.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.376
And it wasn't even a sure thing
that I would live at home,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.736
although I didn't learn about this
until I was 36 years old.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.656
I was having a discussion
with my father one night,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.696
and he said, "You know,
when you were two years old,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.136
one of the doctors
suggested to your mom and I

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.096
that you live in an institution,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.976
that they could just
go ahead with their lives

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.256
and raise their kids

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.296
and kind of be done with having to deal
with all the disability-related things.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.416
I didn't believe my father,
not because he was a liar,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.776
but I'd never heard this story,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.096
and my mother in fact validated that.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.256
She never wanted to tell me.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.816
But in reality, I don't know why
I was really surprised by this story,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.616
because when I was five years old,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.896
and my mother, like mothers and fathers
all across the United States,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.696
was taking me to school to enroll,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.056
she pushed my wheelchair to the school
in walking distance to our house,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.176
pulled the wheelchair
up the steps into the school,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.376
and we were greeted by the principal.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.256
Not really greeted.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.856
But the principal said,
no, I couldn't come to that school

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.576
because it wasn't accessible.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.976
But he told us not to worry,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.176
because the Board of Education in fact
would send a teacher to my house.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.016
And they did

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.735
for a total of two and a half hours

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:21.976
a week.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.256
(Audience murmurs)

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.336
But for good behavior,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.376
they threw in an occupational therapist

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.256
who taught me that very essential skill

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.720
of cross-stitching.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.536
(Laughter)

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.896
I don't cross-stitch today.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.296
(Laughter)

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.016
I didn't actually get to go to school
in a real building

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.176
until I was nine years old,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.376
and then I was in classes
only with disabled children

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.616
in a school that had
mainly nondisabled children.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.496
And in my classes,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.720
there were students up to the age of 21.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.696
And then, after 21,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.056
they went to something
called sheltered workshops

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.696
with menial work

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.920
and earning either nothing
or below minimum wage.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.576
So I understood discrimination.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.376
My parents understood discrimination.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.016
My parents came from Germany.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.736
They were German Jews
who left in the 1930s,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.240
escaping the Holocaust.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.336
My parents lost family
and they lost parents.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.136
Both my parents lost
their parents in the Holocaust.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.336
And so they realized

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.456
that they could not be silent

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.160
as things were going wrong
for me in my life.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.296
Not me personally,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.656
but what was going on around me.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.976
They learned that because
I used a wheelchair,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.816
none of the high schools
in New York City, in the entire city,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.736
were wheelchair accessible,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.256
so what was supposed to happen

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.536
is I was supposed to go
back onto home instruction

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.096
along with many other students.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.296
So my parents banded together
with other parents.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.416
They went to the Board of Education

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.936
and they demanded that the Board of Ed
make some of the high schools accessible.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.616
And they did.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.016
And so I and many others

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.936
were finally able to go to high school,
a regular high school,

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.560
and take regular classes.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.720
So what happened next?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.856
I was learning more and more
about what discrimination was,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.160
and equally important, I was learning
that I needed to become my own advocate.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.376
I was entering college,
Long Island University,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.816
and I had always wanted to be a teacher,

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.056
and so I minored in education
and I took all the appropriate courses,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.976
and then when it was time
for me to go for my license,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.656
I had to take a written exam,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.336
an oral exam

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.296
and a medical exam.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.536
At that time, all three of those exams

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.216
were given in completely
inaccessible buildings,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.496
so I had friends who carried me
up and down the steps

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.096
for these exams,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.776
not in a motorized wheelchair.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.816
(Laughter)

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.320
In a manual wheelchair.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.216
But I passed my oral exam.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.400
I passed my written exam.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.640
My medical exam was something
completely different.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.736
One of the first questions
the doctor asked me

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.040
was, could I please show her
how I went to the bathroom.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.696
I was 22 years old

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.296
and you know when you go
for any kind of an interview,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.576
you think about all the kinds
of questions that people could ask you?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.296
(Laughter)

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.560
That was not one of them.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.456
And I was freaked out in the first place

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.936
because I had heard

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.456
that there were actually
no disabled people using wheelchairs

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.136
who were teachers in New York,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.336
so each step along the way
I was expecting something bad.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.256
So I said to her,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.776
is it a requirement
that teachers show their students

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.080
how to go to the bathroom?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.200
If it is, I can do that.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.616
So no surprise,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.376
I was failed

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.816
because I didn't pass the medical.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.136
The official reason
that I was denied my job

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.976
was paralysis of poliomyelitis
sequelae of -- I'm sorry.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.536
Paralysis of both lower limbs,
sequelae of poliomyelitis.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.176
Honestly, I didn't know
what the word "sequelae" meant,

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.496
so I went to the dictionary,
and it meant "because of."

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.720
So I'd been denied my license
because I couldn't walk.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.176
So what was I going to do?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.256
This is a really important
time in my life,

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.216
because it would be the first time

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.736
that I really would be
challenging the system, me,

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.496
and although I was working with a lot
of other friends who had disabilities

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.096
who were encouraging me
to move forward with this,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.696
it was nonetheless quite frightening.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.296
But I was really very lucky.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.536
I had a friend who was a disabled student
at Long Island University

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.816
and was also a stringer
at the "New York Times,"

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.496
and he was able to get a reporter

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.416
to write a really good piece
about what had happened

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.840
and why he thought
what had happened was wrong.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.136
The next day there was an editorial
in the "New York Times"

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.456
with the title of
"Heumann v. The Board of Education"

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.776
and the "New York Times"
came out in support

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.896
of my getting my teaching license.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.816
(Applause)

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.176
And then the same day,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.056
I got a call from an attorney
who was writing a book about civil rights.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.376
And he was calling me to interview me,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.576
and I was interviewing him.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.896
He didn't know that.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.656
And at the end of our discussion, I said,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.616
"Would you be willing to represent me?
I want to sue the Board of Education."

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.256
And he said yes.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.816
Now, sometimes I say that the stars
were aligned around this court case,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.296
because we had an amazing judge:

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.536
the first African American
female federal judge --

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.216
(Laughter)

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.736
Constance Baker Motley.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.696
(Applause)

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.656
And she knew discrimination
when she saw it.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.256
(Laughter)

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.256
So she strongly encouraged the Board of Ed

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.576
to give me another medical exam,

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.296
which they did.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.336
And then I got my license,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.096
and while it took a number of months

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.176
for me to actually get a principal
to offer me a job,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.096
I finally did get a job
and I started teaching that fall

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.056
in the same school that I had gone to,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.280
second grade.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.616
So --

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.176
(Applause)

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.776
That's a whole other TED Talk.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.416
(Laughter)

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.496
But I was learning as my friends were,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.016
and people I didn't know
around the country,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.296
that we had to be our own advocates,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.576
that we needed to fight back people's view

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.936
that if you had a disability,
you needed to be cured,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.016
that equality was not
part of the equation.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.336
And we were learning
from the Civil Rights Movement

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.496
and from the Women's Rights Movement.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.696
We were learning from them
about their activism

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.736
and their ability to come together,

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.496
not only to discuss problems

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.456
but to discuss solutions.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.880
And what was born is what we call today
the Disability Rights Movement.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.600
So I'd like to tell you
a couple of riddles.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.080
How many people do you think it takes

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.856
to stop traffic on Madison Avenue

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.416
during rush hour in New York City?

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.056
Do you have a guess? How many?

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.795
(Audience members shout out answers)

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.560
Fifty.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.720
One would be too little.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.416
Fifty people.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.176
And there were no accessible paddy wagons,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.936
so they had to just kind of deal with us.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.256
(Laughter)

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.256
(Applause)

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.616
But let me tell you another riddle.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.336
How many people does it take
to stop a bus in New York City

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.920
when they refuse to let you on
because you're in a wheelchair?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.496
One. That is the right answer.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.416
So what you have to do though

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.296
is take your wheelchair --

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.296
(Laughter)

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.176
Sidle in the right place
right in front of the steps

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.536
and give it a little push underneath,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.336
and then their bus can't move.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.016
(Laughter)

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.576
Any of you who want
to learn how to do that,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.816
talk to me after this.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.656
(Laughter)

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.920
In 1972, President Nixon
vetoed the Rehabilitation Act.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.360
We protested. He signed it.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.096
Then the regulations that needed
to be promulgated to implement that law

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.536
had not in fact been signed.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.920
We demonstrated. They were signed.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.536
And when the Americans
With Disabilities Act, the ADA,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.576
our Emancipation Proclamation Act,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:32.016
looked as though it might not
in fact be passed in the House or Senate,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.296
disabled people from all across
the United States came together

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.880
and they crawled up the Capitol steps.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.296
That was an amazing day,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.800
and the House and Senate passed the ADA.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.976
And then President Bush signed the ADA.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.576
It's a great picture.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.656
President Bush signed the ADA
on the lawn of the White House.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.656
It was an amazing day,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.200
and there are about 2,000 people there.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.960
It was July 26, 1990.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.416
And one of the most famous
statements he had in his speech

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.040
was, "Let the shameful walls
of exclusion finally come tumbling down."

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.056
For any of you in the room

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.616
who are 50 or older,
or maybe or even 40 or older,

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.816
you remember a time when
there were no ramps on the streets,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.896
when buses were not accessible,

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.896
when trains were not accessible,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.736
where there were no wheelchair-accessible
bathrooms in shopping malls,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.896
where you certainly did not have
a sign language interpreter,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.096
or captioning, or braille
or other kinds of supports.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.056
These things have changed,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.736
and they have inspired the world.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.576
And disabled people around the world
want laws like we have,

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.840
and they want those laws enforced.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.416
And so what we've seen is something called

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.720
the Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.016
It is a treaty that was adopted in 2006.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:11.016
It's celebrating is 10-year anniversary.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.480
More than 165 countries
have joined this treaty.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.256
It is the first international
human rights treaty

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.840
fully focused on disabled people.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.656
But I am sad to say that our US Senate

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.936
has failed to recommend to our president
that we ratify the treaty.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.896
We signed it in 2009,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.136
but it doesn't come
into force until ratification,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.376
and the president --
no president can ratify a treaty

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.960
without the consent of the Senate.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:50.016
So we feel really strongly

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.576
that our US Senate needs to do its job,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.776
that our Senate needs
to enable us as Americans

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.936
not only to be able to assist disabled
people and governments around the world

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.816
to learn about the good work
that we've been doing,

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.856
but it's equally important

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.696
that disabled people
have the same opportunities

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.376
to travel, study and work abroad

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.776
as anyone else in our country.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.936
And as long as many countries
don't have the same laws as we do

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.576
and don't enforce them if they have them,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.680
opportunities for disabled people
are more limited.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.776
When I travel abroad,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.616
I am always meeting with disabled women,

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.096
and those women tell me stories

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.456
about how they experience
violence and rape

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.136
and how in many cases
these forms of violence

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.656
occur from family members
and people that they know,

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.256
who in fact may be working for them.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.696
And frequently these cases
are not adjudicated.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.696
I meet disabled people

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.376
who have been offered jobs by businesses

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.776
because they live in a country
where there's a quota system,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.336
and in order to avoid a fine,

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.616
they will hire you

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.896
and then tell you,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.776
"You don't need to come to work

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.960
because we really don't need you
in the facility."

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.376
I have visited institutions

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.256
where the stench of urine is so strong

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.376
that before you open
the door of your vehicle,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.416
you're kind of pushed back,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.256
and then gone into those institutions

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.176
where people should be living
in the community with appropriate supports

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.256
and seen people almost naked,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.776
people who are chemically drugged

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.280
and people who are living
lives of despair.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:52.440
These are some of the things that the US
needs to be doing more to correct.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.416
We know discrimination when we see it,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.480
and we need to be fighting it together.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.280
So what is it that we can
be doing together?

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.096
I encourage you all to recognize

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:11.280
that disability is a family
you can join at any point in your life.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.520
I'd like to see by a show of hands
how many of you have ever broken a bone?

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:23.576
And then, when you leave today, I'd like
you to maybe write a couple of sentences

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.456
about what that period of time
has been like for you,

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.016
because frequently I hear from people,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.056
"You know, I couldn't do this,
I couldn't do that.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.376
People talked to me differently.
They acted differently towards me."

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.256
And that's what I see
and other disabled people see

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.840
in flashing letters.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.256
But we -- you in this room,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.496
people listening
and watching this TED Talk --

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.656
together we can make a difference.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.760
Together we can speak up for justice.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.120
Together we can help change the world.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.536
Thank you. I have to go catch my bus.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.000
(Applause)
