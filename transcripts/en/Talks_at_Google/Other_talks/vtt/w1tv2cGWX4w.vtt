00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.030
So this Houston.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.920
Houston was one of the producers
on the film.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.100
HOUSTON KING: Hello.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.880
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.970
We pulling in Andrew, too?

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:10.190
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.870
I think he said he would
be a little late.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.770
Oh, wait, here he is.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.270
HOUSTON KING: I think
here he is.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.479
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.239
ANDREW BUJALSKI: OK.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey,
how's it going?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.620
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Hi.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.940
Good.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.540
How are you?

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.470
Yeah.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.060
Everyone just watched
the movie.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.470
That's what happened.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.777
ANDREW BUJALSKI: That
happens sometimes.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
know, it does.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.405
ANDREW BUJALSKI: You'll
all be OK.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.990
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.590
So it's a pretty loose
forum here.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.910
If anyone has a question
and wants to ask it,

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.820
just raise your hand.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.655
We'll throw a mic your way.

00:00:39.655 --> 00:00:39.920
HOUSTON KING: Yeah.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.020
Andrew, I might even say we're
sort of in the stunned silence

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.280
stage of one of your films.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.930
Why don't you warm them
up a little bit here?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.740
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Me
warm them up?

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.510
No, no, I mean, I think it's
nice to rest in the stunned

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.280
silence for a while.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.020
Sometimes you just
need to close--

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.780
you can fall asleep in the
chairs if you want.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.940
I don't know how long we have
the room for, but let it all

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.580
wash over you.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.670
FEMALE SPEAKER: Something
that was interesting--

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.060
I saw the film at Sundance,
and when you were talking

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.460
about the process for shooting
this, because it's 4:3, it's

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.600
clearly more analog than
digital, yet it's about a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.600
digital topic-- do you want to
talk about that a little bit?

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.060
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Sure, yeah.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.120
Well, I mean, we shot it on
40some year old video cameras,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.520
and before I knew anything else
about this movie, before

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.730
I knew I wanted to make a movie
about computer chess

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.430
programmers, I knew
that I wanted to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.780
work with this camera.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.200
I'd seen some images.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.960
There's some beautiful stuff
that William Eggleston, who

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.630
everybody knows as a
photographer, and particularly

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.440
a color photographer,
from Memphis.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.590
But he shot some great stuff
on the Sony Portapak video

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.530
camera in black and white-- this
same family of old analog

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.250
cameras in the '70s.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.400
And I saw some of that footage,
and it just blew my

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.270
mind wide open.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.530
And I thought, here's a kind of
language of images that has

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.870
sort of disappeared
from the earth.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.889
I mean, analog video was there
and widely used for a few

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.980
years, really, before the next
wave of video came along, and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.280
we haven't really
seen it since.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.150
But there's something so
specific and so beautiful

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.110
about how those cameras make
images that I just started to

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.050
fantasize--

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.130
you know, I'd been making movies
for 10 years shooting

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.430
on film, and for those 10 years,
people had been asking

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.740
me, well, why do you still
shoot on film?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.040
Why do you still
shoot on film?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.410
And so I thought if people want
to see video, I'll show

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.270
them video.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.720
And we found the prettiest,
weirdest, most

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.890
difficult video we could.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
want to talk about--

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.140
I mean, I don't know how much
you guys are into workflow for

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.470
this stuff, but it was
actually pretty

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.100
interesting, right?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.920
You guys had to basically build
out your own rig with

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.080
this camera that, obviously,
no longer is supported or

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.030
really around, right?

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.590
You got it from eBay, I
think you said, or--

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.610
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Yep.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.280
Ultimately, we had three
cameras, because we could

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.410
never be sure how much we
could rely on them.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.240
So two came from eBay, one I
think we were able to borrow

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.680
from a camera collector.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.930
And we were really lucky.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.940
Thank goodness I was not too
intimately involved in trying

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.720
to figure out how
to make it work.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.630
That's kind of above
my pay grade.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.350
But it does turn out to be
shockingly difficult, and I'm

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.400
sure some of your audience can
relate to the technological

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.120
woes of you take something that
was state of the art and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.360
worked perfectly well 40 years
ago, and you think, well,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.990
what's changed?

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.590
It should work perfectly
well now.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.550
And it sort of does, but if
you want to get it to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.100
communicate with current
technology-- if we want to be

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.820
able to show the film in a 21st
century theater the way

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.750
we just did-- there are an
incredible number of hurdles

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.050
that you have to overcome.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.100
And so I thought this
would be simple.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.120
I thought, well, we'll just
shoot it the way we would

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.650
shoot it in 1973-- just a guy
carrying around a camera.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.160
Easy peasy.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.480
But we ended up with this
ridiculous rig with 20 wires

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.940
coming out of the back of the
camera, and going to various

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.840
converter boxes, analog
to digital

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.170
converter, time based converter.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.340
Again, stuff that I'm not even
sure what was happening.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340
But ultimately, we captured
the hard drive.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.020
So using this very old analog
technology, we were still

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.720
making a very 21st
century movie.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: Does anyone
have any questions?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.709
Just yell them out.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.580
Do you want to talk a little bit
about what inspired you?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.840
And even on an acting front,
too-- like, what really

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.690
interested you about the
situation or the dynamics of

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.660
these people, or just this idea
of old school computers

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.550
doing mundane things?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.000
Or I guess, very complicated
things that seem mundane.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.890
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Yeah.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.770
I'm happy to throw
this to Wiley.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.280
I think both of us are about
the same age, and certainly

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.010
grew up with kind of
spotty childhood

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.870
memories of this era.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.340
And so I think there's a lot,
probably, that all of us were

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.530
drawing on subconsciously,
but happy to toss

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.945
that over to you.

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:07.750
WILEY WIGGINS: Who, me?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.170
I don't know.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.190
I mean, obviously there's kind
of a nostalgia element to

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.720
anybody who had these big,
clunky machines in their lives

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.380
when they were a child when they
seemed like the interior

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.240
of some kind of a rocketship.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.720
But then, I think when you grow
up, there's this whole

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:36.530
idea of the utopian ideals of
early computer culture kind of

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.260
in some ways may have gotten
out of hand, and sort of

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.420
thinking about that
aspect to it.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.190
Sort of like nostalgia mixed
with casting a critical eye

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.520
back at the origins of the world
that we live in today.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.200
I don't know.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.140
Is that fair, Andrew?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.870
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Yeah, sure.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.130
No, and I think a lot
of what I remember--

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.890
I remember in that era, when I
was a kid, that there were all

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.835
these philosophical questions
hanging in the air about what

00:06:06.835 --> 00:06:09.300
is it going to mean as computers
enter our lives?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.800
We all knew they were coming,
and so there was the kind of

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.640
utopian ideas about it, and then
there was all the fear

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.480
that went with it.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.470
And to some extent, we have our
new utopian ideals and our

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.280
new fears now, and the
old ones seem quaint.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.410
But I like the idea of
revisiting those old

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.800
questions, maybe
as [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
we tried.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.390
Oh, wait, no.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.370
WILEY WIGGINS: We lost you for
a moment there, Andrew.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.955
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Oh,
it was genius.

00:06:40.955 --> 00:06:43.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: It was really
actually perfect timing as you

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.153
were talking about computers
in our lives, and all of a

00:06:45.153 --> 00:06:47.100
sudden it was just
frozen in time.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.660
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Right.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.560
Well, obviously, yeah, the
computer didn't like what I

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.100
was saying.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.520
I thought it was pro-computer,
but who knows?

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.080
WILEY WIGGINS: I had a really
good time doing this, because

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.360
I had kind of a weird dual role
acting, and then also

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.700
helping doing some of the
equipment purchasing.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.090
The machines that were still
functioning, we had to get

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.190
them to look like they were
actually executing computer

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:12.715
chess programs.

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:18.040
So I had to dust off my memory
of Commodore 64 Basic to try

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.650
and write some fake computer
chess stuff.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.310
So that was super exciting
and fun.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.280
I had a Commodore PET in my
house here for a while, which

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.460
was pretty awesome.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.102
I don't know if you guys have
ever seen one of those.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.070
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Yeah.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.900
It was very fun to hang
out with [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.530
And Houston sitting
there became--

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.640
I was surprised with how
obsessed you got with the old

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.340
computers, Houston.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.160
You became a--

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.690
WILEY WIGGINS: Hacking
Houston King.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.550
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Hacking
Houston King.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.600
You became a 1980s hacker
before our eyes.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.220
It was amazing.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.390
HOUSTON KING: I had to spend
hours upon hours writing this

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.840
program so they would run
on the screen, and I

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.030
was so proud of them.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.670
And there's maybe about two
seconds of it in the film.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.760
But I learned Linux, I think,
for a little bit, and a

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.020
couple-- what other languages
were we working in, Wiley?

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.760
WILEY WIGGINS: Well, all of the
stuff that was happening

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.850
on the actual computer was
Basic, but any of the stuff

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.820
that was sent over the serial,
I can only imagine what that

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.035
was coming from.

00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:15.550
I'm assuming it was just modern
laptops that you were

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.580
just sending serial stuff to.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.300
We were really lucky.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.080
Actually, goodwill in Austin has
a computer museum, which

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.530
is a strange and wonderful
thing.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.530
So that was a really good
source for a lot of the

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.256
machines that we found.

00:08:32.256 --> 00:08:32.602
HOUSTON KING: Right.

00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:36.140
And so we actually got
to go to the museum.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.630
And we knew the teams that were
in the film, so there was

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.870
a corporation, there was MIT,
and then there was, like, Papa

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.410
George, who was on his own.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.790
And so we would try to
correspond what the most

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.900
expensive computers with the
biggest amount of memory for

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.685
the corporations, and then work
our way down to what Papa

00:08:55.685 --> 00:08:58.070
George's computer setup
would look like.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.415
And luckily, they had so
many computers that we

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.610
were able to do that.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:06.030
And ultimately, Czar, who's our
hero computer-- it's got

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.320
that very beautiful soft oval
face to it, if you will.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.200
And it's even mainframe that
we use for that work-- the

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.560
exact ones at the time that were
the best computers, they

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.870
were using for computer chess,
just by pure coincidence.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:23.465
We got lucky.

00:09:23.465 --> 00:09:24.650
WILEY WIGGINS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:26.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it was a
Goodwill that had computers?

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.990
Like, a computer section?

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.200
HOUSTON KING: I've never
seen it before.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.930
It was the Austin Goodwill
Computer Museum, and right

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.650
next door to it was just
regular Goodwill stuff.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.000
WILEY WIGGINS: So it started
out because there was a

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.750
specific Goodwill computer store
here in Austin that was

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.710
basically selling old computers
that people had

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.450
brought in.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.910
And just over the years, they
started getting all of these

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.040
really ancient machines, like
stuff that people were hauling

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.070
off from estate sales
and stuff.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.560
And somebody finally had the
presence of mind to be like,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.190
we should actually probably hang
onto and preserve some of

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:01.100
these machines.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.330
So they opened up their little
miniature museum

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.360
alongside the store.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.860
It's really cool.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:07.280
ANDREW BUJALSKI: It's great.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.830
It's a little one museum, but
then if you're granted access,

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.840
you can go back to the little
warehouse they have behind it,

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.280
which is huge, and full of all
kinds of beautiful old stuff.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.110
And that felt like
the last scene of

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.030
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.920
We were just like, oh my god,
everything is here, and we

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.800
need it all.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.865
And they were kind enough
to give us some of it.

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:29.980
And it was a real lucky
break for us.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.540
HOUSTON KING: And similar to
the Museum of Moving Image

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.970
here, or even more similar to
the Goodwill Computer Museum,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.640
there's the Museum of
Computer History

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.760
that's in the Bay Area.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.150
I don't know if you've
ever heard of that.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.300
Or there's another museum--

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.390
I think it's called the Museum
of Living History in Seattle,

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.280
which is just computer
museums.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.660
And there's probably a lot more
that I'll find out about.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: We have a little
mini one here on the

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:54.900
fourth floor.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.730
HOUSTON KING: Oh, do you?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.120
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.890
ANDREW BUJALSKI:
That's awesome.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:57.283
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:10:57.283 --> 00:10:58.070
HOUSTON KING: I want
to see it.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.835
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:00.460
We can show you.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.780
It's interesting, seeing all the
variations of computers.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.070
At least for me, I only know
specific milestones, but I

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.330
don't necessarily know the
spectrum of all the

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:12.410
variations, so it's cool that
you guys were able to pull

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.780
from ones that actually existed,
and just be like,

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:15.350
well, one--

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.890
HOUSTON KING: I mean, for a
while, Radio Shack was all in

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.960
the computer business.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.570
They had some beautiful
stainless steel computers that

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.590
they were selling.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.840
And some of them are
in the film.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.054
FEMALE SPEAKER: Some
of them worked.

00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:28.850
Do you want to talk a little
bit more about--

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.940
some of the actors, I feel
like-- again, if I'm wrong,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.640
I'm sorry, but do you want to
talk about how some of the

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.810
actors may have actually had
computing experience?

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.370
Like, Wiley, it seems like you
had a little bit as well.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:45.260
Do you want to talk about
that a little bit?

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.540
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Sure.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.450
Well, there are plenty of
folks in the movie who--

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.520
Gordon Kindlmann, who plays
Professor Schoesser, he is a

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.920
computer science professor at
the University of Chicago.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.370
James Curry works with Wiley,
and they do video game

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.840
programming stuff.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.420
And James-- the great thing
about James, who plays the

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.250
British programmer, Carbray, is
that he remembered all of

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.990
the '80s programming.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.730
In theory, he's too young for
it, except I think he was a

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.010
child prodigy programmer.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.810
So at age eight in Britain, he
was doing all this stuff, and

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.650
he knew at all intimately and
remembered all of it, which

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:17.260
was fantastic.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.240
And certainly, Wiley knows a lot
of this stuff in and out

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.950
and up and down, and
it was hugely--

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.110
I mean, A, as Wiley mentioned
before, it meant that I could

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.950
doubly exploit my cast as
technical advisors.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.220
But also, that I wanted
it to feel real.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.230
If I'm going to make a movie
about computer programmers, I

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.770
want them to feel like
computer programmers.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.250
And those guys to bring
so much more of that.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:43.260
I'm not a computer programmer.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.970
If I had sat down with Wikipedia
and tried to figure

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.430
out enough factoids to fill out
a script, and then handed

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:54.110
it to conventional actors, I
don't think we would've gotten

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:57.970
anywhere near it feeling right
the way that it does, or the

00:12:57.970 --> 00:12:59.710
way that I hope it does.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.330
And all credit is due to the
cast for that, certainly.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.190
Well, how much did Weird Science
have something to do

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.555
with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.520
WILEY WIGGINS: It feels more
like Real Genius to me than

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.220
Weird Science.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.140
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Yeah,
that sounds right.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:14.320
Yeah.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that
actually makes sense.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.626
Fine.

00:13:17.626 --> 00:13:18.030
Fine.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.800
WILEY WIGGINS: There's a deleted
scene from this movie

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.136
where we fill the hotel
with Jiffy Pop,

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.440
heating it with a laser.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.690
Little known fact.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.186
ANDREW BUJALSKI: It'll
be on the DVD.

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:31.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.780
Special features.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.758
Do you have a question?

00:13:35.758 --> 00:13:36.716
You can use this.

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:37.966
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I had a question
about the use of VHS.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.870
You mentioned William Eggleston
stranded in Canton,

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.950
and I knwo that Harmony Korine
cited that as a really sole

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.830
influence for Trash Humpers.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.400
And I don't think there's
anything that's been written

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.370
yet, but I can totally see a
think piece being written in

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:05.020
the next couple years, like,
is VHS coming back, or that

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.000
sort of thing.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.870
And I was just wondering if
you guys feel like VHS is

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:15.540
coming back, or maybe more
specifically, I was wondering

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.020
why it seemed to resonate
to you guys.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.900
WILEY WIGGINS: Well, this
is way pre-VHS.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.890
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.460
I guess I meant more the
Portapak stuff, too.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.380
WILEY WIGGINS: Oh, right on.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.760
AUDIENCE: I just meant
antiquated video form.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.170
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Well, I'd be
surprised if you started to

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.110
see this look take over the
multiplex, but I'd also be

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.490
surprised if this was the
last stunt like this.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:47.360
I mean, to some extent, it is a
stunt, and certainly it was

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.050
this great leap off
the cliff for us.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.670
On the other hand,
we meant it.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.550
I mean, I hope the movie works,
and I hope it works

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.970
because we were using these
cameras for a reason, and to

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.690
produce a very specific kind of
feel, and to do something

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.850
very specific with that feel.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.630
So yeah, I mean, it's open
for anybody to use.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.150
I, of course, fell in love with
the cameras while we were

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.110
doing, and I started to
think, I want to shoot

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.590
everything on this.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:17.800
Which I probably won't, but it
is a beautiful thing, and it

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.154
doesn't look like
anything else.

00:15:20.154 --> 00:15:23.280
And you know, Trash
Humpers was VHS.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.870
It was very much
its own thing.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.860
It's hard to imagine that
on any other format.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.040
So I just think it's
out there.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.540
It's like any kind of palette.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.620
It's very easy, certainly in
our current culture, for

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.590
people to get addicted to this
idea that whatever the newest,

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.190
latest, and greatest is is the
only thing you can shoot on.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.890
And you see this all the time,
of course, that there are

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:49.510
camera fads, and I'm not
up to date with it.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.640
A couple of years ago, at
least, people were only

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.370
shooting their movies on the
Canon, and I don't know if

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:54.140
they are now or not.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:16:01.340
But for me, I just see all this
opportunity with all the

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.020
other formats that nobody else
is touching to say, what can

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.230
we do here that nobody
else is doing?

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.520
And that's kind of how I
approach any movie I make.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.330
I hate the idea that my next
door neighbor might be making

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.580
the same movie.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.710
I want to have some territory
to ourselves,

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:24.820
whatever that may be.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.070
It doesn't have to be the
camera, but that's certainly

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.450
one way to get it something
unique.

00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:34.400
WILEY WIGGINS: I was going to
say, also, if you're doing a

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.500
low budget period piece, it's a
pretty magical way to do art

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.570
direction for all the pieces
of the world that you don't

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:42.500
have control over.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.320
You're applying this sort of
texture to everything that

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.640
makes it all work.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.480
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Absolutely.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.960
We had a brilliant costume
department, we had a brilliant

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.720
production design department,
but we also had very limited

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.000
resources and very
little money.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.070
And I think the camera goes a
long way toward bringing back

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:02.280
that late '70s, early
'80s feeling.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.760
Because this is the kind of
image that you haven't seen

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.460
since then, so I think
it inevitably

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.970
transports people to there.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:14.920
HOUSTON KING: And even beyond
just the issue of VHS, I find

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.710
the writers that we're talking
to about the movie are

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.359
incorporating writing about
the film as a bigger piece

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:24.170
about that we finally have
enough history and technology

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.900
that people are starting
to get nostalgic.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.510
And seeing these pieces come
up about the old computers,

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:36.150
and even the gifs that we've
used to publicize the film,

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.720
and we're just starting to
finally see people looking

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.580
back at technology for
the first time

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.990
instead of always forward.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.690
WILEY WIGGINS: Well, a new
tool doesn't necessarily

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:47.850
replace an old tool.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:51.715
They all fill the toolbox up,
and you can go back in history

00:17:51.715 --> 00:17:53.690
and pick things when they're
appropriate.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.020
And that applies to technology
as well.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.780
ANDREW BUJALSKI: But I can't
tell you how many sane and

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.290
rational people, when I talked
to them about doing this movie

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.850
on these old cameras said, why
don't you do it on a new

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.950
camera, and we'll do x y z
filter in post to make it look

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:08.510
like the old camera?

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.600
And that, on the one hand,
makes a lot of practical

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.290
sense, and on the other hand,
I'm so glad we didn't,

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.240
especially because this camera
brought so many weird, quirky

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.210
glitches in the movie that the
camera gave us that we never

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.600
would have been able to invent
ourselves that really, I

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.610
think, become very much a part
of the texture of the movie.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.430
HOUSTON KING: And if you like
the look of it, there's

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.860
another example of a film that
just came out in theaters

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:38.180
called "No" that they used an
actual time period camera as

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.805
well, from, I think, it looked
like it was late '70s.

00:18:42.805 --> 00:18:43.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:45.770
Something about the nuances of
when something doesn't work

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.720
that really kind of adds to the
overall aesthetic of any

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.440
film that's being shot with a
period camera that I think we

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.940
forget, because we just assume
that that's stuff you just

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.010
sort of glaze over.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.440
But you're just used to
it at that point.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.700
But going back, it's
very cool.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.710
Anyone else have a question?

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.010
Yeah.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.890
Should he be using that one
for the purposes of this?

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:10.140
Does it matter?

00:19:12.924 --> 00:19:14.680
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.330
It's possible that there are
whole genres of films about

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.650
conferences that I've never
heard of, but I was just

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.830
really struck by--

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.000
I've never seen a movie about a
conference before, and maybe

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.800
that was just a byproduct
of the topic that

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.560
you're talking about.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.910
But it seemed so accurate and
true, but also depressing, but

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:32.940
also not depressing.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.660
And I was just wondering where
the conference came from.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.370
Like, is there a lot of movie
conferences that feel like

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.040
that, or how did that work its
way in, and how did it end up

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.730
being so realistic and weird?

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:52.960
ANDREW BUJALSKI: I'm sure a lot
of film festival memories

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.030
crept in there, because
certainly, you make a movie,

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.650
and you end up, if you're lucky,
and people want to show

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.260
it, then you travel around
with it, and you end up

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.010
feeling like--

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.170
I mean, I certainly remember
waking up in some of those

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.930
hotels and thinking,
like, I might as

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:08.240
well be a carpet salesman.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.100
It's like, you travel around,
you kind of see the same

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:14.680
people, and say, hey,
how are you doing?

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.140
Here we are selling carpets
in Milwaukee.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.290
All these people who--

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:20.340
we all like to think that we're

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.150
artists, but anyway, yeah.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:26.730
I mean, that's the closest
thing I know

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.050
to convention culture.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.000
But I've seen them.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I've certainly heard plenty of
great convention stories and

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.050
hotel stories from anybody who's
hung around these things

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.390
for any of their business.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.490
Hotels are great, because
they're weirdly anonymous, but

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.770
also, they're so full of human
drama, but you never know what

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.570
that drama is.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.850
It's all these secret
compartments of drama.

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.380
And it was so fun to get to
explore that and play with it

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:57.740
in the movie.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.540
In some weird way--

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.350
I couldn't quite figure it out--
but the way that people

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:05.820
described early computers to me,
too, that the architecture

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.070
of the computer was much more
knowable than it is now.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:12.720
And this fascinates me, that
at some point, I was lucky

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.580
enough to get on the phone with
Richard Garriott, the

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.460
video game programmer, and he
was talking about how when he

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.770
started out working in his
parents' garage, he knew

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.270
everything about the computer
intimately, and there was

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.380
nothing the computer did that
he didn't know what was

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.260
happening, because he'd
spent enough time with

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.380
it to master it.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:33.830
And now, there's nobody
on earth.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.490
I'm talking to you through
a MacBook Pro.

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.550
There's not a single human
being on Earth who knows

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.610
everything that's happening
inside of this computer.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.630
It's gone way beyond the ability
of one person to

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.915
understand.

00:21:41.915 --> 00:21:43.680
But something about--

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.950
and now I'm stretching a
metaphor pretty thin-- but

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.720
something about that
architecture of early

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:54.040
computers with all these kind
of knowable but unknowable

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.430
compartments--

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.710
I don't know.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.470
Somehow, the hotel felt to me
like its own kind of computer,

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.870
or its own old computer.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.350
Maybe an unbelievably enormous
hotel would be today's

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.180
computer equipment.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.770
But I felt like there was some
weird cosmic resonance there.

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.180
I can't quite explain it, but
somehow, it helped with

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.580
whatever I was thinking in the
editing and the shooting.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.770
A friend, Kevin Bewersdorf, who
plays the cameraman in the

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.600
movie, said to me after he
watched it-- he said, it's

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.193
like a drug movie made by
somebody who doesn't do drugs,

00:22:25.193 --> 00:22:27.600
which is basically exactly
what it is.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.990
So this is like, if some of my
thinking sounds a little

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.880
stoned, it's just me
trying to project

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.260
myself into being stoned.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.320
I don't really do it that
much in reality.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.230
WILEY WIGGINS: Timothy Leary
said that computers are the

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.520
new LSD, Andrew.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.074
ANDREW BUJALSKI:
Who said that?

00:22:43.074 --> 00:22:44.406
WILEY WIGGINS: Timothy Leary.

00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:45.040
ANDREW BUJALSKI: There you go.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.290
He should've known.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: Any
other questions?

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:51.830
HOUSTON KING: There's one.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.950
AUDIENCE: Howdy.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:06.010
So there's that one shining
moment around the end where it

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:12.710
flashes to color, and there's
this old woman, and moments of

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.520
talk of religion.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.320
It just seems like this strange
kind of anachronistic

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.220
hole, and characters get lost,
and they're never seen again.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:29.030
And it was just a very
interesting moment, and I was

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.140
wondering if you could talk
about it a little bit more.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.810
ANDREW BUJALSKI: I could
talk about it a little.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.690
I think it sounds like
you saw most of what

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.000
was going on there.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.690
You know, to some extent, we
were raising the ante so much.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.830
In the last third of the
movie, as you noticed,

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:53.040
everything goes fairly insane,
and we're kicking everything

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.820
into as high a gear as we can,
and kind of throwing every

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.235
experimental impulse
at the wall.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:06.310
First of all, there's an
incredible history of black

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:09.890
and white movies with color
sequences, and I think my all

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.390
time favorite is The Women
from 1939, which had this

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:16.220
amazing fashion show sequence
that just kind of comes in the

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.240
middle of the movie, and goes
color, and then it goes back.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.500
But Raging Bull has one, She's
Got A Habit has one,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.780
Schindler's List even
has the girl with

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.030
the little red jacket.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.970
And again, it's always a kind
of stunt, but the question

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.210
with any stunt is, is there a
way to do the stunt that means

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.440
something, or that provides
some value?

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:42.060
And I like the idea, in this
case, that going to color

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:48.600
usually is about something
becoming grand or beautiful or

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.820
magical, and I like the idea
here that it was actually the

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.440
black and white footage that
really was our futuristic

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.980
footage, and to go into color,
we were really stepping back.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.920
As you said, there's something
anachronistic about it, and

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.880
we're with this older woman.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.870
And so this color photography,
which is in some ways more

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.090
familiar to us, although it
looks weird in its own way--

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.550
but we're stepping back from
1960s technology to 1930s

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.185
technology to shoot that.

00:25:17.185 --> 00:25:19.860
And I liked the idea that that
color and warmth would be

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.340
somehow something
old and musty.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.880
Which, again, is not an
explanation for it.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.740
It's just one of the things
I enjoyed about it.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.000
I can't explain anything.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.746
It just is what it is.

00:25:33.746 --> 00:25:34.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: That
was pretty good.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:35.640
That was good.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:35.910
ANDREW BUJALSKI: OK.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:37.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.530
WILEY WIGGINS: I just think he
couldn't bear to not have some

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.610
16 millimeter footage
in there somewhere.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.685
ANDREW BUJALSKI: There's
that, too.

00:25:43.685 --> 00:25:44.670
There's that, too.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.140
For sure.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.362
FEMALE SPEAKER: Anyone else
have any questions?

00:25:49.362 --> 00:25:51.520
No?

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.450
You guys have anything
you want to say as

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:56.546
final remarks, or--

00:25:56.546 --> 00:25:58.760
HOUSTON KING: Well, Jacob,
Jessica, thank you for having

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.700
us screen here today.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.070
This is one of the very first
pure tech audiences we've

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:08.020
screened for, and so it was
very exciting for us.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.030
And thank all of y'all
for coming.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:15.750
And we open in mid-July at the
Film Forum, and so if you like

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.820
the film, please spread
the word and tell

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.740
people to come out.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:23.980
Andrew will be here for the
Wednesday and Thursday when we

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.810
open, and Wiley, it looks
like, is coming Friday,

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:29.120
Saturday for more Q and As.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.425
And so please come out, and you
can meet them in person.

00:26:32.425 --> 00:26:35.166
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Thank you
guys so much, yes.

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:36.910
WILEY WIGGINS: Thanks
for watching, guys.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah, thank you
guys for joining us on the

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:43.390
Hangout, too, for chilling.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.900
But yeah, thank you so much for
bringing the film here.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.240
It's also great to see ways
that people interpret--

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.290
filmmakers, especially,
interpret technology, and what

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.950
people have done in the past,
and what they're doing now.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.090
So that's rad.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.430
Thank you.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:57.296
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Thank you.

00:26:57.296 --> 00:26:57.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: All
right, guys.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.550
See you later.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.320
HOUSTON KING: See you guys.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:26:59.575
FEMALE SPEAKER: Bye.

00:26:59.575 --> 00:27:00.125
ANDREW BUJALSKI: Later.

00:27:00.125 --> 00:27:01.375
FEMALE SPEAKER: See you.
