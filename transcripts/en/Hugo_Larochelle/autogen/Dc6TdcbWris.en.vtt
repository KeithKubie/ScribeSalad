00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 in this capsule we go and translate the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.710
 notion of probability distribution 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.650
 then a probability destruction is 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.330
 simply the enumeration of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.799
 probabilities for all values 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.960
 possible that can take one or 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.199
 several random variables with 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.240
 examples here for example the distribution 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.369
 of probabilities for the reverra thouars 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.789
 spamming community with a country in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.160
 bold then in parentheses the symbol the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.489
 name of the random variable it's going to be 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.660
 enumeration of all priorities 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.579
 for all possible values ​​of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.390
 pits so when on both 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.940
 possible values 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 we will have the numbers of the 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.230
 rotten politics on the equal should the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 spam policy equals true is 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.570
 a way of presenting them that 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.800
 I use here in the form of a table 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.360
 awards a list where we insert the 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.940
 the set of marginal probabilities 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.440
 for marc arabic oratory we can have 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.239
 productive distributions on 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.000
 several random variables nas that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 if they are you or in this case what we 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 gets it's a table in two 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.080
 dimensions finally so this chart 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.670
 lens will contain all the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
 probabilities for all assignments 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 possible of everything but random variable 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.330
 because if rotten to the same wrong 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 unknown there is the need for yaya the true 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.560
 unknown 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 Galfond Spam Equals Fake Unknowns He 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.570
 there is the true power there is the true is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.850
 also known to note that the sum 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.430
 on all my enumeration all my 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.350
 table always worth is equal to 1 that's 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.119
 a property the fundamental of 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.450
 probability distributions it 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.850
 be 1 and then marked so I use 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.979
 pedro symbol for distributions that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.869
 I will use the symbol peace in 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.930
 italic for a probability 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.970
 individual and among others a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.759
 notation that I will sometimes used cp 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.680
 of spam but where peace and italics 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.490
 and dense that if I will actually designated 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.110
 a spurious probability equals x but 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.820
 for a slab in 2x that I will not 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
 specified so for a value of x 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.469
 anyway in fact so pipe of 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 spams in italics it may be 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.610
 do any part of my 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.970
 distribution of quarries 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.920
 finally and notice that the choice 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.690
 to list the priorities in a table 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.330
 or late from the minister no matter it's a 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.970
 little arbitrary did the general concept 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.950
 of a distribution it's just 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.450
 enumeration of priorities for 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.560
 all possible values ​​of but 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.690
 random variable we can have 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.660
 also distributions 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.709
 conditional or in condition on 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.080
 some random variables by 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.560
 compared to other slaughterhouse 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.780
 so for example we would have the 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.760
 distribution of spam knowing that a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 unknown there is the truth that's what there 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.550
 enumeration of spam priorities 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.380
 and galfond and rot legal true in 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.050
 both cases knowing that unknown equals 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.750
 cool then we could also not 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.030
 specify the possible value of 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.160
 unknown so we're queen a section 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.040
 conditional which in this case this is 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.810
 one of the rations of 4 probability for 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.340
 ja fake legal knowing that a known it 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.440
 must to irrigate the true knowing that 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.970
 knew there is the need to go there 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.769
 false gallons knowing that has known galls 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.260
 true to go what a true that everyone 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.480
 known fresh galls and in this case 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.850
 in my psychological kind present under the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.269
 form of a table in two dimensions 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:31.230
 each of my ranger go summit to 1 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.870
 so in fact every subset of 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.540
 associated probabilities have even variable 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.390
 have even value variables for 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.340
 which I condition must summit 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.019
 to 1 in a conditional distribution 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.150
 in other words the disruption 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.130
 conditional on knowing spam 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.959
 unknown we can see on how to do 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.209
 2.2 distribution not useful on the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.980
 spam variable one has one for the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.950
 unknown body wales need more one for 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.840
 the equal unknown body would do so we have 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.190
 two because a stranger near valence 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.380
 then obviously if unknown time 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.660
 discrete random variable of long 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.709
 would have as much distribution in front of 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.709
 the possible for unknown 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.800
 a little remark about conceptually 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.600
 comment on what we can understand 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.060
 conditional distributions in fact one 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.460
 can see them as a distribution that 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.190
 is unconditional but we have 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.220
 standardized regret differently for that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.370
 in this case we satisfy the 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.050
 summation conditions to 1 for 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.160
 different variable codes 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.780
 random on which I condition 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.380
 so for example the distribution of 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.450
 spam that everyone knows true Wales 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.940
 by definition it's actually you like it 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.150
 pro liter marginal spam is 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.430
 unknown but / a constant of 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.960
 normalization which is such that in fact I 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.790
 am going to get a little option that will 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.800
 so I'm going to arrive the variable 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.500
 random for nothing so 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.480
 but enjoy marginal spam equal 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.970
 because if you need a fairy tale 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.550
 is for nothing equals true unknown 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.570
 true galls are given here since that 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.669
 must summit at 1 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.790
 it needs alpha to match the sum 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.520
 of those two numbers there as I read here 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.900
 so finally finally got got 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.760
 my conditional distribution of 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.050
 sacha spam is known gallerey 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.570
 it's just taking the pro liter 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.240
 marginal spam and unknown there is the 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.050
 true and then read normalized for that 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.479
 rings at 1 and in case I specify 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.070
 not the value of a stranger 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.180
 Well, it's a little bit the same but 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.100
 the player two constants of 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.169
 different normalization one for the 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.169
 equal unknown body needs one for 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:45.260
 the unknown and gavray and so I have my 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.419
 two marginal probability for y is 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.479
 legal is necessary to get there the truth that I 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.540
 divide by the sum to get a 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.610
 distribution in each case the case 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.070
 here is known calfo then the quasi 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.070
 unknown in real who are 1
