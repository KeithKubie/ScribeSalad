00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.009
Every organ transplants save thousands of
lives, but what happens if your body rejects

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.660
the new organ?

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.330
Hey guys, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.350
The first successful liver transplant was
performed in 1954.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.820
Since then the techniques have improved over
the years.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.840
29,000 organ transplants are performed in
the United States every year.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.349
But it’s a tricky business.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.010
Matches are rare and rejection can get pretty
nasty.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.460
And rejections happens more often than you
might think.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.611
While some types of transplants are more successful,
like cornea transplants have a 75% success

00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:36.860
rate over ten years and five-year organ survival
rates for heart, kidney and liver transplants

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.370
is about 70 percent.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.970
But on the other hand, according to the National
Kidney Foundation, 17% of kidney transplants

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.130
fail within three years.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.440
While the survival rate of lung transplants
is surprisingly low, like 66% after three

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.560
years according to report from the Children’s
Hospital of Pittsburgh.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.780
When a person gets a new limb or organ, their
body obviously recognizes it as foreign.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.100
and like most foreign things, it tries to
get rid of it.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.840
So what happens when someone’s body rejects
a transplant?

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.640
There are three main kinds of rejection, hyperacute,
acute and chronic.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.070
Hyperacute happens almost instantaneously,
within minutes or hours, the recipient's body

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.380
starts to reject the new organ or limb.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.570
Acute rejection can occur within a few months
to a year from transplantation.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.940
Chronic rejection can happen over a few years.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.480
Basically, your body uses its immune system
to fight off any foreign invader, whether

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.910
that’s a virus or a new liver.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.830
A hugely important part of the immune system
is the Major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.090
The MHC’s main job is to differentiate between
your body’s cells and not your body’s

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.090
cells.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.990
The MHC is made up of mostly glycoproteins
on the walls of your cells.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200
They act as tags that say THIS IS ME.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.160
When a white blood cell reads that tag, it’s
like okay cool, I won't destroy you.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.320
There’s over 20 genes that code for the
MHC and over 50 variations PER GENE.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.800
So there’s a lot of combinations.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800
I mean.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.800
A LOT.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.210
This is why it’s so hard to match a donor
to a recipient.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.299
When the MHC recognizes the tags as foreign,
it starts a process that triggers destruction

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.240
of the weird scary unknown cells.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.110
Your immune system produces T-Cells which
go in and target the foreign cells and induces

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.860
Apoptosis or programed cell death.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.310
other cells and proteins get involved too,
like phagocytes which basically eat up the

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.310
dead cells.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.140
Anyways it’s a messy process.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.980
You can tell your body is rejecting an organ
in a few ways, swelling or redness, generally

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.920
feeling ill and specific kinds of organ failure.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.870
But there are ways to beat rejection.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.980
Most of it involves immunosuppressive drugs,
which can include corticosteroids such as

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.980
prednisone.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.140
While right after the transplant, the dose
of medication is pretty high, but doctors

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.730
might ween the dose over the course of a year
to a "maintenance phase".

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.670
But the thing is, most people have to be on
the medication for life, sometimes up to 12

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.100
different medications every day.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.730
And because the drugs lower their immune system,
they put themselves at risk for infections,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.630
illnesses, and even certain types of cancer.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.190
They have to forever walk a fine line between
rejection and infection.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.690
But research is being done to try to remove
the need for such drugs.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.940
Some recent research from UCSF holds some
promise.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.290
In a study published in American Journal of
Transplantation the researchers used a two-tiered

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.280
approach to tackle rejection.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.750
First they administered a drug called cyclophosphamide
to mice which had transplanted tissues.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.680
The drug effectively killed off most of those
T-cells I mentioned earlier.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.060
Then the mice received cell therapy which
grew populations of certain cells called TREGs,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.590
and like that name suggests they regulate
T cells.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.150
And with more of these cells in place, they
hold back the immune system from rejecting

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.280
the organ or limb.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.170
According to the study nearly 80% of the mice
accepted a transplant without the need for

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.060
a lifelong regimen of drugs!

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.840
And this technique proved successful in one
patient already!

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.590
So that could be pretty cool one day.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.510
But it’s clear more research is needed.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.840
Changing gears for a second, NASA is about
to fly-by Pluto and we're doing a live Google

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.690
Hangout with our space producer Ian O'Neill
and a special guest INSIDE MISSION CONTROL.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.690
It's going to be awesome.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.010
Come join on July 14 at 1pm Pacific 4pm Eastern
and RSVP on the event page for a reminder!
