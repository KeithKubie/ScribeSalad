00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.857
We just simplified 4 plus 5 i, over 2 minus 3 i, to be written instead as

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:09.963
negative 7 plus 22 i over 13. This is clearly a complex number, but it's not

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:15.434
written in the form that we usually see complex numbers written in. So the last

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:21.196
step, in modifying this initial complex number, I'd like you to write our answer

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:25.974
in the form a plus bi. So put the real part of the number here and the imaginary

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:30.372
component here. In fact I'll even write in the i for you. So you just need to

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:32.061
tell me what a and b are here.
