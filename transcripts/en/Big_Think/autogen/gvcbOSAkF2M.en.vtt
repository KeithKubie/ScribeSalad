the question about whether how to think
 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.920
the question about whether how to think
about artificial intelligence and

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930
about artificial intelligence and
 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.270
about artificial intelligence and
personhood and right start official

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280
personhood and right start official
 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.260

intelligence I think is really
 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.430
intelligence I think is really
interesting it's been teed up I think in

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440
interesting it's been teed up I think in
 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.830
interesting it's been teed up I think in
two particularly good films AI which I

two particularly good films AI which I
 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.359
two particularly good films AI which I
really like but many people don't it was

people are attracted to that argument

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450
people are attracted to that argument
 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.410
people are attracted to that argument
and say only persons can be only humans

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420
and say only persons can be only humans
 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.660
and say only persons can be only humans
can be persons right all persons are

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670
can be persons right all persons are
 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.090
can be persons right all persons are
humans now maybe not be that all humans

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100
humans now maybe not be that all humans
 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.220
humans now maybe not be that all humans
or persons but all persons are humans

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230
or persons but all persons are humans
 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.080
or persons but all persons are humans
well there's a problem with that and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090
well there's a problem with that and
 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.640
well there's a problem with that and
this is put most forcefully by the

species possibility that the species has
 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.850
species possibility that the species has
rights and not to be a patient for moral

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860

consideration the kind of things that
 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.260
consideration the kind of things that
have moral consideration on the basis of

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
have moral consideration on the basis of
 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.490
have moral consideration on the basis of
the mere fact that they're not a member

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500
the mere fact that they're not a member
 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.100
the mere fact that they're not a member
of your species he says is equivalent

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110
of your species he says is equivalent
 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.740
of your species he says is equivalent
morally to rejecting giving rights or

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750
morally to rejecting giving rights or
 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.390
morally to rejecting giving rights or

moral consideration to someone on the
 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.030
moral consideration to someone on the
basis of their race so he says

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040
basis of their race so he says
 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.210
basis of their race so he says
speciesism equals racism right and the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220
speciesism equals racism right and the
 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.640
speciesism equals racism right and the
argument is imagine that you encountered

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650
argument is imagine that you encountered
 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.080
argument is imagine that you encountered
someone who is just like you in every

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
someone who is just like you in every
 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.530
someone who is just like you in every
possible respect but it turned out they

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540
possible respect but it turned out they
 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.030
possible respect but it turned out they
actually were not a member of the human

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040
actually were not a member of the human
 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.680

they were a robot right and truly

they were a robot right and truly
exactly like you why would you be

exactly like you why would you be
 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.160
exactly like you why would you be
justified in giving them less moral

rights of persons and I think that that
