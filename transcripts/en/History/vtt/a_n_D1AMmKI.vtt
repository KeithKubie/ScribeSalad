00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.378
- A few months back, we found

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:06.172
where we build a
car for under $500

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:09.342
and then we race over
the course of two days.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:11.052
Danny agreed to
finance the team,

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:15.390
but finding a car for
under $500 is not easy.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.100
Is that a puppy on a chain?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.393
I don't see the chain.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.812
I'm leery to walk
up and find out.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:23.022
We didn't get a car,
but we did get a lemon.

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:25.150
Fortunately for us,
Shannon was able to resurrect

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.776
his old bomber car.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.153
The guy's got it running again.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.613
And then we used some
unconventional methods

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.533
to turn her into the
Count's Bloody Mess.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.617
Today is race day.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:36.494
These cars, they're awesome.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:37.787
I don't know how
some of these cars

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:39.289
are going to end up
lasting this race.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.415
Let's rock n' roll.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.041
Get in there.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.418
We may not last more than a
few laps before this thing

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.878
completely explodes.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.422
But she sure as hell looks good.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:50.049
Oh, yeah, boys.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.719
To transform the bomber
into a race ready lemon,

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.429
first, we had to
get her running.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.390
Then, make her safe,
so nobody dies.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.892
Then came the fun part.

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.144
We made this car looks
like it's covered

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:04.314
with the blood and guts of an
unlucky herd of wild animals.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:05.982
By covering her
with foam and red

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:08.943
paint to turn her into
Count's Bloody Mess.

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:13.406
All done, $500.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:14.240
So who is racing first?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.867
Shannon goes first?

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:16.826
Hell yeah.

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:18.203
We let Shannon go first.

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:20.246
Our goal should be
just finish the race.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.873
Make it, and live.

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:24.334
Hey, we'd be lucky if
we finish this damn race.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.462
Moment of truth, man, I'm the
captain, so I'm going first.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.797
I'm excited but
a little nervous.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.131
I haven't race this
thing in a while.

00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:31.424
She didn't do so good back then.

00:01:31.424 --> 00:01:32.759
And who knows what
mood she's in now?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.812
They got the green flag.

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:44.771
Go, go, go.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:46.272
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:49.234
Man, look at him go.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.236
- These tires are terrible.
- He's coming up.

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.529
There he is.
Go, go.

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:53.696
Look at that.
Look at that.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:55.657
He's getting it.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:56.699
Hey, hey, he's coming around.

00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:57.450
Careful.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.827
Careful.

00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:02.163
Oh, crap, this thing
drives like [beep]..

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:06.125
What is he doing out there?

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.126
Oh.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.086
Off ramp.

00:02:08.086 --> 00:02:09.963
Oh, no, I'm spinning out.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.426
He's coming up, there he is.

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:19.514
Whoo.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:20.974
Yes.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.934
Over 300 laps, fellows.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.019
And they were saying
we could only do 50.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.396
Every hundred laps.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.524
Hey, hey, and
Count's Bloody Mess.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:33.403
All right, let's get started.

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.739
So before we get to the
winners, occasionally, Lemons

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.326
likes to award some losers.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:43.997
So for the judges' choice,
these guys show up this weekend,

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.416
they had a great car,
somehow they kept

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.627
these terrible tires on it.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:53.339
And, of course, it's the triple
nine, Count's Bloody Mess

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.674
from [inaudible].

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.930
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.390
- Well, done, man.
- Well done.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.974
Hey, good job, man.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.737
No way.

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.740
The guys and the car, they both
made it back from the Arizona

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.074
race this weekend.

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:21.367
I've got to say,
man, I'm impressed

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:22.577
that everybody's still alive.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:25.246
I can't wait to
hear how it went.

00:03:25.246 --> 00:03:27.790
I'm trying.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.917
[laughter]

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:29.792
What's that?

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.294
Dramatic entrance there?

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:32.545
That's how I
make an exit, man.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.255
- We took fourth place.
- In our class.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.131
In our class.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.008
22nd overall, but, hey.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.593
- 22nd overall?
- Overall.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:40.470
I didn't think you guys
were going to finish.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.096
- Tada.
- What is this?

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:43.431
We got a trophy too.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.433
And that's not a
participation trophy.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.437
This was hands down the
scariest thing I've ever done

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:51.147
and at the same time
the time of my life.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.607
- Really?
- Oh, my gosh.

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:53.733
It's been an
experience, for sure.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.151
It was fun, huh?

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.611
You're fine when you're
doing it by yourself.

00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:58.404
But then you've got
10 cars around you,

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.906
you're trying to--
oh, I'm sorry.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:00.782
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:01.616
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:02.784
There is no where to go.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:03.910
It is the most
frightening thing.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.870
I'm extremely proud.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.747
I'm so glad you guys are home.

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.458
On top of it all,
get back to work.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:11.626
Let's go.

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:12.585
We've got work to do.
Let's go.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.378
Everybody--
- Really?

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.379
We just got back.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.339
We're still celebrating.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.716
Everybody get your
butts back to work, man.

00:04:18.716 --> 00:04:23.012
Man, I'm shocked this piece of
junk made it back in one piece.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.056
And it lasted the whole weekend.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.725
I'm glad the guys did well,
and they had a great time.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.644
And now it's time for
me to have a little fun.

00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.401
[laughter]

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:38.319
[inaudible]

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.780
I wanted to do that.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.990
Ooh.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.033
I think he's trying
to blow it up.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:44.993
That's awesome.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:45.994
He can't even blow it up.
