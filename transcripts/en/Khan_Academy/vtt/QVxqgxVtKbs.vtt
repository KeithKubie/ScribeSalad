00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.780
Let's say I have an
equilateral triangle where

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.472
the length of each side is 14.

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.930
So this is an
equilateral triangle.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.120
All of the sides have length 14.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.290
And inside that I have another
equilateral triangle-- right

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.980
over here-- where the length
of each of the sides is 4.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.720
Now what I'm curious
about, is the area

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.730
of the region-- let me color
this in a different color--

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.980
is the area of the region that
I'm shading in right here.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.640
So it's the area inside the
larger equilateral triangle,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.850
but outside of the smaller
equilateral triangle.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.600
So let's think about
how we would do this.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.960
And I encourage you to pause
this and try this on your own.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.870
Well the shaded
area is going to be

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.980
equal to the large
equilateral triangle's

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:58.025
area minus the area of the
small equilateral triangle.

00:01:04.294 --> 00:01:05.710
So we just have
to figure out what

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.650
the area of each of these
equilateral triangles are.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.020
And so to do it, we remember
that the area of a triangle

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.582
is equal to 1/2
base times height.

00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:19.040
But how do we figure
out the height

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.360
of an equilateral triangle?

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.310
So for example, if I have
an equilateral triangle

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.490
like this-- let me
draw it big so I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.240
can dissect it little
bit-- so I have

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.950
an equilateral
triangle like this.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.920
The length of each
of the sides are s.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.950
And I always have to
re-prove it for myself.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.220
Just because I always
forget the formula.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.560
We remember that the angles are
60 degrees, 60 degrees, and 60

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.060
degrees.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.190
They're all equal.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.870
And what I like to do to
find out the area of this,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.910
in order to figure out the
height, is I drop an altitude.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.640
So I drop an altitude
just like here,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.220
and it would split
the side in two.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.886
I know it doesn't
look like it perfectly

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:57.860
because I didn't
draw it to scale.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.312
But it would split it in two.

00:01:59.312 --> 00:02:01.597
It would form
these right angles.

00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:03.180
And what's neat about
this is I've now

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.690
split my equilateral triangle
into two 30-60-90 triangles.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.920
And that's useful
because I know the ratio

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.260
of the sides of a
30-60-90 triangle.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.120
If this is s and I've
just split this in two,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.760
this orange section right
over here is going to be s/2.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.380
This is also going to
be s/2 right over here.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260
They obviously add up to s.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.920
And then we know from
30-60-90 triangles,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.550
that the side opposite
the 60-degree side

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.530
is square root of 3
times the shortest side.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.430
So this altitude
right over here,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.420
is going to be
square root of 3s/2.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.210
And now we can figure
out a generalized formula

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.360
for the area of an
equilateral triangle.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.350
It's going to be equal
to 1/2 times the base.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.560
Well the base is going to be s.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.220
So the base is s.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.700
And the height is square
root of 3s over 2.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.990
And so this will
simplify to, let's

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.210
see we have in the numerator
we have the square root of 3s

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.360
squared over four.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.090
And now we can apply
this to figure out

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.361
the areas of each
of these triangles.

00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:23.610
So this is going to be equal
to the area of the larger

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.200
triangle, is going to be square
root of 3/4 times 14 squared.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.700
And the area of the
smaller triangle

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.810
is going to be square root
of 3/4 times 4 squared.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.450
And let's see, we could factor
out a square root of 3/4.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.160
So this is going to be equal
to square root of 3/4 times

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:52.030
14 squared minus 4 squared.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.710
Which of course we
know is to be, is 16.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.740
But now let's actually
evaluate this,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.250
to actually get a number here.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.780
And I could try to
simplify it by hand.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.330
But instead let me actually
just get my-- Actually,

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.150
let's just simplify
it by hand first.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.704
So in case you haven't
memorized your 14 times tables,

00:04:08.704 --> 00:04:09.870
we could just work that out.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.910
14 times 14, 4 times 14.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.820
4 times 4 is 16.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.470
And then carry the one.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.230
4 times 4 is 4
plus 1, so it's 56.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.180
You put a 0 right there, because
we're multiplying by 10 now.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.790
10 times 14 is 140.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.810
And so this is 196.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:41.060
So this is equal to square
root of 3/4 times 196 minus 16,

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.610
which is equal to 180.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.960
So this right over
here is equal to 180.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.370
And 180 is divisible
by 4, so this

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.480
is going to be equal to
the square root of 3 times,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.360
let's see, 180 divided
by 4 is going to be 45.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.510
So it's going to be
45 square roots of 3.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.320
Did I do that right?

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.640
180 divided by 4 times
45 is 160 plus 20.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.110
Is exactly 180.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.730
So it's 45 square roots of 3.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.450
And if I wanted to get
an approximate answer

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.990
as a decimal.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.950
So let me get my calculator out.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.420
So let's go 45 times the square
root of 3, would get us to 77.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.820
If I want to round to the
nearest hundredth, say,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.540
that's 77.94.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.450
So this is approximately
equal to 77.94 square units.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.220
The area of the shaded region.
