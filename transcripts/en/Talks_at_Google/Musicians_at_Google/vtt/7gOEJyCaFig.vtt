00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.814
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.650
MONICA WALSH: Hello,
and welcome back.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.930
Welcome back to the second
part in our series on Unlocking

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.590
Creativity, Part
Two-- Talks at Google.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.950
My name is Monica Walsh, again.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.790
And I am on the Photos,
Streams, and Sharing Team here

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.300
at Google.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.670
And it's my great
pleasure and honor

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.921
to welcome you back
to this series.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.720
We're about to have
some of the most highly

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.760
acclaimed composers, musicians,
and producers on the stage

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.460
here at Google.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.450
And I am screaming in my
skin about the sheer talent

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.720
and intellect that
we're about to see.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.280
I was backstage, and listening
to them riff was remarkable.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.030
So you're in for
a treat, everyone.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.120
Before I let them
loose on stage,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.600
I want to take some time to
introduce them and honor them

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.700
for their accomplishments.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.520
So listen up.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.560
Let's welcome back to the
stage Mr Kenny Warner.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.510
Kenny performed last night at
the San Francisco Jazz Center.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.640
And we all know him.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.954
So welcome back, Kenny.

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:35.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.350
Our next guest is most famously
known for his time in a band

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.870
called The Cure.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.440
You might have heard of them.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.530
I danced my butt off
to them in college.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.770
Roger grew up in East London,
born into a musical family,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.546
and studied art and design.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.310
He's felt a happy tension
between his love for art

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.460
and design and his
passion for music.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.290
Now in his solo career, his
work bridges both worlds,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.890
having released eight
albums, including his biggest

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.050
project which debuted in
London, called "Quieter Trees."

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.460
This is a suite
he wrote performed

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.810
for chamber orchestra based on
a painting by David Hockney.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.000
In 2011, he was asked to rejoin
The Cure to take another tour.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.940
Of course he said yes.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.770
Some of his fans
from my generation

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.380
are really excited about that.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.220
Roger continues to
pursue his solo career

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.580
alongside his work
with The Cure,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.620
and proclaims to feel
the freest he has ever

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.170
felt in his entire career.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.350
We'll hear more about
that on the panel.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.634
Let's welcome to the
stage Mr Roger O'Donnell.

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:04.415
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:06.556 --> 00:03:08.764
ROGER O'DONNELL: I don't
remember saying any of that.

00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:13.890
MONICA WALSH: As I
was getting to know

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.220
this next artist,
Terrace Martin,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.110
I noticed the way his
creative work was described--

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.060
very similar to a fine wine.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.610
He just debuted his recent
album "Velvet Portraits"

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.950
at the San Francisco
Jazz Center last night.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.110
Here is how his music has
been described-- "He never

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.840
stays in one place for too long,
yet maintains a breezy spirit."

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.460
He fuses jazz, G-rap, hip hop,
and is often the binding agent

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.380
in all of his projects.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.910
Terrace Martin is a
multi-instrumentalist, two-time

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.830
Grammy Award-winning
music producer,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.310
and is perhaps most well-known
for his producing records

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.890
of prominent artists like
Kendrick Lamar, Snoop

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.230
Dogg and Stevie
Wonder, to name a few.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.430
He is a rare genius music
producer in Los Angeles.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.970
And we are incredibly fortunate
to have him here today.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.780
Please welcome to the
stage Mr Terrace Martin.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.266
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.590
I told you.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.980
Next, Mr Philip Glass is a
world-renowned composer-pianist

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.870
whose work spans generations.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.270
There is no doubt
Philip Glass has

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.090
had a transforming presence in
our musical and intellectual

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.860
lives.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.390
In the last 25
years alone, Glass

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.190
has composed more
than 20 operas,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.690
eight symphonies,
two piano concertos,

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.950
soundtracks to films, and still
maintains his expansive solo

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.240
creations on both
piano and organ.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.120
Philip grew up in Baltimore,
studied at Juilliard,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.270
and moved to Europe, where he
trained with Nadia Boulanger

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.005
and worked closely with
the composer Ravi Shankar.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.620
Philip Glass is best known
for his repetitive structures

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.095
in music, and has developed
what some call minimalist music.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.960
When he returned to New
York in the late 60s,

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.710
he formed the Philip
Glass Ensemble,

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.210
and still performs with
that group to date.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.090
This November, Philip
Glass turns 80,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.880
and he's still going strong.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.990
He has collaborated with Paul
Simon, Yo Yo Ma, to name a few.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.120
And he still presents lectures
and performs solo keyboard

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.600
concerts around the world.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.490
In 2011, he founded the
Philip Glass Center-- home

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.180
for artists, scientists,
and conservatists

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.250
to collaborate and produce a
culture of our renewal time.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.910
Please welcome to the
stage Mr Philip Glass.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.774
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.010
And the master conductor
of this evening

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.590
is going to be Mike Hawley.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.590
And I'm going to tell you
a little bit about him

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.673
before he takes the stage.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.840
So he'll be weaving our
conversation together.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:15.450
Mike Hawley is the founder
of the EG Conference.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.990
His background is well
suited for the role

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.530
today of conductor or
facilitator of our discussion.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.890
He's an artist,
educator, researcher,

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.940
and previously a
professor at MIT.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.870
He's co-founded several
groundbreaking research

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.610
programs, including Things That
Think and Toys For Tomorrow.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.130
He was born in a
suburb of New York,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.460
studied music and
computer science at Yale,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.780
and did his doctoral
work at MIT.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.260
Mike Hawley is himself
an accomplished pianist

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:58.270
and organist, having won the
prestigious first prize in 2002

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.170
at the Van Cliburn
Foundation International

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.230
Amateur Competition.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.583
Maestro, I'll pass
the baton to you.

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:10.689
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:12.855
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Can we pull
our chairs a little more

00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:16.330
so we can see each other?

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.080
Because if I'm supposed
to be the referee,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.990
I need to know who
to throw the flag at.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.610
It's too bad you had to
bring a piano in for today.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.680
I mean, it's too bad
because there should kind of

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.510
be a piano here always.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.021
Why does it matter?

00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:34.179
I don't mean to just
drop another budget

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:35.960
item in somebody's bill.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.720
But when I was starting
NeXT with Steve Jobs,

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.350
we had a piano.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.659
We had a Bosendorfer piano in
the middle of the software lab.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.500
And meetings were sort
of like jam sessions

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.040
around an oddly shaped table.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.050
And who knew that Bud Tribble,
who ran our software group,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.610
could play every show
tune in the fake book?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.821
There was always music
bubbling in the lab.

00:08:55.821 --> 00:08:58.320
And I'm just sort of curious,
before we dive into our panel,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.900
how many of you play music?

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:01.980
How many of you?

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.160
That's pretty good.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.120
Keep your hands up.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.960
How many of you have a piano
at home and should play it

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.741
but don't?

00:09:08.741 --> 00:09:12.100
How many of you grew up
in a home with a piano?

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.890
About half, maybe.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.880
I was always struck by the
fact that in the 19th century,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.670
the piano was sort
of the internet.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.550
Every home had a piano.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.350
And the software that you used--
you'd go out to the local shop

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.200
and buy the latest whatever
by Chopin or whomever,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.430
and try it out on
your own instrument.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.790
But it has interestingly
different characteristics

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.470
from our internet, it's obvious.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.490
But still, it was sort of
the universal interface

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.260
to music starting in
the early 1800s, when

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.340
the ingredients of technology
of the time sort of converged.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.761
You had to have a cast-iron
industry to make a frame,

00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:53.760
and that made a piano
loud enough, and so forth.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.510
But every home had a piano, the
same way that every home now

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.110
has a computer and a portal out.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.230
It was a social connector-- a
very important and interesting

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.850
instrument.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.730
And that's sort of
where I wanted to begin.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.490
I want to know where
you guys all started.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.222
Did you all grow up
in musical homes?

00:10:11.222 --> 00:10:13.055
Did you all grow up in
a house with a piano?

00:10:13.055 --> 00:10:15.740
Were you playing music
from an early age?

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.919
PHILIP GLASS: Oh, yeah.

00:10:16.919 --> 00:10:18.210
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Keyboards, or--

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.393
PHILIP GLASS: Well I
started with a flute.

00:10:19.393 --> 00:10:20.500
And we were only--

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:20.990
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Started with a flute.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.406
PHILIP GLASS: We
were only allowed

00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:25.890
to do one instrument at
the time in my family.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.039
So I picked the flute and
my brother played the piano.

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.330
But I wanted to play the piano.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.660
So what I would do, I
would-- in those days,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.530
the teacher would
come to your home

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.170
and give a half-hour lesson,
probably for $5 in those days.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.440
It's quite a while ago.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.697
But so what I would do, when
my brother was taking his piano

00:10:44.697 --> 00:10:46.530
lessons, I would sit
in the room and listen.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.320
And as soon as the
teacher left, I'd

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.309
run over and play the lesson.

00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:52.100
My brother would chase
me around the house,

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.475
because he thought
I was stealing

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:56.820
his lesson, which I was.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.470
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Something
all composers learn young.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.060
PHILIP GLASS: So later
on, I've reminded him

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:08.950
about this many times-- that
I ended up being a pianist,

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.209
and partly due to, probably
due to my brother, actually.

00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:13.750
MICHAEL HAWLEY: And
Terrace, do you--

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.041
do you prefer Terrace or Terry?

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.277
We didn't get
properly acquainted.

00:11:17.277 --> 00:11:18.610
TERRACE MARTIN: Terrace is fine.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.460
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Terrace, OK.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.920
TERRACE MARTIN: But for you,
with all these wonderful

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.294
geniuses onstage, y'all can
call me whatever y'all choose

00:11:24.294 --> 00:11:25.300
to call me.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.317
It's OK.

00:11:26.317 --> 00:11:27.900
MICHAEL HAWLEY: So
you play saxophone.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.899
But how did you grow up?

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:30.470
What was it, a
musical household?

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.640
TERRACE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.220
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Did you have
keyboards around, drums?

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.500
TERRACE MARTIN: My father is
jazz musician, jazz drummer.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.810
And my mother is a jazz
pianist and jazz vocalist.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.750
So I grew up in a strong
jazz household of soul music.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:46.250
But my first instrument wasn't
the piano or the [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.840
My first instrument was
something called the MPC 3000,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.610
which is the drum machine.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:53.250
But it was.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.500
This was my first instrument.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.770
Because I grew up in
the 80s, the late 80s,

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.290
where a lot of households,
we didn't-- where I come,

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:01.780
we didn't have pianos.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.990
And the music that was
being played in that time

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.810
was all hip hop.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.620
So instead of all the younger
musicians maybe in the 50s

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.880
and 60s wanted to play pianos
and saxophones and everything,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.600
now because of hip
hop, the whole culture

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.340
shift where now younger
musicians want to say, oh,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.662
how do you do that?

00:12:19.662 --> 00:12:20.870
That's called a drum machine.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.109
So then the drum
machine replaced-- not

00:12:24.109 --> 00:12:25.650
replaced-- but the
drum machine added

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.970
on like a whole other
extension of another instrument

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.777
to a whole generation.

00:12:29.777 --> 00:12:31.360
And I come from that
generation, where

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:36.090
the drum machine and sampling
the records that everybody was

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.090
a part of, just to get
some type of information,

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:39.074
was all we had to do.

00:12:39.074 --> 00:12:40.490
So those are my
first instruments.

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.190
MICHAEL HAWLEY: When did
you take up the saxophone?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.814
TERRACE MARTIN: I
took up the saxophone

00:12:43.814 --> 00:12:51.700
in ninth grade, after I
got into a young ruffle

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:58.060
with the law in ninth
grade, eighth grade I think.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.200
And one of my neighbors
in the neighborhood

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.700
was a famous jazz drummer
named Billy Higgins.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.700
And he was a huge mentor of mine
and for the whole community.

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.100
Billy Higgins said, when
I got out of my ruffle

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.840
with the law at a
young age, he said,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.260
I'm going to take you
to go talk to my friend.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.800
And he'll understand what
you're going through.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.230
And his friend happened to be
this wonderful alto saxophonist

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.786
by the name of Jackie McLean.

00:13:24.786 --> 00:13:26.160
And Jackie McClean
said, you have

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.280
a lot of time on your hand.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.290
You need to do something
more than the drum machine.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.331
I said, what should I do?

00:13:30.331 --> 00:13:32.950
He said here, and he
gave me the saxophone.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.835
And that's how the
saxophone came into my life.

00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:37.210
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
And Roger, I know

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.170
you started young on the piano.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.780
Was it there before you were?

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.200
ROGER O'DONNELL: Yes.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:47.720
I grew up in East London in
kind of post-Victorian times,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.330
most homes had a piano.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.640
It was where everybody
would congregate

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.430
to entertain everybody else.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.510
There's no television and radio.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.910
But I was born a little
after that period.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.178
So I was born, actually,
at home next to the piano.

00:14:04.178 --> 00:14:09.290
So from the minute I could
stand, I would play it.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.240
And as we spoke
about earlier, my mom

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.030
would-- our next-door
neighbor, she

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.800
would when my mom had reached
the dining room, because she

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.560
would hear the piano
start playing when

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.580
she was cleaning the house.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.960
So I would sit underneath
and push the keys up.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.210
And then I was big
enough, I would sit on top

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.970
and push the keys down.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.102
And then my brother taught
me to play 12-bar blues.

00:14:30.102 --> 00:14:31.520
And then I had piano lessons.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.920
So it was always there.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.750
It was always in the house.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:41.055
And a lot of houses in that kind
of era of London had pianos.

00:14:41.055 --> 00:14:41.930
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Sure.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.867
ROGER O'DONNELL: It wasn't
like an expensive thing.

00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:45.700
It sounded terrible.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.949
It was completely out of tune.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.480
MICHAEL HAWLEY: And Kenny,
were your parents musical or--

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.188
KENNY WARNER: My father
was very musical,

00:14:55.188 --> 00:14:57.580
but he didn't have the
luxury of training.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.200
He had to support his
family-- step-father

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.150
and mother and children.

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.990
Then he had to support us.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.510
But he had perfect pitch.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.822
He played alto saxophone by ear.

00:15:09.822 --> 00:15:11.030
And we used to play together.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.100
And I know that whatever
I got came from him.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.950
But we didn't have a piano.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.640
Down the street,
one of my friends

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.490
was having a birthday
party, and his father

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.320
sat down and played piano.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.607
And I'd never seen one.

00:15:22.607 --> 00:15:24.690
I mean, I used to watch
on television Victor Borge

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.820
and Liberace, because they
were on TV, and Jimmy Durante--

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.550
who, by the way, way
before the Cream--

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.824
was it the Cream that break
all their instruments on stage?

00:15:34.824 --> 00:15:36.490
ROGER O'DONNELL: Jimmy
probably started.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.156
KENNY WARNER: Yeah,
but way before that,

00:15:38.156 --> 00:15:40.867
Jimmy Durante would get so
frustrated with the piano

00:15:40.867 --> 00:15:42.700
he would literally break
it till it was just

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.940
sitting on the floor.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.264
And these are the guys I
watched, and Chico Marx.

00:15:46.264 --> 00:15:47.680
Well there's a
great piano player.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.429
ROGER O'DONNELL: I
love the Marx Brothers.

00:15:49.429 --> 00:15:51.835
KENNY WARNER: But after I
saw it live, I went home

00:15:51.835 --> 00:15:52.960
and I said, get me a piano.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.335
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
How old were you?

00:15:54.335 --> 00:15:55.390
KENNY WARNER: Seven.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.820
And one of things
I said in my book

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.750
is I went and I found I could
plunk out any song I knew.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.216
And I ran into the kitchen,
and I said, hey, mom good news.

00:16:03.216 --> 00:16:04.340
I don't need piano lessons.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.631
I just figured out how to play.

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:10.550
MICHAEL HAWLEY: So
they got you a piano?

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.758
KENNY WARNER: Yeah, they did.

00:16:11.758 --> 00:16:14.040
They got a Wurlitzer--
a rent with an option

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.970
to buy should I take to it.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.380
MICHAEL HAWLEY: OK, where
were you in the birth order?

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.671
Did you have your older
brothers, younger siblings or--

00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:21.610
KENNY WARNER: I had two
very older brothers.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.400
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Wow, they still
paid enough attention to you

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.680
to get you a piano.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.440
KENNY WARNER: Well, my brothers
weren't very happy about it,

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.910
but yeah.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.890
MICHAEL HAWLEY: OK,
so full disclosure--

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.850
when I was about five
years old, we got a piano.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.660
It was the piano that my
mother had grown up playing.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.337
And like any kid,
I was drawn to it.

00:16:41.337 --> 00:16:43.170
Who could-- I mean, you
push the thing here.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:43.970
It makes sound.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:45.910
You pull your chin
up over the lid

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.479
and watch the things go up
and down as mom plays-- put

00:16:48.479 --> 00:16:49.520
your hand on the strings.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.989
Lie underneath it-- it
sounds completely different

00:16:51.989 --> 00:16:53.030
when you're on the floor.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.230
And I was sort of hooked.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.256
But I immediately
started playing by ear,

00:16:59.256 --> 00:17:00.630
picking out little
nursery tunes.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.440
My mom thought I should have
lessons, maybe go to Juilliard.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.359
My dad thought maybe he should
play sports or something.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.940
And so I got piano lessons.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.109
I had a total of four
lessons and my teacher quit.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.740
On the fourth lesson, she made
my parents sit through it.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.540
She said, now Michael,
since you obviously

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.106
didn't practice any of the
things I assigned to you,

00:17:20.106 --> 00:17:22.230
why don't you play something
that you want to play?

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.329
And I said, OK.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.730
And I had this crumbling
piece of sheet music

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.530
that I found in the
bench of our piano.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.440
It was "The Marine Corps Hymn,"
from the Halls of Montezuma.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.290
My dad was in the
Marine Corps, and so I

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.660
thought he'd appreciate this.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:34.890
I put this thing on the desk.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.431
And I started playing it with
chords and everything, which is

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:39.340
pretty good for five years old.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.680
And the teacher
threw up her hands.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.350
And she said, look, he's playing
in a completely different key

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.530
from what's written on the page.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.300
Save your money.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.830
Maybe he should take up
football or something.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.700
I was out of there, like a cork
out of a champagne bottle--

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.540
just no [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.220
And I played piano myself
through high school,

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.880
got an incredible
teacher in high school,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.830
and took off like a rocket,
and came within a whisker,

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.920
I would say, of embarking
on a professional career.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.670
I didn't go to
Curtis, but I almost

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.010
did, and then sort
of veered off.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.350
But it's always been
a-- I mention this

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.390
only because you guys are
all professional musicians.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.250
I'm an amateur musician.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:22.810
And I often wonder
how my life would

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:27.950
have gone had I punched through,
and stuck it out at Curtis.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.910
PHILIP GLASS: Well, I'm not sure
it means you are a music lover.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.250
So we're all amateurs
from that point of view.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.540
And I really
believe that's true.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.540
MICHAEL HAWLEY: What would
you do if you weren't

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.020
making a living at music?

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.710
PHILIP GLASS: I'd probably have
a hard time making a living.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.870
Actually, I didn't actually
make a living at music

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.740
until I was in my 40s.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.160
So I did all kinds
of other stuff.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.690
But I never took a
regular job, because I

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.950
was afraid of getting
trapped in the job.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:58.990
I just did day work.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.592
And I did that for a long time.

00:19:00.592 --> 00:19:03.050
MICHAEL HAWLEY: But let's talk
a little bit-- just a little

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.800
bit-- about our lives
outside of music.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.220
Because you surely
have hobbies and things

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.730
that you enjoy doing that--

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:10.980
PHILIP GLASS: I'm not so sure.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.771
MICHAEL HAWLEY: I'm
guessing you might not.

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:13.720
But some of us do.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.360
I often find things you do
outside of the day to day help

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.660
spark creativity in the sort
of mainstream of your life.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.890
You know what I'm saying?

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.962
I mean, if you're a cook,
or if you're a camper--

00:19:26.962 --> 00:19:28.670
PHILIP GLASS: I got
through collaborating

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.490
with other people-- with
dancers, with filmmakers.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.510
I had the music
spark, but I always

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.440
thought, I work with people
who weren't musicians.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.030
And then eventually, I began
working with other musicians

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.800
from-- people from Africa,
from China, from Australia,

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.770
from Mexico.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.416
So the encounters
with other artists,

00:19:52.416 --> 00:19:57.036
other performers-- that was
what was stimulating to me.

00:19:57.036 --> 00:19:58.410
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Now Roger, I know

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.170
you're heavily into Moog
synthesizers and things.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.084
So you have to be a
part-time electronics hacker.

00:20:04.084 --> 00:20:05.750
ROGER O'DONNELL: No,
I have other people

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.222
to fiddle with
those things for me.

00:20:07.222 --> 00:20:09.430
MICHAEL HAWLEY: What do you
do when the stuff breaks?

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.971
ROGER O'DONNELL:
Get somebody fix it.

00:20:12.947 --> 00:20:15.030
MICHAEL HAWLEY: You're not
writing code, software?

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.260
ROGER O'DONNELL: Oh, no, no, no.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.700
That stuff gives me a headache.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.060
I speak to-- I, obviously,
use a lot of software.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.320
And I speak to those guys.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.630
And they kind of say,
can you make it do this?

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:31.770
And they're like, yeah.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.840
And then you're like,
wow, that's cool.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.010
And also, instrument
manufacturers--

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.950
I'm very good friends with
the people at Moog and Cyril,

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:41.890
the main designer there.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:45.990
And he knows things that I would
never know about electronics.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.630
And when he says, I can make
it do this, I'm, like, really?

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.230
It's not anything I
would ever dream of.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.700
All I can do is make music.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.140
I can't make the instruments.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.570
I can tell him what
I'd like it to do,

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.970
but the things that they
give us are amazing.

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:06.140
When Bob started-- and all
of those guys-- Dave Smith,

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.250
Tom Oberheim-- all of those
early guys, when they started

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.340
making synthesizers and
samplers-- what Terrace was

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:17.330
saying about sampling--
it just opened

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.470
a whole new world for all of
us, and allowed us to-- I mean,

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.190
you can't compare it to
any other kind of art.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.480
If you think of a
painter being given

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:32.822
the kind of different tools
that we were given as musicians,

00:21:32.822 --> 00:21:36.100
it just opens up a
whole new world to you.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.953
When you sit at a
Moog synthesizer,

00:21:37.953 --> 00:21:41.065
and you can create
the sounds, there's

00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:43.700
no other instrument
you can do that with.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.750
So you're creating the
colors that you can then

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.366
paint the music with.

00:21:48.366 --> 00:21:50.500
So I don't know what to do.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.490
I just know how
to twiddle knobs.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:53.990
MICHAEL HAWLEY: But
it's interesting

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.156
what you say about painters.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:01.230
I was talking to a friend
about the early Impressionists

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.950
like Monet.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.342
We often forget what the
enabling technologies

00:22:05.342 --> 00:22:06.050
were at the time.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:07.190
His version of a synthesizer--

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:08.564
ROGER O'DONNELL:
Yeah, was paint.

00:22:08.564 --> 00:22:10.160
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
--was paint in tubes.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.970
That was a major breakthrough.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.130
You didn't have to grind
the paint in your studio.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.088
It meant you could take
a little box of paints,

00:22:16.088 --> 00:22:19.440
go out, squirt it on a little
palette, paint in open air,

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.760
and capture the same
sort of impression

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.510
that an early
photographer might get.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.676
ROGER O'DONNELL: Yeah,
OK, you having said that,

00:22:25.676 --> 00:22:29.130
as Monica referenced earlier, I
am a huge fan of David Hockney.

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.560
And every time some new
technology comes along,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.880
he embraces it.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.580
And he takes his
art somewhere else.

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.180
So I guess they do have the
parallel with technology

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.370
that we've had.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.600
But the huge
advances in keyboards

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.710
was amazing for me, from the
'70s through to the-- well,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.710
it's still going on.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:51.160
It's kind of micro.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.839
MICHAEL HAWLEY: As
I said, Kenny, Roger

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:54.880
kind of grew up at the
perfect moment in history,

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.090
when all these little devices
and contraptions were evolving

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.120
by leaps and bounds.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.060
How did you manage to avoid that
and stick with just a piano?

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.944
KENNY WARNER: Well, it
was very intimidating.

00:23:04.944 --> 00:23:06.110
I didn't manage to avoid it.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:10.560
I managed couldn't
manage to embrace it.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.430
Of course, the piano is really
one of the first synthesizers

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.090
in music.

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:14.580
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Sure.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.205
KENNY WARNER: You've
got three strings.

00:23:16.205 --> 00:23:16.999
That's signal.

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:19.040
And then when they put
the felt on-- before that,

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.060
it was like the harpsichord.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.760
It was just wood on metal.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.490
But when you put a felt
on there, that's a filter.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.900
So I mean really, arguably, the
piano is the first synthesizer.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.640
I got into it way later.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.070
I mean, when I was in school, I
took the ARP-2600-- the course.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.890
And I'm going, like, oh, my god,
this is like a science fiction

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:40.690
movie.

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.392
I wasn't thinking
that way at all.

00:23:42.392 --> 00:23:43.850
I'm only a little
better at it now.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.740
I, too, look for-- I get
sounds any way I can.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:52.430
And then I like to stay on this
side of the creative side, what

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.590
the sound does to me.

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:55.870
I can't switch back and
forth to technical side.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.460
It kind of kills what
am I going to write now.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.830
It takes too much
of my-- that's me.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.500
There's some people, like
Terrace, that thrive on that.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.870
And I actually
really admire that.

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:09.360
MICHAEL HAWLEY: So, but
do you write or design

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.050
scores for multiple instruments?

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:13.670
Or is it almost entirely
improvisational for you?

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:15.830
KENNY WARNER: Well, I
compose on the computer,

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.840
because I'm left-handed.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.970
And I have lousy handwriting.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.470
And it was too much work.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.225
Lefties, when they
would do copy work,

00:24:22.225 --> 00:24:23.850
they used to have a
technique-- and you

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:26.780
might remember this-- they
used to use a six-inch ruler.

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.530
And they put nickels
on both sides,

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.650
so that the lefty could
rest his hand on the ruler.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:36.530
Because every time you wrote,
you kept smudging everything.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.782
And it was just
painful to me to write.

00:24:38.782 --> 00:24:40.990
When the computer came, that
was just perfect for me.

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.260
Note, note value, note, quarter
note, note, eighth note, chord,

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.460
eighth note.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.196
And then I went
hog wild with it.

00:24:48.196 --> 00:24:49.320
And I wrote a lot of music.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.285
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Finale or
Sibelius or something else?

00:24:51.285 --> 00:24:52.600
KENNY WARNER: It
started with Finale.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.460
And then someone convinced
me to do Sibelius.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:55.260
MICHAEL HAWLEY: That's for
the techies in the room.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.510
KENNY WARNER: And then I
decided to go back to Finale.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:59.740
Because it's funny
how your brain works.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.100
With Finale, you choose
a note, and then you

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.280
choose a note value.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.880
With Sibelius, you have
to choose the note value.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.780
Then you choose the note.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.530
Because otherwise,
it'll do the note value

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.060
of the previous note.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.815
And I just could
not think that way.

00:25:12.815 --> 00:25:13.606
It was [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:13.606 --> 00:25:15.020
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Terrace,
do you write music down?

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.010
TERRACE MARTIN: I
write music down.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.725
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Using
the same sort of stuff?

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:18.280
TERRACE MARTIN: No.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.760
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Pen and paper?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.610
TERRACE MARTIN:
Pencil and paper.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.565
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Pencil
and paper-- pencil

00:25:21.565 --> 00:25:22.960
is probably a better strategy.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.810
TERRACE MARTIN: Well, just--
and I've always wrote music.

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.150
I grew up in a strong
jazz, bring the chart

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.700
so we can rehearse things.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.300
So I've been writing for years.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.960
But just recently, I started
playing with Herbie Hancock.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.690
And I was trying to tell
him-- not tell him anything.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:50.220
I was suggesting to
him, look-- he said,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.090
yeah, we're doing a new concert
and it's going to be me,

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.160
you, Vinnie Colaiuta.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.320
I said, oh, cool, let's play
all these songs that I grew up

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.680
listening to you-- your songs.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.930
But I have to remember as a
fan-- Herbie hasn't played

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.780
these songs since he
recorded these songs,

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.300
like a lot of these songs.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.787
So this was the first time.

00:26:08.787 --> 00:26:10.870
I always write charts, but
this was the first time

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.984
it was charts with pressure.

00:26:12.984 --> 00:26:14.400
Because I have to
write his songs.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.530
I have to transcribe his
songs, write them back.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.360
So I remember the
first day of rehearsal,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.960
going in a couple of weeks ago,
and I'm passing out the charts.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.670
But I didn't give
Vinnie Colaiuta a chart.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.670
And he said, hey,
where's my chart?

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:31.050
And I was, like, well, here.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.640
It's just a chord.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.020
I'll take it.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.850
And I said, OK.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.760
You know, with writing music,
and I wrote a lot of it

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.560
on the way there.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.390
And I actually did
it two nights before.

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.410
So you kind of don't know.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.500
I'm sure you guys know.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.117
But me, I kind of
don't know exactly.

00:26:50.117 --> 00:26:50.950
I have to make sure.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.090
I have to hear what
they're going to play.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.720
And with jazz, we
have to understand

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:59.020
all the rules to be able to
break the rules in that format.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.410
So writing that chart
was the-- that's

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.520
when I realized
I made a mistake.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.610
And Herbie said-- you know you
could get Finale and a program

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:10.778
to do this now.

00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:16.320
So now I'm actually
going to get--

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.319
and this has reminded
me-- I have to get Finale.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:23.919
MICHAEL HAWLEY: It's
interesting about Herbie--

00:27:23.919 --> 00:27:25.960
we were e-mailing last
week about something else.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.980
There was a young,
super-talented pianist

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.240
named Joey Alexander, who
I think has played here

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.950
at Google, if I'm not mistaken.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:35.500
Any of you heard Joey Alexander?

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.510
Some hands?

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:38.440
He's like the Mozart of jazz.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.680
Once a century, you get an--

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.680
TERRACE MARTIN: Awesome.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.010
MICHAEL HAWLEY: --otherworldly
talent like this.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.546
And I was talking with Joey
and his family saying, well,

00:27:45.546 --> 00:27:47.170
have you thought
about going to school?

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.540
And the answer was,
well, yeah, but you

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.140
know Herbie dropped out.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.930
And it's not my place to advise.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:59.170
In order to drop out,
first you have to drop in.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.490
And not only did he
drop in-- he dropped in

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:06.415
and he finished a degree
in electrical engineering.

00:28:06.415 --> 00:28:08.790
TERRACE MARTIN: Oh, that's
right, electrical engineering.

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.980
MICHAEL HAWLEY: He was
interested in computers.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.780
And lo and behold,
10 years later

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.580
when a sort of fusion
jazz movement gets going,

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.830
he's right in the thick of it.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.288
Because he's interested in
these little things, and gizmos,

00:28:18.288 --> 00:28:20.090
and gadgets, software, hardware.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.819
He's got--

00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:22.610
TERRACE MARTIN: And he
always thinks ahead.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.340
He's not-- and this
is something I'm

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.890
sure nobody is-- he's
not in no particular box.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.890
And I think that's the
big thing with creativity

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.160
is just to burn the box.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.820
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Philip in your world,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.167
are you kind of a computer guy?

00:28:38.167 --> 00:28:40.250
What are the ingredients,
the tools of your trade?

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:41.060
PHILIP GLASS: Pencil and paper.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:41.960
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Pencil and paper.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.460
PHILIP GLASS: Actually, what
happened, the big crisis for me

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.702
was when the people
stopped making music paper.

00:28:48.702 --> 00:28:49.910
MICHAEL HAWLEY: They stopped?

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.620
PHILIP GLASS: Yes.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.760
MICHAEL HAWLEY: So you
had to get a computer

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.960
to print your own music paper?

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.560
PHILIP GLASS: No, I just
found a printer, found someone

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.350
to do it for me.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.560
But for years, I
mean, there were

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.840
three or four different
places in New York

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.310
where I could go buy paper with
tints, and different sizes.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.850
And it was part of the fun,
was going and buying the paper.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.340
And they all went
out of business.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.502
Then for a while, there was
a company called Judy Green.

00:29:13.502 --> 00:29:15.960
I don't know who-- I don't
think Judy Green really existed.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.060
But it was a company
in LA, and they

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.290
would send it to you overnight.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:24.255
But then she disappeared,
or that disappeared.

00:29:24.255 --> 00:29:25.630
And then I thought,
well, maybe I

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:29.900
can find-- I would just find
the printer or something.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.630
And then someone who worked
with me said, no, no.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.700
We'll just get someone.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.400
Just tell me what you want.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.070
And I could get paper
made for me, custom made.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.530
Didn't cost any more
than the other paper did.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.370
But I have all kinds.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.490
And it helps for me,
believe it or not,

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:49.880
it helps to have
the right paper.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.700
I mean, everybody has
their own little--

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.408
and I have to have
the right pencil, too.

00:29:53.408 --> 00:29:55.160
You know that kind of thing.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.140
I don't know how that
translates into computers,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.060
but I have to have--
my tools are--

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.419
I'm very familiar with them.

00:30:04.419 --> 00:30:06.710
MICHAEL HAWLEY: So if we were
to walk into your studio,

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.540
aside from the paper, and
pencils, and presumably

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.350
a pencil sharpener,
what else is there?

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.810
Is there a keyboard?

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:12.800
PHILIP GLASS: A big piano.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.440
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
You've got a piano.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:13.650
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah, sure.

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.480
MICHAEL HAWLEY: You
compose at the keyboard?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.980
A little bit, or
you work out ideas?

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.650
PHILIP GLASS:
Especially some things--

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.080
with piano music for sure.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.190
But the big pieces like
the operas and symphony,

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.850
you can't really
play it on the piano.

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.390
You can play parts of it.

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.240
So what you can do, you
can play part of it.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.450
And you have to
imagine the other part.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.890
I don't work--
then, in my studio,

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:40.520
I have-- that's
what I have at home.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.510
I have an office
downtown, where there

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.950
are some young fellows
there who take the music,

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:48.340
and they put it
in their computer.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.554
And then we can
make changes, and we

00:30:50.554 --> 00:30:52.470
can make corrections,
and all kinds of things.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:53.859
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Print out parts.

00:30:53.859 --> 00:30:55.400
PHILIP GLASS: All
that has to happen.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.120
All the music preparation
has to happen.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.320
But in fact-- now, here's
an interesting thing.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.800
When someone will
call and say, I'm

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.050
playing this piece of yours,
and look at this measure,

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:06.591
and so forth.

00:31:06.591 --> 00:31:08.290
And is this an E or an F?

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.864
And I say, I have no idea.

00:31:09.864 --> 00:31:11.530
And they say, well,
didn't you write it?

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:15.650
And I said, are you sure?

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.800
But I've written so much music,
I obviously don't remember it.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.800
But what I do know-- I learned
to do this a long time ago--

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.270
I save the manuscript.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.020
I save the first sketch.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:30.350
And I've learned to do this.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:34.850
I write on the page,
Page 3, Page 4,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.640
and the name of the piece, too.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.040
So I can find-- so when I have
to find out is it an E or an F,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.780
I go and take a look.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.130
Because I don't remember
most of the time.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.500
And it could be, very often
it could be either one.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:52.250
You know how that can
be, or maybe an F sharp.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.150
But that's about it.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:55.399
MICHAEL HAWLEY: But you have
to be practical about it.

00:31:55.399 --> 00:31:56.900
PHILIP GLASS: Well
I found out-- so

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.690
what we have in my
studio, which so I

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.880
have other people
doing the preparation

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.170
and doing the computer stuff.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:12.190
But what we have is that the
MS means the manuscript--

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.940
the MS is always right.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.750
No, it's not only right.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.960
But it's pretty
much always right.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.210
In other words, if I have
to go back to a piece of two

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.270
or three years ago, and
look at some measure

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.896
that I had forgotten
I'd even written--

00:32:26.896 --> 00:32:28.270
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
All bets are off.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.110
PHILIP GLASS: I'd
take a look at the MS.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.910
And now, that doesn't mean
I always keep it that way.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.970
I say maybe I should-- maybe
it is an E or something.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:41.560
But the great thing is--
there's another good thing

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:44.890
about writing music
on music paper.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.970
I have manuscripts of
everything I've written.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.720
And most of my friends
just have files.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.630
Now, that's OK, except you
can't sell the files to anybody.

00:32:57.179 --> 00:32:59.762
ROGER O'DONNELL: I was going to
say, that's a good investment.

00:32:59.762 --> 00:33:01.700
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Autographs.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.257
Kenny, what's in your studio?

00:33:03.257 --> 00:33:04.090
KENNY WERNER: Well--

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:04.940
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Your ideal studio?

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.200
KENNY WERNER: Computer,
big-- my ideal studio?

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.570
I don't even know.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:13.290
Computer, large screen-- I
like manuscript on the screen.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:15.450
So I had to wait for
the 32-inch screen

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:18.940
to be invented so that I
could see the whole score.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.520
And a beautiful
piano, set of drums,

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:28.410
because I sometimes like to
come at it from the drums.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:32.620
Netflix, so that I
don't have to just sit

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:34.807
there doing music all day.

00:33:34.807 --> 00:33:36.390
MICHAEL HAWLEY: I
know it's important.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:38.016
Roger what's in your--

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:38.328
ROGER O'DONNELL:
Well, I was just

00:33:38.328 --> 00:33:39.869
going to say about
manuscript paper--

00:33:39.869 --> 00:33:42.220
because in the rock
world, we don't use it.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.290
And one thing that
our accountant always

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.990
claims for us every year
is for manuscript paper,

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.786
because he thinks it's
what musicians use.

00:33:50.786 --> 00:33:52.910
So you say, what have you
claimed for us this year?

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.120
Well, I put down manuscript
paper and layout.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.470
And we all look at him
and go, we don't even

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.500
know what it looks like.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:00.073
MICHAEL HAWLEY: But you must
write on something-- backs

00:34:00.073 --> 00:34:01.372
of envelopes, or?

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:03.990
ROGER O'DONNELL: No,
well, I play into logic.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.010
I use logic.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.286
I just play into it.

00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:10.330
And I use the Vienna
Symphony Library of samples

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.760
for composing with.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.759
And I just-- because I'm
not a trained musician,

00:34:13.759 --> 00:34:20.150
I don't-- I need the inspiration
of hearing what I'm writing in.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.820
So when I hear it back--
and the better it sounds,

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.070
that sample library
is so incredible

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.929
that it just inspires
you to add parts and put

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.489
other instruments in.

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.409
But my studio
revolves completely

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:37.860
around my Mac, and my
screen, and an input.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.600
I've got a way to
keyboard a Kawai, that's

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.449
this virtual piano.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.469
It's really good.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:47.830
It's got the action
of a grand piano.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.960
I have a piano in the house,
but I don't record with it.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:59.890
I use Ivory-- the piano
sample, which is amazing.

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:04.130
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Let's talk about
the extra-musical influences

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.910
and impacts, like dance,
and movies, and things.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.188
Well, talk about your
discovery of dance.

00:35:14.188 --> 00:35:19.162
ROGER O'DONNELL: Well, he
was talking earlier about--

00:35:19.162 --> 00:35:20.870
Philip was saying
backstage that we don't

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.650
get to talk very often
to other musicians,

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.370
or we don't get to talk
to people from different--

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.760
because we're always
doing our own thing.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.560
And actually, I find
more inspiration

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.990
from talking to other
disciplines, other artists,

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:39.060
visual artists,
dancers, writers,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.680
than I do from
talking to musicians.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.690
That may be the rock and the
not generally very inspiring

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.330
musicians.

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.370
But when you talk to any artist
that's passionate about what

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.250
they do, inspires me.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.640
And most recently,
it's been in dance.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.570
I saw my first ballet
four or five years ago.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.880
And since then, I
can't write music

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.960
without thinking about dance.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.360
And it's such a natural
combination to me,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.070
that music makes people dance,
that it's a natural thing

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.820
to do when you write.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.400
And Terrace does a lot
in the dance world.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.630
So I'm sure he understands and
knows where I'm coming from.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.700
It's just the feeling of having
somebody dance to something

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.130
that you've created.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.640
I recently, just
before Christmas,

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.110
performed one scene
of an upcoming ballet

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.490
in Moscow, at the
Kremlin palace.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.829
And we were in rehearsals in
the Bolshoi with the two--

00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:38.120
MICHAEL HAWLEY: OK, wait, wait.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.830
Stop right there.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:43.950
I mean-- mind-blowing, to spend
so many years as a keyboard

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.067
player in a rock band.

00:36:45.067 --> 00:36:46.650
ROGER O'DONNELL:
I've been very lucky.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:47.590
MICHAEL HAWLEY: And
then just casually

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:50.152
write a ballet that's being
performed with the Bolshoi

00:36:50.152 --> 00:36:51.600
at the Kremlin--

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.300
ROGER O'DONNELL: I don't know.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.400
Obviously, I've been
very lucky to be

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.260
accepted into different
worlds that I go into.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.470
And I think it's to
do with the passion

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.980
that you take with
you for your music.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.540
And it's always interpretable
by other people with passion.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.750
So back to the
rehearsal-- so we're

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.030
in the main rehearsal
room in the Bolshoi,

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:20.290
where incredible ballet
has been created.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.600
And we were rehearsing.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.840
I was playing piano
with four cellos.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.100
And there were two dancers.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.880
And we did a run through.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.230
And then we stopped for a break.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:32.540
And then I was rehearsing
a piece with the cellos.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.720
They were all Russian.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.670
They could speak English, and
they were all called Masha.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:39.390
But I know how to count
to four in Russian now,

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.520
so it's quite useful.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.480
So I said, let's just
go over this piece.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.190
So we started to play it.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.460
And the dancer, who's
also called Masha,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:51.310
got up and started
dancing-- just naturally got

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.970
up and started dancing
to what we're doing.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:58.730
And that was such an
incredible feeling to do that.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.040
So that's the thing that
I love at the moment.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.360
But it's about passion.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.270
And when a young musician
comes up to me now,

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.585
and they ask for
advice, and we all

00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:13.270
know how difficult
it is right now,

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.285
I tell them that if
they don't have passion

00:38:15.285 --> 00:38:17.410
about what they're doing,
then they should probably

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:18.660
find something else.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.910
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Terrace,
have you tried things outside

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:26.010
of, say, jazz clubs and movies,
or other uses for music,

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.636
so to speak?

00:38:26.636 --> 00:38:27.761
TERRACE MARTIN: Definitely.

00:38:27.761 --> 00:38:31.210
Once again, for me being
a product of hip hop,

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:35.080
the whole culture-- hip hop is
one of the most accepting art

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.440
form of everything coming
into one, whether it's

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.310
rock, classical, jazz or
any-- we accept everybody.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:44.980
We believe everybody
is one, definitely.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.040
And also, through hip hop--
hip hop is not in music.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.940
It is not a color.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:53.430
It's just a thing.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.474
It's a thing that we
all could be a part of.

00:38:55.474 --> 00:39:00.090
And when you're a product
of such a strong culture

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.626
like that, you're involved.

00:39:01.626 --> 00:39:03.500
And you're inspired by
the people around you.

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.760
Like my music, maybe in my
earlier years of playing music,

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.270
it was inspired by a
lot of other musicians--

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:16.160
John Coltrane, Pete Rock, Dr.
Dre, Lenny Kravitz, Snoop.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.170
It was inspired by so
many different things.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:22.460
But now, as I've gotten
older and I live life,

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:26.600
I'm really more inspired by
life more than music right now.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.090
So I find joy into meeting
people, getting to know people,

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.220
shaking everybody's hand,
seeing what you're about,

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.227
what you're about.

00:39:34.227 --> 00:39:35.310
What are you turned on by?

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.750
Especially children-- especially
children, because they

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.849
are the most honest.

00:39:38.849 --> 00:39:40.890
If they don't like your
music, they're like this.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:47.380
I just missed a
year writing this.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.020
And you know what?

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.980
Children, especially
young ones, they

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.101
don't know terms like hip
hop, classical, jazz, rock,

00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:57.600
anything.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.280
They just know what makes them
dance and that feels good.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:00.870
MICHAEL HAWLEY: That's right.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.750
TERRACE MARTIN: So going back
to dance, and I said last night,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:06.820
I believe the heart
is the first drum.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.997
And I believe dance is
the first form of anything

00:40:09.997 --> 00:40:11.830
that music can really
make you kind of move.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.550
Everybody in here,
when you hear music,

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.675
the first impulse is to
dance, whether it's bobbing

00:40:15.675 --> 00:40:18.020
your head or that situation.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:21.039
And even when somebody walks
to me, I see dance in that.

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:22.080
You know what I'm saying?

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.920
That's why I'm inspired
by people living.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.420
I'd rather play, instead of
how the bass line sounds,

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.050
I'd rather play how that
person is taking that picture,

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:32.930
sitting like that.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:37.850
And I'd rather play the music
that-- I don't know if that

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.190
makes sense-- but feels.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.750
You got me?

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:44.220
Is that a better shot of me?

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.840
But I'd rather play what is
the soundtrack to his life?

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.040
What's the soundtrack
of her life?

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.150
What's the soundtrack
of your life?

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.840
That's more what I'm into.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:41:00.930
So with me, as long as
I stay inspired by that,

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:02.500
I'll never run out of ideas.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:05.410
Because I'm always inspired
by life instead of something

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:07.090
that's playing on the radio.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:13.850
I'm so inspired by sitting
here, if I got his number,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.174
I will call him 30 times
a day-- 30 times a day.

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:19.090
ROGER O'DONNELL: You're
not getting my number.

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:20.860
TERRACE MARTIN: 30 times a
day, because you do keyboards.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.901
You know what I'm saying?

00:41:21.901 --> 00:41:23.209
So that's just the whole--

00:41:23.209 --> 00:41:24.750
ROGER O'DONNELL:
You know what you're

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.880
saying about when you
start, and you're listening,

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.015
you've got all of
these influences coming

00:41:30.015 --> 00:41:32.140
through you, like when
you're talking about Herbie.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.540
When I started
playing Fender Rhodes,

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.370
I learned every
one of his solos,

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:40.940
from "Headhunters,"
"Thrust," that whole period.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.960
And it's that moment
when you become yourself,

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.520
when Philip said, when
he sits at the piano,

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.820
and it sounds like him,
that's a key moment of when

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:56.030
you-- everything that's gone
into you comes out as you.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.970
And it's simple.

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:58.361
And that we pass that on.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.430
MICHAEL HAWLEY: What
happens when you get stuck?

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.150
What do you do to get unstuck?

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.550
Or do you never get stuck
trying to work out a tune?

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:13.880
PHILIP GLASS: I don't
have time to get stuck.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.790
I just keep going.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.470
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Too much pressure.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.070
PHILIP GLASS: I just keep going.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:23.720
Sometimes, I can throw
things away for a day.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.190
I've thrown away enough stuff.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:30.040
But it was stuff I had to
write down to throw it away,

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.080
if you know what I mean.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:36.710
The thing that happens to
me-- I'm a little bit older

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:42.800
than some of you guys here-- but
the interesting thing happens

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.400
as part of the process
of aging, really, I

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.230
begin to hear differently.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:51.080
I'm hearing differently
now than I did before.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.580
That's changing the music.

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.940
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Differently how?

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.270
PHILIP GLASS: I hear
different things.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:57.787
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Like--

00:42:57.787 --> 00:42:58.620
PHILIP GLASS: Notes.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.869
What do you want to call them?

00:42:59.869 --> 00:43:02.220
I mean, I hear different music.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:11.030
But for me, let's say that
dancing is about moving.

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.360
Painting is about seeing.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.800
Poetry is about
actually speaking.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:18.470
Music is about hearing.

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.590
Most of the time, I'm
listening to music.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:25.500
I'm trying to figure out how
the hell to write it down.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.510
The hardest part is
writing down what I hear.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.390
Because you look, and say,
is that what I really heard?

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.740
Do you go through that?

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:39.137
KENNY WERNER: Well, when I
get stuck, I just walk away.

00:43:39.137 --> 00:43:40.970
PHILIP GLASS: That's
probably more sensible.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:45.007
KENNY WERNER: Well, I mean, a
lot of people would say that.

00:43:45.007 --> 00:43:46.840
And then I come back,
and go, oh, of course,

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.870
I should do that.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:50.409
Like next morning, it's--
have you ever had that?

00:43:50.409 --> 00:43:52.450
You take a break, and come
back, and it's obvious

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:53.310
what to do next?

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:55.270
PHILIP GLASS: I have a
completely different problem.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:56.936
And people who think
they know my music,

00:43:56.936 --> 00:43:58.569
and I send them new piece.

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:01.110
And they say, well, there are
a lot of mistakes in the music.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.720
I say I'm not sure.

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.390
And so we go over the score.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.230
And it turns out they
say, that can't be a G.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.810
And I say, please,
play the G. Play it.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.980
And just the other
day, a friend of mine

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.290
was conducting a piece for
two pianos and an orchestra.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.880
And he hadn't had
a rehearsal yet.

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.750
He said, it's too over-written.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:25.050
It's too heavy.

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:26.290
I said, I know.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.320
I'm hearing it that way.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.020
I'm hearing very
thick music now.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:30.940
He said, no, no,
no, it's too much.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.170
So he called me the next day.

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.930
And he said, well,
I tried it your way.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.484
It sounded better.

00:44:36.484 --> 00:44:39.130
So he said-- and
he never had ever

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:42.090
admitted that he could-- before
that he would say that no, no,

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:42.590
no.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.580
He knew what the right notes
were, and that I didn't.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.180
But now he's starting to
say, well, you were right

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:48.930
and I wasn't that.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:53.630
I was really amazed that
he-- but I'm hearing things

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:54.940
differently than I did.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.300
And with luck, you'll
live long enough so

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.200
that will start to happen.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:00.950
According to
neurologists, people

00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:05.020
say the brain-- the brain
continues to evolve.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:05.990
Maybe it's devolving.

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.720
I don't know.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:08.150
But it's changing.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:15.930
The structure of the brain--
we're still getting new ideas.

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:21.829
And what that translates into
is that you hear differently.

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:22.870
It's the damnedest thing.

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.110
You hear, you actually
hear differently.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.442
ROGER O'DONNELL: The
thing that you said about

00:45:27.442 --> 00:45:30.830
whether you can translate
what you hear in your head

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:31.622
to what comes out--

00:45:31.622 --> 00:45:33.205
PHILIP GLASS: That's
the hardest part.

00:45:33.205 --> 00:45:35.750
ROGER O'DONNELL: That's an
incredibly difficult thing.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:36.541
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah.

00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.800
ROGER O'DONNELL:
And that-- something

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.220
is this big when you
hear it in your head.

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:44.100
And it has to come
like this to get out so

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.960
that somebody else can hear it.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.970
And when it's like
that, it's incredible.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.590
When it gets to that,
let's hope it's still good,

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.049
but it's never as good as that.

00:45:54.049 --> 00:45:55.840
KENNY WERNER: I do it
a little differently,

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.614
because I cannot for the life
of me plan out, hear something,

00:45:58.614 --> 00:46:00.280
and say, oh, let me
try to capture that.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.900
So what I do is, I
throw stuff out there.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:04.520
And some people start writing.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.395
And then they say, let
me see if I can create

00:46:06.395 --> 00:46:08.040
the illusion of chaos.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.120
So I start with chaos.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.830
And then I keep
pulling things out

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:14.490
until it sounds like there's
a system that I might

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.577
have thought about all along.

00:46:16.577 --> 00:46:18.660
PHILIP GLASS: You've got
it figured out real good.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:21.460
KENNY WERNER: Oh, well it's
the only way I can do it.

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.690
Some would say you
have to tell a story.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.856
First of all, you didn't
ask me what's my influence.

00:46:25.856 --> 00:46:28.500
My biggest influence
is movies hands down.

00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:30.130
Every chord has an emotion.

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.670
You know, you wanted
people to touch the piano.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.120
You know, for example,
this is like--

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.402
and I've watched so many movies.

00:46:38.402 --> 00:46:39.875
[PLAYING PIANO]

00:46:39.875 --> 00:46:40.590
This is warmth.

00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:43.020
This is nobility.

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:52.720
Now it's a little bit of doubt.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.994
You know?

00:46:53.994 --> 00:46:55.410
And now it's freedom.

00:46:58.242 --> 00:47:00.300
But not for too long.

00:47:03.172 --> 00:47:05.720
And so on and so forth.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.660
When I'm thinking movies,
I can really play.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:09.630
When I'm thinking piano,
I can't play at all.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:11.005
PHILIP GLASS: This
is a man who's

00:47:11.005 --> 00:47:12.536
made friends with the piano.

00:47:12.536 --> 00:47:15.596
And I've never
been that friendly.

00:47:15.596 --> 00:47:17.220
To me, it's always
been I have to work.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.640
I still work at
playing the piano.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.320
I'm still practicing.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.370
KENNY WERNER:
That's the problem.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.180
No, can I tell
you a funny story?

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:25.600
PHILIP GLASS: Please.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.808
KENNY WERNER: Walter Norris
was a great piano player.

00:47:27.808 --> 00:47:29.999
He passed away a years
ago with a heart attack.

00:47:29.999 --> 00:47:32.290
And he was one of these guys,
these chronic practicers.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:34.790
They practice all day,
got carpal tunnel.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:36.930
PHILIP GLASS: I don't
practice all day.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.889
KENNY WERNER: Well, so he
had his first heart attack.

00:47:39.889 --> 00:47:41.680
And the doctor told
him-- we were friends--

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.770
and doc told him, you could
only practice 15 minutes a day.

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:47.690
So Walter lived in Berlin.

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:48.330
He e-mails me.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:49.670
He goes, can you imagine?

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.260
The doctor told me I can only
practice 15 minutes a day.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.230
I emailed him back,
you mean every day?

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.990
For me, I do it a
little different.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.440
Everybody does it the way
that they have to do it.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.660
There's a way in.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.840
And of course you don't-- I
don't think anybody on this

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.660
stage is hampered by what's
in the way in, once they find

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.990
the way in for them.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:19.406
PHILIP GLASS: I
think that's true.

00:48:19.406 --> 00:48:21.470
KENNY WERNER: I think
that's the only way.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.920
PHILIP GLASS: The method
becomes very personal.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.720
And in a way, it becomes
impossible to really teach it

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.370
to someone.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.982
They have to find their own way.

00:48:32.224 --> 00:48:33.640
MICHAEL HAWLEY: A
couple of points

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:36.780
came up that just reminded me
of some of my early experience.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.470
It has to do with
learning to hear music.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:44.720
One of the typical exercises
that a kid will get in music

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.480
school is to harmonize a line.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.470
You get a melody,
like a chorale melody,

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:53.340
and you got to write
three voices underneath.

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.340
And one of the first
things you struggle with

00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.790
is trying to hear
all four voices

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.450
at one time in your head.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.450
It is an unnatural act.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:04.930
And there's a moment
at which you finally

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:09.210
do begin to get a sense of how
these different threads sound

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:11.590
inside, without even playing
them on the keyboard.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.548
And then, of course, you
pick up an arrangement

00:49:13.548 --> 00:49:15.730
that Bach of the same tune
and think, why didn't I

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:16.370
think of that?

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.780
I mean, look at
that miraculous--

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:21.160
that one idea-- you
know the feeling?

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:23.510
But it's sort of the
first big threshold

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:28.310
that I remember crossing
in learning music--

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.890
that you could begin to hear
these things without just

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:34.370
having to thump them
out on the keyboard.

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.470
That's why I'm fascinated
by your perspective now.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.730
You say that music
sounds different.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:42.530
And you're hearing
different things in it.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:46.310
And I'll be parsing that
for a while, I guess.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:56.500
Failures-- are there
any interesting failures

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.620
that spring to mind?

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.440
ROGER O'DONNELL: What, that
we're going to admit to?

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.300
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Yeah,
that's the whole point.

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.860
ROGER O'DONNELL: We're not
going to admit to any failures.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.390
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Forget
about the two million people

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:05.598
that are tuned in on YouTube.

00:50:05.598 --> 00:50:08.750
ROGER O'DONNELL: We probably
fail nine times out of 10,

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:12.357
but they don't get
to hear it, do they?

00:50:12.357 --> 00:50:14.190
MICHAEL HAWLEY: It's a
question of attitude.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.260
ROGER O'DONNELL: Well,
what's failure, though?

00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:16.796
MICHAEL HAWLEY: That's my--

00:50:16.796 --> 00:50:19.555
KENNY WERNER: Yeah, you
have to define that first.

00:50:19.555 --> 00:50:21.680
I have something I've been
telling my students just

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.790
lately.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:27.050
In a way, it's
kind of irrelevant,

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.815
not to-- I've been
telling my students

00:50:29.815 --> 00:50:34.950
it takes faith and trust.

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:36.970
You trust your hands.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:40.080
And then whatever comes out, you
have the faith that it worked,

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.554
even if it didn't.

00:50:42.554 --> 00:50:44.720
And then again, that's a
way of opening the channel.

00:50:47.479 --> 00:50:49.270
MICHAEL HAWLEY: When
I was listening to you

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.660
play those beautiful
Bernstein tunes

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.010
with different
harmonies-- fun harmonies,

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:57.054
delicious harmonies--
I was thinking,

00:50:57.054 --> 00:50:58.470
well, you know,
there's not really

00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:59.511
any wrong notes in there.

00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:01.480
And then I remembered,
Franz Liszt

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.500
used to tell his piano students,
there's no wrong notes.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.209
They're uninvited guests.

00:51:09.209 --> 00:51:11.500
And if they turn up, you try
to make them feel at home.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.755
You improvise around it.

00:51:12.755 --> 00:51:13.255
And that's--

00:51:13.255 --> 00:51:14.660
KENNY WERNER: Or invited guests.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.350
I mean, Miles Davis said,
don't fear mistakes.

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.410
There are none.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:19.990
Everybody knows some
version of that.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.236
But there's a funny
story about Herbie,

00:51:22.236 --> 00:51:23.860
in the first chapter
of his book, talks

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:25.434
about the first chord he played.

00:51:25.434 --> 00:51:27.100
He was so intimidated
playing with Miles

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.670
Davis it was totally wrong.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:32.974
And then Miles took that chord,
and he created some new music.

00:51:32.974 --> 00:51:34.390
But there's one
other funny story.

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.052
I heard Charlie
Parker was playing.

00:51:36.052 --> 00:51:37.760
He would always play
with local rhythms--

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.880
Charlie Parker's a great
be-bop saxophone player.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.880
He would always play with
local rhythm sections.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:42.754
That's what they did.

00:51:42.754 --> 00:51:45.180
That was in
Cincinnati, wherever.

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.650
And this piano player had
to pick him up every day.

00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:49.484
And Charlie Parker never
said a word to him.

00:51:49.484 --> 00:51:50.191
He'd pick him up.

00:51:50.191 --> 00:51:51.140
Charlie got in a car.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:51.764
They got out.

00:51:51.764 --> 00:51:52.680
Charlie took his horn.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.721
They played the whole
night, got back in the car,

00:51:54.721 --> 00:51:56.080
never said a word to him.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:59.090
And one night, this piano
player played completely

00:51:59.090 --> 00:51:59.950
the wrong chord.

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.290
And Charlie goes,
mm, I hear you.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.774
He said, I hear you.

00:52:06.774 --> 00:52:08.773
That was the only thing
he said to him all week.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:14.700
MICHAEL HAWLEY: How about kind
of big flashes of inspiration?

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.790
Do those ever happen, where
suddenly something goes off,

00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:20.520
and it's like the
floodgates are open?

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.037
And you're off to the races.

00:52:23.037 --> 00:52:24.620
PHILIP GLASS: I call
those lucky days.

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.930
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Lucky days?

00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:29.150
PHILIP GLASS: They come
now and then, occasionally.

00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:30.020
Occasionally.

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.311
And it's wonderful when it
happens, because that means,

00:52:32.311 --> 00:52:34.690
well, I guess that happened
to Schubert and Mozart

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:35.270
all the time.

00:52:37.332 --> 00:52:38.540
MICHAEL HAWLEY: I don't know.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:39.030
I think there's--

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.620
PHILIP GLASS: It can happen
even to ordinary people like us.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.410
And then it does.

00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:44.420
It's a beautiful thing.

00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:48.119
I've written one
whole piece that

00:52:48.119 --> 00:52:49.660
was like writing a
letter to someone.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:53.650
I never-- didn't change
a note, the whole opera.

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:57.610
And I thought, wow,
that was a freebie.

00:52:57.610 --> 00:52:59.870
But getting about--
there's another thing

00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.840
that talking about
failures, which

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.034
is an interesting question.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.440
If your music over time
changes-- and often it

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.300
eventually it does for
most people after a while--

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.810
then you find that
you've written a piece

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:19.150
that surprises you.

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.460
And my first instinct
is that maybe I'd

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.780
better not show it to anyone.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:27.607
And then I say, no,
I'll just play it.

00:53:27.607 --> 00:53:29.690
I'll give it to the orchestra
and they'll play it.

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:31.530
And we'll see what happens.

00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.960
And no one has that
response except me.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:38.564
I'm the one that's most puzzled
and alarmed by something that

00:53:38.564 --> 00:53:40.980
is radically different from
what I did before-- completely

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.050
alarmed by it.

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:46.030
And I've learned to just
shut up, hand the music out,

00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:48.220
and listen to it.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:52.010
There seems to be another
entity operating in some ways,

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.230
where these things can happen.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:54:00.320
And the big changes
in my music have often

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.870
been perceived to me as
failures, which I later

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.900
came to find out that
I actually had made

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:08.540
some fundamental change
in my thinking, which

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:12.384
I wasn't aware of until
I began to hear it back.

00:54:12.384 --> 00:54:13.050
Does that ever--

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.457
KENNY WERNER: Absolutely.

00:54:17.457 --> 00:54:19.040
ROGER O'DONNELL: I
think those moments

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.050
when you go back into the
studio and listen-- listen back

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.520
to what you wrote
the day before--

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.980
and you think, where
did this come from?

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.520
Who wrote this?

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.550
Those are amazing moments.

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.580
Of course, you look at
it, but I listen to it.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.038
PHILIP GLASS: You ever say,
what jackass wrote [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:38.770
ROGER O'DONNELL:
He's going nowhere.

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:40.560
Those are amazing moments.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.380
And you just think those are
the moments you also think,

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.940
I can't do this again.

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.840
I'll stop now.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.170
That's as good as it's
ever going to get.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:50.670
PHILIP GLASS: I
have a lot of people

00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:53.010
working with me in different
ways, copying these.

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:54.182
And you can't--

00:54:54.182 --> 00:54:56.390
ROGER O'DONNELL: We all copy
you, Philip, by the way.

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:58.414
PHILIP GLASS: Tell me
I've written wrong notes.

00:54:58.414 --> 00:55:00.080
And he said, no, this
is the wrong note.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.410
No, this is the wrong note.

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:05.610
But that's been,
actually-- I've learned

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.550
to defend the wrong notes, and
because I know the right notes.

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.280
But the people I work
with, they're not

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.280
used to the wrong notes.

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.863
And I'm not used to them either,
but I know that they're right

00:55:14.863 --> 00:55:16.500
even though they sound wrong.

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.980
It's a question
of I've just moved

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.520
into a different neighborhood.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.890
It's exciting when that happens.

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:31.860
It's exciting to be
that close to failure,

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.540
if you see what I mean.

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:37.100
ROGER O'DONNELL: I think that's
when you are actually pushing

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.350
where you are going, isn't it.

00:55:38.350 --> 00:55:40.760
If you're out of
your comfort zone

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.190
so much that you
think you're failing,

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:45.150
then you're actually
pushing your boundaries.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:46.960
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah, it's hard.

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.060
If you're the one
on the boundary,

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.580
and you're pretty much
there by yourself,

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:54.480
especially all the people that
work with you are telling you

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.540
got it wrong.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.280
But they're thinking
about a different piece.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.571
MICHAEL HAWLEY: And I remember
reading one little thing

00:56:01.571 --> 00:56:02.620
from Stravinsky, I think.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:05.810
He'd get a commission.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:06.310
Who was it?

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.960
Cole Porter was asked how he
got his inspirations for songs.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.820
And he said, nothing
is more inspiring

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:14.160
than a phone call
from a producer.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.041
That gets it started.

00:56:15.041 --> 00:56:16.540
So Stravinsky would
get a commission

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:18.180
and start working away.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:22.980
And he'd wind up with a stack
of paper that just didn't fit.

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:26.230
He'd have half of another piece
that for one reason didn't

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.500
work with what he was doing.

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:28.583
He wouldn't throw it away.

00:56:28.583 --> 00:56:29.910
He just set it to one side.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:33.510
PHILIP GLASS: We all wish we
had that piece he almost wrote.

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:35.010
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
You're so modest.

00:56:35.010 --> 00:56:36.910
I mean, you said
something earlier about

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:38.690
how Schubert and
Mozart were different.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:39.576
They're not like us.

00:56:39.576 --> 00:56:41.200
Why do you think they
were not like us?

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:48.420
PHILIP GLASS: Well, I've
said this to people--

00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:51.870
you're as likely to meet
Schubert or Mozart as to see

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:53.195
an angel walking on the street.

00:56:53.195 --> 00:56:53.820
It does happen.

00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:55.430
MICHAEL HAWLEY: I feel the
same way about Art Tatum.

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.850
PHILIP GLASS: What?

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:57.340
MICHAEL HAWLEY: I feel the
same way about Art Tatum.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.110
I listen to Tatum
recordings of jazz piano.

00:56:59.110 --> 00:57:01.276
PHILIP GLASS: They exist,
and they happen in a way--

00:57:01.276 --> 00:57:02.540
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Game over.

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.540
PHILIP GLASS: They're
frightening and inspiring.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:10.690
But if someone thinks
that-- maybe someone thinks

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.410
that's you.

00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:14.631
Then, but you don't
think it's you.

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:18.012
It's hard for us to accept,
sometimes, that kind of--

00:57:18.012 --> 00:57:20.470
KENNY WERNER: I think people
would probably think it's you.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.520
PHILIP GLASS: What?

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.320
KENNY WERNER: With
your career, I

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.111
think people would
probably think it's you.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:26.840
PHILIP GLASS: Well, thank you.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:33.900
For a long time, that got
me into trouble, actually.

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.830
I got booed off a lot of stages.

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:38.090
I don't know about you
guys, but-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:41.190
the orchestra, after the piece
was done, with the conductor

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:43.760
next to me, and the
audience was clapping

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.424
and the orchestra
was hissing me.

00:57:46.424 --> 00:57:48.090
That's how-- some of
the best orchestras

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.364
in the country-- the
Philadelphia Orchestra,

00:57:50.364 --> 00:57:52.280
the Cleveland Orchestra,
the Boston Orchestra.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.150
KENNY WERNER: All right,
then I have a question.

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:56.470
After that kind of experience,
how do you keep going?

00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:57.595
PHILIP GLASS: I felt great.

00:58:00.122 --> 00:58:01.080
Because I wasn't there.

00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.470
KENNY WERNER: So it didn't
throw you off your paddle.

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:03.430
PHILIP GLASS: No, no.

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:06.000
Those guys were stuck where
they were, and I wasn't.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.680
KENNY WERNER: Yeah.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:11.569
PHILIP GLASS: I actually
just laughed it off.

00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:13.610
MICHAEL HAWLEY: We've got
about 15 or 20 minutes.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:15.770
And I know there's
a lot of ideas

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:18.340
and questions in the audience
and a couple of microphones.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:21.610
It would be impolite
of me not to say, hey,

00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:24.930
if you want to step up and
ask a question, fire away.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:26.675
Could you go to the
microphone here?

00:58:26.675 --> 00:58:29.050
And I'm going to call on you,
because I can't really see.

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:30.550
Go, please.

00:58:30.550 --> 00:58:33.500
AUDIENCE: So something
you all have said

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.070
reminded me of a
technique that I've

00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:38.750
used when I get into a state
where I feel like my music is

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:40.480
all sounding the same.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:43.460
I shut off the lights,
sit down at the piano

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:47.380
without being able to see the
keyboard, just play two notes.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.130
And then from there,
try to work it

00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:51.900
until you get to something
that's consonant.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.050
And that takes away the
whole notion of what key

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.630
you're in and what
notes you're playing.

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.056
And you just hear the music.

00:59:00.056 --> 00:59:01.930
And I wondered if you
all have tried anything

00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.020
like that, or a few
other techniques

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:06.500
that you use to keep
yourself from sounding stale.

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:14.230
KENNY WERNER: Well, I find
that playing in one key

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:16.980
and then playing in the
other key very tonally kind

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:19.986
of satisfies me in
a kind of weird way.

00:59:19.986 --> 00:59:25.930
I also just sometimes
just play with my entire--

00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:30.252
from elbow to elbow,
but Christmas carols.

00:59:30.252 --> 00:59:31.210
I just like doing that.

00:59:31.210 --> 00:59:34.020
It's just kind of strange.

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:36.640
I wanted to do a whole record
of Christmas carols that way,

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.760
and my wife won't let me.

00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.680
PHILIP GLASS: Let me
ask you a question.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.592
It looked to me like
you were-- your eyes

00:59:42.592 --> 00:59:43.800
were closed most of the time.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.450
You weren't watching
your fingers.

00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:46.825
KENNY WERNER: I
try not to watch.

00:59:46.825 --> 00:59:49.270
PHILIP GLASS: You're basically
listening all the time.

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:51.478
KENNY WERNER: And imagining
someone else is doing it.

00:59:51.478 --> 00:59:53.840
That really helps.

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.090
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.860
This has been amazing.

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.700
Roger, you talked
about playing music

00:59:59.700 --> 01:00:02.400
and it inspired
you to add stuff.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.380
Kenny, you talked about
starting with chaos

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.500
and taking parts out.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.900
Terrace, especially as a
producer with other artists,

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:16.050
do you ever-- is it hard
to know when it's done?

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:20.690
When the piece or
the record is OK?

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:23.090
It's done?

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.900
TERRACE MARTIN: They always
have to tell me to stop.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.770
They always have
to tell me to stop.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.640
For me, everybody feeds off
different energy how they work.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.650
Everybody is inspired
by different things.

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:46.330
And usually with the
records I produce,

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:49.340
there's always this
quiet deadline.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.070
This quiet deadline-- and I call
them where they're rushing you,

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.224
but they never give
you a date when

01:00:54.224 --> 01:00:56.140
you have to turn take a
record into mastering.

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:59.990
So say, for instance, when I
produced the Kendrick Lamar

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:00.870
album, we had years.

01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:03.090
We had three or four
years-- three years

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:04.950
to produce that record.

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:08.750
And I've produced
a lot of records.

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.270
But we didn't really click
until the last four months,

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:14.490
when they said, we're going
to master on January 3rd.

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:18.270
And then for some
reason, that fueled me.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:20.650
And then, instead of adding
more things to the music,

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:21.990
I stop myself.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.650
I listen to it.

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:25.620
I usually go back in the
studio, and I listen back.

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.720
And I say whoa, I need to
start subtracting things

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.720
instead of adding things.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.680
And then usually I have
somebody next to me

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.070
that knows nothing
about harmony, nothing

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:39.800
about all my keyboards,
and they just

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.670
know how it makes them feel.

01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:44.230
And I always say I trust
those people really

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:48.210
a lot more than musicians when
it comes to creative things.

01:01:48.210 --> 01:01:51.664
And usually I have a crew
of people that I look at.

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.580
They don't even know--
they probably know now,

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.871
don't even know I look at
them on the side of me going.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.560
In hip hop, they
say it's too jazzy.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.410
That doesn't mean it's too good.

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:05.350
It means it's too much going on.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:08.170
The conversation's different.

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:09.910
It's too jazzy.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:12.900
OK, take out some instruments.

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:16.390
It's too-- like I'll
do an R and B song,

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:19.960
and put amazing Prince-style
distortion guitar.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.650
They'll say it's
too Guns 'N' Roses.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:27.230
And I'll say, OK, that
means turn down the--

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.210
so it's a few mechanisms
that I do use when to stop,

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:32.200
when I'm working on
other artist's records.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.860
On my records, I don't
care what nobody says.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:36.820
I go all the way in.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.870
If it's the last song of
a ballad, three seconds.

01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:40.245
And if I want to
get a orchestra,

01:02:40.245 --> 01:02:43.207
if that was my heart tells
me to do, I'm going to do it.

01:02:43.207 --> 01:02:44.790
But everybody doesn't
operate on that.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.873
And as a producer, I do
have to be a professional,

01:02:46.873 --> 01:02:49.080
and still open up and
listen to them as well.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:49.660
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
So in other words,

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.720
it's kind of like a
big software release.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:53.640
You've got the
release date, and you

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.397
can't be chucking more features
into the bin and [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:57.813
TERRACE MARTIN:
And I'm trying to.

01:02:57.813 --> 01:02:59.480
I'm trying to add more songs.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:05.370
You know, I hear more-- like,
he says something that all--

01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:08.360
and that's just it my
spirit what you said.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.560
Because I've been hearing
for the past, like,

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:12.740
I talked to Quincy Jones.

01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.920
And he said, he's
hearing music the best

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.100
he's ever heard it right now.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.945
Working with Herbie,
75 years old,

01:03:18.945 --> 01:03:20.320
he said, he's
playing and hearing

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.650
the best music he's ever.

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.940
He said, he can't wait
to be 80 years old.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.150
You know, it's like these
people-- it's like with the art

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:29.270
and being stuck-- I
believe if you're really

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:33.330
in love with this thing, you're
always going to want to grow.

01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:36.840
And that urge to want to grow,
and accepting challenges,

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.730
and wanting to conquer
challenge kind of voids

01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:41.772
out the failure
thing in a way, too.

01:03:41.772 --> 01:03:43.230
Because it's like
it's a challenge.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:44.250
Let's get through it.

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:50.130
I love-- going back to
the jazzy thing, when

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:53.864
Jimmy [? Ivine ?] and
everybody-- everybody

01:03:53.864 --> 01:03:56.030
is not so into the jazz
thing, let me just say that.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.150
So Kendrick said, I
want to do a record.

01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:00.120
I want heavy jazz influence.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.325
And Terrace-- oh, no, oh, no.

01:04:02.325 --> 01:04:04.700
We're not going to people
dance, [INAUDIBLE] people this.

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.560
No, no, we can't.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:07.460
It's going to be too
much music going on,

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.460
too much music going on.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.910
But that kid had a vision.

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.547
And he followed his
heart with his heart.

01:04:12.547 --> 01:04:14.630
And now it's the biggest
hip hop record right now,

01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:15.960
because he followed his
heart, not because he followed

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.390
the train I was going on.

01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:19.020
And we don't believe
in getting stuck.

01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:20.770
When one person gets
stuck, we got to pull it

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:21.540
from the other person.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.620
We've got to uplift each
other in our community

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.060
so we don't get stuck.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.420
Those are very important
things, so that's my thing.

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.070
AUDIENCE: Very insightful.

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.930
Kind of a follow
up to that-- I have

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:36.310
a question more about
the business of music,

01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:39.060
and how do you deal with the
commercialization aspects,

01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.050
and outsiders trying
to influence your sound

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:43.415
and where you should
go with your music?

01:04:43.415 --> 01:04:45.040
PHILIP GLASS: I didn't
understand that.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.414
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
It was a question

01:04:46.414 --> 01:04:48.030
about the business of music.

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.430
How do you deal
with the pressure

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:52.930
of the commercial market
relative to what you

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:54.360
think you should be writing?

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.540
Or do you not, ignore it?

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.831
PHILIP GLASS: I know when
I'm writing commercial music.

01:04:57.831 --> 01:05:00.150
And I know when I'm
writing concert music.

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:05.490
I know, and the people who ask
me to do it, they know it, too.

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:11.340
If I'm writing a commercial
for IBM, that's one thing.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.540
If I'm writing a
symphony for [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.880
it's a different thing.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.500
It's not a problem.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.785
MICHAEL HAWLEY: That was easy.

01:05:19.785 --> 01:05:21.160
ROGER O'DONNELL:
I'm lucky enough

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:25.980
to have a day job that pays
really well in the Cure, which

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:28.980
allows me to experiment
and do whatever I want,

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.210
without any regard
to commerciality

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:37.730
or, if anybody wants to hear it,
I'm in a very lucky position.

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:40.050
So I wouldn't want to be
dealing with that business

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:41.870
side of music now.

01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:46.320
I mean, it's changed
in the last 20 years

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.060
for new musicians starting,
wanting to form bands,

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:51.077
trying to make money.

01:05:51.077 --> 01:05:52.160
It's virtually impossible.

01:05:54.935 --> 01:05:57.431
I've got no answers.

01:05:57.431 --> 01:05:59.930
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Yeah, well, it
is a kind of a moving target.

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:01.950
I mean, when guys
like Bach were around,

01:06:01.950 --> 01:06:05.220
the commerce was done
around wealthy courts,

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.060
and by dukes or the church.

01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:09.060
And so you were constrained
in different ways,

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.220
and tried to push
beyond those boundaries.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:15.650
The 19th century, you had big
rooms and paying audiences.

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.330
It was sort of the Ringling
Brothers approach to promote.

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:20.920
20th century, you
get movie studios.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.830
That became a new home for
a lot of musicians in a way,

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.350
with different constraints.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.430
And now we're in the
sort of post-Napster era.

01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:31.430
TERRACE MARTIN: I want
to add something to that.

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:36.670
When I was trying to be a
part of this music business,

01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:38.470
I would try to do
what's going on now.

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:41.674
I'd try to-- because I was
easily influenced by people

01:06:41.674 --> 01:06:42.840
saying, you need to do that.

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.390
Or you need to do that.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:45.470
You need to do up-tempo.

01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:46.800
You need to do that.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.570
And I spent like seven years
chasing my tail just trying

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:54.030
to do what I felt I should--
what people was telling me

01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:55.310
I should do.

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.612
And the minute I stopped
doing that, and just said,

01:06:57.612 --> 01:07:00.070
look-- because every time I
did try to sound like something

01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:02.380
else, it sounded horrible.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.507
I had the wrong drum
selection, the wrong--

01:07:04.507 --> 01:07:06.590
it just sounded horrible,
because I wasn't in my--

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:07.640
MICHAEL HAWLEY: It
didn't sound like you.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:09.139
TERRACE MARTIN:
That's not my thing.

01:07:09.139 --> 01:07:10.280
And I didn't know then.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.030
Sometimes we get caught
up in the business

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:15.610
with making a living,
and doing that.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:18.490
But when I realized,
man, if you just

01:07:18.490 --> 01:07:24.080
stay true to what
you do and sit still,

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.320
I'm a living witness
that it works over time.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.380
And I'm still working
out things, and learning,

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:33.590
and still try to push
forward every time.

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:36.910
AUDIENCE: So Terrace, you
talked about children,

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.630
and how they have sort
of an unfiltered view.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:42.010
And we've all heard
so much music.

01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:44.890
You guys especially have
heard so much music,

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.100
and written so much music.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.980
How do you find a balance
between your expertise

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.380
and maintaining
that child's eye,

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.420
and finding a way to sort of
bring both at the same time?

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.634
Everybody.

01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:04.050
ROGER O'DONNELL:
I think expertise

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:08.937
is, like we were talking
about the Creative Cloud

01:08:08.937 --> 01:08:10.270
or whatever you want to call it.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:14.270
Expertise is just a
language that allows

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:18.370
you to communicate your ideas.

01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.120
If you have all this
music in your head,

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:25.430
and you don't have the
technique to perform it,

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.750
or to get it out, then
you're really stuck.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:32.430
I think when technique
comes before creativity,

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.080
then you are in big
problems, anyway.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.859
Because it's not
all about technique.

01:08:38.859 --> 01:08:40.970
It's about creativity.

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.029
But you do need the
ability to get it out.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.859
I mean, there was a
big movement in music,

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.640
like punk, where it
was all supposed to be

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.950
about not being able to play.

01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:52.460
But you still had to
be able to communicate

01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:55.290
what your musical ideas were.

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:58.170
And we've probably all got
different levels of technique.

01:08:58.170 --> 01:09:02.154
But we're able to
communicate what we feel,

01:09:02.154 --> 01:09:04.245
and what our emotions
are in music.

01:09:04.245 --> 01:09:05.870
KENNY WERNER: You
know, a lot of people

01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:07.586
have the opposite problem.

01:09:07.586 --> 01:09:09.689
They're creative, but
they have no patience

01:09:09.689 --> 01:09:11.960
for developing language.

01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.420
And I see that a lot.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.100
I had a friend, great
composer, Donald Erb.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:20.920
He said, the bars are filled
with very talented people.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:24.670
But that's kind of part of
what I wrote about, too.

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:26.609
When it's time to
play, it's time

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:28.540
to completely open
up to everything

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:29.950
we've been talking about.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:32.760
But when it's time to practice,
I think the joy of practicing

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.660
is just concentrating on not
just practicing some technique,

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.504
but really owning something.

01:09:38.504 --> 01:09:40.420
And one of the ways
people sabotage themselves

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.399
is they practice too much stuff.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:43.807
They don't really own anything.

01:09:43.807 --> 01:09:46.140
Just to own a little bit of
something, you start to say,

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.740
I can do it.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:52.396
And that language
will free you up.

01:09:52.396 --> 01:09:53.770
You just have to
know when to go.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:55.429
Just for lack of
better words, you

01:09:55.429 --> 01:09:57.220
have to know when to
go in your left brain,

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:58.678
and when to go in
your right brain.

01:09:58.678 --> 01:10:00.320
And I hope that's
the right stuff.

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.080
Right brain is for
playing, they say.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:06.180
Left brain is for
concentrating, practicing.

01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:09.014
I always tell people if you're
practicing is inspiring,

01:10:09.014 --> 01:10:10.055
you should be suspicious.

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:14.924
MICHAEL HAWLEY: A couple more.

01:10:14.924 --> 01:10:17.340
AUDIENCE: It might be a little
bit of an oddball question,

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.100
but do you guys
ever dream music?

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.846
PHILIP GLASS: I do.

01:10:21.846 --> 01:10:23.220
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Do you ever dream

01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.248
music, music in your dreams?

01:10:27.522 --> 01:10:29.980
ROGER O'DONNELL: Yeah, well,
that's part of that big thing,

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:30.480
isn't it?

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.477
If you could get that out.

01:10:33.477 --> 01:10:34.810
KENNY WERNER: That's a hard one.

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:38.640
TERRACE MARTIN: I used to
dream-- my dreams of music

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.250
was always me playing in
Carnegie Hall with Bud Powell.

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.140
But with Jordan's on.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:46.500
You know what I'm saying?

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.430
But I don't dream in music.

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:54.240
But I've always-- I remember
playing in marching band

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.340
in 10th grade, walking
into the football field

01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.490
before the football
players got there.

01:10:58.490 --> 01:11:02.180
And I always imagined I
was playing at Carnegie.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.780
A setting in like--
I remember when

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.520
somebody scored a touchdown.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.460
And they said, oh.

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:10.720
And I would imagine them
saying, Terrace, Terrace.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.320
He ought to know.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:14.360
So those are the
dreams that I had.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.960
And I still dream about
Carnegie Hall and Bud Powell.

01:11:20.707 --> 01:11:22.290
PHILIP GLASS: Since
a couple days ago,

01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:28.250
I saw a beautiful movie called
"Dreams" by Kurosawa, Japanese.

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:34.730
And it's about 12
little stories.

01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:38.670
And he, in the very first
part, there's a house.

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:41.140
And some writing in Japanese.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.380
A friend of mine was
there and told me about.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.470
And it said, Kurosawa
on the house.

01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:48.260
So that was telling
us that everything--

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.710
and then the subtitles
had a name for each piece.

01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:57.220
But in Japanese, it said,
"And then I dreamed this.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.090
And then I dreamed this.

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:00.900
And then I dreamed this."

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.340
So beautiful--
"Dreams" by Kurosawa.

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.500
You can Google it.

01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:07.450
You can find it.

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:13.235
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Who's next?

01:12:13.235 --> 01:12:14.610
AUDIENCE: "Einstein
on the Beach"

01:12:14.610 --> 01:12:16.400
has been a piece
of music that I've

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.020
been listening to on and off
for probably more than 20 years

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:19.520
now.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.010
So thank you for that.

01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:24.400
And every time I
listen to it, there's

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.190
something new that's
revealed to me.

01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:30.550
And I'm wondering if
the folks on stage

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:33.910
can talk about,
maybe, pieces or tunes

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.600
that have withstood
the test of time,

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:41.030
and that are still fresh
and new even after they've

01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:44.284
been in your life
for such a long time.

01:12:44.284 --> 01:12:45.450
PHILIP GLASS: Whoa, so many.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.327
It's gone quiet.

01:12:56.327 --> 01:12:57.910
MICHAEL HAWLEY: He
wants to know tunes

01:12:57.910 --> 01:13:00.470
that have stuck
with you forever,

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:01.670
the melodies that you--

01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:03.197
KENNY WERNER: No,
I think he said

01:13:03.197 --> 01:13:05.780
pieces you've listened to that
you keep finding new things in.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.905
Is that what you're saying?

01:13:06.905 --> 01:13:09.800
AUDIENCE: Right, sort of
like the layers of an onion.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.417
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Music that you
never tire of listening to.

01:13:12.417 --> 01:13:13.750
KENNY WERNER: I kind of stopped.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:17.650
I don't listen to
much music any more.

01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:21.020
It's just-- you say,
I hear differently.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.520
You also start to
think differently.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:27.530
More and more, it becomes just
this very personal dialogue.

01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:29.114
It's not music.

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:31.030
And I heard Herbie say
that too, at one point.

01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:32.390
It's not really music anymore.

01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:34.620
It's just these sounds
that are coming out of me.

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:38.750
And if I listen to a lot of
music, I confuse it with music.

01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:44.030
That must sound incoherent, but
when I think of it as music,

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:46.270
I get trapped.

01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:49.800
When I think of it as
this sounds that I just

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.870
have a tactile sensation, or
even essential relationship to,

01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:55.480
I start to expand.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.930
So it's not-- I don't listen
something over and over again.

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:05.440
I kind of like, first of all,
I kind of like the silence now,

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.866
and then see what
comes out from there.

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.720
ROGER O'DONNELL: I
recently reconnected

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:19.520
with some Stevie Wonder albums.

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:22.090
And I remember listening to
them at the time they came out,

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:25.020
thinking that was
just incredible.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.760
And you listen to them now,
and they're just as fresh.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.940
And the sounds involved, like
a lot of Moog programming

01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.920
from those two guys,
Bob [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.750
and the other guy's name.

01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:40.120
But anyway, and you just
go, that's what Stevie did.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.460
And you just think wow.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.300
And you've worked with him.

01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:50.480
TERRACE MARTIN: Yeah,
that was strange.

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.605
Sitting up here is strange.

01:14:51.605 --> 01:14:52.854
I can't believe I'm even here.

01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:53.980
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:57.260 --> 01:15:00.840
Stevie Wonder is one of,
for me, there's two records

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.060
that I always pull from.

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:07.590
Rather sometimes, spiritual
reasons or just sometimes

01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:10.600
I just like writing to it.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.930
It is the "Purple Rain"
soundtrack-- Prince--

01:15:15.930 --> 01:15:18.190
and "A Love Supreme,"
John Coltrane.

01:15:20.784 --> 01:15:21.950
And I pull different things.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:27.380
Like when I listened to "A
Love Supreme" by John Coltrane,

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.370
I hear things different.

01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:31.130
There's no words.

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:32.060
But I hear aggression.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:32.660
I hear pain.

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:33.320
I hear love.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.680
And I just hear something.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.160
When I first heard
"A Love Supreme"

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:39.050
and really listened to
it, I was in 11th grade.

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:40.190
And I was on the bus stop.

01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:43.140
And for some reason,
he started "Stolen"

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:45.022
and it was a broad--
I'd just start running.

01:15:45.022 --> 01:15:46.730
And everybody thought,
why is he running?

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:47.780
I ran on.

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:50.350
The music was so intense.

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:51.670
And it fed me energy.

01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:56.120
To this day, I use that same
energy although it was jazz.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:59.629
But I use that same energy if I
was doing a rock record, a hip

01:15:59.629 --> 01:16:00.420
hop record, or any.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.020
It is just the spirit of that.

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.330
And then for other reasons, I
make pop artist Stevie Wonder

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:09.090
record, because I love the
clavinet and mini-Moog.

01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:10.900
I love the mini-Moog.

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.820
I say I have a
collection of mini-Moogs.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:15.570
I just picked up one
two days ago on eBay.

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:18.170
I love the mini-Moog.

01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:22.232
And Stevie knew how to
make those mini-- you can't

01:16:22.232 --> 01:16:23.440
play chords on the mini-Moog.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:26.170
But he would do these layers
that we could do now, just

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:28.420
with an instrument called
the ocarina on the keyboard.

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:29.955
But he would do these layers.

01:16:29.955 --> 01:16:31.580
And when I got a
chance to talk to him,

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.246
he was saying he was
trying to make them

01:16:33.246 --> 01:16:36.010
sound like flutes and strings.

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:38.430
But he was using the mini-Moog.

01:16:38.430 --> 01:16:39.600
You know what I'm saying?

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.770
Definition, just like
the alto sax one.

01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:45.040
I just found out
recently the saxophone

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.615
was used to replace strings.

01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:51.372
I took a course at
USC for two days.

01:16:51.372 --> 01:16:53.080
And there was something
about instruments

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.450
were used to replace
other instruments.

01:16:55.450 --> 01:16:57.761
And I think the mini-Moog
is very inspiring,

01:16:57.761 --> 01:16:59.760
because you can just go
in different directions.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.149
You can make drums out of
one instrument-- the bass

01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:03.690
and everything out
of one instrument.

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:05.230
Stevie Wonder does that.

01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:07.144
So that's what I pull
from, different things.

01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:08.060
Are you about to play?

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.726
MICHAEL HAWLEY: I
have a couple of tunes

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:11.070
in mind, just little things.

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:13.390
Because I don't have
the obligations that you

01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:15.680
all have of producing music.

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:18.390
I have the luxury of
absorbing and fiddling around

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:19.420
with it at home.

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.530
And there are
melodies that stick

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:24.036
with me over 100s of years.

01:17:24.036 --> 01:17:26.805
[PLAYING PIANO]

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:41.290
That's an old Bach tune.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:43.880
Who doesn't like a good
Rachmaninoff concerto?

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.213
KENNY WERNER: Love Rachmaninoff.

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:51.820
MICHAEL HAWLEY: Liszt came
up with nice tunes-- sort

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.310
of the guy who
would have been John

01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:55.702
Williams in the 19th century.

01:18:00.957 --> 01:18:01.540
John Williams.

01:18:17.429 --> 01:18:18.470
Any of you know that one?

01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:20.720
It's Indiana Jones,
Marion's theme,

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.786
which is closely related to--

01:18:24.786 --> 01:18:28.272
[PLAYING PIANO]

01:18:33.252 --> 01:18:34.248
Princess Leia.

01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:40.224
And then there's--

01:18:40.224 --> 01:18:43.481
[PLAYING PIANO]

01:18:43.481 --> 01:18:45.980
I'm trying to remember the tune
from Mishima that you wrote,

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.650
Philip.

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:49.099
You wrote the score for Mishima.

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:49.890
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah.

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:52.432
MICHAEL HAWLEY: There's
this fantastic sort of--

01:18:52.432 --> 01:18:55.324
[PLAYING PIANO]

01:19:02.077 --> 01:19:02.910
Something like that.

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:04.201
It's not ringing any bells?

01:19:04.201 --> 01:19:04.700
Wrong key?

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:05.866
PHILIP GLASS: Yeah, it does.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:10.790
I never tried it on
the piano, though.

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:12.740
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Yeah, that's right.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.610
But what everybody
is saying, I think,

01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:19.680
is that these little stories--
these musical stories--

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:21.510
they sort of stick with you.

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:24.770
And they change over time
the way we change over time.

01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:26.775
You listen to a--

01:19:29.745 --> 01:19:33.210
[PLAYING PIANO]

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:55.480
I get attracted to that
piece over and over

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.490
again every few years.

01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:57.860
It feels different to me.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.100
KENNY WERNER: I have
a couple of those.

01:19:59.100 --> 01:19:59.750
I have a couple.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.291
MICHAEL HAWLEY:
Yeah, what are yours?

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:06.070
KENNY WERNER: Well,
I love this one.

01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:08.720
This always just takes me away.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.374
And it's a little
bit improvised.

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:14.142
[PLAYING PIANO]

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:15.350
MICHAEL HAWLEY: There you go.

01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:34.750
That's a nice way to hear it.
