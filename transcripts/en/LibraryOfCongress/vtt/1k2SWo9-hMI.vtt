&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.130
My name is Colleen Shogan.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.280
I work at the Library
of Congress.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.030
Welcome to the 18th Annual
National Book Festival.

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.210
A couple of housekeeping
items before we get started.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.200
Please silence your cell
phones if you haven't already.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.810
And there will be time for a
Q&amp;A at the end of the session

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.030
so please be sure to
save your questions.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.520
I'm honored to be joined
onstage today by Tara Westover,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.660
the author of Educated.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.860
Tara grew up in rural Idaho.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.080
She's a graduate of
Brigham Young University,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.690
and she also received
her PhD in history

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.200
from Cambridge University
in the UK.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.550
And I think that's all I'm
going to say about Tara

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.890
and her biography for now
because I think we're going

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.060
to get into a lot of the details
in our conversation today.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.320
If you haven't read Educated,
I highly recommend it.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880
I picked it up at the beginning
of a trans-Atlantic flight

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.170
from Europe back to Washington,
DC, and I didn't put it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.760
down the entire flight.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.200
And that's really the
marker of a terrific book.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.590
But I am not the only person

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.540
who thinks Educated
is a terrific book

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.270
because a few weeks ago
President Barack Obama issued a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.710
list of his top five books
that he read this summer

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.510
and Tara's book,
Educated, was on that list.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.060
[ Applause ]

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.000
So how did you find
out about that?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.410
Did President Obama tweet you?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.060
Did he text you ahead of time?

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.410
Or how did you find out?

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.880
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I had been
told that he was reading it.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.180
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Mmhmm.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.480
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: But I don't
think I took that very --

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.430
no, I'd been told that he'd
said he was going to read it.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.730
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: OK.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.030
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover:
Which, I know what I'm

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.330
like when I say I'm
going to read a book.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.630
And I thought, yeah,
sure you -- [laughing].

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.930
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.230
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: So no,
I wasn't expecting it.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.890
I went. I had a lunch
with a friend.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.190
It was very nice.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.020
And then I left and I did that
thing that we all do now as soon

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.320
as we stop talking to someone

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.210
and we're alone --
we look at our phone.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.580
And I checked my email and
there was an email from my agent

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.120
who said, "This has
just happened!"

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.970
[Laughter] And yeah, it
was a lovely surprise.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.110
And then a couple of
days later I got a call.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.800
I was at my house and then my
phone rang and I answered it.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.430
And they said, "Do you think
you have time this afternoon

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.350
for a call from President
Obama?"

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.650
[Whispering] I was like
-- [speaking again] yeah!

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.650
[Laughter] I can fit that in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.440
with all the other former
presidents who are calling me.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.060
[Laughing] Maybe at 2:15.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.170
So he really generously
called me

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.790
and was just really
thoughtful, kind.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.330
He has a lot of things
going on in his life.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.510
He did not have to do that.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.830
So I mean, that was pretty --

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.860
I've had some weird
things happen in my life

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.090
and that was pretty weird.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.390
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Yep.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.690
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: You know?

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.990
[Laughter] That was
right up there with some

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.810
of the strangest things that
I never thought would happen.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So to start
us out, in your book I think one

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.800
of the strengths of the book is
your really vivid descriptions

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.700
of where you grew up.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.280
And the setting of your
book is so important

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.970
because it sets the entire
framework for the story.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.650
So in your own words can
you talk to us a little bit

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.190
about the place where
you grew up?

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.490
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.240
I was raised the
youngest of seven children

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.550
on this mountain in Idaho.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.120
And a lot of people know
we didn't go to school.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.420
We didn't go to the doctor.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.720
I didn't have a birth
certificate.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.830
We had these quite radical
aspects of our lives.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.360
I think some people think

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.880
that that means it was a bleak
childhood and it really wasn't.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.980
It was a pretty happy childhood.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.280
There were a lot of
beautiful things.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.580
We had horses.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.880
We had a junkyard.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.070
But I know that doesn't sound
really great but it kind

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.560
of was a lot of the time.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.510
I mean, if you ever want to
have a really good game of hide

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.940
and seek or treasure hunting
or any kind of game at all,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.240
having your own junkyard
is pretty amazing.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.620
You know? We'd go to
my grandmother's house

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.360
and we'd play that lava
game where you pretend

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.730
like everything is lava except
the pillows you put on the floor

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.810
but do that with junk cars
that you can jump from.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.620
Like, it was great!

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.980
So a lot of really wonderful
things about my childhood

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.810
and then there were some kind
of difficult things about it.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.760
So not being able to go
to school was difficult.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.410
I never had any friends.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.980
I never went to another
kid's house.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.910
I called them public school
kids and I never had any friends

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.210
who were public school kids.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.510
I never went to their house.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.820
They never came to mine.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.130
And so there were these
kind of slightly darker,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.060
more difficult elements.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.320
And eventually I
would go to college.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.700
I would not really know what I
was doing or why I was doing it.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.190
But I would teach myself
enough algebra to pass the ACT

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.660
and I would wind
up at a university

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.630
and that would be a pretty
big shock [chuckling].

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.580
And then life would
change pretty dramatically.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.120
But my childhood itself --

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.420
yeah, I think like a lot

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.910
of people's lives
it wasn't one thing.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.410
It was mixed.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.180
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So your
book is about your own journey

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.450
to become educated and
your educational journey.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.540
It's also about your
relationship with your family.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.280
Can you talk a little bit
about your mother and father

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.590
in particular and their
views on education?

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.920
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: My parents, I
think they were quite idealistic

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.180
about education when my
older brothers were young.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.280
My father was kind of
paranoid about the government,

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.580
about many different things.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.640
He thought the government had
been infiltrated by something

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.320
like the Illuminati, this
nefarious organization

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.040
that was corrupting everything.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.440
And he believed public
education was a part of that.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.370
So he didn't want us in the
schools because he was not --

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.850
he didn't want them
teaching us things

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.820
that he didn't agree with.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.210
So that was, I think, when my
parents first made the decision

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.510
to homeschool their kids.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.220
I think they had a
fairly idealistic view

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.260
that they would -- at least
my mother, I think thought

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.060
that she could provide a
better education at home.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.100
But that just kind of gave way,
fell by the wayside so that

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.220
by the time that I came
along and my three older --

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.040
the three that are
just older than me --

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.100
there wasn't a lot of
by way of education.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.470
There were -- I mean, I was
definitely taught to read by one

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.560
of my older brothers,
so I was literate.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.820
Reading was important
to my family.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.280
But it wasn't -- I
never took an exam.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.580
I never wrote an essay.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.940
I never remember anything
like a formal lecture

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.690
which is why I could
arrive at BYU --

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.320
and there's serious questions
to how I got into BYU [laughing]

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.120
because I wasn't qualified.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.710
But you know, that's how I
could arrive at a university

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.830
when I was 17 and go
into a classroom and say,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.130
"what is this word: Holocaust?"

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.430
I hadn't heard it before.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.830
And I'd never heard of
the civil rights movement.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.390
There were so many
things I didn't know.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.590
I thought Europe was a
country, not a continent.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.270
That was very confusing.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.580
And so I had this education
that was incredibly spotty

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.710
because it had just never
been formal in any way.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.130
But I think my parents,
strangely enough,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.300
I don't think it's that they
completely didn't value it.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.010
It just didn't happen.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.040
And I think their
idea of education was

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.460
such that it was entirely
kind of your responsibility

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.800
and if you wanted to learn
something you should go

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.100
learn it.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.400
But there were difficulties
with that.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.670
You know, not everyone can
teach themselves calculus.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.900
I don't think I could do that.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.280
I sort of taught
myself trigonometry

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.400
and it didn't go great.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.270
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So instead of
following a homeschool program

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.010
or going to a public
school or a private school,

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.310
you worked with your father in
the scrapyard, in the junkyard.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.950
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.000
And was that -- did you
learn anything from that?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.590
Was it an unconventional
form of education?

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.430
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: People
always said in my family

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.410
that one thing we know how to do
is we really know how to work.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.400
And we really do.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.340
We're really good workers.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.940
And I think I did learn a
really good work ethic working

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.240
with my dad.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.210
I think people judge
my dad really harshly.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.970
And I struggle with that because
I tried to write him the way

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.840
that I see him and the
way that I think he is.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.730
We got injured a lot in my dad's
junkyard, really horrifically,

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.780
and it was completely
unnecessary.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.210
A few safety precautions,
basic ones [chuckles].

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.510
Nothing elaborate here.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.810
You know, harnesses.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.980
And people wouldn't have
gotten hurt the way they did.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.720
And then of course because
he had these beliefs

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.230
about doctors we didn't
go to the hospital.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.870
And it's hard for me
to convince people

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.350
that this wasn't malicious.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.300
You know, my dad loved his
kids but he put his kids

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.490
in danger a lot and then once
they were hurt he didn't give

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.790
them medical attention.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.660
And that is hard for
people to square.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.960
It's hard for me to square.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.370
It's hard to square that circle.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:25.500
I've squared it for myself
by believing that I --

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.730
my thing is that my dad
has a mental illness.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.890
I think he's bipolar.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.930
For some reason he doesn't
have that bone in his head

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.320
that tells him when
something is dangerous.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.770
And so he would routinely ask
us to do things or tell us

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.950
to do things that
were so dangerous.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.360
But the redeeming fact,
I suppose, is, you know,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.180
my dad never had us do
anything or put us in any danger

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.100
that he wouldn't
have put himself in.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.650
So it was not the case that
my father would, you know,

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.940
if we were injured not take
us to a doctor but then

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.840
if he was injured take
himself to a doctor.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.420
I mean, the worst
injury that happened

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.850
in my father's junkyard
happened to my father.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.670
He was standing next to a car.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.940
He was removing a fuel tank.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.530
Because he just doesn't think
rationally about things,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.800
he decided not to drain the
fuel before he lit a torch

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.790
and started to remove the tank.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.580
And you know, fuel is flammable.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.300
So the car exploded and
he was burned terribly,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.170
unbelievably bad.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.810
And it was months of
recovering and he nearly died.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.730
And of course, my parents
because of the beliefs

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.490
that they have, they did not
take him to the hospital.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.340
They treated that at home.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.590
And the pain was unimaginable.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:44.110
But so I tell this story
because I think it shows

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.090
for my father he was doing what
he thought the right thing was.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.520
You might disagree and it's
hard for people to understand.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.160
For my father, I
think what love looked

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.120
like for his children was not
taking them to the doctor,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.580
not taking my brother to the
doctor when he lit his leg

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.680
on fire and it was
terribly burned,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.880
because he sincerely
believed it.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.930
So he wasn't an unloving father.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.600
He didn't put us through things
and then be kinder to himself.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.170
These were his beliefs.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.450
And so the story is it's
a little more complicated

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.310
than what do you do when
people treat you badly

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.610
because they don't
care about you.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:19.770
It's more a story of what do
you do when you love someone

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.550
and they love you and there is
just something disfunctional

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.730
about it that is harmful to you?

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.670
And that is a harder
situation to resolve.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.350
And I think it's probably
one that most people face.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.070
I don't know a lot of
people who their trouble

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.040
with their parents is just
a completely evil parent

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.340
that doesn't care
for them at all.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.410
I'm sure there are
some parents like that.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.770
But I think it's -- you know,
a family is incredibly nuanced.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.080
And for me, writing
the book, that was one

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.830
of the things I really wanted
to tease apart which is

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.070
to say I love my father, I
think he's a good person,

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.370
I think he loves me.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.180
I think he wants what he
thinks is best for me.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.000
And [laughs] they're not
always the same thing

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.300
as what I think is
best for myself.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.510
And how do we navigate that?

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.120
And what if we can't navigate it
and how do we accept the outcome

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.980
of not being able
to navigate it?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.640
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: For most
of your childhood you thought

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.750
that you would follow in
your mother's footsteps,

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.250
that you would study
to become an herbalist.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.900
You might take over her
business as a midwife.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.790
But then at some point -- you
changed your mind at some point.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:28.010
Can you tell us about how
you made that decision not

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.000
to follow the path that
you thought you were going

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.300
to follow?

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.200
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I think it
was -- you know, it's funny.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.550
I was just flipping
through the book.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.930
I'm going to read a little bit.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.230
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Sure.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.530
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Because
it's here and it's open

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.830
and it's completely relevant.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.130
It's what you just said.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.430
[ Laughter ]

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.730
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
We did not plan it.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:46.030
[Laughing]

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.330
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: No, no
planning and no planning

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.630
in my life [laughing].

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.930
So I'm just going to
do two paragraphs.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.230
Don't worry.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.530
It won't be long.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.830
Three. I'd come to
BYU to study music

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.470
so that one day I could direct a
church choir but that semester,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.970
the fall of my junior
year, I didn't enroll

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.270
in a single music course.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.970
I could not have explained why
I dropped Advanced Music Theory

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:08.220
in favor of Geography and
Comparative Politics or gave

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.270
up Sight Singing to take
up History of the Jews.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.540
But when I'd seen those
courses in the catalog

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.500
and read their titles aloud,
I had felt something infinite

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.670
and I wanted a taste
of that infinity.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.350
For four months I attended
lectures on geography

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.360
and history and politics.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.000
I learned about Margaret
Thatcher and the 38th parallel

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.830
and the cultural revolution.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.530
I learned about parliamentary
politics

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.900
and electoral systems
around the world.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.700
I learned about the Jewish
Diaspora and the strange history

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.860
at the Protocols of
the Elders of Zion.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.090
By the end of the semester the
world felt big and it was hard

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.940
to imagine returning to
the mountain, to a kitchen,

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.340
or even to a piano in the
room next to the kitchen.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.770
This caused a kind
of crisis in me.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.360
My love of music and my desire
to study it had been compatible

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.040
with my idea of what a woman is.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.050
My love of history and politics
and world affairs was not and

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.030
yet they called to me.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.580
I don't know as though there's a
straightforward answer to that.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.050
I think I'd been raised
with a very strong idea

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.870
of what my life was
supposed to look like.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.510
And there were a number
of alternative paths

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:18.230
that you could take that
all followed very closely

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.530
to that path.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.880
So you could go to
college and study music

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.210
so that you could
be a piano teacher

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.720
because that was complementary
to being a wife and a homemaker

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.290
and that was very much
what I was raised to be.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.610
And there wasn't really
a lot of other avenues.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.000
There were a couple of
things you could do as well

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.730
that might be commensurate
with that.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.250
And I had a big struggle at BYU
because I was drawn to things

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:47.030
that by my own definition of
myself and my own definition

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.980
of what it meant to be
female didn't add up.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.810
I did not understand why
I as a woman was drawn

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.110
to what I thought

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.450
of as unwomanly things
but I definitely was.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:02.370
And it took me a couple of years
of kind of wrestling with that.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.050
And I think I was at
Cambridge, really,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.230
before I started reading
a bit of feminist text.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.610
I was in no way ready
for anything

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.310
that most feminists would
call feminism [laughing],

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.630
but I stumbled on this
passage in John Stuart Mill.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.810
And I've read a lot of
feminist stuff since then.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.730
And this is still the
most powerful thing

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.270
that has resonated
with me, personally.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.850
It's a line that he says.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.150
He says, "of the
nature of women,

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:27.210
nothing final can be known."

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.020
And his argument is all
the social pressure.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.590
Women have been cajoled and
pushed and defined to themselves

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.890
and changed in so
many different ways.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.400
And now we have no idea
what they're capable of.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.700
We just don't know.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.000
We don't know what they are

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.300
because we've been
deforming them for so long.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:43.310
And that was, you know,
that whole absence

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.510
of knowledge was
so appealing to me.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.670
I mean, of the nature of women
nothing final can be known.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.940
Because to me what that felt
like was, whatever I'm drawn to,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.720
whatever I want to
be, I am a woman.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.620
So that must be OK.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.190
And I don't need to find
external definitions

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.430
of what I should be
like, what I should love,

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.840
what I should want to do.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.450
I can just discard all
of that and I can say,

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.310
definitionally you can't say
that women don't like politics,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.480
that women don't like history
because I am one and I do.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.840
So that was incredibly
-- that, just, absence,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.210
to take all of what we think
we know and throw it away

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.670
and make your decisions based on
what you think is right for you.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.920
It was really wonderful for
me and it had nothing to do

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.160
with not wanting family
and not wanting children

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.640
or rejecting that way of life.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.470
It just had to do with accepting
other parts of who I was.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:37.490
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: When you were
at BYU it was very difficult

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.790
for you when you started.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.760
But even in your first semester

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.990
that you were there you
still got very good grades.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.670
You were very successful.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.970
How did you do that?

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:50.220
Do you look back at that moment
in time and are you in sort

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.960
of awe of what you were able
to do and the transition

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.880
and the changes that
you overcame?

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:58.270
How were you successful after
going from no formal education

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:00.970
to a very competitive school?

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.720
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover:
[Sighs] I suffered a lot

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.540
of that first semester
[laughing].

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.730
It was kind of awful, actually.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.030
I remember that.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.110
It was not a happy time.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.170
There was a lot of -- I would
say my first two years at BYU

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.240
where I was learning out
of fear because I had

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.540
to have a scholarship.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:28.430
At BYU to get a scholarship --
I had to have a 3.9 or above.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.730
[Laughs] Which is
basically, I think,

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.320
most semesters I could
get four A's and one A-.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.030
If I got two A-'s
that was risky.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.810
And this is insane.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.900
And I knew I had to have it
because I couldn't come back.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.780
Without that money, there
was no way I was coming back.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.840
And so it was just terror.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.790
I just learned -- I did
the homework obsessively.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.730
I did every extra credit thing.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.030
I did everything I could.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:53.930
When I took a math class, which
was a bad idea [laughing],

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.660
I just killed myself
for that class.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.060
And I failed many of the exams.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.810
And then I made a deal with the
professor that if I got 100%,

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.110
missed nothing on the final,

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.230
that he would forget all the
other horrifying tests I'd taken

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.280
and he would just
score that one.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.220
And so just all I did

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.870
for a month was just
study for that exam.

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.370
And I don't mean
all I did, like,

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.670
I studied an hour or two a day.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.970
I mean, that's all I did.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.280
And you know, that's
one of the things

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.410
for me -- getting a grant.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.280
I'd finally applied for FAFSA.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.630
It took this lovely Mormon
bishop, like kind of equivalent

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.580
of a pastor, who spent
weeks trying to convince me

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.520
that it wasn't evil to
accept government money

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.820
and I was very resistant
to that.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.860
[Laughing] But eventually I
filled out this application.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.410
A check came for $4,000.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:45.040
And I think that was the moment
I stopped learning out of fear

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.250
and started learning
because I wanted to

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.890
and I was interested
in the material.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.550
And that was when the shift
really started to take hold

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.800
of being able to follow
what felt compelling to me

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.880
and what I wanted to learn
and what I wanted to do.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:03.110
That little amount of money
made such a difference to me.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.500
It's difficult to even
compare the way that I studied

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.980
and the way that I attended
school and what school meant

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.650
to me before that
money and after

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.970
that money are completely
different.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:15.540
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: I think, for
me, the most disturbing part

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.260
of your book and your story
stems from your relationship

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.970
with your brother Shawn, who was
certainly emotionally abusive

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.480
and at times physical
abusive towards you.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.290
As your education progressed,
how did that inform you

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.700
to help you understand that
that relationship was a

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.990
disfunctional one?

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.570
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah, I
called the book Educated.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.690
And I think it's about education
but it's not about degrees

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:45.710
and it's not about certificates
and it's not about the job

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:47.330
that you can get if you
have the right degree

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.630
and the right certificate.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.930
I think it's about the ways

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:54.290
that education makes you a
different person and for me

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.850
that took a lot of
different shapes.

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.980
One of the shapes it took
was that I became someone

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.230
that was able to have
different ideas in my head

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.530
than the people around me.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:04.850
And I'd never been
that person before.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.060
I had grown up in an isolated
intellectual environment

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:12.240
where my father gave us the
ideas that he wanted us to have

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.870
because he believed that
was the right thing for us,

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.560
but that's essentially
what he did.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.090
And so his version of history,
his version of everything,

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.460
that's what we learned.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.940
And that bled over in some ways.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.430
I was quite used to people
telling me what had happened.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.450
So my brother Shawn,
he would be violent.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.370
He would be not -- yeah, I
was going to say aggressive

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.670
but just flat out violent.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.200
And almost immediately

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.940
after that would happen
he would convince me

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.390
that it hadn't happened
or that it had been a game

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.650
or that it had been this
kind of fun experience.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.630
I mean, there were
times that he would --

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.740
I mean, there's one example
where he grabbed me by my hair

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.040
and he hauled me
down the hallway

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.340
and he shoved my
head in the toilet.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.030
And a friend of mine
witnessed it.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.580
I was 17 so I actually
had a friend.

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:59.070
And later he said to me, Shawn
said to me, "it's just a game"

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.370
and "I thought we
were having fun"

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.820
and "if something was wrong you
really should have told me."

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.960
And I went to my friend,
Charles, who'd seen it and tried

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.940
to convince him that it was this
game and he wasn't having it.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.610
And at some point
in my time at BYU,

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.610
and it wasn't too long
later, that began to shift.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:18.300
And I began to have my own ideas
about what was happening to me.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.130
And I think it was the
same shift with my father.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.590
My father -- there was
a time when I was at BYU

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.370
that my father came and he
was giving me this lecture

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.290
about Jewish, basically about
these conspiracy theories

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.490
that run wild sometimes.

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.220
He thought Jewish people were
going to start World War III

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.550
so they could consolidate
their power

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.260
and he had some pretty
horrifying ideas about that.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.910
And I recognized some of
the things he was saying

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.650
because I'd taken that
course in Jewish history.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.620
And I knew he was
quoting from the Protocols

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.920
of the Elders of Zion.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.220
He didn't.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.520
He would have been
horrified to think

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.040
that he was quoting something
that Hitler had liked.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.410
You know. But I knew
the history of the text.

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:57.270
I knew that it had been
discredited as a forgery.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:58.920
I didn't know how
he got hold of it,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.480
but I knew what it
was and he didn't.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.070
It was the first time
that I think I'd been able

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.750
to hear my father speak with
such confidence and authority

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.730
in this voice that I'd trusted
more than any other voice.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.130
And I was able to think
to myself, "interesting

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.360
that you think that but I
don't, I don't think that."

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.680
And it was the same switch
that happened with my brother.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.830
Something changed where
he would say to me --

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.060
there was a difficult
incident in a parking lot

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:27.720
where he essentially assaulted
me and he cracked my wrist.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.180
I think he probably broke it.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.040
And it took months to heal.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.180
But within a few minutes of it
or within a few hours he tried

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.070
to convince me that
it had been a game,

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.810
that we were having a good time,
that he hadn't had any idea

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.020
that anything was wrong.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.500
And that was the first night

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:47.160
that even though he told me
that, what I wrote in my journal

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.330
that night was I wrote my
version of the events which was

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.660
that it had been terrifying,
that I'd been screaming at him

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.830
to stop, that he really hurt me,

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.310
that I had no idea
why he was doing that

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.200
but I had definitely asked
him, I had told him not to.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.750
And then I wrote his
version which was

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.050
that it had been this
fun, nice, little game.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.770
And I didn't know which
one was right, like,

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:08.070
would not have that moment.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.430
And within a couple of days
I was prioritizing his,

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.730
if I'm honest with you.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.790
It wasn't a complete progression
but it was the first time,

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:17.100
I think, that my brother
attempted to pose his point

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.730
of view, he attempted
to dominate me

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.470
in this very specific
way, and at the end

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.960
of that process there were
still two minds present.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.650
There were two distinct
minds present

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.020
who had had two different
experiences

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.910
and I hadn't just yielded
my interpretation of things

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:31.360
or my experience
of things to his.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.220
He had one idea of what
happened and that was fine

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.070
but I knew what I'd experienced.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:42.810
And I think education, it
has to be more than something

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.250
that you undertake to get a
degree to get a better job.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.810
I think at its absolute best
it needs to be the acquisition

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.940
of the skills that allow
you to live a fuller live,

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.820
that allow you to
participate in a meaningful way

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.170
in the making of your own mind.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.700
And I think a part of
that is just going to have

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.420
to be learning and
getting the opportunity

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.860
to assess a wide variety of
information and a wide variety

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.220
of different perspectives and
decide what you actually think.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:16.150
And that's how you develop that
skill, that really crucial skill

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:18.630
to have people in your life that
you respect, that you admire,

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.290
that you trust, that
are important to you,

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.650
but you don't necessarily have

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.410
to just think whatever
they think,

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.000
that you can have
your own thoughts

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.100
and your own perspectives
and it can be true

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.690
of conspiracy theories
about, you know,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.920
somewhat anti-Semitic
conspiracy theories [laughing],

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.160
or it can be the
truth of your own life

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.460
and what's happening to you.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.760
But I think that kind
of independence of mind,

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.110
that's what education
should be about.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.350
And it should change the way
that you live and interact

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.370
with people, I think, if
it's a real education.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: As the
story progresses -- oh, yeah.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:55.860
[ Applause ]

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.210
As your story progresses,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:00.640
your educational
achievements are building up.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.940
They proliferate.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.850
And your relationship with your
family -- most of your family,

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.780
not your entire family, most
of your family -- deteriorates.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:11.430
So it becomes an
inverse relationship.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.140
So when did you realize
that these two things

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.280
that were clearly
very important to you,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.810
these two things
weren't going to march

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.600
in concert with each other?

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.610
And how did you deal with that?

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:23.320
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I think
there's different kinds

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.620
of realization.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:25.920
There's the realization
that makes you,

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.220
that you're actually aware.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.680
Then there's the realization
that makes you repress.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.850
[Laughing] And I think
there were a lot of years

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.540
that I was aware of it in a way
that made me not deal with it

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.280
at all and just pretend
like it wasn't happening.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.910
For my family, change was
always going to be hard and one

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.750
of the ways -- I said education
should make you a different

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.150
person and it made me
a different person.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.980
It made me the kind of person
who wasn't necessarily going

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.870
to tolerate the behavior from
my brother that I had been.

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.010
And that was never going to
go down well in my family.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.410
It took me a long
time to realize that.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.730
It took me a long time to
realize that there was nothing

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.260
in the way that I
approached my parents.

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:03.560
There's nothing in the
way that I said it.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.030
There's nothing in
the way that I behaved

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.690
that made them not accept that.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.560
They were just never going to

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.410
and it was always
going to be an issue.

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:13.850
It's so easy in those situations
to blame yourself and think, oh,

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:15.270
if I'd said it in
a different way.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.750
No. I don't think that
was ever going to happen.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.950
And so there was going
to be a point, I suppose,

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:24.520
where that was going
to come to a head.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.030
And I don't know when
exactly I accepted it.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.100
I think probably I
accepted it several years

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.110
after it was true, actually.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:36.900
I think there was a lot
of magical thinking there.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.580
There was a lot of thinking, I
can say this, I can fix this.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.590
There was a lot of me
thinking I can change people

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.150
and of course you can't.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.450
You can't change other people.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.020
You can only change yourself
and that's hard enough.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.830
And so I think it
took me a long time.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.840
I confronted my parents
about my brother.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.560
They immediately told
him what I'd said.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.850
He disowned me.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.880
Then my parents developed
this really lovely idea

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.030
that I was possessed which
was the way they tried

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.730
to explain why I'd said
what I said about him.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.850
And after a couple
of years of that,

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:12.800
I became estranged from them.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:15.170
And that was my choice.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.020
But even then I still
thought I could fix it.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.430
And fundamentally it was
because I wanted to believe

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:23.480
that I could change them.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.740
I could make them into people
that I could have in my life.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:28.040
And I couldn't.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.000
And so then I had a
lot of guilt for a lot

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.300
of years about that decision.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.890
I made a decision to
walk away from them

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.560
and then you feel
like a bad person.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.880
You feel like a bad kid.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.820
You feel like -- are
there any reasons

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:42.250
that a child can walk away
from their own parents?

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.260
And for me for a long time I
thought no, no, there are not.

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:47.980
There are no reasons
that make that OK.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.030
And those were some
of my angriest years

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.650
because I didn't
feel like I deserved

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.740
to have made that decision.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.750
So I was constantly relitigating
in my mind every awful thing

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.520
that they had done,
everything I resented them

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.390
for because I was
trying to justify myself.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.570
And it took me a lot
of years to realize,

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.260
if I could just accept the
decision on my own terms,

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.560
that I did it for myself --

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.860
it was nothing to
do with my father.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.430
It wasn't about whether
he deserved it.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.760
It was just because I needed it.

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:20.260
And once I made it about what I
deserved, about valuing myself,

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.550
and not about being angry
with someone else, you know,

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:28.460
things got a lot more peaceful
and I no longer feel that need

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.310
to just constantly
relitigate everything

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.250
that I dislike about my parents.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.030
I try to keep it in my mind
because I don't want to go back

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.500
and get in that situation again.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.400
But then I can also be
someone who has good memories

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:41.870
about my family and
I can be someone

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.170
who has beautiful memories.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.330
And that's important, I think.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.870
I lived my life for a
couple of years as someone

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.170
who had no good memories.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.490
Everything in my life had
just turned to rot and range

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:54.100
and anger because I was
so mad at my parents

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.400
for what had happened.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:00.390
And it's been a much nicer stage
of life to get to the point

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:05.670
where I value my past.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.810
And there was that time
where I couldn't value it

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.110
because it was painful
to lose it.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.550
And I thought, well, I just
have to say that it was all crap

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:13.190
and it was all terrible and
there's nothing good there

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.390
and so I don't care that I've
lost them because they were bad.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.870
And that was kind of painful

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.870
because then I didn't
have any good memories.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:22.830
And it was a long process to get
to the point where I can say,

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.710
"there was value there;
the love was real;

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:28.610
there were really wonderful
things about them; and I've lost

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:31.300
that and that was a
decision and I stand

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.510
by that decision
for my own sake."

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:40.010
But I don't have to devalue what
I had just because I've lost it.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:43.160
And then I can be someone who
had a beautiful childhood.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.870
I can also be someone who
had a difficult childhood.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.290
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Last
question before we turn it

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.580
over for questions
from the audience.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.630
So, can you catch
us up on your life

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.600
since you published the memoir?

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.470
What do you have planned next?

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.980
Are you writing another book?

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.420
What's next for you
professionally?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.440
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I am trying
to put together a documentary

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.920
about rural education.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.460
Rural kids tend to struggle
a bit more transitioning

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.110
from high school
to the next stage.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.200
Whether that's trade
school or university,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.840
they tend to struggle a bit
more, I think especially

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.420
because of the economic crisis.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.760
You know, small towns are sort
of shrinking for the first time

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.800
in the United States
history and I think a lot

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.100
because of big agriculture.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.650
Family farms are dying.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:32.820
So there's a struggle that's
going on there that I saw

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.610
when I was growing up
that I've continued to see

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.730
as I go back there that I
kind of want to explore.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:41.030
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: OK, terrific.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.730
I'm sure there's
a lot of questions

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.940
from our audience for Tara.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.970
If you have them, please,
there's a number of microphones.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.380
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was curious.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.690
You address it at the end of
your book but I was wondering

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.180
since the book has, you know,
gotten such rave reviews

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.380
and become such a success,
what your relationship is now

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.910
with any members of your
family, with your family,

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.330
or what they think of it.

00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:12.230
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I would say
with some I've gotten closer

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:16.000
to them and with
some it's been rocky.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.400
And I wouldn't have predicted
who those people would be.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.100
There were people that I thought
they were reading the book

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.210
before I even agreed to publish
it, they were happy with it,

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:25.260
and then it's been a
real struggle with them

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.930
that it's become -- you know, we
didn't think this would happen.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.520
This isn't necessarily
what we signed up for.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.140
You know, me even.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.200
This is -- it's great but it's
different than what I imagined.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.100
And then there are
family members --

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.180
I have aunts and cousins that
have been incredibly supportive

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:48.290
that I wasn't expecting that
kind of support from them.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:53.280
And so I feel like I've gained a
lot of family from the process.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.030
But you know, it's a difficult
thing, this kind of story.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.560
There's no way around
it, I think.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.040
If you're going to tell
stories about your life,

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.120
it might be difficult
for people.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.450
And it was difficult for
me, in a way, the decisions

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.470
that I made to write the book.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:11.770
And it's a process.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:16.050
So I would say in general
pretty much the book --

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.900
people have responded the way
that you would expect in a way

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.560
but there have been
some surprises.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.480
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering if
you had strong feelings

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.980
about keeping your experiences
from being replicated

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.400
in other families,
about homeschooling

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.320
and your lack of education.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.620
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah,

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.920
the homeschooling one is a
really difficult question

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:41.140
because I think some people do
a fantastic job homeschooling.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.060
My brother Tyler
homeschools his children

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.380
and I've never seen
better adjusted,

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.680
educated kids [laughs].

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.550
I've just never seen it.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.530
But I think that it's
a difficult question.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.630
It's hard to regulate because
you can't compare one family

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:57.930
of kids.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:59.230
You know, you can't rank them.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:00.530
What do you rank them against?

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.780
Do you rank them
against the local school?

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.570
And what if they
have disabilities?

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:09.820
And I don't have a
policy solution for that.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.170
But I would try to give parents
a bit of advice, I guess,

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.440
which is I would say
think about why you want

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.740
to homeschool your kids.

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.250
If the reason you want to
homeschool your kids is

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:22.760
because you want to keep them
from getting access to points

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.750
of view that you disagree with,
I would say that's probably less

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.390
about education and
probably more about control.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.070
And but if you want
to educate your kids

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.320
because you really believe
you can give them access

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.990
to more points of view and more
ideas and more ways of thinking

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.950
about the world,
I've seen that work.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:45.240
&gt;&gt; Hi. I loved your book.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.350
The whole time I was reading it,

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:51.910
I wanted to know what was
the moment or decision

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.790
where you decided, "I
should share this story"

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.510
because obviously
it's very personal.

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.090
There could be repercussions.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.740
I come from a very
similar background to you

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.510
and that's kind of a
question I deal with.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:06.740
What is the good of sharing it

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.400
but also how it can be
misunderstood or have, you know,

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.660
blowback to the people you love
or even are estranged from?

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.850
So I'm just really
interested in why you decided

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.180
to write it and share it.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.480
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.920
I think the typical way
to approach the book is

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.480
to write a proposal or a
couple chapters and sell that.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:25.450
You find a publisher with that.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:28.540
I couldn't do that and the
reason I couldn't do that is

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.030
because I had no idea if
I would ever want the book

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.570
to be published.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.870
And writing a couple chapters

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.050
or writing an outline,
I had no idea.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:39.710
I just didn't know if
it was something that --

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:42.120
I felt like I had to
be fully convinced

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.400
that it would be a useful thing
[laughing] before I would want

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.700
to put it out there.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.110
And I couldn't do that until
I'd written the whole thing.

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.410
I had to write every word of it.

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.760
And there were parts of it
that were hard for me to write

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.600
about that I didn't want
people to know about.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.380
And in a way I needed the
rest of the story arc for me

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.760
to have the conviction.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.060
I think it was worth
those things

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.360
that I didn't really
want to write.

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.270
And I would never have --

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:07.590
you know, that scene
in the parking lot

00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:09.200
that I described is not
something I'm thrilled

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.500
that people know about me.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.800
That's not fun.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.810
But there are other things that
-- you know, there are other.

00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:17.490
There's the end of that chapter.

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:20.930
And there's the realization
of what it meant

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.390
that is important to me.

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:24.080
And I can't have one
without the other.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.220
And I had to write the
whole book and I had to say,

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.040
on the whole, is this
something I want out there?

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.720
But any individual chapter,

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.770
I guarantee you the
answer would have been no.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.070
No, no, no, no.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.470
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you
for writing it.

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:39.530
[Laughter]

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.550
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: As we watch
you coming of age in the book,

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.460
a theme that emerges is
the difficulty surrounding

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.620
romantic relationships.

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:52.910
And as the book edges towards
conclusion it's indicated

00:34:52.910 --> 00:34:56.430
that you formed a healthier
relationship with a man.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.760
But that's kept pretty quiet.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.110
And I was curious about
the choice not to talk more

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.960
about the emergence of that
relationship in the book

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.630
and that portion of
your coming of age.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.350
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah, I
thought about writing more

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:13.310
about that and in the
end I decided I just --

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.240
the book has so many
things going

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.850
on in it and so many themes.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:21.020
And I wanted to provide
something that was useful

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.010
to people who struggle
with that because I did.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:26.900
At BYU, you know, I'd had this
experience with my brother.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.940
He had a nickname for me
that was -- it was "whore."

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.990
That's not a nice name to
call a 16-year-old girl.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.250
That had really entered into
my self-definition in a way

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.040
that would, combined with a
lot of religious sexual guilt,

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.510
really make relationships
difficult

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.810
for me when I was at BYU.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.160
And so I wrote about that
in the best terms I knew how

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:50.250
because I wanted people to
see, to feel what that was like

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.680
and to hopefully feel what it's
like to let that go and to see

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.060
where their own feelings
come from.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.080
I didn't write -- you know, a
lot of people do write memoirs

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.670
about their kind of
sexual coming of age

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:01.970
and their lives like that.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.460
And I didn't feel like
I had a lot to add.

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.800
I felt like the other
psychological things

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.740
that I explore in the book --

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:11.030
the letting go of certain
definitions that people have

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.520
of you, the letting
into your life of people

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.970
who aren't the stereotype
that you were taught.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.610
You know, I think so
many of us form views

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.060
about what people are like.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.400
Maybe we form a view
-- and I did this --

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.790
of what men are like
based on the men

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.090
that we've had in our lives.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:28.780
And then we go out and we
find people in our lives

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.080
who are those men [laughing]

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.940
and it then confirms
the idea we have.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.630
Well, men are like this and then
we're attracted to those people

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.630
and so we surround
ourselves with them.

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.550
And then it becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:44.910
And I was lucky in that Drew
wasn't like that and the men

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.220
that I dated at BYU
weren't like that.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:49.330
And slowly, by allowing
people into my life,

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.610
they allowed my ideas to change.

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:54.580
And I wanted to show
it that way.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.110
I didn't particularly feel
the need to explore it

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.650
in any other detailed way.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.180
I just wanted the idea to be
this is the idea I had of myself

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.970
and this is how it affected my
ability to connect with people.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.650
And this is the way that
that slowly was let go of.

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:11.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:15.880
Hi. So, a fellow rural Idahoan.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.180
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Welcome.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.480
&gt;&gt; I was wondering.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.820
You were talking about
your future project

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.600
with the transition
from rural education.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.940
And I was wondering, based

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.770
on your own experience you talk
about, you know, going to BYU,

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:34.020
going to Cambridge, Harvard,
talking to President Obama,

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:38.320
all these things that there
really isn't this model

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:42.220
and you might feel like,
whoa, this is happening to me.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.810
What kind of advice
or how did you deal

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.600
with jumping these hurdles

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.420
that just keep getting
higher and higher?

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.720
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I don't know!

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.020
[laughing]

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.320
[ Laughter ]

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:59.850
I kind of feel like -- I feel a
bit like my life is a video game

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.070
at the moment and things
keep happening that I feel

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.760
like will feel real eventually.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.840
But right now, you know,
it's fun but it's kind

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.230
of like I'm dreaming that
these things are happening.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:13.530
And there's a weird feeling

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:16.290
that it doesn't really matter
what I do because it's a dream.

00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:19.490
[Laughing] And one of these
days I'm going to wake up

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:24.790
and realize, oh, no, that
all actually happened.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.950
But no. I think change --
I've had a lot of experiences

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.020
in my life where things have
changed dramatically for me

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.420
and I suddenly had to
function in a new world.

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.060
And I had that at BYU.

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:36.830
And I had that at Cambridge.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:40.790
And I kind of thought that I
was done with the catapult leaps

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:44.040
and just arriving somewhere that
I had no idea how to function.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.810
And then this happened.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.280
And it truly is one

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.800
of the weirdest things that's
ever happened to me [laughing].

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.890
And I don't have a strategy.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.790
I kind of -- my strategy is
find things that make you feel

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:00.170
like yourself and stay
grounded and wait to catch up.

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:03.420
You know, your brain
will eventually catch up.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.960
And until then, try
to remain calm.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.560
[Laughter] And that's
what I'm doing right now.

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.810
I am trying to remain calm.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.190
&gt;&gt; Next question.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.730
&gt;&gt; In your book you go a lot

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.770
into how you learned the
good side of education.

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.100
Through college you started
learning more about the world.

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:29.360
But that can be taken
both ways in terms

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.530
of people can become more like
your brother and your father

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.330
through experiences they have
almost through bad education.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:39.450
What is your opinion on that?

00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.720
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: I think
sometimes it's bad education.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.020
Sometimes it's -- you know,

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.940
I speculate that my
father was bipolar

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.030
and I don't think he got what
he needed to deal with that.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.170
And then, of course,
because he passes that on,

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.370
my brother Shawn was raised
in a stressful environment.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:58.200
He had injuries, a number
of head injuries that he got

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.210
from working for my dad
that were never treated

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:02.850
or mostly not treated.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:07.360
So I think, I don't know
as though I would say

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.100
if they got access to
the kind of education

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.260
that would have changed them.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.560
And maybe they wouldn't
have changed.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:19.670
But I think -- I guess I do
see it that way of I don't feel

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.780
like they had the
opportunities that they needed.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:23.080
And I feel like I did.

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.000
And so I try not to
judge them so harshly

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.710
because they didn't get
the chances that I got.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.500
And maybe they would have
made different decisions

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.150
and maybe there are reasons
for that and you can go

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.450
in that circle forever.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:39.310
But I just feel like, I don't
know why they do the things

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.610
that they do.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.550
I try not to be too judgmental.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.800
But I also try to
have a clear line

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.350
of what I'll tolerate
for myself.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.550
So I won't necessarily put
myself in that situation again,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.040
even though I try not
to be so judgmental

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.610
of why they are the
way they are.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.910
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.210
Thank you.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.720
&gt;&gt; Hi. You just mentioned
coming to kind

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:03.890
of understand your father
is potentially bipolar.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:07.140
Throughout the book,
especially in the second half,

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.070
you kind of describe
a lot of experiences

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:15.210
that are also consistent in
yourself with PTSD and CTPSD.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:17.530
And I was wondering if you
could talk a bit about,

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:22.520
if you are willing, how you
became aware of the kind

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:27.180
of lasting impact that some of
the things you went through had

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.090
and the process of recovery.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.390
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:31.690
I think the whole concept

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:36.280
of mental health is
wildly under-discussed.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.700
It took me a really
long time to recognize

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.150
that I had symptoms of PTSD.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:46.810
I think I had written
the book before

00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:53.080
that was apparent
to me, actually.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:57.310
I think I probably had someone
say it to me and I thought,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.020
oh yeah, that's quite obvious.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.320
[Laughing] Thank you.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.120
Yeah. No, I think I've always
-- I resisted therapy violently

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:07.400
for a really long time
and now I love it.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.710
And I don't -- people
say you have

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:12.030
to have somebody really good
and I think that's fine.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.990
I find it valuable to have
anything, any excuse to sit down

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:20.500
and deal with the things that
otherwise you just repress

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.060
and don't think about.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:24.150
I think it's for me
a very good thing.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:29.020
Maybe other people think
it's better to repress it

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.530
but I think it's --
you take the health

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:34.280
of your physical body seriously.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.550
So why not take the
health of your mind?

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:41.610
Like, why allow things
that happened to you

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:45.930
when you were a kid to determine
your life for 40 years?

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.230
Why do that?

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.710
Just take it seriously
and sort it out

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.010
and liberate yourself from that.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:52.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.610
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Time
for one more question.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.910
&gt;&gt; OK. Hi.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.210
So something that was
hard for me to read

00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:00.400
about in your book was how your
family manipulated religion

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.830
or religious language
in their relationships.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:06.210
So I was wondering have you
been able to find your own faith

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:07.640
in God or spirituality?

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:08.940
&gt;&gt; Tara Westover: Yeah.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.240
I put a note at the
beginning of the book

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.400
that says it's not a book about
Mormonism and the reason I did

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.970
that is because I didn't
want people to use this story

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:17.860
to caricaturize unkindly
people of faith in general.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.630
My experience is people can be
very kind and very empathetic

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.930
or they can be very cold
and very self-serving.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.230
And I haven't really noticed

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:23.530
that religion is the
determining factor for that.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:24.830
For my own beliefs,
you know, I was raised

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:26.130
in a very extreme
religion and when I went

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:27.430
to mainstream Mormon faith,
I kind of converted to that

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:28.730
for a while and that didn't
sit perfectly with me either,

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:30.030
mostly because of gender issues.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:31.330
And now I think for me the idea

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.630
of faith has just had
to bend a little bit.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:33.930
It's just had to change.

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:35.230
And there's a really --

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.530
what I think of as one of
the key chapters of the book

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:37.830
which I've titled
after Hebrews 11:1 --

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:39.130
or it might be Hebrews 1:11.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:40.430
And one of them is about a
dog, so it's not that one.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.730
[ Laughter ]

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.030
But the one is that faith
is the substance of things,

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.370
the essence of things not seen.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.700
And I think for anyone
who's had a difficult life,

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.680
who's had to say goodbye to
important people in their life,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.100
who's trying to do those kind of
difficult psychological things,

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.010
I'm going to redefine
what I think romantic

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:56.310
relationships are.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:58.400
I'm going to redefine what I
think family relationships are.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.430
A lot of times you have
to believe in a world

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.510
that is not seen, that you
haven't experienced yet.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.460
And that is true of
education and it's true

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.020
of many other things
where if you're reaching

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.320
for something better
and different

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.680
than what you have, it is faith.

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.980
That's what it is.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.840
It's faith in something
that you haven't seen yet

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:18.240
but you choose to believe in it.

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.200
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Tara
will be signing copies

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.990
of her book downstairs
later this afternoon.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:26.450
Please join me in thanking Tara
Westover for joining us today.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.450
