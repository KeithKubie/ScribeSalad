00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.650
- [Narrator] In previous
videos we've talked at length

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.870
about fiscal policy and in other videos

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.600
we've talked at length
about monetary policy.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.240
But now we're going to
talk about them together

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.820
because at any given time in a country

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.720
there is some type of
fiscal policy going on

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.810
and in parallel there might be

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.540
some type of monetary policy going on.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.510
But first let's just remind
ourselves what fiscal policy is.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.300
This would be government
changing the amount of taxes

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.750
or government spending.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.400
So this is all about taxes and or

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.130
and or, government,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.080
government spending.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.060
And why would that matter?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.590
Well if you change the amount of taxes

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.450
you would change the amount
of money that individuals

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360
and or corporations might have

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.890
which might change aggregate demand.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.150
Similarly, if the
government goes out there,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.150
spends more or less, that also
would change aggregate demand

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.660
and this could be used as
a tool in order to attempt

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.760
to engineer what the economy's output is.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.790
Now monetary policy on the other hand,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.930
it's very important not
to, not to get confused

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.990
between these two.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.920
This is all about central, central banks.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.820
And I know a lot of you might be thinking,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.230
hey isn't the central bank
part of the government?

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.230
And I would tell you, well it depends

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.600
what country you're in and depends

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.190
how you view part of the government.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.970
In the United States for example,

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.690
the Federal Reserve System
is quasi-independent.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.287
It is true that the
executive makes appointments

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:33.980
including the chairman of
the Federal Reserve Bank,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.990
but it should be acting independently

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.377
from the federal government.

00:01:37.377 --> 00:01:42.330
Now this is all about central
banks changing money supply,

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.853
so money supply,

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.820
to impact or to target
oftentimes, interest rates.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.382
And now why would this matter
if we're thinking about

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:55.790
engineering, so to speak,
where we are relative to

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.390
full employment output?

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.800
Well with low interest
rates, borrowing is cheaper

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.840
so people might be willing
to borrow and spend more

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.110
or corporations might be willing
to borrow and invest more.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.450
On the other hand if you
had higher interest rates

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.500
it would go the other way.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.830
Either way you have an
impact on aggregate demand.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.710
So with that primer out of the way,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.253
let's look at two different
scenarios for an economy.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.570
So in this first scenario,
let's call this scenario one,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.770
pause the video and think
about where this economy

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.543
is operating relative to
full employment output.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.250
Well you can see here that
our equilibrium level of

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.640
output, Y sub one, is below
our full employment output.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.210
So here we have a negative output gap.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.680
And so from the federal
government's point of view

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.530
they might wanna say, hey
let's do some expansionary

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.360
fiscal policy in order to shift
the aggregate demand curve

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.570
to the right.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.040
Well what would be
expansionary fiscal policy?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.150
Well you could lower taxes.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.460
That could shift aggregate
demand to the right.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.830
People would have more
money in their pockets.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.640
Corporations might have
more money to spend with,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.210
to invest with.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.581
The other option is that
the government could just

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.760
directly spend more.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.100
If it spends more that
also would have the impact

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.580
of shifting aggregate demand to the right.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.790
But in parallel with the fiscal policy,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.090
what might the monetary policy look like?

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.425
Well an expansionary
monetary policy would be to

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:25.090
increase the money supply.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.690
Increase the money supply with the goal,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.170
which would have the impact,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.810
or usually would have the impact,

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.600
of lowering interest rates

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.430
which would make borrowing cheaper.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.700
And so corporations might invest more

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.640
and people might borrow and spend more.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.428
Either way, or especially
if both is happening,

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:47.870
you are going to shift
aggregate demand to the right.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.550
So with this expansionary
fiscal and monetary policy

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.710
you might get to a situation like this.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.982
Maybe aggregate demand gets shifted enough

00:03:55.982 --> 00:03:59.410
so we get to a world like this.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.090
So that's aggregate demand curve two.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.500
We're now, our equilibrium
level of output,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.330
we're at full employment output

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.920
and our price level has gone,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.860
has gone up.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.970
And generally speaking,
expansionary policy

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.360
whether we're talking about
expansionary fiscal policy

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.500
or expansionary monetary policy,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.640
you're going to see the price level go up.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.670
Now let's look at scenario two here.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.630
What are we dealing with here?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.990
Well as you can imagine
it's the opposite situation.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.970
We have a positive output gap.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.590
Our equilibrium level of output

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.110
is above our full employment output.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.010
And so this is a situation
where the federal government

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.130
might say, hey our economy
is at risk from overheating.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.620
That's typically not what they say.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.140
They tend to like it 'cause
it's good for winning election.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.380
But they might say, if it's
a prudent federal government,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.500
they might say hey this
is the time to maybe

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.490
pay down some of the government debt.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.020
Or be a little bit more
fiscally responsible.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020
And so what they might do is have

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.650
a contractionary fiscal policy.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.260
So that would be taxes
might increase and or

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.260
government, government
spending might go down.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.890
Neither of these things
tend to be very popular.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.000
In general contractionary fiscal policy

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.140
is not a good way to win elections.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.800
But a prudent government
might be willing to do this

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800
and either of them,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.810
because of the same reasons
we just talked about,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.010
might have the effect of

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.490
shifting aggregate demand to the left.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.540
Similarly, the Federal
Reserve might wanna do a

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.730
contractionary monetary policy.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.530
And contractionary monetary
policy is far more common.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.240
Where the Federal Reserve says, hey

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.150
when we are producing above
our full employment output

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.460
inflation might get out of control.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.530
So what they might do is
lower the money supply,

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.000
money supply,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.480
which would have the impact,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.230
or usually would have the impact,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.890
of increasing interest rates
making borrowing more expensive

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.900
so people might borrow and spend less

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.260
and corporations might invest less.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.130
And so either way you
might have the effect

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.120
of shifting aggregate demand to the left.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.710
So aggregate demand
might look like this now.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.550
That's aggregate demand two.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.690
Our equilibrium level of output now

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.490
is at full employment output.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.490
And now our price level, our
price level, has gone down.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.390
And generally speaking,
contractionary monetary policy

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.760
and or contractionary fiscal
policy will have the impact

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.060
of at least slowing down inflation.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.160
I'll leave you there.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.550
The big takeaway here is, fiscal
policy and monetary policy

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:41.220
seldom act in isolation.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.260
Oftentimes when we're
at a negative output gap

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.970
you have expansionary
policies in both dimensions.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.493
And in a positive output
gap it might be prudent

00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:53.290
to have contractionary
policies in both dimensions.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.980
Now one question you might ask is

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.910
what if they go in opposite directions?

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.130
What if, say, fiscal
policy is expansionary

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.390
while monetary policy is contractionary?

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.480
Well there it depends.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.040
They might offset each other.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.180
In fact, sometimes the
central bank might have

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.100
a contractionary policy because they think

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.450
that the federal government
is being too expansionary.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.503
All interesting things to think about.
