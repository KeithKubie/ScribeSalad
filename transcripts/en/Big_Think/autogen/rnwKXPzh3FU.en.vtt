more humans but you still end up with a
human so I'm not sure humans would

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
human so I'm not sure humans would
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.280
human so I'm not sure humans would
evolve much on Mars unless there really

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290
evolve much on Mars unless there really
 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.759
evolve much on Mars unless there really
was selection pressure only women that

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
was selection pressure only women that
 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.190
was selection pressure only women that
could handle the Martian gravity only

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200
could handle the Martian gravity only
 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.690
could handle the Martian gravity only
the offspring that could handle the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700
the offspring that could handle the
 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.180
the offspring that could handle the
Martian gravity would do well

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190
Martian gravity would do well
 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.610
Martian gravity would do well
only the humans offspring that could

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620
only the humans offspring that could
 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.800
only the humans offspring that could
handle ultraviolet light perhaps or

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810
handle ultraviolet light perhaps or
 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.320
handle ultraviolet light perhaps or
could hander handle bitter cold even

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330
could hander handle bitter cold even
 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.730
could hander handle bitter cold even
when you have a spacesuit there might be

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740
when you have a spacesuit there might be
 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.700
when you have a spacesuit there might be
cold extremities your fingers and

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710
cold extremities your fingers and
 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.110
cold extremities your fingers and
but that selection pressure would be

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120
but that selection pressure would be
 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.560
but that selection pressure would be
really slow and I just save it all the

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570
really slow and I just save it all the
 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.670
really slow and I just save it all the
time a science base on Mars yes let's go

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680
time a science base on Mars yes let's go
 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.120
time a science base on Mars yes let's go
a human colony where your families are

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130
a human colony where your families are
 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.940
a human colony where your families are
going to retire and or raise kids and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950
going to retire and or raise kids and
 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.460
going to retire and or raise kids and
build playgrounds as it that's a lot

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470
build playgrounds as it that's a lot
 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.350
build playgrounds as it that's a lot
harder thing but you're asking a great

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360
harder thing but you're asking a great
 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.210
harder thing but you're asking a great
great question Victor look at the movie

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220
great question Victor look at the movie
 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.780
great question Victor look at the movie
and see what you think carry on
