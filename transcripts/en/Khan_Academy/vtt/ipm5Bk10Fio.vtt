00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.019
- [Instructor] One idea
that we're going to keep

00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:04.432
coming back to in our study of government

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:07.400
is the notion of public policy

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.620
and how public policy is actually made

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.984
and what we're gonna do in this video

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:13.440
is focus on what you could consider to be

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.638
the five stages of the policy process

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:18.548
and I'll use a very simple example

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:21.819
to make those stages tangible.

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.957
So, the first stage of
the public policy process

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:29.647
is identifying issues or agenda-setting,

00:00:29.647 --> 00:00:30.480
so agenda.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:36.493
Agenda-setting right over
here or identifying issues.

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:38.176
An example of that, and
this is actually something

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:40.726
that is going on near my house right now,

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:42.513
is that there is an intersection

00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:44.520
about two blocks from my house,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.630
so let me see if I can
draw this intersection.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.315
So, looks something like this
and it's a two-way stop sign,

00:00:52.315 --> 00:00:55.650
so you have a stop sign right over there.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.942
You have a stop sign right over there

00:00:57.942 --> 00:01:02.484
and the problem is you have
this large park in this corner

00:01:02.484 --> 00:01:05.313
right over there and
there's also a school here

00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:08.525
and so in the morning there's
a lot of kids and parents

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.183
going on their bicycles
or walking to school,

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:12.688
but the problem is there's
also a lot of parents

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:15.549
who might be late for school
and they're going in their cars

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.972
and they're going quite
fast down this road

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:20.059
and it's a two-way stop and so even though

00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:22.807
there's a lot of kids
that are waiting to cross

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:25.632
right over here, and
there's no crossing guard,

00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:28.054
so there's a lot of kids and
parents walking right here,

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.847
they have to wait and you can imagine,

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:30.910
this is an elementary school.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.172
These cars are going by really fast.

00:01:33.172 --> 00:01:37.012
It's quite dangerous, so
the agenda here is that,

00:01:37.012 --> 00:01:39.946
well, how do you make
this safer and easier

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:43.582
for families to cross the
street on the way to the park?

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:45.596
So, the example here.

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:47.096
How to make easier

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:54.630
to cross the street at that intersection?

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:01.231
Now, once you determine the
problem that you want solved,

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.551
you do the agenda-setting, the next step

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:06.167
is to formulate some type of a policy,

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:10.534
so I'll call that step
two, would be policy,

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:12.117
policy formulation.

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:16.317
So, one potential idea here is,

00:02:16.317 --> 00:02:20.048
well, why don't we just make
this into a four-way stop?

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:22.542
So we could put some paint
here to make it clear

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.464
that people are going
to cross on all sides

00:02:25.464 --> 00:02:28.010
and we'll put two more stop signs

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.893
to make this a four-way stop

00:02:30.893 --> 00:02:34.328
and so let's say that
this is our current plan

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:36.588
as we say, hey, we're
making this tangible.

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:39.921
We're going to implement a four-way stop

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:42.158
at that intersection.

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:44.178
Now, that's not the only
solution that's possible.

00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:46.243
Maybe some type of speed bumps

00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:48.776
might be in order right over
here and right over here.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.463
Maybe they implement some
type of crossing guard

00:02:51.463 --> 00:02:54.478
or maybe you put one of
those flashing blinking signs

00:02:54.478 --> 00:02:55.839
that tell people their speed limits

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:58.433
so that they go slower, so
there's many different ways

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:02.181
to formulate ideas that
will address this agenda,

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:03.426
that will address these problems,

00:03:03.426 --> 00:03:04.982
but let's say that we do a study

00:03:04.982 --> 00:03:06.431
and we decide that a four-way stop

00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:09.645
is the policy that we want to pursue.

00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:11.114
Well, then the next step after that

00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:14.317
is to convince other people
that this is a good idea,

00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:17.292
so step three right over here

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:20.459
we could call policy, policy adoption.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.743
Adoption or legitimization,
and in my context,

00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:30.968
it might involve going to the city council

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:33.895
maybe with some traffic
experts, some safety experts.

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.667
Maybe I could go gather
the community here,

00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:39.203
petition so that a lot of
people in the community here

00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:42.071
agree that a four-way
stop would be in order

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:44.283
and let's say the city council
and the police department

00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:46.696
and all the various stakeholders
who have to buy in say,

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:50.170
"Yes, we are going to implement
a four-way stop here."

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.046
And then they implement it

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:53.765
and so once the policy is adopted,

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:57.314
the next thing is, well, you've
gotta actually implement it,

00:03:57.314 --> 00:03:59.055
so I'll call that step four.

00:03:59.055 --> 00:03:59.888
Policy,

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:03.128
policy implementation.

00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:04.378
Implementation.

00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:08.829
Mentation, and in this case,
it's pretty straightforward.

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.113
Someone needs to show up and
install those stop signs.

00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:15.067
Maybe they're gonna put
some markers over here

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:16.656
to make it more clear that people

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.592
are going to cross the street
as they go on to the park,

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:21.353
but that would be the implementation.

00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:25.089
Now, the last step in
this public policy cycle

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:27.204
or this process, and you'll
see it really is a cycle,

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:30.383
is to just assess it, to
evaluate how things are going,

00:04:30.383 --> 00:04:33.938
so the next step, we'll call
this step five right over here,

00:04:33.938 --> 00:04:36.188
would be policy assessment.

00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:38.532
Assessment.

00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:43.614
Or evaluation and so one possibility

00:04:43.614 --> 00:04:46.097
is to go survey people in the community.

00:04:46.097 --> 00:04:48.287
Has that solved the problem?

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:49.896
Has it created new problems?

00:04:49.896 --> 00:04:51.277
Is there a traffic issue now

00:04:51.277 --> 00:04:53.675
because people have to
go to the four-way stop?

00:04:53.675 --> 00:04:55.800
And whatever the assessment says,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.896
the assessment might say, "Hey,
everything's perfect now,"

00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:59.863
and then you don't really have to worry

00:04:59.863 --> 00:05:02.401
about this problem anymore,

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:04.492
but maybe there's a new traffic problem

00:05:04.492 --> 00:05:06.983
and now that'd be another issue to address

00:05:06.983 --> 00:05:08.869
and you would have to go
through the cycle again

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:11.676
or maybe it hasn't
addressed the speed issue

00:05:11.676 --> 00:05:12.850
and so maybe you need to think about,

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.147
well, how do we slow cars
down or whatever else?

00:05:15.147 --> 00:05:19.054
And we would keep going through
this public policy process

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:21.908
or this, really this cycle
that we're talking about.

00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:23.853
Now, the example that I just gave,

00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:25.467
this is a very simple example

00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:27.838
at a corner two blocks from my house

00:05:27.838 --> 00:05:29.167
and this is actually
something I'm thinking about.

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:31.614
I'm thinking about going to
the city council about this,

00:05:31.614 --> 00:05:35.443
but as you can imagine, as
we go into much deeper things

00:05:35.443 --> 00:05:37.390
that are affecting people
at the federal level,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.872
healthcare, taxes, whatever else,

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:42.337
each of these steps can be quite involved

00:05:42.337 --> 00:05:46.368
and it can even take years
to do any one of these steps.
