00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:21.300
So there's a great
line that says

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.630
that sex is a disappointing
answer to life's riddle

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.445
and that love is ultimately
a religious problem.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.840
What we hope to get with love is
what we failed to get with God.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.580
Once we dispensed with God,
or once Nietzsche told us

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.130
that God is dead, we needed
something else to believe in.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.230
And so now we deify the other.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.380
When in love, they
are like the wind.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.130
They are our salvation.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.330
She becomes the sun.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.640
What we really hope to gain
from love is completion.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.940
It's transcendence.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.100
It's immortality now.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.270
It's stepping off
that people mover

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630
that's carrying everyone
else towards death.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.000
It's transcending
the human condition.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.470
By merging with an
incarnation of the divine,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.190
we might be saved too.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.040
Ultimately when we fall
in love, it's a prayer.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.310
It's a sacrifice.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.370
We give ourselves and hope
that this beam of light

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.040
will save us from
our animal condition.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.970
We can dispense from
being gods with anuses

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.990
and being just gods.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260
You know, the whole purpose
of the human condition

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.470
is to leave our animality behind
and become the symbolic beings,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.390
the self-creating
beings that we are,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.690
this recursive self-aware,
self-creating consciousness

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.860
that is constantly
scripting, and rewriting,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.080
and editing its own
subjective unfolding as mind,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.710
mind constantly trumping matter.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.480
We can sense the divine
within ourselves.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.320
We see the divine within
ourselves, the namaste.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.390
And we just reach out and
try to get it from the other.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.360
And perhaps the impulse to
find salvation in the other

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.020
is a mistake.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.540
And perhaps the answer is
in our creativity instead.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.936
I don't know, just a thought.
