00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.700
Okay, so, good. We've got one, each person, we know how much they spent.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.360
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.490
&gt;&gt; Next we want to know, at the festival, how much money have we collected.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, in order to be able to display that, we need to create a report.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.990
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I'm going to click Reports.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.400
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.850
&gt;&gt; Think I'm figuring this out, Sam.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.850
&gt;&gt;

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.360
[LAUGH]

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.790
And we want to create a new report.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.540
&gt;&gt; So, I'll click New Report. What do I do next?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; So these are mainly all off of the

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.350
standard objects, but we want to use our attending object.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.920
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.670
&gt;&gt; So.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.210
&gt;&gt; I'll quick find it?

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.810
&gt;&gt; Quick find it.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.060
&gt;&gt; Activities with attendees.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.490
&gt;&gt; So, those are part of the solution

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.750
&gt;&gt; package. So, definitely not those. I, I don't know if you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.430
remember earlier when we were creating the attendee object, how those little

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.510
check boxes at the bottom of the edit screen.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.850
&gt;&gt; It sounds vaguely familiar.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So one of them was to be able to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.670
report on that object, so we'd need to check that box.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; okay. So I'm going to go to attendees, and view the object itself.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.040
&gt;&gt; Yep. Now a little bit different from before, we're just

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.010
going to edit the object completely. So just click that little edit button.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.820
&gt;&gt; This looks familiar, right?

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.239
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so right there, optional features,

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.290
allow reports.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.960
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Save. And then

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.250
&gt;&gt; Now

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.100
&gt;&gt; I think, yeah, I'm just going to go through and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.950
do this for all the other stuff we might want to remember.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.280
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.180
&gt;&gt; So like what, festivals, bands?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.150
&gt;&gt; Festivals, bands, stages, sounds good.
