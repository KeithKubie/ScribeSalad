00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.180
Oh nipples, without you chests would be pointless.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.310
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.780
Nipples: everybody has them, but you probably
don’t pay them much attention.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.910
That is unless you’re cold, aroused, or
talking about science and your little bosom

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.330
buddies decide to stand at attention for all
the world to see.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.000
How do nipples get hard, and what purpose
does this serve?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.110
Answering the how is a bit easier than answering
the why, especially thanks to a recent study

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.410
published in Nature Neuroscience.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.350
Researchers were interested in the sympathetic
nervous system, which is most known for its

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.079
role in the fight or flight response.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.460
If you’re not familiar with it, of course
we’ve covered it, and you can check out

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.600
that video to learn about it in-depth.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.220
But back to the researchers -- When they were
examining the sympathetic nervous system in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.290
mice, the researchers found that it was more
specialized to respond to specific stimuli

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.920
than previously assumed.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.239
The scientists followed nerves in the system
from where they originated in the spinal cord

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.430
to where they connect to other structures
like the blood vessels, muscles, and yes,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
nipples.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.449
They found there were 8 distinct types of
neurons wired to specific areas, each expressing

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.080
different genes and responding to different
stimuli.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.320
So there is actually a type of neuron that
exists just to make your nipples erect.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.310
When these neurons are activated by the neurotransmitter
norepinephrine, they cause erector muscles

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.950
to contract, tightening your areola and causing
your milk duds to harden.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.110
Titillating as this information is, it still
doesn’t answer why nipples need to get hard

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.200
in the first place.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.700
What’s the point of the point?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.200
The most obvious reason is for breast feeding.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.570
A baby’s suckling reflex is activated when
something strokes the roof of their mouth,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.090
so a stiff nipple will help get the little
sucker to latch on for a meal.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.420
But what about when it’s time to make a
baby, or when it’s cold, or when nipples

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.549
go rogue and pitch a shirt-tent for no obvious
reason?

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.340
Science is a little more perplexed about that.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.510
It’s possible that hard nipples are supposed
to serve as a signal of arousal, but it’s

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.880
a pretty terrible signal if it also shows
up just because it’s cold.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.560
That’s like having a thermometer where all
the numbers are replaced with winking emojis,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
it tells you nothing!

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.540
It’s possible we get nipply when it’s
nippy because the muscles in our areolas and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.310
under our hair follicles respond to the same
stimuli.4 The scientists who discovered what

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.609
I will heretofore call the “nipple neuron”
found another kind of neuron that also responds

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.379
to norepinephrine and causes your hair to
stand on end4.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.239
This might be a vestigial trait from when
we were more hirsute, and our hair puffed

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.129
out to trap air and keep us warmer.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.540
It’s also frequently suggested our hair
rises in stressful situations in an effort

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.999
to make us look bigger.

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:27.150
You can imagine how puffed out hair would
be helpful when you’re being attacked by

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.349
a predator, though it’s a little harder
to see how stiff nips will intimidate a bear.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.329
Maybe it’ll think you’re aroused and be
kind of weirded out.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:38.329
If the only surefire reason nipples get stiff
is to help with breastfeeding, then why do

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.129
men even have nipples?

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.040
It’s a classic question, and it’s one
that deserves a classic episode, so I’ll

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:58.959
let Laci Green explain it here.

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.670
The human body is totally fascinating and
awesome and if there are any weird bodily

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.870
phenomenons you’d like us to explain, tell
us!
