00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.190
Fitness affects us all.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.150
And many times, we do fitness
activities throughout the day

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.530
without even being
aware of it, like

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.140
when you're walking up
the stairs to your office,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.000
or when you run after your bus,
or when you enthusiastically

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.268
play video games during
your coffee break.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.790
The good thing is
that Google Fit

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.250
can keep track of all
of these activities

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.990
so you get credit for all that
exercise that you're doing.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.230
And here's where you
developers come in,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.480
because all these
activities Google Fit

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.120
can keep track of opens up
the opportunity for new apps

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.650
to be created-- apps that
have never been seen before.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.070
That's what's called a
window of opportunity.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.390
Let's have a look.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.360
Kicking it off
with martial arts,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.650
you can now record
your fitness activities

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.321
while performing martial
arts, like this guy over here.

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.169
[KARATE SOUNDS]

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.405
But martial arts is only
one of the supported sports

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:18.200
that has a punch to it.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.532
Boxing is another classical one,
like what this guy is doing.

00:01:22.532 --> 00:01:25.787

[BELL]

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.080
But there is so much more
you can do with Google Fit.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.370
Dancing, for example,
has another punch to it,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.008
like you can see over here.

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:42.992
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.660
But Google Fit is not
limited to that either.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.200
It supports all of
the classical sports--

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.550
for example, American football
that you can see here.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.090
[GROANING]

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.790
We'll save the details
for the studio.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.490
So as you see, there are
many different activities

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.570
in Google Fit, and we have
only touched on a few of them.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.890
There are lots more, like
playing tennis, or golf,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.770
or doing jumproping, or
playing hockey, or meditation,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.200
aerobics, rock
climbing, kayaking,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.940
or even Zumba dancing.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.280
Google Fit supports over
100 different activities.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.910
So what are you waiting for?

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.980
Get your coding engine
started, and go out there

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.870
and create that next viral
app using Google Fit.
