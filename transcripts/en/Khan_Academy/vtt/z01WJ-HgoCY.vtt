00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.150
I'm back, and I just
have to finish up

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.505
problem number eighteen.

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:06.275
I just want to make
sure I did this.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:12.910
10 minus x squared, this will
be x squared minus 20x, plus

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.790
100, plus 225.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.180
This is where I always
mess up.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.930
Let's see, what's
325 minus 289?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.650
It's 25 plus 11, so it's 36.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.400
So we're left with 0 is
equal to x squared

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.240
minus 20x plus 36.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.390
And now we just have to factor
this right here.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.640
I'll do it up here.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.400
So what two numbers, when you
multiply them, is equal to 36,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.770
and when you add or subtract
them, you get minus 20?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.020
What do you get, let's see.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.180
18 and 2.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.775
18 times 2 is 36.

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:03.420
And if you make them both
negative when they add, they

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.440
go to negative 20.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.620
That's x minus 18,
and x minus 2.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.000
I just factored this as x
minus 18 and x minus 2.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.750
And you can review my
presentation on factoring

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.820
quadratics if you forgot
how to do this.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.970
But I just said, well
18 times 2 is 36.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.860
And they have to be negative,
because when they add together

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.196
you get minus 20.

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:35.930
So x could be equal to 18,
or x could be equal to 2.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.380
And those are the possible
choices.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.840
And that's it.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.930
This was a short video,
just a leftover from

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.440
problem number eighteen.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.450
I'll see you in the next
