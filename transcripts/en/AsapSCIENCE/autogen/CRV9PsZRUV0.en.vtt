00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.610
 We all have an internal dialogue within our minds - to remind yourself to drive your mobile phone 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.680
 Bill, or even the exercise is a difficult conversation with a friend. But what if this sound becomes 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.680
 Sounds that are out of your control? 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.819
 Psychologist Julian Jaynes suggested that not all human voices should be heard 

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:22.609
 - internally created from the right hemisphere of the brain, but seen as external from the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.710
 In the left hemisphere (of the bilateral legislative system). As a result these sounds were seen as contacts 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.270
 Of the gods. But around 1000 BC BC, with the rise of modern consciousness, these sounds 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.390
 It is recognized as our own. Some psychiatrists believe that the brains of people schizophrenia 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.740
 May return to this state, and some of their ideas are recognized as their property. 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.850
 Schizophrenia is a disease that affects the nervous system, affecting approximately 1% of the 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.579
 population. To be clear, schizophrenia is not the same as "multiple personality 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.250
 disturbance'. Symptoms of hallucinations often include: seeing things that are not there, to 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.440
 Illusions such as high belief in the plot, high rates of depression, the most prominent 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.640
 Hear voices. Hearing hallucinations occur in many disorders - from simple sounds to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.600
 Words or names that are called - but sounds heard in schizophrenic patients are quite different. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.149
 Often they are associated with the current psychological state, and can be very hostile, accusing, 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.200
 Threat or persecution (58); ultimately embody many of their fears. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.229
 A 2006 study found more than 3,000 schizophrenic patients that genes related to immune function 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.869
 May play a role - specifically a complement of 4 or C4 genes. C4 is a gene concerned 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.639
 In pruning the synapses in the brain. For example, teen minds undergo a process 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:43.630
 Known as 'synaptic pruning' in which unused connections are cut off to help our brains 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.350
 efficiency. But in individuals with schizophrenia, this C4 gene may be excessive and cut off 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.130
 Areas that participate in planning, perception and thinking. The links are also made between 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.389
 Microbes in the intestines - after all, microbes that have lived within us have also emerged 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.200
 The immune response and development modify the brain's effect. One study found that lactic acid 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.259
 Bacteria have been significantly more abundant in people with schizophrenia, while another 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.070
 Found that the prevalence of fat and glucose abnormalities is significantly higher in patients with 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.660
 Schizophrenia. 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.780
 Although schizophrenia is diagnosed and is based primarily on behavior and reported experiences, 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.530
 Research has found the cause to be a combination of these genetic factors with some environmental 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.120
 Stressors such as growing up in an urban area, minority position, and even cannabis 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.340
 THC has also been used to exaggerate a psychological response in some individuals with genetic or developmental risks 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.950
 Shock . 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.000
 Currently, a medicine for schizophrenia focuses mostly on the fight against hallucinations and delusions 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.260
 Unfortunately, 49.5% of patients with schizophrenia do not end up taking medication for them. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.340
 This is why genetic research is so important to fight this disease. Of course, some 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.860
 People can not recover through a combination of medications, advice and support that 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.780
 It can greatly reduce symptoms. 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.790
 On AsapTHOUGHT we talk about how a stain on mental health is a serious issue in our culture and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.910
 The media. Many of us contribute negatively to the stereotype of mental illness without 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.230
 So achieve it - so we break 5 ways that we all can reduce the mental health stigma right 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.950
 right Now. Check it out with the link below.
