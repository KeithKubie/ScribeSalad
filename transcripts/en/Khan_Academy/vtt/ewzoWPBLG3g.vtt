00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.440
We are on problem 7.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.705
Let me draw what they
have drawn.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.810
They drew a right triangle.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.380
The right triangle looks
something like this.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.990
And then they drew
another triangle.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.150
And it looks like an isosceles
triangle, although we can't

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.600
assume anything in this life.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.795
Nothing comes for free.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:34.950
So this is x.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.410
This is y.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.560
u, v, w.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.590
Those are the angles.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.790
In the triangles above, what
is the average-- arithmetic

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.860
mean-- of u, v, w, x, and y?

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.310
So you have to just add up the
sum of the angles and then

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.420
divide by the number
of angles.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:03.020
So we want to take u plus v plus
w plus x plus y, and then

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.239
divide by the number
of angles.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.030
So there's one, two, three,
four, five angles.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.630
First question.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.250
What is u plus v plus w?

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.065
Well, they form the angles in
a triangle, so they're going

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:19.740
to add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.820
And what's x plus y?

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.680
Well, it's a right triangle.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.875
And all three of these angles
have to add up to 180.

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:33.080
x plus y plus this 90 have
to add up to 180.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.480
So x plus y is going
to be equal to 90.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.580
Just subtract 90 from
both sides.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.200
So x plus y is equal to 90.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.640
So if we take the sum of the
top, 180 plus 90, that's 270.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.650
Divided by 5.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.920
5 goes into 270-- 5,
25, 7, 20, 54.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.036
So the average is 54 degrees.

00:01:59.036 --> 00:02:03.180
That's the arithmetic mean
of all of those angles.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.430
And that is choice E.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.230
Next problem.

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:14.050
I just inadvertently switched
back to my bad-luck yellow.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.920
All right.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.870
Problem 8.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:25.510
Looks like they've drawn--
It looks like a ray.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.642
I'm going to put an
arrow on one side.

00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:31.860
Let me switch colors.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.120
They say that this is
x to the third.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.940
This is x squared.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.040
This is x.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.970
If x, x squared, and x to the
third lie on a number line in

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.090
the order shown above, which of
the following could be the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.680
value of x?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.910
So the first thing we know, x
has got to be-- well, the

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.240
first thing we know, that
x is a positive number.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.940
How do I know that?

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.330
Because if x was not a positive
number-- well, let me

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.690
think about that.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.590
Right.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.810
x has to be a positive number.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.770
Because-- let me put
it this way.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.270
If any negative number-- let's
say it's negative 1/2.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.090
If you square negative 1/2,
you get positive 1/4.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.080
So for any negative number,
the square is going to be

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.420
bigger than the number itself.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.550
So we know that x is
greater than 0.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.210
That's one thing we know.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.670
What else do we know?

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.410
We also know that x is going
to be less than 1.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.000
How do I know that?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.640
Because x squared
is less than x.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.680
And that only applies for
numbers less than 1.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.870
Because 1/2 squared is
equal to 1/4, and 1/4

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.280
is less than 1/2.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.990
So we also know that
x is less than 1.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.520
So we just have to find a choice
where x is greater than

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.240
0 and less than 1.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.390
And if we look at the choices,
greater than 0 and less than

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.510
1, there's only one choice
that that applies to.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.800
And that's 3/4.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.730
Choice C.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.420
You might want to say 3/2,
but that's 1 and 1/2.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.670
That's greater than 1.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.820
The first two choices
are negative.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.339
The last two choices are greater
than 1-- or greater

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.640
than or equal to 1.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.660
So we know it's choice C.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.910
Next problem.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.080
And if you didn't want to do it
in an abstract way, and if

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.640
you have a lot of time, if
you're really fast on the

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.560
problems you do know
how to do, you can

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.460
always try out the numbers.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.710
But that takes longer.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.210
They drew a coordinate
system right here.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.150
And this is my y-axis.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.910
This is the x-axis.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.100
And then they draw a line that
goes through the origin.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.420
And then they tell us that this
point right here is the

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.215
point 1 comma 3.

00:05:08.215 --> 00:05:10.160
So this is 1.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.120
This is 3.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.560
And what do they want
us to do with this?

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.420
In the figure above, line l
passes through the origin.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.600
This is line l.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.710
What is the value of k/h?

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.820
Oh, and then they label
another point here.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.200
They say this is h comma k.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.090
So what is the value
of k divided by h?

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:41.300
So the y value over the
x value, right?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.890
And I'm going to tell you right
now, the value of it is

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.680
going to be the slope
of this line.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.930
And how do we know that?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.980
If you wanted to figure out the
slope from the origin to

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.930
this point, what would it be?

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.910
The origin of course is 0, 0.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.340
So it would be change in y.

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.710
Change in y is 0 minus k.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.740
You wouldn't have to
do this on the SAT.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.840
I just want to show you that
it would be the slope.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.060
And then change in x
would be 0 minus h.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.060
And that of course is equal
to minus k over minus h.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.360
The negatives cancel out,
and that equals k/h.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.520
So they're essentially just
asking us, what is the slope

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.630
of this line?

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.770
Well, that's easy enough,
because it

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.120
gives us another point.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.530
And so we can say, well, we
could do this rise over run.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.350
So here, what is the
change in y?

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.410
Change in y is equal
to 3 minus 0.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.180
I'm taking this as kind
of the initial point.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.660
3 minus 0.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.560
Change in x is 1 minus 0.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.900
So change in y over change
in x is equal to 3.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.460
And that's our slope, and
that's our answer.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.760
So the answer is A.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.290
Next problem.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.820
Problem 10.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.410
They're saying the absolute
value of m minus

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.130
3 is equal to 5.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.850
They're also telling us that the
absolute value of k plus 7

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.655
is equal to 15.

00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:14.640
In the equations above,
m is less than 0 and k

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.890
is less than 0.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.410
What is the value
of m minus k?

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.230
So m is less than 0, right?

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.450
So there's two possibilities
here.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.660
This first equation, if we
didn't see that, it could mean

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.390
two different things.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.790
You could say m minus 3 is equal
to 5 or m minus 3 is

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.050
equal to negative 5.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.050
This one would solve to m is
equal to 8, and this one would

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.840
solve to m is equal
to minus 2.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.390
Well, we know m is not 8,
because m is less than 0.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.510
And to solve this, I just
added 3 to both sides.

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.690
So we know that m is minus 2.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.610
Similarly, let's take that
second equation.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:07.220
That tells us that k plus 7 is
equal to 15, or k plus 7 is

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.210
equal to minus 15.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.010
Subtract 7 from both sides of
this, you get k equals 8.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.270
Subtract 7 from both sides
of this, you get k is

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.810
equal to minus 22.

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.530
And they tell us that k
is also less than 0.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.980
So we know that this is k.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.980
And they want us to know
what m minus k is.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.390
Well, m is minus 2,
and k is minus 22.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.422
So minus 2 minus minus 22.

00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:40.090
So that's the same thing
as minus 2 plus 22.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.030
And that is of course 20.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.920
And that is choice E.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.620
I will see you in
the next video.
