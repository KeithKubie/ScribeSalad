Please give them another hand.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:07.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.920
I'd also like to welcome
those in the hometowns

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.310
of our national student poets who
are watching online this afternoon;

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.980

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.260
[ Applause ]

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.450
Now just a few minutes ago,
we held pinning ceremony

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.350
for these five immensely
talented young poets in my office.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.020
One of the perks of being
the Librarian of Congress,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.840
and I got to talk with them
about what it means to take

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.820
on a big public role
championing books and writing,

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:26.450 position:56%
and also to ask them how they
started being inspired to make magic

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.710
with words and you will
hear more about that soon.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.150 position:56%
I'm also very pleased that we are
welcoming the National Student Poets

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.620
Program back to the library.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.880
In fact, the very first
class received their pins

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.560
in the library's historic
poetry office,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.830
home of our U.S. Poet Laureate.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.260
Now for this year's class,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.510
we brought back the 21st Poet
Laureate, Juan Filipe Herrera.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.770
Who was joined by the
acclaimed actor

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.510
and National Student Poetry
champion, Alfre Woodward.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.070
[ Applause ]

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.270
Now, you'll hear a bit from both of
them later, but I'm pleased to say

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.310
that our recent laureate
will be leading a workshop

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.250
for the National Student Poets
tomorrow, Miss Tracey Smith.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.510
I can't, whoop.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.750
[ Applause ]

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.810
Now, I can't imagine
though a more enthusiastic

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.810
and dynamic teacher
than Juan Filipe.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.810
So, National Student Poets you are
in for a life-changing experience.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.410
In fact, life-changing
feels like the perfect way

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.640
to describe your year to come and
all you will do in your new roles.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.220
You don't have to take
my word for it,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.920
one of the very first
National Student Poets,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.150
Luisa Banchoff recently
wrote about her experience

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.660
for our Poetry Center blog.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.290
And one point stuck out for
me, she's now a history teacher

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.810
in Botswana and she asked you to
"Recognize what makes your poetry

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.290
so precious, is potential
to touch others

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.070
in surprising and comforting ways.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.790
It's capacity to make us feel
communion with other people,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.690
to make us feel less
unmoored in a chaotic world."

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:50.210
So, Annie, Kinsale, Ben, Juliet,
Camilla I am eager to hear you read

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.050
for the first time as National
Student Poets, and I look forward

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.640
to you making good on
Luisa's words and now I'd

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.530
like to welcome my friend
and colleague Kit Matthew,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.600 position:56%
Director of the Institute of Museum
and Library Services to tell us more

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.060 position:56%
about this program and its partners.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.860
Kit.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.070
[ Applause ]

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.060
&gt;&gt; Kathryn K. Matthew: Well thank
you very much Carla and thank you

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.620
for hosting this even here today.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.820
We really appreciate your work
as a librarian, a former member

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.160
of the National Museum
and Library Services Board

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.930
and as a fellow ex-officio member
of the President's Committee

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.200
on the Arts and Humanities.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.630
On behalf of the Institute of
Museum and Library Services,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.520
we always enjoy working with
our colleagues at the Library

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.860
of Congress on the National Book
Festival and we look forward

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.400
to another successful
festival this year.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.190
I'm delighted to be with you all
today to celebrate this 2017 class

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.240
of the National Student
Poets Program.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.590
IMLS is proud to have partnered
with PCAH and the Alliance

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.650
for Young Artists and Writers
to establish this program

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.000
which shares exemplary
works from teen poets

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.870
like those we honor here today
with a national audience.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.610 position:56%
The approximately 123,000 libraries,
and 35,000 museums nationally,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.490
and related organizations
have long been centers

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.870
of learning inspiration community
and creativity for writers

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.460
and learners of all ages.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.280
And the National Student Poets
Program leverages the role

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.120
of these third spaces
libraries and museums

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.890
in promoting the cultural
participation of youth

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.360
and empowering communities
to celebrate creative voices.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.880 position:56%
This year's five exceptional student
writers, Annie, Kinnsale, Ben,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.030
Juliet, and Camilla
were selected by some

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.720
of our nation's finest
literary voices and leaders

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.420
in education rising to the top of
more than 300 national medalists

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.240
in the Scholastic Art
and Writing Awards.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.180 position:56%
They will receive academic awards,
opportunities to showcase their work

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.050
in libraries, museums and
schools, and at special events.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.080
We hope these young writers or
poets will share their passion,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.250
literary creativity and
talent to inspire their peers

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.940
and community members locally

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.320
and foster an even deeper
appreciation for poetry.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.870
IMLS is actively working with
our partners on the future

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.250 position:56%
of this program and we remain
committed to recognizing and lifting

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:48.040 position:56%
up the work of young writers like
these five poets we honor this year.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.360
Their voices are powerful
and you will hear

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.630
that when they read
and so is their poetry.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.940
Poetry has the power
to inspire curiosity

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.490
and change the way we
perceive our world.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.710
It has the power to connect
people across generations

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.570
and spark those critical dialogues

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.350
and community spaces
including the libraries

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.500
and museums across our nation.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.610
I'd also like to take
this opportunity

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.400
to recognize all the work that the
President's Committee for the Arts

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.080
and Humanities has put into the
National Students Poets Program.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.920 position:56%
Their time and energy and dedication
has been invaluable to the success

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.860
of this series of events, so please
join me in thanking PCAH staff

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:39.510
for making this ceremony
and program a success.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:47.060
[ Applause ]

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.600
So, in closing, I'd like
to share with you a quote

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.590
from American poet Jane Kenyon;
"The poet's job is to put

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.580
into words those feelings
we all have that are so deep

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:06.040 position:56%
and so important, and yet, so
difficult to name, to tell the truth

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.280
in such a beautiful
way that the people,

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.270
we the people, cannot
live without it."

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:19.390
In closing, I charge you five take
poetry into our nation's places

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.680
of learning, into our
schools, museums,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.490 position:56%
our libraries, and community spaces.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:32.310
Reflect and amplify the multiple
voices and stories around you.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.390
You are a key part of our nation's
future and the caliber of your work

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.420
and the strength of
your passion tells me

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.220
that the future indeed bright.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.590
So, congratulations on
your accomplishments.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:48.100
We look forward to following your
continued service throughout the

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.470
next year, and we really
sincerely will be following you

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.260
through social media and in person.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.670
So, now it's my pleasure

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.060
to introduce Virginia McEnerney the
Executive Director for the Alliance

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.620
of Young Artists and Writers

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.510
and to tell you a little
bit about the program.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:12.270
[ Applause ]

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.510
&gt;&gt; Virginia McEnerney: Good

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.140

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.580

I want to honor and
acknowledge the inspiration

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.240
and founder behind the
National Student Poets Program,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.630
Olivia Morgan who's
also here with us today.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.930
Thank you so much [applause].

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.900
For your heart, Olivia.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.490
Thank you.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.000
I know we have some
National Students Poets alums

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.300
in the audience.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.600
Can I see you?

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.900
So, [inaudible] do I
see you back there?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.510
And McKayla.

Thank you so much for coming.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:14.530
We're so happy to have you here.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.070
Thank you.

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.370
Are you pointing?

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.430
And Stella, you guys and go Paul
and Maya I see you back there.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.940
Thank you for coming.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.520 position:56%
Thank you for coming to support
your brothers and sisters in poetry.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.640
Last April during National
Poetry Month,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.170
I accompanied 2016 National Student
Poet Maya Salameh on her tour

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.280
of workshops as she gave
workshops and readings

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.300
across northern California.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.790
One night when, one Wednesday
night in a pouring rainstorm,

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.250
the Yuba-Sutter Regional
Arts Counsel in Marysville,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:53.850
California hosted an
open mic reading

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.130
with Maya as the featured guest.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.810
After Maya read a few poems,
community members stepped

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.160
to the stage in work
clothes, and uniforms,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.440
and cowboy hats to
read their own work.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.410
It was an amazing, amazing evening

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.540
of community building
and connection.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:14.450
I think everyone in the room would
have been as moved, as wowed,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.970 position:56%
as I was not only by the quality of
the work from the people in the room

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.050
and the humor and honesty that
was expressed, but by the fact

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.930
that the program does exactly
what it sets out to do.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.370 position:56%
It brings poetry into people's lives

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.380
and it brings the poetry
that's inside them

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.790
out into their communities.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:42.000
Here is what we know, poetry
lives, it shortcuts the expression

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.190
of complex emotions and ideas.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.820
Poetry matters.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:51.690
It makes good times sweeter and it
makes hard times easier to bear.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.820
Like all art forms, it gives
shape, and depth, and texture,

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.470
and meaning to our lives

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:02.540
and teenagers we have found
are the perfect emissaries.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.720
You may know that the word
"teenager" didn't even come

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.160
into common usage until the 1920s.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.020 position:56%
Before that, you were either a child
or an adult, but the Depression

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.200
and child labor laws and the
automobile actually elongated

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.210
that transition from
child to adulthood.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.990
These fine poets became
eligible to be appointed

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.290
as National Student Poets

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.060
because they first received
a national poetry medal

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.390
in a Scholastic Art
and Writing Awards.

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.660
At the Scholastic Awards
which were founded in 1923,

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.760
just about that time when
teenagers became a common usage,

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.140
our focuses on advancing
and advocating

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.080 position:56%
for the creative lives of teenagers.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.600
Teen poets are particularly
well-suited to serve as advocates.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.640
They're young enough to be
relatable to little kids

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.720
and they're mature enough to
be taken seriously by audiences

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.670
like those of us here
this afternoon.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:59.460
The 2017 National Poets join a
legacy of incredibly young writers

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.760
who feel poetry in their bones.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.220
These poets each have
strong unique voices

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:10.230
and their writing reflects the
complex realities and emotions

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:13.650
that young people face
in America today.

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.060
They are prepared to enter this
year of service fully committed

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.540
to sharing their voices, and
their insights, and their artistry

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.360 position:56%
to inspire audiences in large cities
in formal venues like the Library

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.880
of Congress and in small
town art centers like the one

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.610
in Marysville, California.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.150
Poetry is an ancient art form
that continues to reinvent itself

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:39.590
and make itself newly relevant
generation after generation,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:44.510
and we are so proud to be
presenting this generation's finest

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.520
young writers.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.710
The writer and playwright James
Baldwin wrote, "You write in order

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.060
to change the world
knowing perfectly well

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.340
that you probably can't,
but also knowing

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.890
that literature is
indispensable to the world.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.790
The world changes according
to the way people see it

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:09.820
and if you alter even by a
millimeter the way people look

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.510 position:56%
at reality, than you can change it."

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.480
These young people are changing
the world and we are so honored

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.740
to be here with you to launch
you into your year of service.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.390
It's now my honor to welcome
an artist who has advocated

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.880
for these poets from the very
beginning and we're so proud

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.850
to have you here with us once
again, the acclaimed actress

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:39.230
and activist, Alfre Woodard.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.530
&gt;&gt; Alfre Woodard: Hi.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.210
Hi. Good afternoon everyone.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.200
Good afternoon.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.940
Yeah, yeah.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.600
I have to tell you I am
totally hyped to be here

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.840
with you young poets and your
families today, as well as,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.790
the intrepid Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.240
Not only is an honor, it is a joy

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:08.380
and a wakening, and
absolute delight.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:13.220 position:56%
The National Student Poets Program
is something quite dear to my heart.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.700
I served on Barack Obama's
President's Committee on the Arts

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:23.270
and the Humanities when the
visionary Olivia Morgan proposed

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.600
this program six years ago.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.450
Together, she the PCAH and
lots of other entities dreamed

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:36.740
and they labored this into
fruition and it has continued

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.800
to blossom each year since.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:45.180
Engaging in this work and hearing
the voices of our young people

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.030
from across the nation,
has fortified my education

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.870
and sustained my hope for and
my belief in this generation.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.750
I now get to be here
with you beauties

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:05.930
and congratulate you exceptional
few who stand with us today.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:12.740
I applaud you poets who inspire
me in my work and my every days.

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.660
I see you alumni.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.710
The Obama President's
Committee has a history

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.060
of catalyzing important events in
the arts and this program is one

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.830
of our proudest achievements.

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:29.450
The National Student Poets is the
highest honor bestowed upon a young

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:31.950
poet by their country.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:36.270
With this great honor
comes great responsibility.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.960
Each of you will spend the
next year sharing your art

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.100
and showing the country how crucial
the arts are to each individual

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.120
and to our society as a whole.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.320
We invest in you as you
are the bright promise

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.430
of our extraordinary nation.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:03.020
We ask in return, that you
pay that investment forward.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.650
You go forward engaging with
teens nationally and helping us

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.490
to reach those who have yet to
discover the power of poetry

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:17.880
and the strength that comes
from discovering one's voice.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.440
Your presence in our schools will
inspire in others the courage

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:28.680
to discover the raw beauty and
freedom that comes with expressing,

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.820
owning, and sharing who they are.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.090
When PCAH created this program,

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:41.020
we had as you've heard two
critical partners in the IMLS

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.300
and the Library of Congress.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:46.960
Thankfully still, because of them,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.280
the NSPP is guaranteed a
long life going forward.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:58.020 position:56%
Also, the resources of all of you in
this room and the many more outside

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:04.220 position:56%
of this room, ensure that NSPP will
carry on the purpose and the promise

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:09.750
of this venture, and especially
with the support of our brilliant

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:17.060
and woke alumni poets, the 2017
laureates will takeoff soring

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.270
and join that continuum,
moving across the country,

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.020
opening minds, and hearts.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:32.960
As our nation crawls then
slouches, occasionally sprints,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:39.490
and now limbs toward our more
perfect union, it is imperative

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:46.480
that we Americans recognize and
understand our interconnectedness

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:51.090
that we awaken to our
common humanity.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.540
Fortunately, have the power
of chosen words to aid us

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.340
in expressing that truth.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:04.330
Poetry is the mother tongue of
the heart and we are ever grateful

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.130
that you young ones
speak it so well.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.450
It's not an easy task what you have
before you, but it is a challenge

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.110
that you're primed to meet.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.710 position:56%
Turn around, well you'll see it when
you come here, I want you to look

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:25.260
at all the faces in this room, as
you shove off, know that we will be

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.170
at the ready during
your year of service,

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:34.540 position:56%
to inflate your water wings, to send
you kind bars, and press juices,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:41.800
no Red Bulls, to laugh with you,
to cry a little, to applaud you,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.090 position:56%
and to feed you when you are nearby.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:50.310
We are tremendously excited about
all that you will accomplish.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:56.030
So right now, I am going to ask
you all to come to the stage.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.510
Please come up now.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:15.350
[ Applause ]

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.410
I am excited to introduce
each of the 2017 poets

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.520
for their first public reading.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.500
Then we'll present
you with your plaques.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.090
Our first poet is Anne Castillo
from Falls Church, Virginia.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.510
Welcome Anne.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.390
I'm Anne Castillo and I'm a
representing the Southeast region

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.850
this year as a National
Student Poet,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.390
and today I will be
reading two poems.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.660 position:56%
This is "Love Letter for a Library."

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:06.290 position:56%
A creased corner dips under my thumb
like atlas bruising beneath sky.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:11.770
This fold is untidy, accidental
origami I can't smooth out.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.030
A stranger's hand pressed
this paper like flowers.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.030
She left me her crumpled daisy.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:21.230
I dissected syllables
in the window seat,

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.170
heard my sister curse how
poetry won't be quiet.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.320
In this place, stories
don't stay dead.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.190 position:56%
Here, I learn Venus flytraps swallow
spiders, plumbs help forgetfulness,

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:38.590
and the phena emerged from her
father's splitting forehead.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.440
[Inaudible] noun; parchment

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.590
from which writing has been
completely erased to make room

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.410
for other text, something altered,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.710
but still bearing visible
traces of its earlier form.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:56.430 position:56%
Synonyms; butterfly, grief, library.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.120
On airplanes I avoid
aisle responsibility,

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.260
but here, I am brave.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:07.080
Here I must only unfold a corner
to believe I can begin again.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.200
Outside a boy plays in
blue boots after rainfall.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.930
I imagine this land as
the orchard it once was

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:18.510
and that he mashes fallen
peaches with very step.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:27.070
[ Applause ]

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:32.130
And I'm not going to read my second
poem on the Discovery of Dinosaurs;

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.120
I dream of a phantom
femur far below,

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.920
pale as puddled moonlight
on a chapel's roof.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.030
The beast became bones.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.730
Time shucking scales from
its body, sinew dissolving

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.340
into clumps of stringy roots.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.920
The earth is now a crypt.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.470
A dragon's tail perhaps for the
murmurs or a giant skeleton.

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.690
Ribcages emerged in
vast hallowed chambers

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:01.410
like a cathedral's arch
then teeth came next.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:06.350
Oh God, what is this creature
whispered like a prayer?

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:10.520
I used think of the dinosaurs
who became bones and shadow

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.310
like a lilac forgotten
between the pages of a book.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.720
Now, I think of the ones
who unearthed the bones

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.900
so time's raw sunlight
could touch those ghosts.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.700
Thank you.

reading two poems today.

at sinking canyon feet.

Smokey sage tracks
lonesome wind calls

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.590
after her hand overbound playing.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.550
Southern discomfort
in sideways glances.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.270
Her coiled fingers
dropping penny change

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:51.950
and chubby multicolored hands.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:56.320

My second poem is called, Eden on
Avocado Street; The frozen curb pops

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.990
like gumballs under our
toes as we wait together,

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:28.160
pinky fingers folding pages like
secrets under the bus stop sign.

You twelve today press

Familiar names thumbed smooth
between aisles of driftwood text.

My eyes died blue like windowpanes
swallow peppered words like pebbles.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:48.160
I poke at each paragraph with the
crescent curve of my index finger.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:53.820
You always bring me here after
school to this Mausoleum of lost

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.620
and found, of yellow
cars and mice and men,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.400

We swing dance between
tragedy and Dr. Seuss.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.030
Heals beating holes into
crown colored carpet,

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:10.620
bucking bus rides bring us
here where you wear glasses

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.830
and I weave my legs
together on beanbag chairs.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:19.050
You teach me to balance on my toes
and cling like books buying glue

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:24.550 position:56%
to that candied lip of asphalt
curb, to press brown thumb to tongue

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:29.670
when I turn a page, to linger
at each corner of my mouth

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.190
and almost taste the
worlds that whirl

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.050
and coagulate beneath
our sticky touch.

I'm going to be the National Student
Poet representing the Midwest.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.590
I'm really thankful
to be here today.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:25.920
The poem I'll be reading is called,
League of Thieves; I go to school

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.380
with a class of thieves, a bunch

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.830
of book smart Brainiacs
slugging in the minor leagues.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.560
Yeah, we are eager
beaver of busy bee,

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.440
but better to be more
cut throat than that

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.450
because these crooks are
cooking up some words for flavor

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:46.240
and you're going to want to be
here when they're ready to be rare.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.750
Yeah, I go to school with a class
of thieves, but don't mistake us

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.820
for those brassy pickpockets
or some swindler syndicate,

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.010
nah we ain't your average
cat burglar.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:59.750 position:56%
Our heists are for the long haul and
not just because we're comfortable,

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.720
but because of one and done
doesn't cure a sweet tooth

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.460 position:56%
for New York coffee with Caulfield
or some peanut butter and mayonnaise

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:10.640
on toast with yang, no
it doesn't cure a craving

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.810
for a story truth from O'Brien.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.550
Among the awkward shelves made

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.750
of awkward timber you
can find us scavenging

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.640
for a little unpublished
history, from a Franklin

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.680
that ain't famous reveling in west
[inaudible] rambunction and peaking

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.260
at whose eyes are really
watching God.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.680
Yeah, I want to learn how
to boo like a mockingbird,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:36.750
study how [inaudible], I want
to go back to the blue border

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.000
where the characters
claim their author

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.490
and lose my confusion to curiosity.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.830
We aren't addicts, at
least, I don't think we are.

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.390
Maybe a little neurotic, greedy
of course, but we've got logic

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:56.500
because this feels too
normal to be immoral.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.810
I go to school with a
class of thieves taught

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:01.900
by a purposeful plaid
man who once assured me

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.390
that no one ever borrows a story.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:09.520
We pinch from the east wing stacks
in a way that can't be corrosive,

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.490
because even though we take
testimony like vultures,

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:17.150
no manual ever resigns from this
head space without packing first,

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:23.210
but I rush to catch rubies,
metaphors, bubble gum chewed opals,

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:26.980
and the multitudes of in-truth
imagery whittled onto the bellies

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.260
of uneven tables, man
I used to spend spells

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.990
and half-baked seasons trying to
figure out why these themes tasted

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:38.730
so independent in my mouth
and so separate in yours,

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.310
but I have discovered that
dictionaries can be traded

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:47.040 position:56%
like currency, invested upon like
some profitable wears I have folded,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.610 position:56%
ivory epics, episodes in chapters
seven times over and have never been

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:57.090
so indifferent to an ethos
racing down the backstretch.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:03.870
So again, I am reminded that this
is our library, our bank vault,

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:08.290 position:56%
our quiet acropolis in which we
wrap ourselves in trinity knots just

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:12.980
to strike enough sage until
we are ready to pencil in more

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:17.000
than just failed syllables
on a titled page.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.520
Suddenly, from the
fictional guide books

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.460
and fairytale how-to's us
unglorified wrestlers must decide

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.580
whether to paint our hydrangeas
like corn flowers, like acid,

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:32.940
like the way lavender should smell
only I keep reading remembering

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.870
that I go to school with a
class of thieves who steal

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:40.280 position:56%
in a heterogeneous union of pleasure
and necessity who keep weaving

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.630
and shoplifting yarn even
though we aren't doggy-dog

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.990
because we have only
read about rock bottom.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:52.470
Lightning strikes us somewhere
in between a Bart Simpson

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.940
and a [inaudible], but
not too close to either

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.020
because we live just outside
of literature spending most

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.590
of our time picking out the
padlock trying to back inside.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.510

My name is Juliet Lubwama and
I'll be representing the Northeast

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.940
as a National Student
Poet this year,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.210
and my first poem is Flight
is a Three Parts Novel;

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:10.190 position:56%
The statuette knows more than
Athenaems fathoms more than pigtails

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:14.140
and fingerprints that flock
over her scapula like wings.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.250
A question resides
in her skin asking

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.720
where the blooming hands have gone.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.020
I tell her our words are rekindling

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:29.870
and when stories become
strangers we burrow in stagnation.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:35.290
Yet I have an endured a reverse
metamorphosis and unbecoming.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.300
We thought that this was
home until it wasn't.

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.650 position:56%
Reading lights and lullabies
defined our solid ground with hearts

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.340
in the right place, but they
upset the symmetry of our bodies.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.860
We tucked novels under
our right arms like seeds,

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:55.330
like baking legacies, like
balance hid in biographies

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.180
that martyred our juniorities

00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:04.010
but sometimes I identify more
stick and stone than soul.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:09.630
Sometimes I wish I could
still see myself in her.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:14.760
My legs crossed cut behind me
like butterflies carrying a book

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.710
like a pearl and not a pond.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:23.460
Willow lines of age gather
in her hair and trousers.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:27.920
Still her cheeks stay rounded
like a page mid turned,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.090
a storyline expecting but
not waiting to be told.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.820
What chiseled rock and
novel share is the pliancy

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.810
of their existences
witnessed to the hazy streets,

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:44.390
the Pancake House, and
other rising things.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.940
This is a perpetual ascension.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:53.430
This dog eared parenthesis festers
in the cerebellum and mutters sky

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:58.510
like echo, like it's
still all we know.

And my second poem is
Trying to Find Home;

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.850
My parents crossed the
ocean cracking can'ts

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.800
and Locke's philosophies
between their teeth like walnuts.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.660
Western learned but foreign
and how they hold themselves

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.680
like waterlogged apples
dangling by the stem.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.950
Finding unexpected asylum with
strangers, the familiar lilts

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:38.460
in their tones, carving
homes out of each other,

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.830
but when a cousin questions
where I'm from?

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.980
My tongue becomes a
salmon pink and floundering

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:51.240
as if an answer could
be found in a lifetime.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:57.590 position:56%
My family tree is worn and trampled,
sieged by storms, by dictators,

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:03.910
by slavery, my kin arrived with
textbooks swaying on their heads

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.320
and shackles around their ankles.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.200
Still, in a land we
have yet to call home,

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.350
our neighbors see our cacao
hands whether they be doused

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.060
in blood or saltwater.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:26.510
Even this can become a sanctuary.

Today I'll be reading My Mother
Still Presses My Collars for Me;

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:26.350
I am not a poet: Starting
at the beginning

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.700
of a road bookshelves will
sometimes, but not always,

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:34.330
lead you to the end;
210 natural theology,

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:37.500
this library is a religion,
a magnified category

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.040
of the Dewey Decimal System, a
system of veneration a sacrament;

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.440
108; groups of people
accelerated rises and degenerations

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.950
and hives recorded
dutifully in the immensity

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:54.380
of civilizations collective
data processing; 220;

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.050
the bible; I am not a poet.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:39:01.260
I am scripture snapping apart at
the binding reverence crushed open

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:05.150
on golden page edges, smudges
of silk streamed innocence,

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.110
spinal thread unraveling
eye and knowing, knowing,

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:12.880 position:56%
knowing [inaudible] in all the wrong
places and I am falling in love

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.220
with an icon class to the library.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:19.580
I draw feathered lines between
theology animal cracker crumbs

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:24.180
and philosophy and I dub the three
doctrines a cornerstone of true

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.580
and inherent self-understanding;
561; paleobotany;

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:33.570
a study in the army of ladybugs
marching between carpet fibers,

paleo as in ancient, as in
connecting of generations; 340; law;

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:44.210
I write memorandums in this library
and not poetry, although whispers

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.210
of beauty can be found
between presentencing reports,

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:51.390
statutes to finding our boundaries
and we sit and yawn and ponder

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.560
over the best way to write stoic
opinions, hostility wrapped

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.590
in the polite gauze of directness.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:04.340
The sacrilege of ambiguity is not
a luxury afforded in these stacks;

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:10.810
114; space; 115 time; stanzas are
tucked into different corners.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:14.790
These words are charred splinters
of bookshelves being burned.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.700
They are singed church steeples,
the vernacular of a child learning

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:23.060 position:56%
to build and destructs things within
the boundaries of sincerity of,

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.810 position:56%
"is this me" reflected in the
titles jumbled on the way to my mind

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:32.480
of surely not, refracted in the
beeping of a sensor tag; 184;

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.970
platonic philosophy; humanism
is denoted by the currency

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:41.580 position:56%
of computer generated rocks used for
permission to enter the playground

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:46.340
and for a child that art of
self-betterment is often pursued

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.700
through the carving of
another crevice of knowledge,

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:52.170
the addition of a paperback
committed to memory.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.460
The edges of the universe sputter

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.640
on our ivory domes skimming cloud
painted frescos while modern day

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.800
patrons skim popsicle stained
fingertips on the frames

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.950
of library double doors,
flanked by figures

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:11.900
of turtle perplexity captured in
the face of marble statues mirrored

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:17.100
in the moment of revelation;
120; the self;

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:21.300
I am this a splintering
façade the weights

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.510
of millions before me here a
palladian homage to everything

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:30.160
that holds a society together,
unfathomable worlds cracking open

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:37.410
in an instant and today, it is
reduced to one question; 608;

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:42.670
patent; why do patent lawyers
need science backgrounds?

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.700
I receive a muddled answer
from a student in the elevator.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.210
At the library, this is a question
I etched into a scrap of paper

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.820
and tucked into the
cushion of an armchair.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:59.510
If I come back in a week,
I will have an answer.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:06.250
[ Applause ]

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:07.550
Thank you.

00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:10.510
Thank you so much.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:21.270
[ Applause ]

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.510
&gt;&gt; Alfre Woodard: Congratulations
Camilla.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:36.040
[ Applause ]

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:41.260
So, I am overwhelmed.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.560
I am overcome.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.510
Please give our 2017 poets
another round of applause.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:43:14.330
[ Applause ]

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:20.610
Yeah, because you're going to want
to see what's happening next, okay.

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:25.830
So, right now please welcome
to the stage Joey Reisberg.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:29.660
A National Student Poet
from 2016 and he's going

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.680
to share some reflections with us.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.510
Joey.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:40.200
[ Applause ]

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.830
Nobody's drank that
water, so you go ahead.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.130
&gt;&gt; Joey Reisberg: Hello.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:47.580
It's so great to be
here on this amazing day

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:52.430
and hear some reflections
on this past amazing year.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.210
In June, my fellow 2016 National
Student Poets and I stood

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:00.000
in a third grade classroom at
the Harlem Academy listening

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.150
to 9-year-olds recite an original
collaborative poem about ice cream.

00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.070
I like to think of this moment as
essential during the madcap rush

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.480
of the past year, the brightness

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.410
of young voices proudly
exclaiming their creation.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:19.490
The; I lost my place for a second.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:24.290
The smiles as lines like swirly
I wish I could have some more.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.150
The tempting taste is lovely

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.720
and it makes us feel good
ring through the air.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:33.410
The vividness of their poem,
the imagery of sprinkles

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:37.160
and sunshine it all feels
like a beautiful dream.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.780
I think I can speak
for all my fellow poets

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.200
when I say this year
was a whirlwind.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.050
It all started back in
September when we were appointed

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:49.140
at the White House by former First
Lady, Michelle Obama and after

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:52.450
that came a dizzying rush
of readings and workshops

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.280
and appearances at high school.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.530
Our pack of poets have
traversed the country

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:01.660
from the Dodge Poetry Festival in
Newark, New Jersey to the Aspen,

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.430
Colorado Ideas Festival, to
Johnstown, Pennsylvania and El Paso

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.450
in Northern California, and
Minnesota, and Nashville,

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.260
and New York City, and San
Diego, and Chicago, and Dallas,

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.510
and Atlanta try and track
our progress on a map

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:20.730 position:56%
and you get a messy spaghetti tangle
of crazily intercepting lines.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.730 position:56%
Our service projects include working

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.800
with first generation
immigrant youth, the elderly,

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.860
elementary school students
and mine happening next month,

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.180
a celebration of local poetry
at the Baltimore Book Festival.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:35.940
We have met poets like Mark
Doty and Edward Hirsch,

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.810 position:56%
performed at Carnegie Hall, spent
an afternoon at the Huffington Post,

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.410
done radio interviews and TV
appearances, and in my case,

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.930
read a poem about chicken fat
on the Lincoln Center Stage;

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.140
that's a long story, I'm sorry.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.640
But of course, we were not
alone on these endeavors.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:57.710
So a million thank yous go to
Hannah, and Debra, and Virginia,

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.450
and everyone at the Alliance
for Young Artist and Writers,

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.100
and the President's Committee
on the Arts and Humanities,

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.120
and the Institute for Museum
and Library of Services,

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.490
and thank you to our parents
and a special thank you

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.190
to Dr. Carla Hayden and
the Library of Congress

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.230
for hosting the Appointment
Ceremony this year.

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:17.370
Libraries are where I read some
of the first poems of my life

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.440
at the Enoch Pratt in
downtown Baltimore.

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.960
Libraries align with one
of the central missions

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.710
of the National Student Poets
Program to foster creativity

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:30.510 position:56%
and hope with accessibility to bring
knowledge and literature to people

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:35.630
who really need it, and to the
class of 2017, congratulations.

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:39.320
You are here today because of
your astounding poetic promise

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.370
because you show the spark
of something special.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.840 position:56%
Right now, is your celebration time.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:48.450 position:56%
Savor this moment of joy and let
the affirmation you are experiencing

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:51.450
today guide you throughout
your year of service.

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.760
You will be challenged to bring
out the best parts of yourself,

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.460
to do things you've never even
thought about doing, to stand

00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.120
and to realize you serve a unique

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:02.290
and necessary purpose
whether you are standing

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.730
in front audiences of
one or one thousand.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:10.140
It's not easy, but we don't write
poetry because of its simplicity.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.610
As poets you have learned
to love complexity,

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:17.410
to reside with an ambiguity, to ask
questions that may not have answers

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:20.560
and now you must take those
things you already do so well

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:24.020
and apply them to the
experiences this year will bring.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:27.100
Above all, the National
Student Poets Program is

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:28.870
about communication.

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:31.550
Poetry itself is, of
course, communication.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:36.130
A kind of telepathic understanding
built with metaphor and imagery

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:39.480
and all the intuitive things which
the perceptive jurors have loved

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.920
about your writing, but at the
root of the amazing year you

00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:47.070
about to embark on, is the same
basic principle; how are you going

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.450
to take the acclaim and joy
of right here and right now

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.630
and bring it to your own community?

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.750
How are you going to use poetry
to uplift the voices of those

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.460
who deserve to be celebrated
and heard?

00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:02.210
How can you build doors and
gateways with your beautiful words?

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:07.130
And here's a secret, I as a
recent alumni, do not fully know.

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:11.040
Yes, I've been through the
magical and transformative year,

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.420
but I do not have all
of the answers,

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.760
but that's the beauty
of this program.

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:19.830
We have each other and now a six
year network of poets dedicated

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.660 position:56%
to answering the lofty and ambitious
questions NSPP poses to us.

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.340
We each contribute a little
bit more and a little bit more

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.410
to bring poetry to America.

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:32.870
Swelled heads and going solo
are opposite to the spirit

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:37.640
of poetry despite the stereotype
of a poet as a disgruntled loner.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.800
You will learn that poetry is
a vibrant and growing world,

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:45.820
a tightly bound community, and
so we the alumni have a request;

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.480
we need your words.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:51.590
We need your words to be honest and
true to be diverse, to be funny,

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.870
to reflect your soul while
still standing up for others.

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:57.970
A lot has changed in the
year since I and the class

00:48:57.970 --> 00:49:00.240
of 2016 have been appointed.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.100
So, we need your words to guide
us forward, to give us hope

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:08.610
and show us the brave new future of
the National Student Poets Program.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:10.510
Thank you.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:23.370
[ Applause ]

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:24.670
Thank you.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:29.510
It is my honor to welcome Poet
Laureate Juan Filipe Herrera.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:36.170
[ Applause ]

00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:37.510
&gt;&gt; Juan Filipe Herrera:
Well, thank you very much.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.010
What a wonderful presentation.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.510
Let's give him a big mono.

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:48.150
[ Applause ]

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.540
And let's give Alfre a
big mono too why not.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.510
Let's give her the biggest mono.

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:00.760
And our new national youth poets.

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:04.500
Let's give them a super
heartful mono.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:12.540
[ Applause ]

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:14.510
A little bit bigger.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:26.500
[ Applause ]

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.810
That's the feeling.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:30.880
That's the feeling
and after Carla Hayden

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:35.510
who charted a new course
for us, a super mono.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:43.050
[ Applause ]

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.920 position:56%
And let me just mention Rob Casper
and the staff and the Poetry Center,

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:51.510
the Literature Department a big
super [foreign word spoken] mono.

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:57.140
[ Applause ]

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.820
And you know this is what
it's all about right here.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.890
This is how the poetry is formed.

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:03.990
This is how we do it.

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.230
People say, what, what,
how do you do the poetry

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:07.530
and where does it come from?

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:11.190
This is how it happens when we are
with each other and when we think

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.710
of each other and we sit down
in a lonely corner or we come

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:17.490
out in a blasting explosive
space, it's the same.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:21.580
We make contact with each other,
and we create friendships,

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:24.640
and we get ideas, and we
listen to a term and we go "Oh,

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.040
I hadn't thought of
that [inaudible].

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.340
I hadn't thought of that.

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.650
I'm going to look it up."

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:34.020
And eraser that has traces
of the actual original text

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.050
and perhaps that's what we're
doing now, creating a new text.

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:40.540
I think that's what our new
team is going to be doing.

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:45.550
Looking at that, at the plain,

and to pullout the messages, and to
pullout the letters, and the voices,

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.510
and bring them forward and this is
exactly how it happens by listening

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.390
to each other, by trying
out our poems.

00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:57.690
Can you believe it?

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:58.990
How was that?

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:00.290
How was that?

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:03.740
Wasn't that just, you
know, incinerating?

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:08.620
And that's the feeling.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.560
If your heart is not on fire
and your energy is not pulsing

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:17.060 position:56%
through the floor and up through the
roof, then you're not doing poetry

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.730
and you were doing poetry.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.030
That's what you were doing.

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.180
Weren't they just intense
and beautiful?

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.000
Aren't they prophets?

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.510
Let's give them another big hand.

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:39.170
And that's what's going
on, you know.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:44.490 position:56%
The new example, the new experiment,
the new text, the new horizon,

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:48.610
the new voice, the new path,
and I think we heard it today.

00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:54.410
All those formulas, all those
scientific excavations and tests

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.360
that you all did to
come up with those poems

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.980
and the words that,
that bring them out.

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:02.190
I think every line was a pathway.

00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:04.110
Every line was a capillary.

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:08.820
Every line was a synapse
to the new idea,

00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:11.780
and that's what we want right now.

00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.360
We need that new idea.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.660
We need the prophets.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.170
We need the scientists
that do poetry.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:22.440
The new poetry volcanic scientists
of the nation, and thank you.

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.790
Thank you for dedicating
your life to this.

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:30.200
Thank you for dedicating your
extreme intelligence and creativity

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:35.580
to this thing called poetry and
this place called the nation.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.210
Thank you for pouring
your lives into it.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:44.150
You're young, powerful lives
into what we all love here

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:49.840
at the library is words, and
histories, and self, and spirit,

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.430
and communication, and
discovery with your voices.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:56.510
Another big mono.

[ Applause ]

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.360
You know, people do say, you
know, why are you a poet?

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.890
And why do you do that?

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.970
Why aren't you a, you
know, doing something else?

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:19.510
And it's great to do poetry
and it's such a place to be.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:23.910
We can play, we can as
Malcolm Margolin said,

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:26.540
"What happened to recess?"

00:54:26.540 --> 00:54:31.810
We can do a little recess, but
that recess is a different kind

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.110
of recess.

00:54:33.110 --> 00:54:34.410
Perhaps it's a real recess.

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:37.540
I was hanging out with Liam
Humble [phonetic] as you know one

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.610
of our great poets, and
he says "Juan Filipe."

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:41.910
I said, "Yes Liam."

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.210
He says, "Wait a minute.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:44.630
Juan Filipe I got to talk to you."

00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:46.270
I go, "Yes, go ahead Liam."

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:48.500
He says, "I got to tell you."

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.830
I said, "But please do."

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:56.850
And he says, "Juan Filipe, I want
to be standing up at the edge

00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:00.550
of a volcano staring into
the mouth of creation."

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.110
And I went, "Well, that's
really very good Liam."

00:55:04.110 --> 00:55:06.430
But that what it is.

00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:08.300
That's what it is.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.990
You're standing at the edge
of that volcano which is now

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:16.700
and you're staring down
at the mouth of creation

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:20.360
which is a very daring thing
to do and didn't you feel that?

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:24.170
Didn't you feel that edge of
that volcano in their voices?

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:27.210
Didn't you see what they
were seeing just a tad?

00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:30.980
Didn't you see it sputtering and
boiling and exploding at you?

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.280
That was hot.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.790 position:56%
You guys did some hot stuff up here.

00:55:33.790 --> 00:55:35.490
That was some stuff you know.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:39.190
I can barely, you know,
touch the podium.

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:43.520
And that is what we want, you know.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.200
And that's what poetry does.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.120
It finds that new thing.

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:55.140 position:56%
It grasps it, it grasp that which is
a graspable which we all are after

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:58.960 position:56%
and it cannot be done in a straight
line, and it cannot be done not even

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.810
in a rectangular space even though
Einstein worked with rectangles

00:56:03.810 --> 00:56:07.230
and squares and yet he
said they had not volume.

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.230
I said, "What is that again?"

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:14.480
A rectangle without volume
and yet it has walls?

00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.780
And that's what you're doing.

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.430
You're creating these paradoxes
and you're taking us through them

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:20.940
and that's what we need right now.

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.560
We need that paradox to be not
explained, but presented to us

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:30.150
so we can travel through
it and find it.

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:34.380
How beautiful that is and
how powerful poetry can be

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:40.080
with new lines, with new minds
that are born right in front us.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.420
Thank you so much.

do you believe in them?

this is how poetry happens.

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.420
How we learn.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:01.720
How we do poetry isn't it?

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.020
We listen to each other.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.580
We get excited by each
other and we go,

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:06.850
oh I'm going to take those terms.

00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:10.350
So, that's what I did
reading your poems.

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:14.890
How complex and direct
and beautiful they are

00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:17.710
and how many secrets they contain.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:22.790
So, I did a cardboard shirt
poem; shirt cardboard poem.

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:28.180
I usually run out of paper and
I make believe that the shirts

00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:32.860
that I take to the cleaners
will come back fully ironed,

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.100
but they always come back crinkled.

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.770
But what I do get out of
it is that shirt board.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.930
So, then I'll write a poem on it.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:47.710
It feels better because it has
density and a softness, and color,

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:53.040
and it's brown, and it
looks like a gram cracker.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.770
I like all that and
I can draw on it.

00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:00.840
So, this is called A Stranger.

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.630
Now the question is
reading my own writing.

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:12.310 position:56%
A stranger presses paper like
flowers and I took, as you can begin

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:15.680
to feel some lines
and images and words

00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.580
from your poems if that's okay.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.050
A stranger and this is for you;

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:25.490
A stranger pressed this
paper like flowers.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:30.970

eye and thunderbolt face

in the storms over Houston, like me,

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:43.470

giving our skin to the dead

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:47.670
for one, just one more life.

Gatsby and driftwood my breast
died with dawn died, died, died,

00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:58.360
with nothingness, not
the easy nothingness,

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:04.040
not the easy nationalism I'm
talking, I'm talking freedom.

like that beat the holes,

on the first precipice

of the first unknown
galaxy, that's, that's you.

about I'm born yet born unsaid

yet with new letters
and the attic spells

to her mother's place and
returned and in her house

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:03.270
and never came back, and to all
the people and these storms,

whose son obeyed his grandfather

who had Alzheimer's and
said, "Well, you know,

in our culture we obey our elders."

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.470
And he was right, he was right.

Grandfather said, "Go, go,
go, go come on you got to go."

And that's alright.

What happened was the
car with the two children

and the grandfather kept on going
and the son, grandson stepped out,

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:44.970
just got out hoping to open
the van and he couldn't do it.

that night, who spoke of peace

lives in the midst of their sudden

prone in gone by the night pillar

the new evaluation of our society.

some food and drink and say hello

you should pick-up a Meet

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.540
where to go see said
superheroes in a couple of days

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:50.470
at the National Book Festival
which you should all go to.
