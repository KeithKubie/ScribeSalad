00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:01.976
-[Voiceover] Let's
think a little bit about

00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:06.961
modeling population and
what I have pictures here

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.013
are some of the most known,

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:10.785
actually this gentleman right over here

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:14.527
might be the most known
person when people think about

00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:17.540
population and the limits
to grow the population.

00:00:17.657 --> 00:00:19.439
This is Thomas Malthus.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.439
He was a British cleric
and writer and scholar

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.772
at the end of the 1700s, at
the end of the 18th century,

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.002
early 19th century.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.585
He really challenged the notion

00:00:32.585 --> 00:00:34.673
that population could grow indefinitely

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:37.479
and that we would always
through technology

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.901
be able to feed ourselves

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:40.972
and that really that the
environment would eventually

00:00:40.972 --> 00:00:44.285
put some caps on how much

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:46.307
or where the population could grow to.

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.191
P.F. Verhulst and I'm sure

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.489
I'm mispronouncing his name here.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.489
He was a Belgian mathematician
who read Malthusâ€™ work

00:00:57.032 --> 00:00:59.038
and tried to model the behavior

00:00:59.632 --> 00:01:00.730
that Malthus was talking about

00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:04.193
that, okay when there aren't
environmental constraints,

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:06.922
maybe population does grow
somewhat exponentially

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:09.018
but then as it approaches
kind of the limits

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:11.386
set by the environment

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:13.143
it's going to essentially asymptote

00:01:13.143 --> 00:01:16.518
towards some type of population.

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:18.403
Malthus in particular,
he actually doesn't think

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:19.981
it's just going to be
a nice clean asymptote.

00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.288
He actually thinks that the population

00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:22.494
would kind of go above the limit

00:01:22.494 --> 00:01:23.829
and you'd have these catastrophes

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:25.556
and then they would go
crashing below the limit

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:28.632
and you kind of oscillate
right around the limit

00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:30.757
through these catastrophes.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:34.536
You can tell Malthus was
a fairly optimistic guy

00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:36.704
but let's go through a
little bit of the math

00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:38.936
and a little bit of the
differential equations

00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:41.822
although it's not too,
these aren't overly hairy

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:43.800
differential equations to
think about population.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:46.525
The first way to think about population

00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:48.479
and I'll express it as
a differential equation.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.973
Actually let me just
set some variables here.

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:53.241
Let's say that N is our population,

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.445
so that's our population

00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:00.139
and we are going to assume
that N is a function of T.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.113
N as a function of T

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:05.185
is what we're going to
be thinking about in this

00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:07.659
and frankly the next series of videos.

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.889
One way to think about how to model this

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.045
is just so what is the rate of change

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:15.590
of population with respect to time?

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.553
How does that relate to things?

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:19.851
We could say, okay, well
what is the rate of change

00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:22.739
of population with respect to time?

00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:25.903
D, capital N, DT.

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:27.570
Well one way to think about it

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:29.568
is it's going to be
proportional to the population.

00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:32.633
You could say well maybe
this is going to be

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:34.992
some proportionality constant

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:36.700
times the population,

00:02:36.007 --> 00:02:38.328
times the population itself.

00:02:39.021 --> 00:02:43.772
This makes sense if the
population is smaller

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:47.085
then you're not going to have as much

00:02:47.085 --> 00:02:50.976
change per unit time as if
the population is larger.

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:54.159
The larger the population the more

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.850
it's going to grow in a
particular unit of time.

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:59.332
Actually this is actually
a fairly simple to solve

00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.085
differential equation, you
might have done it before.

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:03.428
I encourage you to pause this video

00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:04.964
if you feel inspired to do so

00:03:04.964 --> 00:03:06.226
but I'll solve it right here

00:03:06.226 --> 00:03:11.187
and you'll see that we get
an exponential function here

00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:12.922
for N, so let's do that.

00:03:12.922 --> 00:03:14.011
Let's solve this and we'll essentially

00:03:14.812 --> 00:03:18.034
separate the variables,
separate the N from the Ts

00:03:18.034 --> 00:03:19.975
although we only see DT here

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:21.043
but I'll do that in a second.

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:23.680
If I divide both sides by N.

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:28.068
I get one over N and if I
multiply both sides by DT

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:31.186
if you kind of think about the DT

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:32.517
is something that you can multiply.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:34.832
I'm going to multiply both sides

00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:35.953
or I'm going to divide both sides by

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:38.038
and multiply both sides by DT.

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:39.377
I'm going to get one over N,

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:41.328
DN on the left-hand side

00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:43.589
and on the right-hand
side I'm going to get

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:48.589
R times DT.

00:03:50.002 --> 00:03:51.801
Notice I got the DT
onto the right-hand side

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.334
by multiplying both sides of that

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.338
and then I divided both sides by N

00:03:55.338 --> 00:03:57.012
and I got the one over N right over here.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:02.842
Now what we can do is we
can take the antiderivative

00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:04.461
of both sides.

00:04:05.072 --> 00:04:08.828
We can take the
antiderivative of both sides

00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:11.357
and what do we get on the left-hand side?

00:04:11.357 --> 00:04:15.692
Well this is just going
to be the natural log

00:04:15.692 --> 00:04:19.442
of the absolute value of our population

00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:21.457
and actually if we assume
that the population

00:04:21.457 --> 00:04:24.605
is always going to be non-zero

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:26.683
then we can actually take
this absolute value off

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:28.417
but I'll do that in a second.

00:04:28.705 --> 00:04:33.705
That's going to be equal to R times T

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.107
and then we could have
added the constant here

00:04:38.107 --> 00:04:39.628
but I'm just going to do it on one side.

00:04:39.628 --> 00:04:44.628
It's R times T plus C.

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.192
Now, if we actually want to solve for N,

00:04:48.192 --> 00:04:50.515
we could take ...

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:52.668
If this is equal to this
then E to this power

00:04:52.668 --> 00:04:55.303
should be the same as E to this power

00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:56.879
or another way of thinking about it,

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.356
E, the natural log of
the absolute value of N

00:04:59.356 --> 00:04:59.868
is equal to this.

00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:01.714
Is another way of saying that E to this

00:05:01.714 --> 00:05:02.991
is going to be equal to that.

00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:04.593
Well actually let me just do it this way.

00:05:04.593 --> 00:05:09.593
Let me just take E to this power

00:05:12.035 --> 00:05:12.908
and to that power.

00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:14.271
If that's equal to that
then E to that power

00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:15.864
should be the same as E to that power.

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:20.691
We're going to be left
with E to the natural log

00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:22.293
of the absolute value of N.

00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:24.346
That's going to give you
the absolute value of N.

00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:27.541
Let's just assume N positive,

00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:32.541
let's just assume population
is greater than zero.

00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:39.081
Then we can this left-hand
side right over here

00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:41.161
we'll just simplify to N

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:43.403
and then our right-hand
side it's going to be ...

00:05:44.195 --> 00:05:47.514
Well it could be E to the RT plus C

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.663
or this is the same thing.

00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:52.223
This thing right over
here is the same thing

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:57.835
as E to the RT, E to the R times T, times,

00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:06.912
actually let me do that
E in that same color.

00:06:06.912 --> 00:06:11.231
E to the RT, times E to the C,

00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:14.264
times E to the C, right?

00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:16.703
I'm just taking E to the
sum of these two exponents.

00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:19.466
That's going to be E to
the RT, times E to the C.

00:06:20.342 --> 00:06:21.436
If we want to, we could
just hey you know what,

00:06:22.282 --> 00:06:23.984
this is still just going to be some

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:25.649
arbitrary constant here.

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.745
Actually let's just call this C.

00:06:28.609 --> 00:06:30.086
It's E to the RT times C

00:06:30.086 --> 00:06:35.086
or we could say C times E to the RT.

00:06:42.676 --> 00:06:45.181
Notice, so we have solved
the differential equation.

00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:47.443
We haven't gotten to this kind of

00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:49.558
less than optimistic reality of Malthus

00:06:49.558 --> 00:06:50.289
where we're limiting it.

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.424
This is just hey, if we
just assume population

00:06:52.424 --> 00:06:53.325
is going to ...

00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:55.523
The rate of change of
population with respect to time

00:06:55.523 --> 00:06:57.988
is going to be proportional to population.

00:06:57.988 --> 00:06:59.985
When we solve that differential equation,

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:01.794
we get that population
is a function of time.

00:07:01.794 --> 00:07:03.477
Actually let me make it explicit

00:07:03.477 --> 00:07:05.030
that this is a function of time.

00:07:05.003 --> 00:07:09.401
Let me just move the N over a little bit,

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:10.864
so let me write it this way.

00:07:10.864 --> 00:07:15.864
N of T is going to be equal to this.

00:07:17.261 --> 00:07:20.797
This was our solution to
this differential equation.

00:07:20.797 --> 00:07:23.122
Once again this is going
to just grow forever

00:07:23.122 --> 00:07:24.499
and if we know the initial conditions

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:29.499
and so let's say that
we knew that N of zero

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:32.093
when time is equal to zero.

00:07:32.093 --> 00:07:33.175
Let's just say that's N sub naught

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:35.346
so what would C be?

00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:40.698
Well N of zero is going to be equal to C.

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:44.540
C times E to the zero power.

00:07:44.054 --> 00:07:45.356
You know the zero power is just one

00:07:45.842 --> 00:07:47.041
so this is going to be equal to C,

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:51.239
so C is equal to N sub naught.

00:07:51.239 --> 00:07:52.606
Now we can even write it

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:55.118
that the solution to this
thing right over here

00:07:55.118 --> 00:08:00.118
is N as a function of T

00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:03.947
is going to be equal to C times ...

00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:08.484
Be careful, N naught,
our initial population,

00:08:08.484 --> 00:08:13.484
times E to the E to the RT.

00:08:15.937 --> 00:08:18.273
Now once again this is an exponential.

00:08:18.273 --> 00:08:20.514
Essentially our population
is going to look like this.

00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:24.625
If I were to graph it, it's going to look

00:08:25.563 --> 00:08:27.116
if that's my time axis,

00:08:27.116 --> 00:08:30.037
that's my N axis right over here.

00:08:30.037 --> 00:08:32.453
I could say it's Y equals N axis,

00:08:32.453 --> 00:08:35.955
however I want to denote it.

00:08:35.955 --> 00:08:37.538
That would be N naught

00:08:37.538 --> 00:08:40.443
and it's going to grow
exponentially from there.

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:41.534
The rate of this exponential function

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:45.366
is going to be dictated by
this constant right over there

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:46.674
but it's going to be
look something like this

00:08:46.674 --> 00:08:48.681
and it's just going to grow
faster and faster and faster

00:08:48.744 --> 00:08:50.273
forever and ever and ever and ever.

00:08:50.273 --> 00:08:52.596
Now, as I mentioned at the
beginning of the video,

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:55.988
Malthus does not believe

00:08:55.988 --> 00:08:57.141
that this is going to be true.

00:08:57.141 --> 00:08:59.582
He thinks that we're going
to hit some natural limits

00:08:59.582 --> 00:09:02.651
that are going to start to
constrain the population.

00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:04.603
In his mind the more natural

00:09:05.695 --> 00:09:09.173
or more realistic function
to model population

00:09:09.173 --> 00:09:12.134
would look something like this

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:15.831
or even potentially something
that you keep going crashing

00:09:15.831 --> 00:09:19.288
around that kind of limit.

00:09:19.288 --> 00:09:22.180
What we'll see in the next
video is that P.F. Verhulst

00:09:22.018 --> 00:09:25.202
actually came up with a very
good one differential equation

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.282
and solution to the differential equation

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:31.753
that does model a lot
better, that better describes

00:09:31.753 --> 00:09:34.524
the reality that Malthus
believed that we were in.
