&gt;&gt; I will.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:14.697
I'm going to read a poem by

00:08:18.356 --> 00:08:20.356
a book.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.068
I opened a book and in I strode.
Now nobody can find me.

00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:31.134
I've left my chair, my house, my
road, my town, and my world 

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:33.135
behind me.

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:37.224
I'm wearing the cloak, slipped 
on the  ring.

00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:41.921
I've swallowed the magic 
position.

00:08:46.498 --> 00:08:48.351
I dived in a bottomless ocean.  
I opened a book and made some 

00:08:48.352 --> 00:08:50.352
friends.

00:08:55.513 --> 00:08:57.513
I shared their tears and lafo 
lafort 

00:08:58.968 --> 00:09:01.614
laster and followed the road to 
its happily ever after.  I 

00:09:01.615 --> 00:09:04.465
finished my book and out I came.
The cloak no longer can hide me.

00:09:06.485 --> 00:09:08.485
My chair and my house are just 
the 

00:09:11.187 --> 00:09:13.187
same, but I have a book inside 
me.

00:09:13.643 --> 00:09:15.509

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:44.684
Donaldson, and it's called "The 
Gruffalo"."  A mouse took a 

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:49.212
stroll through the deep, dark 
wood.  A fox saw the mouse, and 

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:51.213
the mouse looked good.

00:09:54.316 --> 00:09:56.316
Where are you going to, little 
brown mouse?

00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:01.887
Come and have lunch in my 
underground house.  It's 

00:10:01.888 --> 00:10:03.888
terribly kind of you, fox, but, 

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:09.019

a gruffalo.  A gruffalo?  What's

He has terrible tusks and 
terrible claws and terrible 

00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:25.621
teeth in his terrible jaws.  
Where are you meeting him?  Here

00:10:25.622 --> 00:10:27.622
by these rocks and his favorite 

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.510
food is roasted fox.  Roasted 
fox?

00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:39.661
I'm off, fox said.  Good-bye, 
little mouse, and away he sped. 

00:10:39.662 --> 00:10:41.662
Cheerio, fox.

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:47.397
Doesn't he know there's no such 
thing as a gruffalo?  On went 

00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:50.442
the mouse through the deep, dark
wood.  An owl saw the mouse and 

00:10:50.443 --> 00:10:52.443
the mouse looked good.

00:10:55.524 --> 00:10:57.524
Where are you going to, little 
brown mouse?

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.220
Come and have tea in my tree top
house.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.900
It's quite nice of you owl, but,

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:09.675
I'm going to have tea with a 
gruffalo.  A gruffalo?  What's a

00:11:09.676 --> 00:11:11.676

00:11:12.728 --> 00:11:14.728
A gruffalo, why didn't you know?

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:19.862
He has knobbly knees and turned 
up toes and a poisonous wart on 

00:11:19.863 --> 00:11:24.131
the end of his nose.  Where are 
you meeting him?  Here by this 

00:11:24.132 --> 00:11:26.132

00:11:31.326 --> 00:11:33.326
Owl ice cream?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.304
Whohee, good-bye little mouse, 
and away owl flew.

00:11:42.997 --> 00:11:44.623
Silly old owl, doesn't he know 
there's no such thing as a 

00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:46.884
gruffalo.  On went the mouse 
through the deep, 

00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:53.408
dark wood.  A snake saw the 
mouse and the mouse looked good.

00:11:56.489 --> 00:11:58.489
Where are you going to, little 
brown mouse?

00:12:02.434 --> 00:12:04.434

00:12:21.932 --> 00:12:23.932
are orange, his tongue is black.

00:12:26.425 --> 00:12:28.872
He has purple pimples all over

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:48.955
And away snake slid.
Silly old snake, doesn't he know

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.312

&gt;&gt; The gruffalo.

00:14:54.123 --> 00:14:58.263
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; So now we wonder what's going

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:02.967
on.  As you may remember, the 
mouse has just encountered the 

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:05.013
real gruffalo in the woods.

00:15:08.914 --> 00:15:10.743
.
My favorite food, the gruffalo 

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:13.197
said.  You'll taste good on a 
slice of bread.

00:15:16.859 --> 00:15:19.917
Good, said the mouse.  Don't 
call me good.  I'm a mysterious 

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.997
creature in this wood.  Just 
walk behind me and soon you'll 

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:25.856
see everyone is afraid of me.  
All right said the gruffalo, 

00:15:25.857 --> 00:15:30.947
bursting with raver. laughter.  
You go ahead and I'll follow 

00:15:30.948 --> 00:15:33.019
after.  They walked and walked 
until the 

00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:41.670
gruffalo said I hear a hiss 
ahead.  It's snake said the 

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:46.596
mouse.  Why hello.  Snake took 
one look at the gruffalo.   Oh, 

00:15:46.597 --> 00:15:48.597
crumbs, he said.  Good-bye 
little mouse.

00:15:52.712 --> 00:15:56.394
And off he slid to his log pile 
house.  You see said the mouse? 

00:15:56.395 --> 00:15:58.395
I told you so.  Amazing said the
gruffalo.

00:16:01.521 --> 00:16:03.961
They walked some more until the 
gruffalo said I hear a hoot in 

00:16:03.962 --> 00:16:08.658
the trees ahead.  It's owl, said
the mouse.  Why, owl, hello.

00:16:13.144 --> 00:16:15.214
Owl took one look at the 
gruffalo.  Oh, dear, he said, 

00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:19.911
good-bye little mouse, and off 
he flew to his tree top house.  

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:22.776
You see, said the mouse?  I told
you so.

00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:28.669
Astounding, said the gruffalo.  
They walked some more until the 

00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:33.970
gruffalo said I can hear feet on
the path ahead.  It's fox said 

00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:38.638
the mouse.  Why, fox, hello.  
Fox took one look at the 

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.639
gruffalo.

00:16:46.008 --> 00:16:48.008
Oh, good-bye he said and off he 
ran to his underground house.

00:16:51.115 --> 00:16:53.132
Well, said mouse everyone is 
afraid of me but now my tummy is

00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:56.007
beginning to rumble and my 
favorite food is gruffalo 

00:16:58.696 --> 00:17:01.600
crumble.  Gruffalo crumble, the 
gruffalo said, 

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:07.879
and quick as the wind he turned 
and fled.

00:17:10.163 --> 00:17:12.163
All was quiet in the deep, dark 
wood.

00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:17.077
The mouse found a nut and the 
nut was good.

00:17:19.764 --> 00:17:24.880
[ APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; All right.  Fantastic.  Here 

00:17:24.881 --> 00:17:26.881
we go.  Whoops.

00:17:28.794 --> 00:17:30.794
We're going to sing a song now 
based 

00:17:36.307 --> 00:17:37.968
on one of Julia's little list of
flat books, which is called it's

00:17:37.969 --> 00:17:40.218
a little baby.  So we're going 
to do some -- it's an action 

00:17:40.219 --> 00:17:42.219
song.

00:17:44.432 --> 00:17:47.362
So we're going to peak through 
our fingers first, then we're 

00:17:47.363 --> 00:17:49.363
going to point.  Then we're 
going to wave.

00:17:53.514 --> 00:17:55.557
And then clap and finally dance.
So let's have everybody do those

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.230
action when is we sing them 
them.

00:18:01.515 --> 00:18:02.585
.

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:05.451
Somebody's hiding.  I wonder 
who.  It's a little baby and 

00:18:05.452 --> 00:18:07.452
she's peaking at you.

00:18:12.422 --> 00:18:14.487
Can you peak, can you peak, can 
you peak too?  Somebody's 

00:18:14.488 --> 00:18:16.567
hiding.  I wonder who.

00:18:19.847 --> 00:18:22.488
It's a little baby and he's 
pointing at you.  Can you point?

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:30.644
Can you point?  Can you point 
too?  Somebody's hiding.  I 

00:18:30.645 --> 00:18:32.645
wonder who.

00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:37.981
It's a little baby and he's 
waiving at you.  Can you wait?  

00:18:37.982 --> 00:18:44.083
Can you wait?  Can you wait too?
Somebody's hiding.  I wonder 

00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:46.084
who.

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:53.179
It's a little baby and he's 
clapping with you.

00:18:55.345 --> 00:18:58.018
Clap, clap, can you clap too?  
Somebody's hiding.  I wonder 

00:18:58.019 --> 00:19:00.019
who.

00:19:01.495 --> 00:19:03.495
It's a little baby and she's 
dancing 

00:19:04.754 --> 00:19:11.110
for you.  Can you dance?  Can 
you dance too?  Wonderful.  

00:19:11.111 --> 00:19:13.111
Thank you.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.011
.
We've come to the end of our 

00:19:17.012 --> 00:19:20.118
live stream.  So let's do our 
good-bye song, which is the 

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:22.119
opposite of the hello.

00:19:25.685 --> 00:19:28.535
We're going to wave and then -- 
wave friends three times.

00:19:32.819 --> 00:19:35.273
Say good-bye.  All right.
â™«â™«

00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.291
Good buy friends.  Good-bye 
friends.

00:19:41.434 --> 00:19:43.434
Good-bye friends.

00:19:45.711 --> 00:19:48.760
It's time to say good-bye.
â™«â™«

00:19:50.837 --> 00:19:52.837
&gt;&gt; Come again.
