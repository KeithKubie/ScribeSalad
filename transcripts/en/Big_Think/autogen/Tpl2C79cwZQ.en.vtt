the neglected tropical diseases are

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320
the neglected tropical diseases are
 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.560
the neglected tropical diseases are
diseases which as you can tell by their

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570
diseases which as you can tell by their
 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.140
diseases which as you can tell by their
name are terribly neglected it means

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150
name are terribly neglected it means
 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.109
name are terribly neglected it means
that they have not received the level of

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119
that they have not received the level of
 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.540
that they have not received the level of
interest or investment or intervention

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550
interest or investment or intervention
 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.820

that they deserve over the years and yet
 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.089
that they deserve over the years and yet
by some estimates they actually are the

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099
by some estimates they actually are the
 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.999
by some estimates they actually are the
together the largest disease burden on

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009
together the largest disease burden on
 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.460
together the largest disease burden on
the planet today so one of the most

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470
the planet today so one of the most
 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.040

common diseases of the neglected
 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.590
common diseases of the neglected
tropical diseases are intestinal worms

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600
tropical diseases are intestinal worms
 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.630
tropical diseases are intestinal worms
and these are worms which embed

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640
and these are worms which embed
 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.819
and these are worms which embed
themselves in the bowel they can result

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829
themselves in the bowel they can result
 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.729
themselves in the bowel they can result
in malnutrition they can result in

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739
in malnutrition they can result in
 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.889
in malnutrition they can result in
vitamin deficiencies they can result in

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899
vitamin deficiencies they can result in
 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.790
vitamin deficiencies they can result in
diarrhea and ultimately making children

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800
diarrhea and ultimately making children
 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.310
diarrhea and ultimately making children
and adults as well more susceptible to

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320
and adults as well more susceptible to
 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.220
and adults as well more susceptible to
other diseases and I think that this is

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230
other diseases and I think that this is
 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.130
other diseases and I think that this is
a really important takeaway on the NTDs

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140
a really important takeaway on the NTDs
 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.720

alone is not the answer what what else

is needed is actually access to clean

this is something that can be done

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560
this is something that can be done
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.960
this is something that can be done
through schools it can be done through

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970
through schools it can be done through
 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.150
through schools it can be done through
existing health centers there's not a

massive incremental cost it doesn't take
 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.860
massive incremental cost it doesn't take
a lot more time to do and yet it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
a lot more time to do and yet it
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.500
a lot more time to do and yet it
actually has a domino effect on taking

actually has a domino effect on taking
 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.660
actually has a domino effect on taking
out other diseases downstream and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
out other diseases downstream and
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.150
out other diseases downstream and
overall improving lives and improving

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
overall improving lives and improving
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.640
overall improving lives and improving
