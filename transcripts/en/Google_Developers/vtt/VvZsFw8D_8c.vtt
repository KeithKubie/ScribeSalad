NIK SATHE: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.440
And for those of you watching
the Livestream, good day in

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.220
whatever time zone you're in.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.030
My name is Nik Sathe.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
I am part of the engineering
team for Google Wallet.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.200
And over the last many, many
years, a decade or so, we here

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.300
at Google, along with many of
you, have been looking to

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.380
digitize the world around us.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.060
We consume most media digitally,
whether it's

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.456
videos, books, music.

00:00:29.456 --> 00:00:31.010
We communicate digitally.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.850
We take digital pictures.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.980
But the one thing in our lives
that has sort of resisted this

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.860
trend is our wallet, which has
remained strangely analog all

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.230
of these years.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.520
Many of us have pieces of
leather or fabric stuffed full

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.980
of paper or plastic, that take
up our daily lives in such a

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.030
way that there are TV sitcom
episodes that are dedicated to

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.490
large wallets.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.090
And there's also a medical
condition called fat wallet

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.675
syndrome that affects millions
out there in the world.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.230
It seems like we destroy entire
rainforests to create

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.330
paper coupons.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.020
But the redemption rate
is maybe 1% or 2%.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.560
That's a pretty bad
ratio in my book.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.910
And we also have a lot of
merchants, for people like me

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.110
that like to save money--

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.250
we want to sign up for
loyalty cards.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.730
And the US households, on
average, have about 18 loyalty

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.380
programs that they've
signed up for.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.330
But the majority of us leave our
loyalty cards at home and

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.240
don't actually benefit
from the savings

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.940
that we have out there.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.990
So we have dead animals, dead
trees, and wallets full of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.290
inanimate objects that don't
really help us do things, and

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.830
a shopping experience that's
actually still pretty arcane.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.330
We still go to stores, look
for items, stand in line,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.290
rummage around in our wallets to
find these coupons to save

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.040
some money, a loyalty card to
earn some points, and then

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.759
finally, a payment instrument
to make a payment with.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.050
This is really not the way that
things should be working

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.820
in the digital era, is it?

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.160
And it's no wonder that
consumers have told us, and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.610
probably told many of you as
well, that they really want

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.300
digital versions of offers
and loyalty cards, most

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.270
importantly.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.200
And 53% of them have told
us that they want those.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.670
But unfortunately, only
4% actually use them.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.300
So why this disconnect?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.500
What's up with that?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.360
People want digital versions,
but they aren't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.270
really using them.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.140
One of the reasons may be that
in our efforts as an industry

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.020
to try to solve this problem for
consumers, we have created

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.070
literally hundreds of
applications that try to solve

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.740
this problem.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.750
A simple search in any app store
will find over 1,000

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.490
apps for offers and 650
apps for loyalty.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.010
But no consumer in their right
mind is going to want to have

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.270
more than a few of these
that they really want

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.520
to be engaged with.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.380
Another issue that we've found
is that the very reason why

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.990
merchants want to engage in
these relationships with

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.060
consumers, to better understand
them so that they

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.570
can help them save time and
save money, is the data.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.250
And unfortunately, because of
our arcane processes today,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.850
many times the data that's in
loyalty programs is really

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.530
irrelevant.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.470
We have many people that have
signed up as Elvis Presley,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.440
which, by the way, is the most
common pseudonym used in

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.790
loyalty programs out there, or
Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.270
And I'm sure we have a few
Elvises in this room.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.360
You don't have to admit it
if you don't want to.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.880
So these are the sorts of
problems that we tried to set

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.150
ourselves up to solve
at Google.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.800
And I believe that
we have made some

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.390
inroads in that effort.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.970
So our vision is to create
a platform and enable an

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.050
ecosystem that will digitize
the entire wallet.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.560
We want you to be able to take
digital versions of all sorts

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.720
of things that people carry
around with them today,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.830
digitize them, move them up to
the cloud where they can be

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.960
used anytime, anywhere.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.900
And as the lines blur between
physical retail of bricks and

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.910
mortar and online commerce,
we believe that this cloud

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.530
wallet, with digital content
combined with a mobile device,

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.390
will allow you to seamlessly
bridge from the online world

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.060
to the offline world.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.240
So today, I'm very, very
proud to announce--

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.720
and excited to announce--

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.290
extensions of the Google Wallet
Platform, specifically

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.590
the Wallet Objects API.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.710
And here to tell you a little
bit more about the details of

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.970
these capabilities
is Pali Bhat.

00:05:07.504 --> 00:05:12.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.380
PALI BHAT: Thanks, Nik.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.590
I'm very excited to talk to you
a little bit more about

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.020
the Google Wallet Objects API.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.150
Because the first thing we did
with the Wallet Objects API

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.820
was make it extensible.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.720
We wanted Wallet Objects API to
allow developers like you

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.180
to be able to store any type of
object into Google Wallet.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.500
And this is not just limited
to the paper coupons or the

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.300
plastic loyalty cards that
Nik already talked about.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.320
But this could be any object
that you can imagine.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.196
So this could be key reports
that you want to store in, or

00:05:45.196 --> 00:05:46.830
let your customers store.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.280
It could be gift cards,
tickets, et cetera.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.700
And of course, while we were
building out this extensible

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.340
platform, we wanted to change
these objects, these lifeless,

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.080
inanimate objects, into
rich objects that

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.710
you can engage with.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.040
So we wanted you to be able to
engage with your customers

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.270
through sending them
personalized messages or

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.500
real-time updates.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.980
And these real-time updates
could be point balances for

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.150
your loyalty card.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.310
It could be expiring offers--

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.850
any sort of update that could
get you to engage with your

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.750
customers better.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.810
And of course, we wanted to
facilitate all of this with

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.890
your brand within
Google Wallet.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.470
So you get a complete branded
experience with your brand

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.150
that you can use to engage
with your customers.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.730
And of course, like everything
else that you've heard about

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.910
today at Google, you get to
reach millions of Google users

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.700
by using the Wallet
Objects API.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.480
But before we go too far into
the API, I just wanted to talk

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.320
a little bit about what the
customer experience, what the

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.320
user experience looks like, and
how that compares to the

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.950
world that Nik described
previously of what exists

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.020
today with paper coupons and
plastic loyalty cards.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.330
So let's talk a little
bit about Maya.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.480
This is your typical mom who's
very busy juggling multiple

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.330
jobs and also, doing most of the
shopping for her family.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.890
And of course, in the current
world, when she needs to find

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.760
savings, or tries to save time,
what she has to do is

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.500
sign up for loyalty programs.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.330
And these are usually cumbersome
paper forms or go

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.600
through a stack of paper coupons
where she finds offers

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.730
that are relevant to her.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.520
And so we decided to make this
finding process, whether it's

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.580
loyalty cards, offers, or any
other objects that are of

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.730
interest to her, very,
very simple, either

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.720
within your own site--

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.470
and this is whether you're
a developer or merchant--

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.240
or within Google Wallet.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.570
The next thing that she has to
do is go save this to Google.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.250
Now, usually in the physical
world, what has to happen is

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.010
that you have to clip a paper
coupon or store a loyalty card

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.500
within your purse.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.330
With Google Wallet objects
API, all you need is your

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.160
Google account.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.020
So Maya can just use her Gmail
username and password and be

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.340
able to save any type
of wallet object to

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.100
Google for use later.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.740
And of course, in a typical
shopping experience, Maya

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.210
would need to go in, find this
offer or loyalty card,

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.400
remember to use it.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.179
And that remembering part
is really, really hard.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.890
What we've heard is that a
majority of customers in the

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.799
United States today-- and Nik
referred to 18 loyalty

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.750
programs in the United
States today--

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:48.090
a majority of them, over half
of them, users like Maya

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.350
forget about.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.020
So they sign up for it, then
just forget about it, and

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.650
leave it in a drawer.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.990
And we are going to solve that
by giving you timely geo-fence

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.390
notifications at the right
time and place.

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.340
And it's going to work with
all of the other Google

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.990
technologies we have out there,
so that a user like

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:10.910
Maya always has these objects
showing up on their phone at

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.990
the right time and place.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.950
And the use is, of course,
very simple.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.110
Instead of digging through your
purse and handing it out

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:21.760
over checkout, you just have to
show your smartphone, and

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.620
it's there for use with a
barcode, or QR code, or

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.080
whatever other thing
you prefer.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.940
And lastly, we don't want
that interaction

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.120
to stop right there.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.340
We want you to be able to engage
with Maya and other

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.540
customers of yours through
the Wallet Objects API.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.320
Now, what I wanted to do next
was talk to you about two of

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.870
the different types of objects
that we focused on.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.270
And that includes loyalty.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.030
And I'm going to talk a little
bit more about that.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.090
And then David's going
to talk a little

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.340
bit more about offers.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.730
Well, lots of merchants out
there have loyalty programs to

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.270
acquire and engage
their users.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.910
And what all of them use to
acquire and engage their

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.120
users, there are many, many
problems with it.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.820
And I'm going to talk about two
of the big problems that

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.610
exist with loyalty programs out
there today-- these paper

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.490
or plastic-based loyalty
programs-- and how we've

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.330
solved that with the Google
Wallet Objects API.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.640
So the first, of course,
is sign up.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.950
Today, the process for signing
up for a loyalty card happens

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.620
to be going and standing in
customer service, getting a

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.960
paper form, filling
it out, and then

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.580
handing it back to them.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.560
Hopefully you get activated
immediately, or maybe it's a

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.210
few days later.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.150
And then you have to fill out
all of the data that you have,

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.110
similar to your name,
et cetera.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.840
And maybe you enter Elvis
Presley, maybe something else,

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.120
just because it's so cumbersome
to fill out.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.260
And what we've done
is solved that by

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.640
introducing instant sign-up.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.880
So what you can do now, as a
merchant or developer, is

00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.910
allow your users to sign up
with just a few touches on

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.440
their phone.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.870
And I'm even going to do a short
demo of that right now.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:11.170
And the next thing, of course,
is real-time updates.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.520
What you can do today is--

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.770
typically, most of these loyalty
programs do not even

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.630
have email addresses of
you, so they can't

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.875
communicate with you.

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:22.940
We'll enable real-time point
balance updates in

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.580
personalized messages.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.910
And you'll see a little bit of
that in my demo as well.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.340
And of course, we decided
to make this

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.700
really simple to integrate.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.460
And it will work with your
existing loyalty programs.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.610
So without further ado, I'm
going to switch to the

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:43.670
WolfVision here and show
you how this will work.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.530
Now, one of the things I want
you to note is that this isn't

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.030
our consumer-facing
user experience.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.420
This is just something that we
pulled together so that our

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.360
developers can see how
this would work.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.130
So when we do the launch of
this Wallet Objects API

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.640
functionality, you will see
that some of this user

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.460
experience will differ.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.780
But you can look at a first
screen that would just be an

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.050
introduction that tells me I
can store all of my loyalty

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.000
programs in Wallet.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.870
So I'm just going to
get started here.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.670
It shows me a list of all of the
amazing loyalty programs

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.340
that I could sign up for.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.450
And we hope in partnership with
you that we'll have lots

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.910
of loyalty program you
can sign up for.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.180
I think I'm going to
pick Marriott.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.110
Because like lots of the folks
out here, we are staying at

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.110
the Marriott Marquis
that's close by.

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.210
And I'd love to have
some Marriott

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:34.460
Reward Points for that.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.260
So the first thing it
will do is pull up

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.230
information about Marriott.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.570
And it will tell me
a little bit more

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.330
about Marriott Rewards.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.540
It tells me I can get
priority check-in.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.120
That sounds pretty good
when I'm showing

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.030
up at 11:00 PM tonight.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.800
And some free nights as well.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.800
Turns out I'm not yet a member
of Marriott Rewards, so I'm

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.660
going to just say Join Now.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.850
Well, it's already pre-populated
with my

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.470
information.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.720
So you see my name.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.830
And I'm just going to agree to
the terms of service, because

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.510
I trust Marriott.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.640
And I'm going to create
my account.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.680
And just like that, you should
see that my Marriott Rewards

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.780
Wallet Object should get
stored in my Wallet.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.220
And I'm going to give
it a second here.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.350
And look, nice.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.300
I've joined the program, and my
account has been activated.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.630
And this all happened
in real time.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.525
And it's instant sign-up.

00:13:35.525 --> 00:13:39.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.270
PALI BHAT: And you see, I
have my Wallet Object.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.330
I've got my member ID.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.190
And there's a message, even a
personalized message, from

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.740
Marriott Rewards for me.

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.090
And this Wallet Object can
be updated in real time.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.810
So what this means for all your
developers out there is

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:57.290
that this is an opportunity
for you to create a Wallet

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:01.530
Object, and then engage with
your customers in real time.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:07.080
So with that, what I'm going
to do is call over David to

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.095
talk a little bit more
about offers.

00:14:09.095 --> 00:14:10.850
DAVID SINGLETON: Thanks, Pali.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.560
My name's David Singleton, and
I'm Engineering Director for

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.020
Google Offers.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.300
So even though I'm from the
Google Offers team, I'm here

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.330
today to tell you how anyone
can use the Wallet Objects

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.960
Save to Wallet API to save
offer objects from your

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.310
website directly to their
Google Wallet.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.970
And Nik and Pali have already
explained a little bit about

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.460
how digital wallets can bring
paper coupons to life.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.810
Not only is it much easier to
have and carry my phone with

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.240
me-- it's probably already in my
pocket compared to a stack

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.620
of paper coupons that I might
be interested in.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:54.260
But a problem that I find
frequently with coupons is

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.560
that I always forget
to use them.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.200
How many times have you pulled
a crumpled piece of paper out

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.500
of your wallet to discover
that the expiration

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.940
date was long past?

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.900
It's something that happens
to me all the time.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.750
Once an offer is saved to Google
Wallet, the app will

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.210
actually keep track and remind
users when they're near a

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.420
store and they can actually
best redeem the offer.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.520
And that way, they're much less
likely to go unredeemed.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.908
So let's take a look
at how this works.

00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:34.360
Pali already introduced you
to Maya, who is a mother.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.950
She's got two children.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.140
And this weekend, she would
like to buy some new

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:41.030
shoes for her kids.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.470
So what she does-- she
likes to save money--

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.830
she goes to her favorite
couponing site on the web,

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:48.440
which is RetailMeNot.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.950
And she's looking for an offer
that she could use close to

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.750
her home in Mountain View.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.820
My RetailMeNot have integrated
the Wallet Objects Save to

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.170
Wallet API.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.230
Let's take a look at
how that affects

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.630
Maya's experience here.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.220
So she's scanning the
available offers.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.080
And here's one that looks
interesting from Sports

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.745
Authority, 20% off one item.

00:16:08.745 --> 00:16:11.500
We'll take a deeper look.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.380
And what you can see here is
that there's a Save Offer to

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.740
Google button available
on the page.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.850
Now, Maya's already signed in to
her Google account, so all

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:27.085
she has to do to save that
offer is a simple click.

00:16:27.085 --> 00:16:29.700
And now you can see it says
that the offer is saved to

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.340
Maya's Google Wallet.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.500
Let's take a look over here.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.050
DAVID SINGLETON: Thanks.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.030
Let's take a look over
on her phone.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.900
And you can see that the offer
is already available there.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.114
And she could go directly into
the store to use it.

00:16:46.114 --> 00:16:50.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.010
DAVID SINGLETON: We switch back,
she can continue her

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.140
browsing experience.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.040
Here's another one from Forever
21 that looks great.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.030
Again, just a single
click to get that.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:05.349
Now, let's fast forward
to Saturday morning.

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:09.270
Maya drives to the mall, pulls
into the parking lot, and

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:14.099
let's take a close look at what
happens on her phone.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.440
So what you can see right here--
it just when buzz.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.839
And there's actually a
notification already on her

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:23.800
phone reminding her that she has
a saved offer nearby that

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.280
she can use at Sports
Authority.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.474
So she goes into the store.

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.620
She goes into the store, walks
around, finds the shoes that

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.550
she was looking for.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.510
Maybe picks up a yoga
mat on the way out.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.720
And all she needs to do now is
go back to that notification

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.410
on her phone, tap it, and she's
taken directly into the

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.650
redemption screen for
that saved offer.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.060
In order to use it, all she
needs to do now is show it to

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.220
the cashier at the point
of sale, and she

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:04.780
saves her 20% off.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.940
So with the Wallet Objects Save
to Wallet API, you can

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.350
take advantage of distribution
on your own website.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.210
But alongside the Wallet Objects
Platform, we have

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.450
Google Offers, which allows
you to extend your reach

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.720
through Google properties across
the web, search ads on

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.130
Maps, which you might
have seen during the

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.880
keynote demo earlier.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.170
You don't have to use Google
Offers in order to take

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.610
advantage of the Wallet
Objects Platform.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.390
But using the Save to Wallet API
gives you a seamless path

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.820
for users and merchant staff, if
you do decide to upgrade to

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.720
Google Offers, to extend
that reach.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.400
And now I'm going to hand
back to Pali to

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.828
explain a little more.

00:18:44.828 --> 00:18:50.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.550
PALI BHAT: Thanks, David.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:57.350
So we know that the world's
top developers join us at

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.070
Google I/O. And we're excited to
tell you that our platform,

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:04.010
the Wallet Objects Platform,
isn't limited to just loyalty

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.390
cards and offers.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.350
So I want to show you two
examples of how we've created

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.810
an extensible platform for
you to take advantage of.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.860
So the first thing that I want
to talk about is the types

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.610
that are supported within
Google Wallet.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:26.840
What we've done is picked the
two most commonly used

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.500
examples, which is loyalty
cards and offers.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:35.400
But you could actually go in and
save any type of object to

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.500
Google Wallet.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.970
So these objects could be as
simple as a library card to

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.730
your local town's library.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.760
Or, it could be as sophisticated
as the Wallet

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.370
Object that our partner
BillGuard has built, which

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.660
lets you get alerted for
fraudulent transactions on

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.780
your credit card.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.300
And so really, the limit
here is only by

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.950
what you can imagine.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.680
So I would encourage all of
you to partner with us to

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.730
create innovative
Wallet Objects.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.070
And we will actually make an
effort, on specific types of

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.880
objects, to share it with
standards bodies, like

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.600
schema.org so that everyone
can take advantage of it.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.580
The second thing that we've
done is we've created a

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.340
platform in which all of the
ecosystem providers out there

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.450
and developers out there can
build very, very interesting

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.800
tools on top of this platform.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.880
So an example is Urban Airship,
which is one of our

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.920
partners, which is showcasing
their tool within a Sandbox at

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.950
Google I/O on the
second floor--

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.590
I hope you join us there.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.160
And they've made a drag and drop
tool that will let you

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.000
create a Wallet Object.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.950
And so this is an example of the
Urban Airship tool being

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.200
used to create Alaska Airlines
loyalty card.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.070
If you want to learn more
about this tool and this

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.180
integration, I'd encourage you
to stop by at our Sandbox.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.960
So we haven't stopped
right there.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.890
We've got a number of different
partners that have

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.200
joined us today.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.840
So it's Alaska Airlines,
Belly, BillGuard, BJ's

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.940
Restaurants, The Body Shop,
Marriott Rewards, Raley's, Red

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.110
Mango, and RetailMeNot.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.900
And all of these brands are
already integrating into the

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.600
Wallet Objects Platform.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.360
In addition, if you want to make
it much, much simpler to

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.050
integrate, then we've had a
bunch of tools partners and

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.450
technology providers, like
Accelitec, Blackhawk, Loyalty

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.310
Lab, Paytronix, ProfitPoint,
Urban Airship, and Vibes

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:43.720
already signed in, which
together, power over 300

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.530
loyalty programs, offers,
et cetera.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.930
And so we'll make it really
simple for you to onboard, if

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.710
you want to participate in the
Wallet Objects Platform.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.220
So I encourage you
all to do that.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.440
And to wrap up, I'll hand
over to Nik Sathe.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.840
NIK SATHE: Thanks, Pali.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.560
I hope you guys have a bunch
of creative ideas that have

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.930
started to turn over in your
minds as we have been

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.830
imagining for the last few
months while we've been

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.850
working on this platform.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.760
I did want to summarize a couple
of things, just to make

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:20.100
sure that we get the meat of
the content out there.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.570
Whoops.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.450
Guess I went too far.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.660
So as you've heard from Pali and
David, the Wallet Objects

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.990
Platform is intended to be a
set of capabilities that

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.330
empower you, as developers and
innovators, whether you're

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.220
working for yourselves trying
to engage directly with

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.100
consumers or whether you're
working on behalf of retailers

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.390
and merchants out there
to help them

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.360
engage with their customers.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.650
We believe we've given you a
rich set of functionality that

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.420
you can innovate on top of,
create branded experiences to

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.550
engage your customers, or engage
consumers out there.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:00.750
And to make sure that you do
that with the distribution

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.760
that Google can provide you with
through the Google Wallet

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.150
application.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:09.620
We already have millions of
Google Wallets out there, as

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.780
you've probably heard.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:14.650
They're available on a growing
number of devices.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.390
And our ambitions are to
significantly increase that

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.540
footprint later this year.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.580
We've only touched on the
surface, and I want to make

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.800
sure that you have opportunities
to hear more.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:30.200
Immediately after this, there
is a session down the hall

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.350
that's called Loyalty
Deep-dive.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.170
It's not just about
loyalty programs.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.540
They will talk more about the
data structures behind Wallet

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:41.640
Objects, the APIs, and the ways
that you can use that to

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.640
further your goals.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.590
We also have a sign-up form
where we will start issuing

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.010
API credentials in the next
couple of days, after the buzz

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.660
around I/O dies down.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.450
And you have a chance to go
to the Sandbox, as Pali

00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.130
mentioned, to not just see the
Urban Airship tools that have

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.540
been built, but also other
capabilities from partners

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.190
such as ProfitPoint.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.550
So I hope that this has
given you a sense for

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:10.640
what we have built.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.540
The intention was to allow
you, as developers, to

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.410
innovate freely.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.180
And also, gain the distribution
that's required

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:22.160
to reach millions of consumers
out there.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.310
Without any further ado, let
me go ahead and call my

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.480
colleagues up for Q&amp;A. If you
have a question, please come

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.940
down to the microphones so
that the folks on the

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.960
Livestream can hear you.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:41.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.556
PALI BHAT: And just one--

00:24:42.556 --> 00:24:44.200
can you turn my mic on?

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.400
Just one quick note to add,
speaking of freely.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:52.380
This API is available free of
cost to all developers.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.300
So please do take
advantage of it.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.185
NIK SATHE: No questions?

00:25:07.185 --> 00:25:08.435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.230
NIK SATHE: There's got
to be the first one.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:14.480
I think that'll loosen
the crowd up.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.590
AUDIENCE: Owen Thomas
from ReadWrite.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.450
When you talk about Google
Wallet being available on more

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.120
devices, I'm sure a lot of
developers are thinking this--

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.560
iOS?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:28.960
NIK SATHE: So we can't
specifically

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.750
comment on future plans.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.130
But as I said, even today we
have Google Wallet available

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.280
on millions of devices.

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.940
We are adding to those devices
daily, weekly, certifying new

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.870
devices and carriers.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.130
And our ambitions and our
plans are to extend that

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.503
footprint significantly.

00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:47.310
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:48.560
NIK SATHE: Thank you.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:53.640
PALI BHAT: Yeah, please come
to the microphones in the

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.900
center of the room.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.153
You can just circle
around the front.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.730
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Eduardo.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:07.980
I'm from Brazil.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.710
I saw some examples where you
use credit cards as the

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.455
payment method.

00:26:16.455 --> 00:26:20.160
But in emerging markets like
Brazil, Argentina, Colombia,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.040
Mexico, carrier [? billing ?]
is still very strong.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:29.200
So I'm not sure if I lost
something in the presentation,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.400
but do you have plans to go
to emerging markets in

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.650
partnership with carriers to use
carrier [? billing ?] in

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:36.900
the platform?

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.710
NIK SATHE: So what we talked
about just now had nothing to

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.910
do with payments, per se.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:47.170
And it might be a more
appropriate question for you

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:51.260
to come to our booth and talk
about specifically with regard

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:54.250
to our payment plans, since this
was really more extending

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.640
the Wallet beyond payments into
the kinds of things that

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.190
consumers would want to engage
with on a daily basis.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.474
Thank you.

00:27:02.474 --> 00:27:05.410
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Drew
[INAUDIBLE] from New Zealand.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.950
There's plenty of offer
platforms out at the moment.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.160
One of the things that doesn't
get catered for is the

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.680
redemption side on the
point of sale.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.640
Is there any sort of support
beyond the Wallet that you're

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.130
giving to the retailers?

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.550
DAVID SINGLETON: So our vision
with the Save to Wallet API

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.870
for Offers is that retailers
can use their

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.100
own existing systems.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.070
And they can use this platform
to take coupon data that they

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.400
might have already, get it
onto mobile devices.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.270
But then, in store, the
experience can be consistent

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.390
with whatever they're
doing already.

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.360
So you saw, I think, the
redemption experience that we

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:41.990
showed here.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.670
And that was very much in line
with what Sports Authority,

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.010
for instance, as an example,
are already doing.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:48.980
AUDIENCE: Sorry, just to ask.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.600
So one of the things might
be a one-time voucher.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.680
What are you doing?

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.950
Have you got considerations
for that?

00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:58.400
DAVID SINGLETON: So I'd really
encourage you to take a look

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.230
at the Wallet Object's
documentation.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.210
One of the things that
you can do here is--

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:05.280
there are two concepts.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.090
There's a concept of
a class of object.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.920
So on offer with a certain set
of terms would be a class.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.940
And then, when an offer is being
saved to Maya's account,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.490
she was actually receiving
an instance of it.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.650
The platform's very flexible and
extensible, so it would be

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:23.990
possible for the issuer to
actually generate unique

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.180
codes, for instance.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:27.250
I really encourage you to take
a look at the documentation,

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.480
which is at this URL.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.340
AUDIENCE: It was not found
when I had a look.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.940
PALI BHAT: Yeah, just one other
quick thing, is that

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.490
there is a session where we're
going to deep-dive into what

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.550
the API looks like.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.290
That will probably clarify
a lot of these questions.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.080
And that's going to start
in the next 25 minutes.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.170
PALI BHAT: Yeah.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.150
NIK SATHE: Thanks.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.340
Go ahead, in the front
of the room.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.400
AUDIENCE: Hi, John
from Chicago.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.900
So the APIs are available now.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.390
When is the Wallet app
going to be updated?

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.340
When can we expect to actually
get this into

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.640
the hands of consumers?

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.900
Thanks.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.660
PALI BHAT: Yeah, so we expect
to have the Wallet app

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.220
available very soon,
as soon as we can.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.390
But of course, we don't have
a specific timing to

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.820
announce right now.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:09.920
But stay tuned to our blog.

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.150
NIK SATHE: I think the one thing
I would add is in order

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.410
for the app to be adopted
widely, we need

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.400
to have great content.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.040
So I would encourage you guys to
start building the content,

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.630
and we will be releasing that.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.740
Again, it's not our policy to
talk about specific dates in

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:23.230
the future.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:27.590
But it will be as
soon as we can.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.320
AUDIENCE: Do you have any sample
apps that are already

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.570
live on Google Wallet?

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.450
PALI BHAT: No.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:40.110
So we haven't actually made any
sample apps available for

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:41.830
develops who don't
have API access.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.510
But the best thing to do is just
sign up for API access.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.250
And as soon as you see that,
you'll get a sample app in

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.850
your hands as well.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:47.550
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:50.890
The link doesn't seem to work.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.830
NIK SATHE: I'm sorry.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.110
What was that?

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.190
AUDIENCE: The link doesn't seem
to work on the sign-up

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.660
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.840
PALI BHAT: Oh, the link
isn't working?

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.255
Yeah, we'll get that
fixed right away.

00:29:56.255 --> 00:29:57.490
MALE SPEAKER: I'll get
the link fixed.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.430
In the meantime, just go to
google.com/wallet/business,

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.340
and you can sign up there.

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:05.110
PALI BHAT: So for those who are
on Livestream, you said

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:08.740
google.com/wallet/business, and
you can sign up there if

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.640
this link doesn't work.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.260
But the link will start
working soon as well.

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.740
NIK SATHE: Any other
questions?

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.330
Great.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.910
One thing that we didn't talk
about is we started the

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:25.320
platform with loyalty
and offers.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.830
We will be working with the
community to try to find the

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:32.610
next set of types that we will
add semantic definition to.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.570
And we are working with
organizations, like

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.880
schema.org, to try to establish
semantic standards

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.660
that these things can have, so
that other types can have

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.150
interoperability in the
future as well.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:48.420
So if any of you are interested
in helping us

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:52.590
define the next set of reified
types, as we call them, where

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.390
we can add more semantic
definition to the syntax that

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.020
the platform provides, we'd love
to hear from you in our

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:00.310
Sandbox as well.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.010
PALI BHAT: OK.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.710
NIK SATHE: OK.

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:02.310
PALI BHAT: Yeah, thank you.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.610
NIK SATHE: Great.

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:02.910
Thank you very much.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.210
DAVID SINGLETON: Thank you.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:36.095
