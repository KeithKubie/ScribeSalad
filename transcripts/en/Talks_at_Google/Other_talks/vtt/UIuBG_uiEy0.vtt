SPEAKER 1: Today, one
in every 68 children

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.770
has a diagnosis of autism.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.820
The spectrum is becoming
wider and wider.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.850
And because of that, there
are lots of misunderstandings

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.000
and misconceptions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.760
Some employers are thinking
about making accommodations

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.020
when we talk about autism.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.960
Some people assume
if a kid has autism,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.660
he must be having
a very high IQ.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.390
Some parents are feeling
like the world is ending

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.520
when their kids get diagnosed.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.140
None of these is accurate.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.080
Today, we are very
fortunate to have

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.340
the director from UW,
University of Washington Autism

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.150
Center, Annette Estes.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.620
She is a research professor
in the Department of Speech

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.760
and Hearing Services, and an
adjunct research professor

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.190
in the department of
psychology at the University

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.590
of Washington.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.160
She is also a
licensed psychologist

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.170
in the state of Washington.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.200
Her research is carried
out at the UW Autism

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.350
Center and the Center on Human
Development and Disability.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.960
Now, let's welcome Annette.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:23.620
ANNETTE ESTES:
Thank you so much.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.150
OK.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.740
Hi.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.590
Thank you for coming today.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.120
So we're going to
spend lunch together,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.220
and I'm going to be
talking about autism.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.980
We have time for questions.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.390
I kind of like taking
questions periodically

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.160
throughout the talk,
so I will do my best

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.920
to remember to do that.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.060
So, an autism spectrum
disorder is a general term

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.030
that is used to describe a group
of complex disorders of brain

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.400
development.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.071
When we talk about autism,
we're usually-- at this point,

00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:00.070
we're thinking about two
domains of functioning.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.050
One of them is
social communication.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.480
The other is restricted
and repetitive behaviors

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.120
or interests.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.870
And these impact
children and adults

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.150
in a number of different ways.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.590
So first of all, in the
communication domain,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.150
we think a lot about language.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.990
Language development
can be delayed.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.830
Some children never
end up functionally

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.370
being able to communicate.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.350
But with early
intervention, at this point

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.480
most people can develop
the ability to talk.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.030
A lot of people on
the autism spectrum

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.020
actually have language
abilities in the typical range,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.790
and it's more about the
non-verbal communication

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.380
where you see the impairment.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.520
So for example, gesture
use or eye contact

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.860
or emotional expressions
are sometimes

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.240
lacking in individuals
with autism.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.380
And sometimes, the
understanding of those kinds

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.070
of non-verbal
behaviors are lacking.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.560
With early intervention,
many people

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.910
achieve quite good levels of
communication and language

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.530
development.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.360
But what you often see is
a difficulty integrating

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.610
the verbal and the non-verbal.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.070
So even in individuals who have
achieved what we would consider

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.150
typical levels of being able to
communicate, sometimes things

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.260
are a little bit off.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.680
So maybe you'll have eye contact
without verbal interaction,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.820
or vice versa.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.390
You might see a person talking
without making eye contact

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.210
or using typical gestures.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.880
So this can impact people
in a number of ways.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.280
The reason that we talk
about social communication

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.160
is it's really hard to
disentangle communication

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.550
and social ability.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.060
So, social-emotional
reciprocity is another aspect

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.020
of communication.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.210
So that social approach,
sharing interests, feelings,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.310
initiating, responding
to social interactions,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.370
all of these things can
either be diminished

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.980
in individuals with autism,
or sometimes even lacking

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.500
entirely.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.880
But again, since we're
talking about a spectrum,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.750
it's not always the
case that there's not

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.190
an interest in
social interaction,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.080
but there's often difficulties
in developing or maintaining

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.910
or understanding relationships.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.010
And this can come about
for a number of reasons.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.820
So sometimes, it's
adjusting behavior

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.660
to suit the variety of
different social contexts

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.530
you find yourself in, whether
it's a child on the playground

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.400
versus at a family reunion
versus in a classroom.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.390
Sometimes, it's due
to the fact that kids

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.070
aren't as interested in peers.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.970
Sometimes it's
interested, but not

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.410
knowing how to kind of
initiate or connect with kids.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.660
And early on,
imaginative play is

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.990
so important to
child development,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.920
but also just in terms
of what kids do together.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.959
And this can be a specific
area of difficulty

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.000
for kids on the spectrum.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.130
So, restrictive and
repetitive behaviors

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.970
are the other circle that we
talked about at the beginning

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.270
of today.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.780
And this can kind
of manifest itself

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.260
in a couple different domains.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.200
So, one of them is in
stereotyped or repetitive motor

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.770
movements.

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.140
This is something that people
notice kind of pretty easily.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.960
So that could be
rocking back and forth

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.320
or flapping your hands
if you're really excited,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.370
that kind of thing.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.220
But it can also be a little
in a different domain.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.740
It can also have to do with
repetitive use of objects,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.490
or even repetitive speech, so
saying the same kinds of things

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.500
over and over again.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.150
And you can see in the
picture here a little boy

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.180
who winds up his toys
in a specific way

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.620
from smaller to larger.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.260
And that's an example
of a repetitive

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.620
type of use of objects.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.060
The other dimension of this
is insistence on sameness,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.710
or inflexible
adherence to routines.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.060
How this might look is a parent
bringing their child to school

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.950
a different way than
they normally drive

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.260
and having that result in a
lot of distress for the child.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.080
That's not something
that, typically,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.840
developing kids
worry about too much,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.120
but a lot of kids on
the autism spectrum

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.040
get thrown off by
those type of changes.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.910
Another dimension is a highly
restricted or fixated interest

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.800
on something.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.400
So you know, again,
this doesn't have

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.050
to be an unusual something.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.390
It can be Magic the Gathering
or other things that kids--

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.400
that a lot of kids that
age really love to do.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.490
But kids on the
autism spectrum seem

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.160
to focus on that exclusively,
or with a lot more intensity

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.030
or focus than other
kids their age.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.540
But it can also be an
unusual kind of interest.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.590
So I've had kids that
absolutely love refrigerators.

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.290
That's not a very typical
thing, but you know,

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.130
we have had experts on
refrigerators and vacuum

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.340
cleaners and all
sorts of things that

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.970
are unusual in their focus.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.650
The other thing that
just got added officially

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.580
to the diagnostic criteria
is hyper or hyposensitivity

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.040
to sensory input.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.160
So this can be textures
or sounds, or even

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.010
visual kind of interests.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.040
And the way that
this can manifest

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.800
is anything from having only
certain types of clothes

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.700
that a child wants to wear--
I'm seeing some nodding

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.490
and smiling in here--
you know, having

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.210
to cut tags out or only wear
a certain kind of blue jeans,

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.560
that kind of thing.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.320
But it can also be just
being able to hear things--

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.450
it doesn't have to be
startling to loud noises,

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.940
it could actually be
hyper-awareness of sort

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.940
of not very loud noises.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.890
Like right now, there's a little
bit of a high-pitched sound

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.340
going on.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.769
I don't find it disturbing,
but a person with autism

00:07:50.769 --> 00:07:52.560
might have a really
hard time concentrating

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.410
due to this noise.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.694
AUDIENCE: It's a squeaking
fan and the AC [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:55.694 --> 00:07:57.360
ANNETTE ESTES: Squeaking
fan and the AC.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.730
There you go.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.470
So that can be a problem.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.860
So the other way-- I hope
I'm kind of describing

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.610
how autism is a spectrum.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:08.690
But some of the
ways that I think

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.160
it's easiest to
understand this spectrum

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.330
is to understand that some
people, like [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:21.660
already told us, have highly
adapted intellectual abilities.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.510
So, it's true that some
people on the autism spectrum

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.860
are far above average in terms
of intellectual functioning,

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.840
but a lot of people--
but it really

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.890
spans the whole spectrum, and
there are a significant number

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.390
of individuals with autism that
are intellectually disabled,

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.620
that have a very
hard time functioning

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:43.100
due to intellectual impairment.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.990
So that's, again,
one of the myths

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.797
that-- you can understand
why, because there

00:08:47.797 --> 00:08:49.880
are people with autism
that are very, very bright,

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.710
but not everyone has that gift.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.970
Also, some people have
a language impairment,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.100
and some people don't.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.390
So that's another
kind of way that this

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.570
manifests as a spectrum.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.720
One of the most
important things is that,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.590
to be an autism
spectrum disorder,

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:09.720
the difficulties have to
present early on in development.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.930
So this is before age three.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.560
And they also have to cause
clinically significant

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.120
impairment.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.770
So this is an important
point that I'll

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.040
sort of pause on for a
minute, because if you think

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.640
about autism, so difficulties
with social communication,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.140
restricted and repetitive
interests, all of us

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.980
can see some of ourselves
in those type of symptoms,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.420
I guess, or those kind
of characteristics.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.960
So you know, not all of
us are highly social.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.060
Not all of us always feel like
we're understanding what's

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.910
going on in social situations.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.150
Some of us might be more
particular about how

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.340
things are lined up, or maybe
don't like change very much.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.470
But to have an autism
spectrum disorder,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.140
it really has to significantly
impair your life.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.970
It has to be a problem.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.760
Whether it's in
school, if you're

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.230
a school-aged
person, development

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.010
if you're a little guy,
it has to cause problems.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.810
And so that's something
to keep in mind,

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:14.980
because I think all of us can
relate to this on some level.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.370
So, OK.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.550
So, all of this that
we've talked about

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.330
is reflected in the
Diagnostic and Statistical

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.060
Manual of Mental Disorders.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.990
This is the--
essentially, it's a book

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.390
that psychiatrists
and psychologists

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:35.100
use to diagnose people
with all different kinds

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.200
of psychiatric disorders.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.575
You can see up here that
it started with the DSM-I,

00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:45.660
and has gone through
five iterations now.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:51.100
And just to clarify
for some of you who've

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.460
known about these kinds
of disorders for a while,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.860
in the DSM-IV, the
previous iteration,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.660
we had Autistic Disorder,
Asperger's, Childhood

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.020
Disintegrative Disorder, Rett's,
and Pervasive Developmental

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.000
Disorder.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.680
And all of those
are now subsumed

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.800
under this umbrella of the
autism spectrum disorders.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.650
So if anyone had a
diagnosis before that

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.516
had a different
name, now it's just

00:11:15.516 --> 00:11:16.640
called something different.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.460
But it's still part of
the autism spectrum.

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:26.520
So, any questions about what we
just talked about, or comments?

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.310
That was a very
quick Autism 101.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.860
Yeah.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.360
Yes.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.450
What is-- so the question is,
if you have an 18-month-old,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.080
for example, how do-- what
do these kinds of things

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.580
look like?

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.220
I am so glad you asked that,
because my focus of my research

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.080
and a lot of what
we do is focused

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.730
on the youngest ages, when
autism first starts to emerge.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.720
So hopefully by about
the middle of the talk,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.990
you'll know more about the
answer to your question

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.600
than you ever thought you would.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.200
That would-- so we'll
see how that goes.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.210
So, what's important about
an ASD diagnostic evaluation?

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.510
So, why do people want
to get a label like this?

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.370
How does it help?

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.210
So, the first thing is it
can be a key to accessing

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:09.820
appropriate services.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:14.450
Whether it's medical,
psychological, behavioral,

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.360
educational, all of those
things can fall into place

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.490
much more easily if people
know that a person has autism.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.350
Also, parents get information
about the next steps.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.300
So a good diagnostic
evaluation will

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.610
include recommendations
for intervention

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.335
that are individualized
to that person.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.060
It will also help clarify that
person's individual behavioral

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.180
and developmental difficulties,
but also their strengths.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:46.220
I think a lot of times when we
do the testing that's involved,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:50.160
you can really see where
a child's abilities are.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.860
And that kind of
gives you the in you

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.910
need to start--
sort of jumpstart

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.290
some learning processes.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.830
And then, in the
best of all worlds,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.490
parents and caregivers can
get support and education

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:04.210
about autism.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.770
So, a lot of people, after
they get this diagnosis,

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.840
find themselves warmly embraced
by the autism community.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.010
And that would be-- it's
a really important thing

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.457
for a lot of people to have that
support along the way, and also

00:13:18.457 --> 00:13:20.290
information from other
parents, because that

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.140
can be really, really helpful.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.850
So here, I wanted--
what I wanted

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.370
to do next is show you a video.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:33.730
This video is of a girl
who was evaluated--

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:36.440
I think we evaluated her
probably 15 years ago,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.660
so I don't think she would be
recognizable at this point.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.240
But also, they
did-- her family did

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.050
sign a release of
information, so you

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:47.380
know it was OK to show this
for educational purposes.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.640
And I wanted to
show you this video

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.550
because this is the typical
age at which a child gets

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.920
their first official
diagnosis with autism.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.530
And this is a girl who
I also had a chance

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:03.270
to know throughout her childhood
all the way up till when

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.830
she was a teenager.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.960
And I will just tell you that
her last evaluation with me,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.784
she knew more words than I did.

00:14:10.784 --> 00:14:12.950
I had to go look up some
of the words she was using.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.650
So she was a kid who
was highly capable.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.710
And here she is at age four.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.570
And what I'd like you to do
is notice the differences

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.340
in her approach to the
situation than you might

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.850
expect other four-year-olds.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.120
So if you don't know
about four-year-olds,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.610
I'll clue you in.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.820
Not surprisingly, I'm
going to ask you to look

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.420
at her social interaction.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:39.880
So, she's in a room
with two adults.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.580
One of them is her mom.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.720
The other one is an
examiner who knows--

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.840
has just had a really fun time
with her for about an hour.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.520
So a lot of-- so these are
people who she's familiar with,

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.630
and who are fun.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.920
She also-- I also want you to
see how often she initiates

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.900
or responds to
social interaction,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.590
what she does when
she communicates.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.770
What is she talking about.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.310
Is she directing it at people.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:06.940
Is it social.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.880
And also look at what
she's doing with the toys,

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.330
and see if you can see some of
the restricted and repetitive

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.440
kinds of interests
that she shows.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.990
OK.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.140
So I imagine that you
noticed several things

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:27.127
about the social and
communication and repetitive

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:28.960
behavior domain when
you were watching that.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.520
Does anyone want to make
comments or observations

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.473
about what you saw?

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:40.620
So this little girl was not--
she was a pleasant person.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.340
She didn't cause a lot of
problems for the grown-ups

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.880
in her life, which
can sometimes,

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.969
for kids on the autism
spectrum that have not

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:52.010
a lot of challenging
behaviors, that can actually

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.710
delay how long it takes them to
get identified, because you can

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.300
imagine that she's a really
nice girl to be around.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.800
However, part of that was
because she wasn't initiating

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.740
social interaction
like you would expect

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.670
most four-year-olds would
not give you probably

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.760
30 seconds in the room
without them coming up to you

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.120
and showing you things,
bringing you things, asking you

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.340
to be on the floor with them.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.050
She did have communication.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.320
You heard her say numbers.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.620
You heard her-- I guess
that's probably all

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.040
you heard in that little clip.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:28.260
But she didn't direct anything
to other people in the room.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.810
And she also, as you
noticed, lined up blocks.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.190
She actually was putting
them all with the same thing

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.900
on the top, the little letters.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.080
And then she had a ritual that
included some repetitive motor

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.277
mannerisms and a repetitive
kind of verbal sounds

00:16:46.277 --> 00:16:47.110
that she would make.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.920
So those are the kinds
of things that you

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.710
might see that, again-- yeah.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.945
AUDIENCE: This is what makes
it difficult, because--

00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:54.820
ANNETTE ESTES: Right.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.962
So the question,
to sum it up, is

00:16:56.962 --> 00:16:58.420
how do you tell
whether something's

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.920
typical or not typical,
because basically kids are

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.130
quirky people, right?

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.970
I mean, that's kind of
characteristic of childhood.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:10.190
So what makes
somebody have autism.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.819
And a lot of that has to
do with having a real sense

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.450
of typical development.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.000
So you know, knowing
how often you

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.069
would expect a child
with typical development

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.630
to be initiating
social interaction.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.920
Lining things up specifically
isn't such a bad thing.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.880
It's do you do that
without any social--

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.380
without any communication,
and do you kind of maybe

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.455
get distressed if that-- if
you're not able to do that.

00:17:35.455 --> 00:17:37.330
Do you have a variety
of things you're doing.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.430
So these are some
of the questions

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.770
that I think, if people
have these questions

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.665
about their own child or
another grandchild, a neighbor,

00:17:44.665 --> 00:17:47.040
anything like that-- I mean,
neighbors get a little hard,

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.980
but if you have
worries, you know,

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.450
feel free to consult--
there's a really

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:58.610
good website, First Signs, that
has some nice video examples.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.090
But also, I think coming in
for a diagnostic evaluation

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:04.880
or a screening is
a really good idea.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.870
There are some things
online, too, about that.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:10.360
So if anybody has
questions, let me know.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.920
So as [INAUDIBLE]
said, one in 68 kids

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.260
have been-- the most recent
estimates from the CDC

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.150
is one in 68 kids have
autism in the United States.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:23.980
One in 42 boys, and
one in 189 girls.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.080
So not considered an un-- it's
considered a common problem

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:28.990
at this point.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.230
When I first started
giving these talks,

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:33.710
we would say that autism
was a rare disorder.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.300
We don't say that anymore.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:42.900
One of the interesting facts
about this more recent CDC

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.440
study was that the
prevalence rates

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.990
ranged from a low of 175
in Alabama to a high of one

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.640
in 45 in New Jersey.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.870
And people have
wondered about this.

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.920
I think it's interesting.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.130
I can only speculate.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.940
I am not an epidemiologist.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.620
But one thing I
happen to know is

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.270
that there are very,
very few services

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.590
in Alabama for any
developmental disabilities.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.850
And New Jersey, on the
other hand, charges $1--

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.970
or gets $1 of every
speeding ticket

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.552
in the state of New Jersey to
go towards autism research.

00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:17.010
And that's just
the research piece.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:22.700
So they have an amazing kind
of comprehensive identification

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.670
and intervention
program in New Jersey.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.240
So I think that it's not
that people are moving there,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.410
it's that there's
sort of more awareness

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.439
and that there's more
professional kind of-- more

00:19:35.439 --> 00:19:36.980
professionals that
understand autism.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:39.450
And also, people-- there's
more reason to get a diagnosis.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.940
So back to the what do
you-- why would you do this?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:46.150
Well, you would do it if
you had good intervention,

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:48.570
because otherwise
it's probably not

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.192
that helpful to come forward.

00:19:50.192 --> 00:19:50.692
Yeah.

00:19:50.692 --> 00:19:52.525
AUDIENCE: It's always
struck me that there's

00:19:52.525 --> 00:19:54.070
such a gender divide with this.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.205
Is there any explanation or
musings about why this is?

00:19:57.205 --> 00:19:58.580
ANNETTE ESTES:
There are musings.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.005
So the question is about
why more boys than girls.

00:20:01.005 --> 00:20:04.240
It's about three to
one boys to girls.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.550
This is common among a lot
of the childhood disorders.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.020
So, ADHD has a similar
kind of prevalence.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:18.380
And there's a lot of people
that are interested in this.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.280
Actually, I'm going back to--
I have a couple studies that

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.080
are funded by the NIH Autism
Center of Excellence Studies.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.770
And one of the
[INAUDIBLE] not mine,

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.530
but another one of the
[INAUDIBLE] that was funded

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.610
is specifically to better
understand that question.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:37.200
So there's a lot of speculation,
but one of the things

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:43.500
is that girls seem to have
some sort of protective factors

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.200
early on.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.250
So whether it's something
about girls' brains

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.560
are more resilient than
boys' brains, it seems like,

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.050
and we're trying to understand
more about what that is.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.250
Of course, that kind
of switches in puberty,

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.780
where girls start to have
higher rates of anxiety

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.520
and depression.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.750
So there's a lot to
understand and unpack there.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.110
But probably-- my
best bet would be

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.370
to look into the biology and the
underlying kind of differences

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.340
in the brain.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.770
So the question is
why do kids get autism

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:14.520
and how are they more at risk.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.890
I will get to that.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.550
That is good.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:18.050
OK.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.520
But quickly, a
couple more facts,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.800
and then we'll get there.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.570
So co-occurring
medical conditions,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.080
these can include
GI difficulties.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.060
So a lot of kids having
problems with eating

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.510
and distress due
to gut problems.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.890
Sleep problems and sleep
disorders are really common.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.029
It's a very difficult
thing for the whole family,

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:42.820
I think, oftentimes
for people with autism.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.210
And then seizure disorder.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.840
So about-- well,
it's interesting,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.310
because there are some
kids that get seizures

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.180
early on, like under age
two, that end up with autism.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.250
But most people with autism
that go on to have seizures

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.570
are teenagers when they
are first recognized.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:07.130
And so this is something that
is important to look out for,

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:11.635
if kids start to have sort
of staring spells or changes

00:22:11.635 --> 00:22:12.510
in their functioning.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.836
That's one thing that
people need to look out for.

00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:16.960
AUDIENCE: And what do you
mean by gastrointestinal?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.300
Do you mean like things like
diarrhea or constipation?

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.460
ANNETTE ESTES: It can be
diarrhea, constipation.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.710
There's-- some people think
that there's a higher rate

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:30.810
of Celiac, so difficulty
with gluten, in autism.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.120
It's unclear whether
that's truly higher,

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.750
or if it's just that it's
harder to recognize it.

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:42.520
But certainly, there
seems to be more reflux.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.630
Just all sorts of things
surrounding the gut.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.430
Interestingly, the
gut and the brain

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.820
are highly connected
early in development.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.380
Those cells are actually
the same cells early

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.670
on in fetal development.

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.730
And so there may be
something around that.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:04.560
Then over time, and during
school age and into adulthood,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.920
there can be a co-occurring
psychiatric and developmental

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.540
disorders in addition
to the autism.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.690
And this is something that,
again, this new DSM was good,

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.240
because it helped us
be able to-- there

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.090
was, like, rule-outs that you
couldn't have autism and ADHD.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.506
Well, that was not
really reflecting,

00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:24.380
I think, the natural
history of the disorder,

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.850
which is that, yes, you can
have attention problems.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.370
Anxiety becomes quite pronounced
in a lot of individuals

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:34.340
with autism as they
get older, like

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.400
teenage and early adulthood.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.260
Learning disorders.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.051
So even when somebody--
a learning disorder

00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:41.180
is when you have
typical development,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.450
or typical intellectual
ability, but you

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.240
have a specifically hard
time with a certain area,

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.360
like, say, reading
or math or spelling.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.510
Something like that.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.320
So that can happen at a higher
rate in people with autism.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.480
Actually, we had a study,
including a lot of people

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.700
here in Seattle, that
showed 90% of our kids that

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:07.840
had an IQ of 70 or above had
either an extremely unusually

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.230
high ability in a
certain academic area,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.910
more than you'd expect by the
IQ, or a really low ability,

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.230
much lower than you would
expect based on their IQ.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.960
So this poses a lot of
challenges in school.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.690
Intellectual disability is much
higher in people with autism,

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.890
as well as speech and
language problems.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:29.880
OK.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.580
So, causes.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.630
Here's your slide.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.902
We have-- this is a
really-- I'm going

00:24:35.902 --> 00:24:37.610
to give you the
complicated answer first,

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.830
because it is complicated.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:41.860
So you know, there's-- we'll
just have to deal with that

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.600
in autism, I think.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.410
The causes are
probably an interaction

00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.750
between-- over the course
of early development,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:55.030
between some pretty
complex factors.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.200
So each one of these
factors in and of themselves

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.330
is not simple.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.020
But the first thing we
know is that there's

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.340
a genetic basis to autism.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.280
We know this from twin
studies and family studies,

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:14.220
and now we know it because
of the increasingly good

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.970
technology that allows us to
be able to really pinpoint

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:21.110
very small changes
in the genome that

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.310
are related to autism risk.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:26.250
We know that their
brain structure

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.290
can be different in
people with autism.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.330
And I'll tell you a
little more about that.

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:33.780
We know this through
neural imaging studies.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.170
We also know that
brain function,

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.760
through functional
neural imaging studies,

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.468
can be different.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:45.330
And we also think that there's
some prenatal factors that

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:47.650
might go into increasing autism.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.770
And how I think about
the prenatal factors

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.110
are it's sort of anything that's
bad for the brain probably

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.650
increases autism risk.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.190
So for example, there
were early studies

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.730
with thalidomide, which was
a substance that parents--

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.940
or moms took when they
were pregnant to help them

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.660
with nausea.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.470
And it turned out that it
was very bad for babies,

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:15.000
and it also increased
autism rates.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.670
So babies that were
exposed to thalidomide

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.230
had higher rates of autism.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:25.220
We know this through some
studies of viral infections,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.970
and people are now looking
at all sorts of factors,

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:33.260
everything from air
pollution to other kind

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.810
of toxins in the environment.

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.320
These things-- so again,
anything bad for the brain

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.070
probably increases autism
risk, in conjunction

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:47.250
with the genetic factors that
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:53.920
So once you kind of have a baby
with these sort of early signs,

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.680
these early behavioral
deficits probably

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.170
cause a cascade of
developmental problems.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.270
So if you're not
paying attention

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:07.150
to the speech of your--
of people around you,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.650
then you're not going to be
learning to talk as well,

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:10.150
right?

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.122
And if you're not
sort of more orienting

00:27:12.122 --> 00:27:13.580
to social interaction,
you're going

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.690
to miss out on a lot of
learning opportunities,

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.720
because that's how babies learn.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.730
So these things kind of set up
a developmental cascade that

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:25.900
can end up resulting in autism.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.540
So that's the answer.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.540
It's very complicated.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:32.940
One of the things I
really want to focus on,

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.430
though, is the autism genetics.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.030
So at this point, we understand
that the primary cause

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:39.710
of autism is genetic.

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:43.070
However, when you take
one step further into what

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.500
does that mean, you're back into
a very complicated situation,

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:52.080
because some of the genetic
factors are inherited,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.420
some are not inherited.

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.930
They're de novo mutations.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:28:00.139
The de novo mutations tend to
be-- they can be very rare.

00:28:00.139 --> 00:28:01.680
They don't occur in
very many people.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.800
But when they do, they're
very powerful risk factors.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.490
So these have begun to be
identified more and more

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.480
in the population.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.160
So it doesn't affect that
many people, but when it does,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.760
it's a really important
set of information

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.630
that you can get from that.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.510
Most people with autism,
it's more complicated.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.630
There's-- we used to think
that there was going to be five

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.620
to 10 genes that we
would recognize--

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.150
we would be able to find
that accounted for autism.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:30.650
Now we're up to, like,
300, people are thinking.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.680
So these are mostly
common genetic variations

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.060
that, together,
have small effects,

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:42.220
and they kind of interact
with one another.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.096
And in different
people, and along

00:28:45.096 --> 00:28:47.470
with other later occurring
factors, might lead to autism.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:55.240
So any individual may not have
an identifiable genetic cause

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.070
for their autism, but probably
about 10% to 20% of people with

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.950
autism, they're-- at this point,
there could be a genetic kind

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.720
of answer to why
they got autism.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.860
So at this point, we would
love to see everybody

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.800
that has an autism diagnosis
get a genetic testing done, just

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.530
to see if they are
among those people

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:18.140
with those small rare
mutations that might also

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.560
have some medical follow-up
associated with them.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.930
But again, that's not going
to pay off for everybody.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.450
But it's certainly worth
it for those people who do

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:32.600
have those kind of factors.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.660
Oh, I see a hand.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.440
Yes.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.360
Most of the rarer and the
more powerful mutations

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.500
are not inherited.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.230
They're de novo.

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:48.090
They just arise in the course
of early, early genetic-- well,

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:50.850
when the fetus is being
formed, basically.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:53.960
And so for the
most part, there's

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.570
some-- there's
some families where

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.980
there are inherited factors.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.760
Most of the time, though,
those are those common variants

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.600
that I was talking
about that, if you

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.219
have five or six of them,
you don't have autism.

00:30:06.219 --> 00:30:08.760
Or if you have-- I don't know
the number, because we're still

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.350
sort of doing that
research, but let's say

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.850
that if, in one individual,
there were 10 genes that

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:16.870
caused their autism,
you might have

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.750
to have nine out of those
10 to increase your risk.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:27.260
So these are oftentimes
kind of subtle factors

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.360
that we're talking about with
the inherited forms of autism.

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.880
Now, that's not
the case for some.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.130
So I guess-- just as
you say one thing,

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.040
there's exceptions like
fragile X syndrome,

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.750
for example, which,
in fragile X,

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.140
you can see pre-mutation
carriers that

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:47.250
don't have fragile X, and
then, in one generation,

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:48.520
it will show up.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:55.006
And this can be, you know-- so
in that case, it is inherited.

00:30:55.006 --> 00:30:57.140
But usually the
parents don't have

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.630
symptoms that are recognizable.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.130
So it's-- yes.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:03.630
Yeah.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is there any correlation

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.229
between siblings'
chances [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:10.270
ANNETTE ESTES: There are.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:16.390
So in the 1990s, Tony Bailey
and some others in the UK

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:18.500
did some of the
first twin studies.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.970
So they studied monozygotic
twins, or identical twins,

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:27.200
and the dizygotic twins,
or fraternal twins.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.380
So the monozygotic twins
share approximately about 100%

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.290
of their genes, dizygotic
twins about 50%.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:36.490
And then they've studied sort
of like cousins and further out

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.430
relatives.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:39.620
And what they found
was exactly what

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.970
you would expect for a
highly genetic disorder.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.370
So the monozygotic twins had
about a 90% concurrence rate.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.350
And when you got
to dizygotic twins,

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.264
it was about-- I'm guess--
I forget the-- I'm trying

00:31:51.264 --> 00:31:52.180
to remember the study.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.138
It was a long time ago.

00:31:53.138 --> 00:31:54.560
But it went way down.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:59.160
And then the further out you
went, the less concordance

00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.660
you had.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.510
So the less chance of
having both siblings.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.410
You notice it wasn't
100%, which is

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:09.150
why we are also interested
in environmental factors.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.870
And we also understand now
that genetics is not so simple,

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:13.370
either.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.210
With something
called methylation,

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.530
you can change gene expression
due to environmental input.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.630
Anyway, it gets-- it really
is a fascinating area.

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.200
But it's not my
area, and I realize--

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.640
I spent about 10
years of my life

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.680
doing what they would
call phenotyping, so

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.372
doing the diagnostic
assessments for families that

00:32:35.372 --> 00:32:37.330
were participating in
our genetic studies, some

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.900
of the first studies where
there were two or more kids

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.720
with autism in the families.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.250
And I started to
realize that I was never

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:49.740
going to be a
molecular geneticist,

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.770
and so I would probably do
better as a psychologist,

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.270
thinking more about the brain.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.550
And became really fascinated
by some of the early studies

00:32:57.550 --> 00:33:00.290
that our group and
others published,

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.770
because what it appeared
was that the genes

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.190
that we were finding all
express themselves in the brain.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:11.530
This is not surprising now, but
it was pretty neat at the time.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.890
And so not only are these
genes expressed in the brain,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:18.030
but they're also typically
expressed early in development.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.550
And they're a lot
of times related

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.046
to neuronal development,
or the cells-- neurons

00:33:22.046 --> 00:33:23.170
are the cells in the brain.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.060
So it's how those
cells proliferate,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.800
how they connect to one
another, and that kind of thing

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:33.690
that seems to be related to the
genes that we're identifying.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.110
So, this was in 2002.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:42.790
Our group began doing a
large-scale study that

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:48.420
included multiple views on
people with autism, including

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.220
doing brain imaging studies.

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.280
And these were, at the
time, the earliest--

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.270
we were told, actually, some
of the reviews that came back

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:58.860
for this grant was, well,
you can't identify autism

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.794
as early as three
to four years old.

00:34:00.794 --> 00:34:02.460
So how are you going
to find these kids?

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.860
But we did.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:10.090
And what we found was that the
kids with autism had about 10%

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.239
enlargement in their
brain as opposed

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.070
to typically developing kids.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.320
And then the kids in the
developmentally delayed group

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.989
without autism actually
had smaller brain size.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:24.080
So this led us-- and other
groups replicated this,

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.810
it became one of the most
replicated findings in autism

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.840
in terms of a biomarker,
one of the first.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.330
So, related to this-- oh, yes?

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.919
So the question is whether
developmental delay and autism

00:34:38.919 --> 00:34:39.710
are the same thing.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.650
They're actually not.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.790
You can have autism and not be
delayed in your development,

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.570
although I guess only
on certain measures,

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.330
because of course by definition
you are socially delayed if you

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:49.969
have autism.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:58.157
But there's a number
of ways that you

00:34:58.157 --> 00:35:00.240
can have developmental
delays that are not autism.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.739
I mean, I don't know how-- it's
kind of a complicated thing,

00:35:02.739 --> 00:35:06.635
but that's why our
psychologists stay in business.

00:35:06.635 --> 00:35:10.030
AUDIENCE: From that graph,
it looks like [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.762
will never co-exist.

00:35:11.762 --> 00:35:12.320
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.170
ANNETTE ESTES: You can
define it so that they don't.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.765
In this case, it
was developmental--

00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:16.265
AUDIENCE: Because you
either have a smaller

00:35:16.265 --> 00:35:17.960
brain or a bigger brain.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.960
ANNETTE ESTES: Well,
it's-- you know, this was--

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.100
our DD group was 15 kids.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:25.590
So you know, I wouldn't
take too much from that.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:29.810
The developmental delay group
had multiple different reasons

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.090
for being delayed.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.980
And it so happened in
our group that they

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:37.510
had smaller brain size overall.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:39.900
You can definitely have autism
and developmental delay.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.520
But in the way we defined it,
it was developmental delay

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.539
without autism.

00:35:44.539 --> 00:35:45.080
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.110
ANNETTE ESTES: Yeah.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:46.740
So, OK.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.310
So back to-- so we're finally
getting to your question

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:51.340
about when you can
diagnose autism.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:56.520
So just a quick
poll-- I don't know

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.974
how to do this without making
everybody cheat and look

00:35:59.974 --> 00:36:00.890
around, but that's OK.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.050
What do you think the earliest
age is to diagnose autism?

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.670
So how many-- raise your
hand if you think four.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.374
I already sort of
said we could do that,

00:36:09.374 --> 00:36:10.540
so I guess I gave that away.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:11.170
Three?

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:12.265
OK, I said that, too.

00:36:12.265 --> 00:36:14.420
Two?

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.780
Under one?

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.280
OK.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.880
So we have two and under one.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.850
More people in the two.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.350
Well, I am going to tell
you what I think about this.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:28.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.430
ANNETTE ESTES: I'm trying to
make it easier for you guys.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:33.130
So yes, there's no
between one and two.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.690
I'll have to change that.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.210
So, let me tell you about
some of the earliest

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.680
signs of autism.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.380
So between 12-- between one and
two, what you start to see--

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.740
and this is based
on research that's

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.410
both retrospective
research, where

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.769
parents talk to us about
what their children were

00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:55.060
like when they were growing up.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:59.690
It's also based
on a new approach

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.500
that I'll tell you more
about of looking at infants

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.220
who have older siblings
with autism who

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:06.490
are known to be at higher
risk for developing autism.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.330
So there's also
prospective studies

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.430
that look at development
in these younger ages.

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.390
And what we find is-- you'll
see the word less here

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:16.440
in the social domain.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:20.810
So less orienting, less
looking at-- to people

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:24.050
when there's social
kind of things going on.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:26.940
Less initiating, less
sustaining of engagement,

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.420
less coordinating,
fewer gestures.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.320
Some kids have delayed
language milestones,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.220
but there's not a lot of
language going on at this age,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.720
right?

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.510
So the bar is fairly
low here for everybody.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.530
And repetitive
behavior was thought

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.760
to not occur at this age,
but our group recently

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.620
did a study that
looked prospectively

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.070
at these infants
with older sibs,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.010
and found that there
really were more

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.610
subtle forms of repetitive
behavior going on at this age.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.632
Not so much the motor
movements or winding things up,

00:37:57.632 --> 00:37:59.340
because again, these
kids are very young,

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:03.177
but would tend to focus more
on objects, sort of palm them

00:38:03.177 --> 00:38:05.260
in their hands back and
forth, that kind of thing,

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.884
for a lot longer than
you would expect.

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:11.410
So this was the beginning
of repetitive behavior.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.367
And just to let-- for those
of you that say how can you

00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:15.200
tell the difference?

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.950
I'm going to show you a little
video of typically developing

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:24.730
babies so that you can
kind of get a sense of just

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.840
how social little guys can be.

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.350
OK.

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:30.850
Whoops.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.270
That goes on for a while.

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:33.850
OK.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.600
And so you can see that, even
before kids learn to talk,

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.880
they're doing all
sorts of communication.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.810
They're sharing enjoyment.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:43.650
They're imitating each other.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:46.550
There's a back and forth
to their interactions.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.860
And so if you're kind of
grounded in typical development

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.760
and you interact with
a little one who's

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:56.160
not showing some of those
early emerging skills,

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:01.680
you can actually detect
differences in some people

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:03.620
earlier even than a year.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.847
And right now, we're
involved with a four-site--

00:39:05.847 --> 00:39:08.180
it's actually larger than
four-site-- four clinical site

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.790
study, University of
Washington, Washington

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.830
University, Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia,

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.440
and University of
North Carolina.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.930
And what we're doing is
studying these infants

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.720
with older siblings with autism.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.280
And we're doing brain
imaging, as well as

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.540
behavioral assessment.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.550
The reason we're focusing
on these infant sibs

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:29.790
is that recurrence
rate is about 20%.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.240
So if you have a baby and
you have an older sibling

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.220
with autism, there's
about a 20% chance

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:36.750
that that baby's going
to have autism, too.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.850
In addition to that,
there's a 30% chance,

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.820
if you don't have autism, that
you might have other learning

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.680
problems, whether it's
speech and language

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.850
or specific learning
disabilities.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.230
So the idea here is
to assess and monitor

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.480
infants who are at
risk for autism,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.740
and understand what's going on
before their symptoms emerge.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.830
So we're getting-- yeah.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:02.380
Sorry.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.290
Quick question.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.123
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for that number.

00:40:05.123 --> 00:40:06.430
What is that 20%?

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:11.860
Does that mean for autistic
child and there's a 20% chance

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.732
that his sibling will
also have autism?

00:40:13.732 --> 00:40:15.690
ANNETTE ESTES: The baby
will have autism, yeah.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.070
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.100
That's really high rate.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.050
ANNETTE ESTES: It is
a really high rate.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.380
AUDIENCE: Comparing to one in--

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.035
ANNETTE ESTES: One in 68.

00:40:20.035 --> 00:40:20.880
AUDIENCE: 40-- 60, yeah.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.160
ANNETTE ESTES: Yeah.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.020
Exactly.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.630
So, that's right.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:25.600
So this is a group
that, I would say,

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:28.810
needs assessment and
monitoring, but also we

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:29.750
can learn a lot from.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:33.210
So we're getting babies in at
three to six months of age,

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.540
and then assessing
them at 12 and 24,

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.830
and then again at 36
months with brain imaging

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:41.100
and behavioral assessment.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:43.800
The brain imaging is
done, by the way, asleep,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.790
so no sedation.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.350
So late-night studies,
very dedicated families.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.140
And what we found in
our initial study was,

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.110
at six months of age,
you could already

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:58.670
tell-- see some differences.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.740
These are assessments that
were done by evaluators looking

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.755
at gross motor at six months.

00:41:06.755 --> 00:41:07.380
Let's see here.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.330
So we have six months,
12 months, and 24 months.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:17.702
And the red line are kids that
went on to develop autism.

00:41:17.702 --> 00:41:20.030
The brownish line
is kids that went on

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:22.602
to develop a milder
form of autism.

00:41:22.602 --> 00:41:24.810
So they had-- they were
still on the autism spectrum,

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:26.560
but their symptoms were milder.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.510
These are high-- and
these are both high risk.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:32.030
Here's the high risk infants
that did not develop autism.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.300
And then the blue line
is the low risk infants

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.360
who had older siblings that
were typically developing.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.310
And already at six months,
you can see some differences

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.960
in the groups.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.540
And those groups' differences
increase over time.

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:47.270
This is parent report of
how the kids were doing

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:48.540
at home and in the community.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.080
And you see the exact
same type of pattern.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.090
With children that go on
to develop autism at six

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.770
months were already lower
in their adaptive behavior

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.402
than high risk infants
that had mild symptoms.

00:42:00.402 --> 00:42:03.120
And then-- or milder symptoms.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.005
High risk that went on to not
have autism, and then low risk

00:42:06.005 --> 00:42:09.340
that had no autism.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.740
So development in infants
at high risk for autism

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.540
in the first year
of life, this is

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:20.480
something that differs starting
as early as six months.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.600
These differences
are mild and subtle.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:25.550
They're not the kinds of things
that you would necessarily

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:29.840
walk into a clinic and
be able to pick out.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.585
But these symptoms unfold
and develop over time,

00:42:32.585 --> 00:42:35.270
and there's a convergence
between both parents

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:37.180
and clinicians.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:39.380
So here's the real
answer to your question.

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.690
So it's a bell-shaped curve
when kids actually have

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:46.830
the full syndrome of autism.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:52.145
There are very rare cases--
rarely before eight months,

00:42:52.145 --> 00:42:55.660
but between 8 and 12
months, you actually do

00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:59.050
have a very few rare number
of babies that will show

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:02.310
the full syndrome of autism.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.130
These symptoms kind of
coalesce and emerge,

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:08.559
and by 24 months of
age, most children

00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:10.100
who are going to go
on to have autism

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:14.660
will be able to be identified
if they're seen by a specialist.

00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.540
And then some kids,
though, don't really

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.800
show their full
signs until later.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.040
I would say only very
rarely do symptoms

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.575
occur after age three
for the-- you know,

00:43:26.575 --> 00:43:28.410
really the first time.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:32.300
And yet, you might notice that
the median age of diagnosis

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.610
in the United States
is five years of age.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:42.510
So this is our challenge, that
we can reliably diagnose autism

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:43.560
by 24 months of age.

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.160
Sometimes, before 12.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.630
And yet, the average age is
four to six years when people

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:52.510
are actually getting diagnosed.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.330
So there's this gap.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:56.930
And the gap is even
more painful when

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.290
you look at that second
piece of information

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.170
there, that usually between
the first time a parent brings

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.290
in a child for an
evaluation, there's

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.400
another year before
they actually

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.380
get the answer from
the professionals

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.590
that they are seeking.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.520
So it's something
that parents have

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.220
called a diagnostic odyssey,
going from person to person,

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.720
doctor to doctor to try to
understand what's going on

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.360
with their child's development.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.690
Yeah.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.180
AUDIENCE: So on our journey--
I could add some color

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:28.190
to this-- on our
journey, we started

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.470
to realize that our son was
autistic when he was two.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.560
We did a couple of visits to see
if we could get confirmation,

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.696
and when we called for the
evaluation, it was May.

00:44:41.696 --> 00:44:45.640
And the next available
appointment for an evaluation

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.276
was February, 10 months later.

00:44:47.276 --> 00:44:48.150
ANNETTE ESTES: Right.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:50.930
AUDIENCE: And so once
we got to the point

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.525
that we realized that we needed
an evaluation, the soonest we

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:55.590
could get one was
10 months later.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.155
So that's part of what
adds to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:58.155 --> 00:44:59.030
ANNETTE ESTES: Right.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:01.620
It's really a huge challenge.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.840
And one of the things that
we're going to try to do

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.140
is use some of the
early brain findings

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.240
that our group and others, I
guess, but it's really mostly

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.010
our infant brain imaging
study have come up with.

00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:19.730
And this is differences that are
present before the symptoms are

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:20.990
really clear.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:24.050
And you can see these are
DTI images, diffusion tensor

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.580
imaging.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:28.800
And they show-- the areas
that are kind of in brighter,

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.460
hotter colors are
areas where there

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.940
was higher-- something
called fractional anisotropy

00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:36.315
in the children that went
on to develop autism,

00:45:36.315 --> 00:45:38.440
as compared to the kids
that didn't develop autism.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:40.660
So the connections
between the parts

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.850
of the brain in infants
that go on to develop autism

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:46.790
are already different
at this early age.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:49.110
And there's a couple
other findings

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.100
that we're working on
publishing right now.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:58.375
And what we hope to be able to
do is, for parents who-- you

00:45:58.375 --> 00:46:00.250
know, that eventually
what we'd be able to do

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:03.220
is get something a little
cheaper than an MRI

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.370
to be able to
identify differences.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:07.730
But once we know kind of
what those differences are,

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.070
then we can maybe
work on figuring out

00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:14.180
who's at the highest
risk so that we can maybe

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.120
develop preventive
interventions,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:20.276
or at least know who to really
do some close assessment

00:46:20.276 --> 00:46:21.900
and monitoring with
so that there's not

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.910
a 10-month wait for people
who are at the highest risk.

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:29.840
So this is maybe obvious,
but what we aim to do

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.900
is start intervention
as soon as possible

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.880
after autism symptoms
emerge, because this

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.800
leads to the best outcomes.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.180
We would like to provide
intervention and support

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.320
across the lifespan.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.670
Usually, people with autism need
supports at all different steps

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.950
along the way.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.350
Even the people who respond
the best to early intervention

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:52.240
still can face challenges at
all the different developmental

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.300
points along the way.

00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:59.880
And one thing that we
know from our work at UW

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.480
is that early intervention
does improve outcomes.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.960
We did the very first
randomized clinical trial

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.110
of early intervention,
and recently just did

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:10.130
a follow-up of that.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.680
But that first finding was
that we could improve IQ

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.190
actually average of 17 points.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:19.300
Some of the kids
gained 30 points of IQ

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.800
during the early intervention.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.760
Improved communication,
reduced diagnostic severity.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.250
This evidence was
really important.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.800
It might seem obvious to
people who've gone through it

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.430
that their kids get
better, but having evidence

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:33.540
means that insurance
companies will pay.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:39.450
So it was work that I think has
yielded really important gains

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:40.410
that way.

00:47:40.410 --> 00:47:44.410
We also just published the
first-ever follow-up study

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:46.460
that showed that these
gains were maintained two

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.710
years after early intervention.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.520
This paper was named as one
of the most influential papers

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:53.460
last year by NIH.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.150
And again, it seems
like a sort of no duh

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:59.860
when you look back on it, but
nobody had done this before.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:01.932
So one of the
interesting things is

00:48:01.932 --> 00:48:04.140
it looked like there was--
I know there's people here

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.570
that like data, so
one of the things

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.990
I will show you is this is--
you can't see this very well,

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.470
but here's the early-- this
is our intervention group.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.300
The red is the control group.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:17.570
And here, we have
18 months of age.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.640
A year later, about
four years of age.

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.710
And then this is
six years of age.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:24.180
And what happened is
the kids didn't really

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:28.900
differ in their autism severity
during the early intervention.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.220
But two years later, they did.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.580
So what we think-- and but what
they did differ on right away

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.310
was their IQ levels.

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:37.890
So what seemed to
have happened was

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.740
kids maybe gained
the ability to learn

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.160
from a typical environment.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.780
They were able to be in typical
classrooms, to-- you know,

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.260
we don't really know
what happened exactly,

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.080
but they had a lot
less intervention

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.430
during those two years after
our study than the kids

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.120
in the control group.

00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:57.930
And their autism symptom
severity went down a lot

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.766
during that time.

00:48:58.766 --> 00:48:59.557
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:48:59.557 --> 00:49:01.540
How early is early intervention?

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.620
ANNETTE ESTES: Well,
these kids entered

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:08.220
the study between 18
and 30 months of age.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.062
And, yeah.

00:49:09.062 --> 00:49:10.520
So, one of the
things I want to say

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.380
is being in the
Pacific Northwest is

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:16.020
a really-- something I
don't take for granted.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.140
We have-- we could never
do all this research

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.940
without a supportive community
and supportive families that

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.860
are amazing that they would
do things like stay up

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.280
half the night with their
babies to get a brain imaging

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.200
study done, or bear with us
for-- I guess they give two

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.476
years of a longitudinal study.

00:49:34.476 --> 00:49:35.850
There was a lot
of questionnaires

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.250
and a lot of assessments.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:43.000
And it's pretty neat
to be in this region.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.850
One of the other
things that was--

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.570
that's been a true
pleasure for me

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:50.360
is becoming the director
of the Autism Center.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.110
So not only do I
do research now,

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:56.100
but I get to have a clinic
where we can develop clinical

00:49:56.100 --> 00:50:00.000
services, hopefully that
use what we've been learning

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.424
in research for all these
years and start to make it--

00:50:04.424 --> 00:50:06.340
these state-of-the-art
evidence-based clinical

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:09.870
services available that we can
do research that's relevant,

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:13.160
because we're kind of in the
trenches with people and facing

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.440
some of the same problems
that the families are facing.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.460
And we also know
that we are not alone

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.430
going to be able to
meet the needs that

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:27.170
exist in our community, so we do
a lot of professional training

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.350
to increase community
knowledge and skills,

00:50:29.350 --> 00:50:31.330
because that's how I
kind of sleep at night.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:35.736
You know, I know we can't help
everybody one person at a time.

00:50:35.736 --> 00:50:36.370
And, let's see.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:38.080
We have just a few minutes.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.370
I won't talk too much about
our clinical services,

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:44.000
just to say that we do have
an infant clinic now based

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.010
on what we learned
from our families

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:47.630
in the infant brain
imaging study.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:50.322
People really valued
having that assessment

00:50:50.322 --> 00:50:51.530
and monitoring along the way.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:54.780
We have ABA services,
social skills groups.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:00.110
We want to start
this process of being

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.830
able to be on the playground
and using a program called

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.960
Remaking Recess for
kids to be socially

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.850
included during recess.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:09.080
We have a summer camp.

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:10.250
So we're working on it.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:13.870
And I'm going to skip
through all these specifics.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:14.940
We also do training.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:17.160
I want to invite you all
to-- invite your teachers,

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.410
and if you are teachers, come.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:21.760
We have a free two-day
workshop for educators,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:22.710
two different times.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:25.350
One is on transition
to adulthood in autism,

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:27.660
and another one is for
elementary school-aged kids.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:28.840
And we have flyers up there.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.004
So get your teachers to come.

00:51:31.004 --> 00:51:31.920
It's going to be good.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.040
And it's free,
because we're being

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:37.040
supported by a community group
called the St. Johns Masonic

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.562
Lodge.

00:51:37.562 --> 00:51:39.770
So they raise money for us
to be able to provide this

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:40.330
to teachers.

00:51:40.330 --> 00:51:42.680
We had 700 teachers last year.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.960
And this year, we're hoping
for 1,400 over two days.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.570
Or two different times.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:53.600
So, community support
is where it's at for us.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.680
We just wanted to put in a
plug if you have ideas, energy,

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.310
entrepreneurial thoughts,
financial support, mentorship,

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:02.080
or networking, we're
all about that.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:05.710
So come and talk
with me afterwards.

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:10.050
Or Jim Boyle, who's here from
the University of Washington.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:13.620
He can also tell you more
about how to partner.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.170
And then, stay
connected with us.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:16.750
This is our website,
our newsletter,

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:21.330
and our first-ever gala
dinner is in September.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.140
So, that's it.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.250
I think we are just on time.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.037
So, feel free to stay afterwards
if you want to talk more,

00:52:29.037 --> 00:52:30.370
if you have any other questions.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:31.270
Thanks.

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:34.920
[APPLAUSE]
