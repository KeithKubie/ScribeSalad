00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.670
Some movies are so iconic that it’s hard
to imagine what cinema would be like if they

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.670
never existed.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.740
The legacies left in their wake can be seen
across genres, and form the basis of more

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.230
stories than we realize.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.350
It is thanks to the persistence and hard work
of these pioneering crews that some of our

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.039
favorite movies were ever finished.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.079
These are 10 Famous Movies That Almost Didn’t
Get Made (For Shocking Reasons).

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.969
Star Wars
When George Lucas set out to tell the story

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.769
of a galaxy far, far away, it seems the whole
universe united against him.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.850
The director had an impossible time finding
a studio to fund 1977’s Star Wars.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.389
And when he did, they didn’t exactly give
him enough money.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.480
The actors weren’t into it either, and thought
the movie was going to be for kids.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.600
Plus, huge storms on set in Tunisia not only
wrecked a ton of the equipment, it also delayed

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600
production.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.980
Somehow though, Lucas got it done.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.399
It’s one of the most beloved franchises
of all time, and he’s got the legion of

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.070
fans to prove it.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.560
Jaws
Known as one of the most frightening movies

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.630
of all time, Steven Spielberg’s Jaws has
been terrifying audiences since it was released

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.659
in 1975.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.890
The story of a man-eating Great White shark
stalking the beaches of Amity Island is a

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.439
hard one to forget, especially when swimming
alone.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.119
But for the crew members, the production is
memorable for it’s off-screen scares.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.939
The three animatronic sharks built for the
shoot often sank, had to be repainted daily,

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.990
and had to be rebuilt every week because of
the saltwater.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
Plus, thanks to a stipulation in the contract,
Martha’s Vineyard agreed to let the crew

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.020
film there, but the set decorators had to
put up and tear down the props every day.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.479
Mad Max: Fury Road
What started out as a drawing snowballed into

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.520
a two hour, high octane offering from director
George Miller.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.630
Sidelined due to flooding, skyrocketing insurance
rates, and shipping delays in the post-911

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.010
climate, Mad Max: Fury Road was ten years
in the making.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.099
Never one to sit idle for too long, Miller
used his time to consult with experts and

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.360
develop his vision.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.180
The delays in production turned out to be
kind of a blessing.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.290
The film’s every element is accounted for,
and designed to a T. Plus, the stunt team

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.120
had the opportunity to practice their moves
so much, that they were able to execute them

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.430
without CGI.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.300
Blade Runner
Some of the most amazing worlds presented

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.660
on screen were first conceived in books.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.310
And any director who takes on the challenge
of merging their vision with the existing

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.159
work of an author has their work cut out for
them.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.590
1982’s Blade Runner was based on the book
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.590
K. Dick.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.390
And when he saw what the studio wanted to
do with it, he was unimpressed.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.430
Apparently he wasn’t the only one.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.659
The film’s director Ridley Scott needed
some convincing too, and had already refused

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.040
the job once.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.079
It even had it’s budget pulled, but somehow
the movie managed to get made.

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.329
Apocalypse Now
According to Murphy’s law anything that

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.519
can go wrong, will go wrong.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.340
And if you ever doubted that sentiment, just
take a look at the filming of 1979’s Apocalypse

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.890
Now.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.000
Marlon Brando, a principal cast member, returned
from a hiatus in filming looking unrecognizable

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.410
and didn’t know any of his lines.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.599
Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.819
And everyone on the crew was constantly getting
sick.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.719
Even if you remove the physical ailments,
the production was still subject to the very

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:54.000
real risks of shooting in nature.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.659
The sets were annihilated by a typhoon.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.120
The native wildlife posed a constant threat.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.439
And the filming went way over schedule.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.439
The Wizard of Oz
In every conversation about Hollywood classics,

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.400
film buffs always pay homage to 1939’s The
Wizard of Oz, with some even speculating that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.490
it’s the most watched movie in history.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.670
Good thing, too, since the cast went through
hell to get it made.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.240
The adorable little Toto was hard to keep
on cue, and had to be replaced after an injury.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.580
Two of the actors even had to be hospitalized
because of their costumes.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.980
The original actor signed on to play the Tin
Man almost died when the aluminum dust in

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.470
his makeup coated his lungs and caused an
allergic reaction.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.060
And Margaret Hamilton, a.k.a The Wicked Witch
of the West, was burned by the copper in her

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.120
face paint after getting trapped on a fiery
set piece.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.420
World War Z
Lately there’s been a lot of talk about

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.780
studios meddling with movies after shooting
has already wrapped, with Fantastic Four and

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.760
Suicide Squad leading the conversation.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.850
But a few years earlier, a different property
was at the forefront: World War Z.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.070
Although its technically an adaptation of
the Max Brooks novel, the similarities begin

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.120
and end with it’s title.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.820
After shooting had already wrapped, the studio
ordered reshoots and changed the ending.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.790
They even brought in different writers to
do it.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.140
Just when it seemed things couldn’t get
worse, Brad Pitt would no longer acknowledge

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:31.380
director Marc Forster in person, and spoke
through a proxy.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.670
Jurassic Park
Jurassic Park has been roaring into our living

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.440
rooms since it’s release in 1993.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:42.050
It has a great story, pioneering special effects
that still meet today’s standard, and a

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:50.680
handful of heart-stopping moments.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.500
But during filming, director Steven Spielberg
had a few heart-stopping moments of his own.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.190
The robotic T-rex weighed over twelve thousand
pounds.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.130
And if Spielberg learned anything from Jaws,
it should have been that animatronics and

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.400
water do not go well together.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.390
After a few days in the rain, the damage began
to manifest in a terrifying way: by coming

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.830
alive and roaring uncontrollably.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.620
Titanic
James Cameron is responsible for some of the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.940
most epic movies of all time.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.680
The director has a knack for turning his personal
passions into big screen spectaculars.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.050
Enamored with underwater exploration, Cameron
merged his interest with the story of the

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.860
ill-fated voyage of the Titanic.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.740
As we’ve mentioned before, productions that
use a lot of water tend to hit more snags,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.960
and this one is no exception.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.910
Members of the stunt team were injured, the
shoot went over its schedule and its budget.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:49.220
The director was a force all his own, and
reportedly blew his top more than once.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.610
Apparently someone even spiked the catering
with PCP in protest.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.990
Deadpool
Hollywood presents itself as all glitz and

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.350
glam, but the behind the scenes challenges
of getting a movie made can sometimes be,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.590
well, boring.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.020
Take Deadpool for example.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.370
Despite the character’s insanely loyal fanbase
and box office potential, it took way longer

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.340
than it should have for the merc with a mouth
to get a proper movie.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.340
Why?

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.610
Because the project kept changing hands.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.630
Ryan Reynolds was always on board to play
the character, and even got to in X-Men Origins:

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.630
Wolverine.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:31.660
But everyone knew Wade Wilson deserved better,
and in 2016, patience paid off and fans got

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.460
what they were waiting for.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.220
So what do you think of our list?

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.880
Did we miss any other movies that almost didn't
get made?
