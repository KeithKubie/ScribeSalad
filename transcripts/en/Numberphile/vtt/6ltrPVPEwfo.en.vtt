00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.190
JAMES GRIME: So I've got
another prime number

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.830
generating formula for you.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.270
So this one is more modern.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.590
It was 1947, a mathematician
called Mills, and he found

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.670
this formula.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.750
He said there exist numbers--
which we're going to call

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.800
theta, the Greek
letter theta--

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.700
where you raise it to the
power 3 to the power n.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.570
And you actually then have
to round it down.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.740
That gives you fractions, so you
actually round it down to

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.830
the nearest whole number, which
you write like this.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.550
That's the symbol for
rounding it down.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.110
There exists a number like this
that will always give you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.320
primes for every value of n.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.600
So you might have n equals 1,
n equals 2, n equals 3, and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.010
every value is a prime.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.200
The smallest value for theta
where this will work is called

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.250
Mills' Constant.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.210
I'll write it out for you.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.840
It's called theta, and
Mills' Constant is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:14.760
1.306377883863080690, something,
something,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.030
something, something.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.500
So you can see it's not
a whole number.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.960
So the value you get when you
raise it, it's not going to be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.260
a whole number, and you
have to round it down.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.970
Let me just try the first few
to show you what I mean.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.220
Let's do n equals 1.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.890
Let's use my constant.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.840
You put it in.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.720
So then it's 3 to the power
1, so it's just cubed.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.070
So what I'm going to do is, for
each time, I'm going to

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.780
take this constant and then
raise it to the power 3

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.495
to the power n.

00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:47.430
And I'll do that n equals 1,
n equals 2, and so on.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.300
So, n equals 1.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.610
3 to the power n is just 3.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.040
So that's going to
be theta cubed.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.920
That's the first prime.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.860
And what is the answer?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.490
What is theta cubed?

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.160
Theta cubed is 2.229,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.880
something, something, something.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.300
You round it down, so
the prime is 2.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.730
Hey!

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.889
We've got that is prime.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.400
In fact, every number
should be prime.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.960
Let's try the next one.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280
Let's do n equals 2.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.290
So this is going to
be 3 squared.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.290
That's theta to the power 9.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.080
So take the constant to the
power 9, and that is going to

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
be 11.082, something,
something.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.470
Round it down, you get 11.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.290
So you get gaps.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.490
It's not consecutive primes,
but every one is a prime.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.990
You get 11, that's
the next one.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.060
Let's do n equals 3.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.860
So I now need theta 3
to the power 3, 27.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.180
Theta to the power 27 is
1,361.000, something,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.930
something, something.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.730
1,361 is a prime as well.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.820
Let's do n equals 4.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.965
Theta to the power 81.

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:02.215
You get 252,100,887--

00:03:05.973 --> 00:03:06.341
BRADY HARAN: Oh, yeah.

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:07.450
That's clearly a prime.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.170
JAMES GRIME: Which is clearly a
prime, which is a a prime--

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.930
Point something, something,
something, but

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:11.980
you round it down.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.350
But you're actually guaranteed
to get a prime every time.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.720
BRADY HARAN: Do you know
what my conclusion is?

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.740
That number's awesome!

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.100
JAMES GRIME: I know.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.200
I completely agree.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.710
That number is completely
awesome.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.410
So the rock stars of math, so
I have pi, and e, and these

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.080
golden ratios, and
things like that.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.680
It's not nearly as famous.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.490
It's a constant that
gives you primes.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.490
Brilliant!

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.200
I love it.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.790
BRADY HARAN: Is it proven?

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.820
I mean, there's a lot
of n's you could

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.790
put into that equation.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.060
Is this a proven thing?

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.350
JAMES GRIME: Yep.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.050
This is proven.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.520
This is proven.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.250
So you might think then,
what's the big deal?

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.760
We've got a formula to find
guaranteed primes.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.130
How amazing is that?

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.080
And the problem is, did
you notice how big

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.850
the powers were getting?

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.790
The powers very quickly become
so huge that even computers

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.950
can't deal with the problem.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:19.029
So the next one, n equals 5,
is theta to the power 243.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:24.980
And this is about 1.602
times 10 to the 28.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.090
Once you start getting bigger
than that, you can't do it.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.210
The computers can't
cope with that.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.990
The other problem is you need
to know this constant to a

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.230
great accuracy.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.040
Because, what I've written
out for you--

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.390
let's say if I terminated
it there--

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.640
isn't accurate enough to tell
me what the next prime is.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.930
The next prime actually
is something huge.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.450
We'll put it on the screen,
I think, instead

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.790
of writing it out.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:02.230
But this was not accurate
enough to work it out.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.820
That's a bit of a problem.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.580
You need to know theta very,
very accurately.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.700
BRADY HARAN: Is theta
rational?

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.430
Does theta have an end?

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.650
JAMES GRIME: We don't know.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.920
We don't know.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.700
How amazing is that?

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.180
We don't know if theta
is irrational or not.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.080
That's a cool question
as well.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.280
We don't know.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.850
One of the other problems with
theta is, at the moment, we

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.280
don't know any way to really
work it out, apart from taking

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.460
one of the Mill primes--

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.260
You take one of the Mill primes,
cube root it, and

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.060
theta is approximately that.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.400
So I'm afraid it's a bit
of a circular argument.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.050
We haven't got a good way
of working out theta.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.530
You have to know the
primes in the first

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.640
place to work out theta.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.540
BRADY HARAN: Oh, well I'm not
so impressed by it anymore.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.240
JAMES GRIME: I know.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.850
So you can see why it's
not so practical.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.210
One of the things that we might
be able to do is, if

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.540
Riemann's hypothesis is true--

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.630
Riemann's hypothesis is a very
important hypothesis in

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.910
mathematics that hasn't been
proven yet, that is a

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.600
Millennium prize, and it's
related to crimes and how

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.250
they're distributed.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.290
If that is true-- (WHISPERING)
it probably is true--

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.900
If it's true, then we
have another way

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.540
to find Mill primes.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.160
Using that method, we can now
calculate what theta is

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.890
probably going to be.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.870
It's been calculated up to about
7,000 digits, but it is

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.290
relying on if the Riemann
hypothesis is true, which

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.410
hasn't been proven.
(WHISPERING)

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.860
It's probably true.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.210
We have worked out larger Mill
primes, and we have worked out

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.072
theta to a large number
of places.

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:51.150
