Speaker 1:          00:01          So we want the understand defraction patterns. It's clear that there's some relationship between the arrangement of the electrons that are doing the scattering and the pattern of the scattery you get right at a particular angle. There's a particular intensity and it must be depend on how, it must depend on how those electrons are arranged. But how is the interesting question, right? So what we're going to do now is look just a little bit at the, no one figures this out. In a real case, people have written fancy computer programs to do this, but so that it doesn't seem mysterious. I want you to get the idea of how it works.

Speaker 2:          00:44          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:47          so the first slide we showed, or the third slide actually that we showed last time was made of a bunch of these things we call benzenes. That collections are six dots and they're simple. They're already all oriented the same way. That's not very reasonable except when they get regular and a crystal, which is where we're going. But anyhow, if you have a whole bunch of them but randomly distributed, it turns out the intensity you get is stronger proportional to the number of them that are doing the scattering. Right? But the pattern you get is the same you'd get from just one. So that's why we use this funny slide and this was the pattern that came out, this thing that looked a little bit like a snowflake. And I'd like you to understand why that hexagon a dots gives a snowflake. So we take the hexagon or dots and what do we look for to see where scattering might be to see what, what's the number, what the trick is. The trick is to look at things that lie on equally spaced planes. Try to choose a set of planes so that as many of the electrons as there are will fall on or near that set of evenly spaced planes. Right? So [inaudible] this is two dimensions. So we're looking for lines or cross sections of planes, right? So how, how could we draw lines on here evenly spaced lines so that all the dots will fall on them?

Speaker 1:          02:26          Well, we could do it that, uh, this way, right? So they're evenly spaced, three of them and all the electrons fall on or near them. Notice they don't have to fall exactly on, cause if they're displaced a little bit, the phase of the wave will change a little bit compared to the others, but only a little bit. So it just has to be near not exactly on. Okay. So, uh, there we have it now. So that means that you'll get scattering in that direction where all there well, where they will reinforce one another. Right. Let's, uh, let's go back to the, to the display we were looking at before.

Speaker 2:          03:07          Ah, here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:11          We were talking about this just as class started. So a wave comes in, makes these things all move up and down the electrons here and here at the same time. Actually let's make all three of them vibrate for current purposes. Okay. Now we're interested in what angles light can come out and all these things will help each other out reinforce one another. So as we go here that and look at that vertical line, we see that they're not all in phase at that angle, but as we increase the angle, when we get to say here, it looks not so bad. The top and the bottom are actually exactly in phase, but the middle one is exactly out of phase and it'll cancel out the top one. And if there were a whole row of these, the the, the, the second one cancels the first, the fourth would cancel the third, the sixth would cancel the fifth and so on.

Speaker 1:          04:05          There wouldn't be anything coming out. And now we go a little bit away from that. And it's worth making a point here. Suppose that this were a very, very, very long line of scatterers. Right? And the first two, let's, let's get to this place here where they're all exactly in phase, that'll obviously very, very strong angle. But suppose we looked at another angle that was close to that. Just that just a teeny bit off. So the first two are off by just, you know, one degree in phase and the next one's off by two degrees in phase, not much off. Okay. So are we going to get pretty strong light coming out from that

Speaker 2:          04:48          Russell?

Speaker 1:          04:51          If it's a very long string, if the first one's one degree out, by the time we get to the hundred 80th it'll be 180 degrees out or exactly 180th we'll cancel the first one 181st we'll cancel the second 183rd second, we'll cancel a hundred we'll cancel the third and so on. Right. So it has to, if you have a really long string, it has to be exactly on from one to the next in order to get them so that you get something coming out and what you get coming out. Then we'll be quite strong because there'll be the scattering from the whole bunch of them.

Speaker 2:          05:29          Right.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Where does that, where did you see that in last week's lecture? Friday's lecture. Right. You saw it that you got very fine dots when you had a really long row of things. Okay, so back to here.

Speaker 2:          05:51          Uh,

Speaker 1:          05:53          so there'll be things that are almost exactly in phase and it'll be a certain angle at which there'll be in phase in that angle is shown by that, the end of that Arrow. And you get therefore a dot there. And also by symmetry, the other five of the six dots as you could draw the lines, other angles at the same way. Everybody with me on that? Okay? Okay. Now, uh, so we look for electron density on or near evenly spaced planes. Now because it only has to be near, there are other directions we could draw it. So we get a set of planes where there near but not on like here right now, one is a little above the plane too, or a little below the plane, right? Or vice versa for the second line. Right. But they're pretty close and there are certain spacing.

Speaker 1:          06:45          Now that spacing is larger than the blue spacing. Does everybody see that? What does that mean? About the angle at which the reflection will occur or the scattering where there'll be in phase, the angle will be smaller. So the, the part of the snowflake that comes from that is here, right? Smaller angle because it's a larger distance and you could see immediately why that is. If we look at this thing that, that if there, if you look at the top to the bottom where they're far apart, the lines are far apart. You get the first reflection there. But if the line, but if the lines are closer together, like these two, then you have to go to a higher angle in order to get that first one first coming into phase, right? So that's that reciprocal relationship. Okay. So we get a set of six dots like that.

Speaker 1:          07:43          And that's most of the pattern. But there are other places too. You can see it, for example, you can take those lines in that set of lines. Every, uh, every dot. The center of every.is on a line. There happens to be aligned in the middle. That doesn't have anything on it. But who cares, right? The others are on evenly spaced lines, right? So they'll all be in phase where we'll that one km, that reflection close in or far out, far out. And there you see it way out at the edge. Can you see it there? Just a little bit with the, I can turn the room lights down but I don't think it's worth it. You can see that it's there and there. And so there's six of them out there as well. Okay, so you got the idea of how by looking for evenly spaced planes, you can, uh, you can predict what the pattern will be for a certain arrangement of electrons.

Speaker 1:          08:40          Now don't notice those ones far out are very weak. That's because although the centers of the dots lie ride on the lines, the lines are getting so closely spaced that there's part of the electron density that's not write the lines. That in fact gets out to almost halfway between the lines, right at that part of the electron density will be canceling. So most of the electron density is all in phase here, but some of it is out of phase. And as you get the lines closer and closer together, the fact that the electron distribution is finite and not tiny points means that things will get weaker and weaker as you go to higher angles. Okay, so there, there again, we notice here that the closer spaced planes you have higher angles. This is what we've just been talking about. Now, when you take a slide with a regular lattice of these benzenes, then if you remember, if you took just one, you get this snowflake pattern. If you take a whole row across the top

Speaker 2:          09:49          right like that,

Speaker 1:          09:53          oh, pardon me, I meant to say that one will be very weak. You can hardly see it. What you need is a bunch of them to cooperate to see something that you can see. Now first we could take the whole row along the top and and we're going to look only at scattering in the vertical direction. So I've narrowed in on the picture. But if we take that whole row along the top, remember they'll all scatter in phase at the specular angle because for go for scattering up and down. So now it gets more intense because they're all cooperating for other directions. They wouldn't all be in phase from one hexagon to the next, but for scattering up and down where they're all at exactly the same level, they'll all be exactly the same. Okay. Now suppose I had the next row. Will they be in phase?

Speaker 1:          10:46          Well, the second for the same scan for the same direction of scattering up and down where that top row is all in phase. So we would get the scattering shown here right? Stronger than it was before because it's a bunch of these things now. Right, but still not really strong. But let's add in the next row. Is that going to make them all stronger again? No. Most of the time they'll be out of phase from the next row for scattering in this direction. Right. Most of the time there'll be out of phase, but for particular angles there'll be in phase. So in fact, what that will do if we add the next row that we, we made the picture of brighter, cause we got twice as many things scattering now, but there'll be bars across it like that. It's always the same pattern getting brighter and brighter as we add more of them, but at certain angles that are in phase now and at certain angles, they're out of phase from one pattern to the next or from one row to the next. Now, so what's going to, if we add the whole sheet of them, can you see

Speaker 1:          12:00          Sam? Ah, they'll only be really precise angles at which they all interfere. Otherwise the hundred 80th will interfere with the first 181st with the second and so on, right? So if we add the whole phase, the whole thing, then if we look at the pattern, it's going to be brighter, right? But it'll be only at knots, holy at very precise angles, right? And that's what we saw when we went to this final picture for scattering from a lattice. So what this means is that the lattice repeat concentrates the snowflakes scattering into tightly focused spots on a regular pattern,

Speaker 2:          12:47          right?

Speaker 1:          12:48          So this is the diffraction from a two D lattice of Benzenes, which is the same as the underlying snowflake that came from just one. But it's as if it were being viewed, as I said last time through a peg board,

Speaker 2:          13:08          right?

Speaker 1:          13:09          All that scattering gets concentrated into a few points. Very Bright. And these are these regular points. Now, some people seemed not to know what a pegboard was. So I took a picture of a pegboard over the weekend. How many people have never seen a pegboard before? Just to calibrate me? Okay? Most people have seen a pegboard, but you know, you put it that you could put these hooks in it and then hang whatever you want on it, like tools or pictures or whatever you want to put on your wall. So it's like looking through the holes in that at the snowflake pattern. Now there's there two quotes, spaces that get talked about direct space or real space and diffraction space or reciprocal space. Okay. So the crystal is the real thing that you're interested in. And diffraction photo is in diffraction space. You see these dots that allow, we saw for example, for copper sulfate, right?

Speaker 1:          14:07          So in real space you have a unit cell structure. That is the thing, the pattern that then gets repeated to make the crystal, but you have the pattern, right? And that gives rise to this fuzzy pattern like a snowflake and reciprocal space. And then you have a crystal lattice or regular repetition of these patterns, right? And that's as viewing through the holes in the pegboard. Okay? And remember that decreased spacing and real space corresponds to increased spacing and reciprocal space, which is of course why it's called reciprocal. Okay? So that's what we want to understand about how it works, right? There are patterns which give rise to patterns and reciprocal space, that buzzy thing. And then if you have a repeating lattice of that, it gets concentrated into particular points, but it's the same underlying pattern. So there's the pattern, which is the structure of the molecule, and there's the lattice, which is the structure of the crystal.

Speaker 1:          15:11          Okay. Now let's look at the light bulb filament, the last thing we looked at and see why the scattering from that looks the way we do it looks like this x with, with dots along it. Okay, so we take, we want to find if there are electrons on this helix, right? We can find a set of evenly spaced parallel planes like the yellow ones here. So we'll get scattering perpendicular to those planes. And sure enough there it is that spot. But we could also take a set of planes and it goes not only up but also down both branches, but both directions of that particular branch of the ex come from the same planes. Okay. But you could make planes that are twice as close to one another. Right. What will those give rise to?

Speaker 1:          16:04          Twice as far out. The sign is twice as big, actually. Not that actual spacing, but it's, it's that one, the second one out along the branch. Okay. Now will that be, do you expect that to be brighter or not as bright as the first one? Not Well, uh, there it probably will be not as bright. And the reason is that for, there are two things that have to do with the brightness. One is how much density there is on the plains versus how much there is between the planes, right? And we see here that say take the original yellow one. There's a lot. All of this stuff is nearly on the plane and halfway between the plate and there's not very much just a thin cross section of the wire. Okay? Uh, but as the planes get closer and closer, the fact that the wire has a finite thicknesses thickness means that some parts of the wire, the same part of the wire are out of phase compared to others.

Speaker 1:          17:10          So because of the finite thickness, you expect it to slowly fall off in intensity as you go out. But you'll then get the third one along the branch and so on, and you can do the same trick in the other direction, right? So that's why it's an x. You can draw this analogous mirror image lines. Okay. Now what does the x, the angle of the x tell you? The x could look like this or it could look like this, right? What do you learn from that? The angle that the x makes, how tightly wound the helix is. Cause if the helix, we're very right, then the planes would be like this. And if you'd grab the string and the spring and stretched it out, they'd look like this. Right? So the angle of the x tells how tightly wound the helix is. Tells the pitch of the Helix. Okay. What does the spacing of the spots tell you? Did you do the homework I suggested for today that you didn't have to hand in? Then you'll know what the spacing of the spots tells you. If you know the wavelength of the x rays or of the light in this case, what does the spacing of the spots tell you?

Speaker 2:          18:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:28          It tells you this how, what? The actual distance is between successive turns of the Helix, how far apart the planes are. So it tells the scale of the Helix, right? The angle you get from the x, but how big the actual helix is you get from the spacing of those dots. If you know the wavelength and the distance that you're magnifying. And in that case of the demonstration, the distance from the slide at the back of the room to the front of the room for seeing this and the spots weaken successively because of y or thickness as we just explained as you go on out. Now that looks very much like a Rosalind Franklin's B d n a photograph from 1952. So we see the helix and we see how how angled the, the success of turns of the Helix are, what the pitch of the Helix is, and from the spacing of the dots, we get how big the actual helix is.

Speaker 1:          19:32          But there's something funny, it's the intensity doesn't just evenly decrease as you go out. It's instead of being strong, not quite as strong, less strong, weaker, very weak. As you go out, it goes weak, strong, strong, very weak, strong. Now why is that? Why do you get such a funny pattern of intensities? Let's look here at this uh, thing again. Remember where if we will look for the first, second, third, and so on, we saw that they come in and out of phase, but let's suppose so it would be if you have things that are twice as close together here as in the first case, what effect does that have on the actual pattern? We see the pattern we saw if we had only every other one was here, the direct beam. First reflection, second reflection, third reflection, fourth reflection. How does it differ if we add one in between? Okay, here's the first reflection. Do we see that if we have all three, that's what

Speaker 3:          20:48          would've been the first reflection if we didn't have the intermediate one. Do we see a reflection here if we have a whole row of them? No, because every other one cancels out so we won't see that one. How about the next one? Yeah, we very bright, right, because there's more doing the scattering. How about if we go to the next one? No, nothing there. Cancel. Right. How about the next one? You perceive a pattern emerging.

Speaker 2:          21:18          What is it? What you see it and you don't see? It.

Speaker 3:          21:29          Can you, can you say it in a more mathematical way? Suppose we numbered them. The the one straight ahead. We'll call zero. Then there'll be the first one, two, three, four, five. What happens? What do we put one in between? Is One there. This was one here, right? There was one for the top and bottom. Is that there? How about too? How about three? No. How about for, what's the, can you state at mathematically Lexi, what do you say?

Speaker 2:          22:10          Can't hear it very well.

Speaker 3:          22:14          Which ones disappear? The odd ones. One, three, five, seven, nine. The odd ones disappear, but the even ones are still there, right? If we put an extra one in between, now let's think about DNA. Here's a helix, right? But what do you say about DNA? Is it just the Helix? It's a double helix. So there are two heela sees. Okay, so suppose we have that. They're the, they're the success of turns and we get scattering at a certain angle. But suppose we make a double. He likes now what'll happen, Lexi, you're going to help me again.

Speaker 3:          22:51          How different will it be if we have a second? He licks wound halfway between the first, he likes what will happen to the what we are from one helix. We had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine with angles. Right. What happens now? Can't hear all the arguments disappear. Right? So what would you have expected to see in Rosalind Franklin's picture then? Right. It would be weak. Strong, weak, strong, weak. Strong. Right. But generally getting weaker as you go out because of the finite thickness of the wire. Is that what we see? No, we saw the first one is very weak. Strong, strong, very weak. Strong. Can you see any, how could that be? What is that you? Yeah, perfectly in face. What do you mean they're not perfectly in phase? There may be they're not equally. Ah, maybe the second one isn't half way between the first.

Speaker 3:          23:58          The turns of the first one. Right. What happens? So the planes are twice as close there and that would cancel every other reflection. All the odd winds. But suppose it's like that. Did you ever see a situation like that before? Where what repeats is not aligned but a pair of lines. Angela, the second diffraction pattern we looked at was of that sort, which showed the same dots, but the intensity got modulated. Remember? Okay, so let's instead of doing this where we have equally spaced ones, let's do one where they're not equally spaced like this. Now, oops, came loose here.

Speaker 2:          24:47          Uh, here we go. Oh No. There we go.

Speaker 3:          24:55          Okay, now consider the top and the bottom one, right, which are in successive turns the same helix and the this one is offset in the middle, but consider just the top and the bottom one. Okay. There's the first reflection, the second reflection, the third reflection, the fourth reflection. Everybody see between the top and the bottom. Now tell me what happens if, if I had that other one offset this way. How about the first reflection there? Is that going to be strong? No, because the this one is canceling it and remember there's also one like this below this one. Remember, it's a really long row of these things, so it gets almost perfectly canceled. Not quite because it's not quite. There would be exactly the minimum and when the first and the third are in phase, the second one is not exactly out of phase, but very close. Very weak. That reflection's going to be. Now let's go to the two. What would be the second reflection of the single helix there? How about there? Yeah, the second one now is helping out a little bit. Not Perfectly, but it's hell. In fact, probably if you go just a little bit further, maybe there'd be better. But anyhow, there'll be a reflection there. Okay. Now how about if we go to the third?

Speaker 3:          26:11          That's as good as the second one, right? And how about if we go to the fourth, who would the fourth if they were evenly spaced, what would you expect for the fourth? Very strong. Right? So let's go to the forest. One, two, three, four. What should it be? Really weak. And how about the fifth? That's precisely what she saw, right? Weak, strong, strong. Very weak. Strong. So that's much, this is how much it's offset from the center in order to get that sequence of intensities.

Speaker 2:          26:51          Everybody with me on this? Okay.

Speaker 3:          26:59          So that's that repeated pair pattern that we saw before and there's there you see that that the outer coil of the DNA, which has phosphorous in it with a lot of electrons, right? That's very much like this. Like this helix. Okay. Is much more electron density near these planes than between them. Then halfway between, but there's also much more electron density on those near those blue plains. Then in between for the same reason. And that means that you get those spots on the side that tells you the diameter or the helix. Okay. And the things top and bottom tell you the base stacking distance. Let me back up just a second to show you what we mean, right? So there are a bunch of electrons here, bunch of electrons here, lunch here, bunch here, and that gives scattering in this direction. So all that information, the helix diameter, the fact that it's a helix, the fact that it's a double helix, the fact that it's an offset double helix and the diameter of this cylinder are all easily read out if you know what you're looking for.

Speaker 3:          28:08          Which crick knew because he had been studying Heela sees of proteins, right? So he knew about, he knew from helix scattering. Okay, so knowing the molecules, electron density, as we knew our artificial sort of benzene or this DNA, it's easy to calculate the crystals diffraction pattern, especially if you have a computer to help you out. But it's not an intellectual challenge. It's just work. Right? Using pretty heavy duty math people got the Nobel prize for developing it or, or a canned program. That's what they got the Nobel prize for. You can go the other way and go from the ex-ray pattern to what it was that was causing it. Right. What we did was go from what's causing it to the pattern now, but in fact you can go the other way now when you press a button on a machine and you get out the electron density at every point in space, okay, that's the, that's the yield from an x ray structure. Why don't you get the nuclear positions? Why do you get the electron positions?

Speaker 3:          29:15          Alex can't hear. It's too, it's too heavy. So it doesn't vibrate the nuclei. So they don't function as an antenna to give off the new waves the way the electrons do. Okay. So you get a result, which you can plot on a map. Now in the olden days when I started doing this kind of thing, the kind of map you got out was a big sheet of computer output paper and it had numbers it and it that a given piece of paper was a given slice through the unit cell through the pattern, right? And numbers were printed out that said, what was the electron density at that particular point on that level. So you know, you had uh, uh, x axis, y axis, and at this point it was 75, 40 to 55, 87 or whatever the number is and so on. And what you do is take a felt tip pen and co connect dots of equal size, right?

Speaker 3:          30:11          And you'd get a contour of that particular electron density. And here's where that was done for a particular compound. This is taken from a book written at that time by stout and Jensen. Uh, and you drew these by hand because you didn't have a computer that could draw, it, could figure out where to draw it and so on. So here was here where Adam's in a particular crystal structure. Now that Pr, then you had a whole bunch of sheets of paper for different slices through the electron density. Stack them up right now sometimes the particular slice you're working in went right through the middle of an atom. So you've got very high electron density. Sometime had just barely touched the atom, right? So you see here that that one, that Adam, this particular slice was very near the nucleus. So we got high electron density, but that when the nucleus was not in this plane, so you just got a little glancing blow at it, but you could make, you could draw these things on acetate or plastic sheets and stack them up, right?

Speaker 3:          31:15          So this was the model made for the first determination of the structure of penicillin. In fact, the potassium, salt of penicillin, where's the potassium, Adam? How can you distinguish potassium from nitrogen or carbon or hydrogen or oxygen? It'll have a lot more electron density. So you see it, all right? There's the potassium, lots of density, okay? Now here's a molecule that happened to be flat. So it was possible to slice through practically all the nuclei. It's not a very common type of molecule, but this one is Rubo few, Seren, okay? Now these contours are drawn at intervals of one electron per cubic Kang strum, right? So the first one is one electron cubic Galveston, two electrons per cubic costume, three electrons per cubic instruments. So on. Now there are both carbons and oxygens in this. How can you tell which ones are oxygen's? Yeah, you in June, they should have more contour lines. So if we look here, we see that that one goes up to five electrons per cubic construct. One, two, three, four, five rings, right? That one goes up to seven electrons per cubic Armstrong. And so do those, right? So those are the oxygen's. Go ahead and there's a picture of the structure and you see indeed, those atoms are oxygens.

Speaker 2:          32:52          All right? Now, uh,

Speaker 3:          32:56          what is our fundamental goal of looking at this stuff? What do we want to see bonds? Do you see bonds? What does it look like? It looks like just a bunch of balls. Just Adams. But there was Louis, right? Are there electron pairs but halfway between the bonded

Speaker 2:          33:20          Adams? No,

Speaker 3:          33:22          it's just Adams. Why are there no hydrogens? Because they have hardly any electrons compared to the others, right? So they're very weak thing. Okay. Now those are bonds. You can see I'm there. Where did those lines come from? Angela? Would you say somewhat true that, yeah, your drone. How did you know where to draw the bonds? Connected, dawn, you connect the centers of the rings, right? Those are the bonds. Now, how do you know what's the single bonds? What's a double bond? What's a triple bond?

Speaker 2:          34:04          Yes.

Speaker 3:          34:05          Do you notice in that you notice in the structure here on the bottom right there double bonds and single bonds. How do I know which is which? Is there any way annoying knowing Elizabeth distance between the distance noble bonds or should be shorter than saying hold bonds and in fact, notice that that here we have short, long, and intermediate. Why Intermediate? Why do I draw a dotted line there?

Speaker 3:          34:37          Because we have this love here, residents, right? So they're one and a half bonds. Okay? But fundamentally what we see our spiritual Adams, right? No bonds, no one shared pairs on oxygen. Just Adams. So was Louis Way off base? Yeah. Actually you can see the bonds with X-ray, but you don't look at total electron density. The way we're looking at it, what you look at his difference density. You see how different is the picture? I actually determine from what I would have expected if they were truly spec just spherical Adams undistorted. How do you find, how would you make such a map?

Speaker 3:          35:36          So you have these pieces of paper that say how much the electron density would be at all different points experimentally. How much it is experimentally. Now I want to see how different is that from what if I just had spheres for the atoms? What would I do? I have to find out what the spheres would look like, what density they would predict at all these different points, and then do what? Subtract. Right? So that's the difference. Density. Sometimes it's called [inaudible] formation because it's how much the electron distribution gets deformed when bonds get made. Okay? So you take the observed electron density, which is from Ray, which is experimental, and you subtract atomic electron density, which you calculate somehow. You know what's very cool? Adams would look like, we'll get to that next, how you would know what that is. But anyhow, you, how do you know where to, when you're going to do the subtraction, you have to make sure you position the atoms properly to be subtracted, right?

Speaker 3:          36:37          How do you know where to put them? How do you know where to put your spherical items? So that just attracted, yeah, you put it on the center of those rings, right? Okay. So let's look at a case like this. This was done by laser Ovitz and Ziva Bercovitch yell and uh, what, how was 33 years ago? So this is an interesting molecule because it has lots of different kinds of bonds in it. Single bonds, double bonds, in fact, three double bonds in a row. And also benzene rings that have these resident bonds. Okay? So we're going to look first at one of the benzene rings. Okay? So this map that I'm showing you here is a difference density map. It's the total minus what it would be for the atoms. But notice what was subtracted is just the carbon density didn't subtract hydrogens. So let's look at the features that are big here.

Speaker 3:          37:32          This is how the electron density changed in forming the molecule from Adams. Okay? So first look up there. There's some very dense contours right in the middle up there. And that's the hydrogen which was not subtracted, right? So it's the biggest game left in town once you've subtracted the spherical carbons. Okay? Uh, okay, so that's, and the, the total amount of intensity in that region is one electron, which is what you expect. But now the total amount of debt formation density in this region where there's a single carbon carbon bond is only a 10th of an electron. What would Lewis have said? Two electrons. It's a 10th of an electron. Okay, now let's slice that and, and, and, and within the carbon, carbon bonds of the ring, the aromatic ones, it's bigger. Why bigger? Cause it's partially double bond in the resonance structures. Right? Okay. So it's 0.2 electrons for those ones in the ring. Now let's slice it and turn it so we can see it's cross section and it's round. No surprise there. But let's slice the ones in the ring and turn them.

Speaker 3:          38:52          It's oval, not round. The bonds are not round. Why? Oh, because they're partially made up of these p orbitals that point in and out of the ring. Distorted from being round. Okay. Now let's look at the double bonds that are in the middle of this molecule. Okay, first that one, we've already seen that bond before. That was 0.1 had around cross section. But let's look at one of the double bonds. Not Too surprisingly, it has more electron deformation density and at 0.2 right? And the one in the middle actually has 0.3. Now you might, they're both double bonds. So probably they look similar, right? And in a sense they do. If we slice the first one and turn it, it's oval for the same reason as before. There's a p orbital pointing in and out of the, of the board, and if we look at it below, part of the bond is caused by overlapping as we'll see of those p orbitals, so it's got an oval up and down shape. How about the next one? If we slice it and turn it, it's also oval in cross section, but perpendicular.

Speaker 2:          40:10          All right.

Speaker 3:          40:11          What do you expect the next one would look like? It's symmetrical. It'll look like the first one again, but here's something interesting. That cross section of the middle one showed the defamation due to the pink, but not the defamation showed showing due to those neighboring blue ones. There's must be something different about the interaction at the end and the interaction in the middle. Does everybody see that problem? You might think the middle one would be round or cloverleaf shaped, but it's not. It's distorted in the in plane direction. But to understand this, you have to be patient. Wait till next week or later this week when we start getting into quantum mechanics. But notice that it's as if the carbons form better bonds. So the, the bonds from those central carbons at the end go up and down, but the ones in the middle are in plain.

Speaker 3:          41:10          Cool. Now, how many electrons are other in a bond? So here we're going to plot how many electrons vertically and how long the bond is, which is related to whether it's single, double, triple. In fact, a single bond is there a double bond in a triple bond? Have those distances. Now, if you, uh, and in fact you could also do a one and a half, right? Those bonds in the benzene ring. Now what would you expect this to be? How many electrons? If you were Louis, how many electrons would you have in a single bond to double bond? Four, six, three. One and a half. Okay, so there's what you would expect for the plot if Louis was right, two, four, six. Okay. Now we can take this molecule that we just looked at and see how much electron density there is in each of those bonds. And I've color coded it and it looks pretty darn good.

Speaker 2:          42:15          Right?

Speaker 3:          42:17          Hurray for Lewis. And in fact, the people who did the work laser over itch and bercovitch Yellen looked at a bunch of other structures to and added those to the same plot. And they're not bad except the scale is wrong. Instead of being two four, six, which I've fade it out here, it's 0.1 0.2 0.3 so bonds are a very minor game and the distribution of electrons, Louis in a sense was sort of right. There are, is electron density shifted between the atoms, the hold them together, right, but much less than pairs of electrons. In fact, this amount of bonding density is about one 20th of what Louis Bite of said, but never did say because he wasn't that naive. Okay. So instead of getting to you get a 20th of 2.1 okay. So Bonnie density is about a 20th of a Louis. Incidentally, the unit Lewis is used only within this class.

Speaker 3:          43:22          Okay. So here's another example done by donuts in Switzerland and these people who were the uh, uh, Seiler and Shites or who were, you know, Swiss, who were the progeny of watchmakers and people that do very precise work, cause the do this, you have to have really precise experimental work if you're going to subtract something from something else and have the difference be meaningful when the numbers are almost precisely the same, right? Remember we looked at the total electron density. You look just like spheres. So you have to be really good with this if you want to have this be meaningful. And those guys are really good. This was done what, 25 years ago. Okay. So they took this molecule which is highly symmetric, which is great. Remember it's got its residents structure, so all the bonds around the middle or the same top and bottom.

Speaker 3:          44:14          Okay? So we all, we need only look at a quarter of the molecule or for convenience, a little bit more than a quarter. So I'll blow it up here. And there is the electron difference density. So this is how the electrons shifted during formation of the bonds. Okay, so there is a carbon, carbon aromatic bond, a bond and a half. And if you'd turn it and look at it, it's the store did the way you expect. Just as in the previous experiment we talked about. Here's another one. Same deal right now. Here is a single bond. Carbon, carbon single bond. What's it going to look like in Cross section round? Good. Now here is a carbon nitrogen triple bond. This is something new. What's it gonna look like in Cross section? Maybe like a cloverleaf, Huh?

Speaker 2:          45:10          Like that? It looks like that.

Speaker 3:          45:16          It's round. It's not cloverleaf and it's not a diamond. It's round in cross section, so we'll address that later. What's that? That's not a bond. That's the unshared pair on nitrogen. Well, what's special here? What are we looking at? We're looking at the carbon fluorine bonds. Does it look like the carbon carbon bonds are carbon nitrogen? How's it different? There's no there. There, right? There aren't any electrons holding carbon to fluorine. What the heck is going on? Where is the CF bond? This brings up the second great question in the chorus. What's the first question? How do you know? Right. And the second question is illustrated by this. A film clip. Oh, the sounds down. What caused the sound to go down?

Speaker 2:          46:25          Huh? See if that does it. Come on, baby.

Speaker 3:          46:45          I worked hard on this.

Speaker 2:          46:52          That sounds familiar though. Can you

Speaker 3:          46:55          I find it before class. Did you hear it? Okay. I'll tell you what it says.

Speaker 2:          47:13          Do what?

Speaker 3:          47:17          Let me try this just to make sure. It's not that I can do it myself. This is a disaster. Catch some thieves. Harmson that's what we're here for, Mary. Well, sir, click, click, click, click. What do you think of him compared with what sir? Exactly. Okay. What do you think of it compared with what's are exactly. That's the second question compared with what? In anything quantitative. Even many qualitative things. That's the question and that's where we're having problems here. Looking for the CF bond. We already saw this question when we talked about resonance. Remember I asserted that when you have residents, the molecule is unusually stable. What should you have asked compared to what? Right? In that case, it turns out it's compared to observed or calculated energy. Compare. The observed are calculated energies. What really happens to what you would expect if it were not resonant. And we'll talk later about how on what basis you might have an expectation. Now we're talking about difference electron density. So what do we compare?

Speaker 3:          48:55          We compare experimental electron density or it could be calculated, right? Cause we, if we can use quantum mechanics to calculate it, but compare experimental electron density to what? What have we compared it to what it would be if it were just Adams, right? But what kind of atoms, right? We compare the observed are calculated total electron density to the sum of electron densities for a set of undistorted Adams. Now, what's an undistorted Adam? Okay. Now to avoid Paoli problems, and this isn't the time to discuss what those are, we need to subtract not an unbiased spherical fluorine atom, which if you count up how many electrons there are on fluorine, each quadrant of space around flury in of which there will be for each quadrant, we'll have one in three quarters electrons in it, right? You multiply that by four and you get seven electrons, which is the valence electrons of, of, um, of fluorine, right?

Speaker 3:          50:06          But, uh, if you, but you can't have one and three quarters electrons from fluorine and also electron from carbon in the same place, that's too many electrons in the same place, right? So what you have to start with is not an undistorted spherical fluorine atom, but a fluorine atom that's prepared to make a bond, which has only one electron in the region where it's gonna make a bond. So if you subtract the spherical one, you're subtracting too much from the region of the bond, right? So that's why you don't see any electron density in there. So, and if you want to understand this better than I've explained it, go on the web and look at Professor Dunn. It's explaining it. We have a little movie of him talking about this particular problem, okay? But at any rate, the conclusion of all this is that bonding density is about one 20th of a Louis, right? And it's time for me to quit. We'll go on with this next time.
