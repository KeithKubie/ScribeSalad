JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Good morning, friends!

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.030
Good morning.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.860
There we go.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.740
I hope everybody's doing well.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.110
It's great to see you
all bright and early

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.990
on day two of I/O '15.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.500
How many folks made it
to the party last night?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.290
Yeah.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.410
Good times?

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.970
I thought so.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.800
Yeah.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.090
So if you made to the party,
and so many of you did,

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.702
thank you again for
showing up so early.

00:00:28.702 --> 00:00:29.910
My name's Jonathan Alferness.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.930
I'm vice president of
product management at Google,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.240
and I lead up our mobile
display ads products.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.020
I have here with me my good
friend Scott Huffman vice

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.850
president of engineering, and
he leads up our mobile search

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.455
engineering efforts.

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:45.580
Today we're going to spend
about 40 minutes talking

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.300
to you about the world
of apps, app discovery,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.050
and how to really grow your
own audience through the tools

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.082
that we're providing.

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:56.540
We're going to talk about this
from an organic perspective,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.100
and also from a
paid perspective.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.480
Then we're going to talk
about some of the tools

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.302
that we're providing to help
you analyze the performance

00:01:03.302 --> 00:01:04.760
and analyze your
user acquisitions.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.460
There are a ton of apps
available in the App

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.710
and the Play Stores today.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.690
About a million-- actually,
more than a million

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.370
apps in both of those locations.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.050
And if you think
about this, this

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.790
presents an enormous challenge
to mobile app developers,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.290
right?

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.831
You need to stand
out from the crowd.

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:29.600
You need to get noticed.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.240
You need to drive
usage of your app.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.605
And the sheer volume of apps
out there is not the only hurdle

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.620
that you face, but bringing
users into your app

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.740
and engaging them time and time
again is another challenge.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.710
And you see the
other stat behind me,

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.880
where literally
a quarter of apps

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.680
are downloaded, installed
on users' phones,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.430
and yet never even run once.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.130
So there's a lot of
waste left in the system.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.480
Users are spending more and
more time in mobile apps.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.240
This is adding up to
over 30 hours per month

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.567
being spent in
mobile applications.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.900
And what we're see thing is
it's some of this engagement

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.760
is long periods of time
spent in game, but some of it

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.424
is through tiny slices of
time that really add up.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:24.840
Users are pulling their mobile
phones out of their pockets

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.560
to interact, to reach
for information,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.560
to make things happen even in
the real world, over 150 times

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
a day.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.445
We think about these
as micro-moments.

00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.070
Think about it.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.653
You're standing at
the train platform.

00:02:36.653 --> 00:02:39.120
You're waiting for the next
commuter train to come.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.120
You pull out your phone, and
you start to work on a task.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.550
You start to work on something
that you needed to do.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:45.500
But then the train
comes, and you've

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.940
got to get in, so you
kind of just, quick,

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.940
shut down the phone, put
it back in your pocket,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.060
and climb in the train.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.060
When you get off, you
want to be able to pick up

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.930
that task again.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.070
Your day is filled with all
of these slivers of moments

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.104
where you can interact
with your mobile devices.

00:02:59.104 --> 00:02:59.770
Another example.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.630
You're waiting in line to
pick up a cup of coffee.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.504
You probably pull your
mobile phone back out,

00:03:03.504 --> 00:03:06.370
and you want to resume that
task where you left off.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.560
The reason mobile apps
work so well in this space

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.350
is that they don't have to
worry about connectivity.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.280
They can save state,
they can provide you

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.830
with clean rich UIs,
and they're right there

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.180
to be accessed on
your home screen.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.520
So all this time adds up.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.350
And it adds up to now
over 30 hours per month

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.430
spent in mobile applications.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.220
And users are using more and
more mobile apps over time.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.790
In fact, the latest
stat indicates

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.430
that 36 is the number of apps
that the average American has

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.920
on her cell phone.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.620
And, as I mentioned a few
moments ago, a quarter of those

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.990
are left completely unused.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.820
We've been out
talking to friends,

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.450
talking to users
around the globe,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.550
really trying to
understand more about how

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.692
folks are fitting apps
into their daily life.

00:03:55.692 --> 00:03:57.900
And I'd like to take you
through one of these stories

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.882
to sort of illustrate the
power of mobile applications.

00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:03.215
So this is our friend Christian.

00:04:03.215 --> 00:04:04.610
This is a true story.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.280
Christian is a
young professional.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.860
He lives in Philadelphia.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.309
And he has a younger brother.

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.350
And his younger brother
recently started running.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.950
As with most sibling
relationships,

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.550
they have a bit of
a sibling rivalry,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.810
and so Christian is very eager
to go running with his brother

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.860
as well and show him that
he can do him one better.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.470
So 5:00 AM, Christian's brother
shows up at Christian's house.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.440
Sounds like about the
time my kids wake up,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.023
which is a little
early to be running.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.250
But anyway, his brother
shows up at the house,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.041
and his brother pulls
out his mobile phone,

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:40.260
and he starts configuring
his running app.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.660
He's downloaded a running
app that helps coaching him,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.402
driving him to be a
better and better runner.

00:04:45.402 --> 00:04:46.860
And Christian
thinks, well, dammit,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.318
I can't be one-upped
by my brother.

00:04:48.318 --> 00:04:49.870
So he pulls out
his mobile phone,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.230
and he wants his
own running app.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.350
But Christian isn't going
to sit there and use

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.060
the same running
app as his brother.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.070
He's unique, he's
his own person,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.060
and because it's a
rivalry, he does a search,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.270
and he starts looking for
the right kind of running app

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.610
for him.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.940
He finds a site with
the top 10 running apps,

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.110
and he peruses them.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.690
And he finds that there's
this Nike+ running app,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.950
which really,
really sings to him,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.720
because he's always been
an avid Nike customer.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.870
And he has one of those
pairs of Nike sneakers

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.090
that have the
little chips in them

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.120
so they can actually track
his pacing and running.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.400
And this happens every day.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.160
Thousands upon
thousands of times.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.700
Users need an application to
service some need for them.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.990
They have to make almost
a split second decision

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.700
with a little bit
of information.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.660
But for Christian,
this app has now

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.160
become an integral
part of his life.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.750
It sits there on
his home screen,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.750
and he uses it every day.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.090
Think about the power of the
connection that was just built

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.580
between Nike and Christian.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.010
Discoverability is the
first of these challenges.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.930
How do you get your
app to really stand out

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.730
from the crowd?

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:10.150
And today, as app developers,
you're doing a lot of work.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.440
You're worrying about
optimizing your listings.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.700
You've got to create
beautiful videos,

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.325
get them out there,
get them published,

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:18.170
get users to watch them.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:20.260
You probably want to
optimize your keywords

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.790
so that you can easily be
found in searches on these Play

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.720
stores.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.800
Many of you realize that you
should also extend your reach

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.754
by paying for app promotion.

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:32.170
And then you
probably have to deal

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.620
with a variety of
social channels.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.500
This is an awful lot of
work, and at Google we're

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.070
really leaning in to make
this as easy as possible,

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.000
to really cut through as much
of this as we can for you.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.860
So let's talk a little
bit about the assets

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.620
that Google has to bear
to bring to the solution

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.740
to really facilitate app
discovery for all of you.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.400
It really comes down
to the fact that we

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.470
have a large variety,
a heterogeneous set,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.840
of different properties
and platforms

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.150
that users are interacting
with on a daily basis--

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.210
on a minutely basis.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.490
And so across Search, and
the Play Store, and the AdMob

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.290
in-app network,
and YouTube, we can

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.700
help users connect
with apps as they're

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.980
going about their daily life.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.830
And we're working on a
whole variety of tools

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.580
to help you connect with
users at the right moments,

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.510
as they're looking
for these solutions

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.830
to install on their phone.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.590
We understand that,
for app developers,

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.034
it is not an Android-only world.

00:07:41.034 --> 00:07:43.700
And I want to make sure that all
of you understand this as well.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.160
From our perspective,
we are absolutely

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.400
committed to bringing
these solutions

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.310
to life across platforms,
across both iOS and AdMob.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.080
Because, for all
of you, you need

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.300
to grow the largest
audience possible.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.120
And if we limit to
one platform, you're

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.570
not going to be able to do this.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.440
This is an ongoing
commitment for everything

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.690
that we're doing in
this mobile apps space.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:09.730
Now I'd like to welcome
Scott Huffman come up

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.790
on stage to talk us
through what we're

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.690
doing on the organic
side of the world,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.530
to really help with
discovery and engagement.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.102
SCOTT HUFFMAN: Thanks, Jonathan.

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:21.895
Hi, everyone.

00:08:21.895 --> 00:08:23.700
I'm Scott, and I'm
one of the leads

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.770
in the search team at Google.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.220
And, in particular, I have
the really fantastic job

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.419
of leading up our
mobile search efforts.

00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:32.919
And over the last
couple years we've

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.320
been very focused
on how can we take

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.740
the great content and the
great services that all of you

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.620
are creating your apps and
make those a first order

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.745
part of the Google Search
experience for our users?

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.050
Now, Jonathan talked about
the hard, hard problems

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.040
that I think all of you
face in this apps world.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.370
First of all, out
of all those million

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.320
apps that are out
there how in the world

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.539
do users find out about your
app when they have a need,

00:09:02.539 --> 00:09:04.080
understand that your
app is something

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.920
they can meet their
need, and decide

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.230
to put that app on their phone?

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:10.055
Even once you get
through that hurdle,

00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:12.430
we all understand-- and Jonathan
gave some of the stats--

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.660
that you're not done
yet, because users

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.110
forget your app is there.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.160
They don't really
understand all the things

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.090
that your app can do for them.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.960
And a lot of times
it sits unused.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.400
So how do you get users to
reengage once the app is there?

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.675
Now, for us and Google
and the Search team,

00:09:27.675 --> 00:09:31.240
this actually sounds like
kind of a familiar problem.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.120
We've seen this one before.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.630
If we go back in time, way
back to ancient history,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.500
in 1998, here is a graph
of the number of websites

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.670
that were out there.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:45.535
And there were about a
million websites in 1998.

00:09:45.535 --> 00:09:47.160
Lots of great things,
obviously-- there

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.910
was huge growth to lead
to this million websites.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.790
But if you were creating
a new web application,

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.000
it was very, very difficult
for you to get discovered.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.171
Say that you had a fantastic
collection of cookie recipes,

00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:01.420
and you wanted to put that up.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:02.836
And, in particular,
maybe you just

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:06.230
have the most fantastic
chocolate chip cookie recipes.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.590
How in the world would
people find your site?

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.230
You could put yourself
into web directories,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.457
you could try word
of mouth, and really

00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:15.040
trying to generate
some buzz, but it's

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.910
very difficult for a user who
says to themselves, "I really

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.000
need an organic chocolate
chip cookie recipe to bake,"

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.180
to find you.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.880
And then along came Google
and other search technologies,

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.360
and it really changed the
equation pretty dramatically,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.639
where now all of
a sudden users who

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:35.180
needed that organic chocolate
chip cookie recipe-- that's not

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:39.690
very easy to say, by the way--
could put that into the box,

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.130
and if your site had the
relevant best chocolate chip

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.380
cookie recipes out
there, it would come up,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.350
users would discover it,
and as users used that, it

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.820
would come up more and more.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:56.930
And so we saw an explosion where
we went from a million websites

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.980
to over a billion websites with
just even more dramatic growth

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.170
because it enabled the
long tail of everyone who

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.500
wanted to create content
services on the web

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.250
to be discovered, not
just in a directory,

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.230
but in a needs-based way
where users could find you

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.480
by expressing their need.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.224
Now here's another graph.

00:11:18.224 --> 00:11:19.890
I didn't go backwards
in the slide deck,

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.160
I actually went forward, but
the graph looks familiar.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.000
This is the number of
apps in the Play Store,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.580
and, gee, it looks
familiar, doesn't it?

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.200
We've had, on the one
hand amazing growth

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.970
over the last few years
to get to a million apps.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.940
And on the other hand, maybe
there's a lot further to go,

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.340
and a lot more apps,
a lot more content

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.290
and services, that
can be created,

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.630
if we can allow users
to find those things.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.100
I want to submit to you that
Google Search is a fantastic

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.500
place for your app
to be discovered

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.390
and for users to be able
to tap into the things

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.890
that you're creating.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.030
And, lest people
wonder about this,

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.650
in fact what we're
seeing at Google

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.690
is that mobile users are
in fact coming to Google

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:08.040
search expressing needs many,
many millions of times a day.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.130
And we're seeing
incredible growth in that.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.910
So here's just one stat that
shows that-- that more Google

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.930
searches now are taking
place on mobile phones

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.070
than on laptop and desktop
computers in places like the US

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.400
and Japan and many
other countries.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.840
And this is just accelerating.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.010
Users don't just tap on app
icons; they come to Google

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.590
and they express a need.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.850
And we want to bring your apps
to them when they do that.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.030
Now, our solution
to this problem,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.940
and the way you could
tap into Google Search,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.195
is something that we
call app indexing.

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:42.350
And app indexing is
a pretty simple idea.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.820
What you do is, basically,
you change your app

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.860
to add deep linking capability.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.720
Deep links are
basically URLs or URIs

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.500
that point to each of the
different pieces of content

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.600
or individual services
inside of your app.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.630
And we have a lot of help
here at the conference

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.730
and online to help you do that.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.570
We have folks giving
box talks-- in fact,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.260
there's one right
after this talk--

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.590
that goes into kind of the nuts
and bolts of how you do this.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.870
We have folks kind of manning a
help desk out here, and so on.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.144
After you add deep
links to your app.

00:13:18.144 --> 00:13:19.560
There are a few
simple choices you

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.390
have for publishing your
app's deep links to Google.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.710
And then, on the Google side, we
do basically what we always do.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:30.350
We take those deep links and
we add that to our index,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.290
so that our index now not only
contains content and services

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.940
from the web, but
also from your app.

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.810
And then we apply our
set of ranking algorithms

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.440
to surface your app,
and in particular

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.340
the individual pieces
inside of your apps

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.200
that are most relevant
for a user's query

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.660
when users come along
with those needs.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.760
Now, even before any
of this app indexing

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.070
stuff, of course, if people
come to Google Search and ask

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.190
for apps, we're going to give
them the best apps of the kind

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.040
that they ask for.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.030
So, for example, if a
user comes along and asks

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.460
for cooking apps,
Google Search is

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.504
going to bring up a nice list of
some of the best cooking apps.

00:14:07.504 --> 00:14:09.670
This is something that we've
been doing for a while,

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.169
and one thing people
may not realize

00:14:11.169 --> 00:14:15.360
is that, in fact, there is a
fair amount of app installation

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:18.060
that flows through
the Google search box,

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.100
in addition to what's coming
through the Play Store.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.710
But more often,
people come to Google

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.110
and they ask for
things that they need.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:26.610
They don't know if
they need an app,

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:30.390
they just know that they need
animal-shaped cookie ideas.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.290
And who hasn't needed that?

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.670
And what happens if
the user, for example,

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.500
doesn't have the
Pinterest app today?

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.690
Starting from this side,
if the user says to Google

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.310
"animal-shaped cookie ideas,"
in addition to content from

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.620
the web and other apps, Google
actually offers an installation

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.900
offer for apps that have
great content about that.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.380
In this case, one
of the apps that

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.910
has great content about the
animal-shaped cookie ideas

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.540
is the Pinterest app.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.790
Once a user taps
that install button,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.990
they go through the
Play Store install flow,

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.640
and when the app
is installed, you

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.390
can see in the middle screen
here not just an open button,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.850
but that green continue button.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.380
And when the user taps
on that continue button,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.150
it in fact takes them not just
to the top of the Pinterest

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.750
app, but straight into the
content that they asked for.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:24.400
In this case, a lovely page full
of animal-shaped cookie ideas.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.900
And so the user has
gone all the way

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.484
through from discovering
the app installing the album

00:15:29.484 --> 00:15:31.400
and then getting to the
content that they were

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.780
looking for inside of that.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.950
Now once your app is
installed, then you

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.510
can drive re-engagement
through those deep links

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.580
that you've provided to Google.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.660
And whether users are
looking, in these examples,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.490
for things like a restaurant,
a craft idea, a movie, or any

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.640
of the other zillion things that
people come to Google every day

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.540
to search for-- if your
app has relevant content,

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.590
and it is ranked in the
list here, it'll come up.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:02.980
So you see here some restaurant
related apps, the Etsy craft

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:06.110
app, some movie related
apps, and so on,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.022
that allow users, by
expressing their need,

00:16:09.022 --> 00:16:10.730
to come back to your
app again and again.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.280
Now probably people have
heard-- because we've

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.300
talked about it a lot
over time-- that Google

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.440
uses hundreds of signals
that come together to drive

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.900
our ranking algorithms.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.790
And by making your app
content available-- visible,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.220
basically-- to Google, that
content and the characteristics

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.770
of your app are able to
influence the ranking

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.990
and to help users find that
app at the appropriate times.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.220
Now, that all sounds great.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.080
Or at least I'm hoping
it sounds great,

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.680
because I'm trying to give you
the best sales pitch for app

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.420
indexing that I can.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.100
But how do we know that
any of this stuff works?

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.760
One tool that we have
is something that's

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.360
called the search console.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.910
And back in the day, back
in my 1998-type graph,

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.540
this tool-- and actually,
more recently than that,

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.990
the tool was called
Webmaster Tools.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.750
In fact we've not only renamed
it Search Console to get away

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.790
from the idea that is
just for webmasters,

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.569
but also added a lot of
tools that are really

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.310
focused on apps, so that both
webmasters and app developers

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.119
can come to the search console
and get a really nice picture,

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:24.551
analytically, of what's
happening with your app

00:17:24.551 --> 00:17:26.800
from the point of view of
Google Search-- what traffic

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.699
is flowing from Google
that's coming into your app.

00:17:29.699 --> 00:17:31.240
And let's look at
some of the results

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.790
that some of our
partners are seeing.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.620
Now, it's early days, but these
are kind of some early results,

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.530
but really exciting
for our app partners.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.472
The Guardian--
what they're seeing

00:17:42.472 --> 00:17:44.805
is that, for users that have
the Guardian app installed,

00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:47.710
and that therefore are
seeing app links in Google

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.080
Search instead of
web links, they're

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.830
seeing a significant increase in
the clickthrough of those users

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.711
to go into the app, as opposed
to users to select the Guardian

00:17:56.711 --> 00:17:57.210
website.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.420
So a 4.5% jump of
that backclick.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.220
So a nice increase
in reengagement.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.060
Etsy, they've seen increased
traffic from referrals,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:11.550
things that are flowing through
Google to them, of over 11%.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.430
And Tabelog, who is a
Japanese restaurant app,

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.900
is seeing increased app traffic
to their restaurant pages,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.860
so kind of the
core content pages,

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.780
the core purpose of
their app, of almost 10%.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.470
So, again, early
days, but pretty

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.360
nice results for something
that's completely free

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.820
and that is easy for apps to do.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.394
So where are we
going with all this?

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:36.810
Well, Jonathan mentioned that
cross-platform is incredibly

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.200
important for us at Google.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.350
We understand that
your app needs

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.780
to work across these
different platforms.

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.620
And so we actually announced--
I think it was on Wednesday--

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.640
and began rolling out our
iOS approach to, or solution

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.260
for, app indexing.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.230
And on iOS we've started
sort of the same way

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.280
we started on Android,
which is we worked

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.400
with a great set of partners--
you see their icons here--

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.860
to do the initial launch.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.980
And we're just kind of
checking that, making sure

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.600
all the pipes are running
smoothly, and so on.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.930
And then we'll open this up
to everyone in not very long.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.800
I'm also very happy
to announce today

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.560
that we are opening
up app indexing

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:22.100
two apps that only exist as
apps and not as websites.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.920
So far, what we've
done is really

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.642
work on it with apps that have
a corresponding web presence.

00:19:27.642 --> 00:19:29.600
But there are a lot of
great apps in the world,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.058
and probably many
of you are making

00:19:31.058 --> 00:19:32.879
them, that don't have
corresponding web

00:19:32.879 --> 00:19:34.795
presence, that still
provide wonderful content

00:19:34.795 --> 00:19:36.580
and services for our users.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.110
What this project
allows us to do

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.090
is bring those apps
into our index as well.

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.360
So things like HotelTonight,
Visual Anatomy Free,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.560
and several others are kind
of our initial partners here.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.540
Here we're going to be launching
this initial set of partners,

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.966
again, just to get
the pipes cleaned out

00:19:53.966 --> 00:19:55.590
and make sure that
everything's working

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.010
within the next few weeks,
and then later in the year

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.632
we'll open this up for everyone.

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.090
And we're really
excited about this

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.589
because we think
it really will open

00:20:02.589 --> 00:20:05.630
the floodgates to
letting any app be

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.440
a part of Google's index.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.360
So hopefully I've convinced you
that a great way for your app

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.810
to get to be discovered
and reengaged with users

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.340
is through Google Search and
through indexing your app.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.730
Allowing users to come to
Google and express a need

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.970
to find the great content
and the great service

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.190
inside your app.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.790
We're seeing a lot
of effectiveness

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.190
here for app developers.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:33.990
It's completely free, and if
you want to learn more about it,

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.850
you see the link here with
lots of documentation,

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.972
and also the box talk that
comes right after this.

00:20:38.972 --> 00:20:40.930
Thanks very much, and
I'll bring back Jonathan.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.940
JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
Thanks, Scott.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.050
Thanks, Scott.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.580
It's incredible to
see all of this work

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.960
that Scott and his team are
doing to really bring apps

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.750
to life within the core of
what Google has to offer

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.030
the world-- our search product.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.950
Seeing apps as first
class citizens,

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:03.870
and searching all of
this great deep linking

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.590
technology across
both platforms,

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.690
brings the biggest
smile to my face,

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.010
because it just shows
this commitment.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.710
And it shows how
much more we're going

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.490
to be able to do in
this mobile world

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:17.450
when we really combined
the great power that Google

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:19.840
Search has to offer with
this wonderful content

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.199
that you guys are all creating
in these millions of apps.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:25.240
We're going to pivot now.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.670
We're going to
spend the last 10,

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.195
15 minutes or so talking
about paid advertising

00:21:30.195 --> 00:21:31.820
and talking about
some of the solutions

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.070
that Google is
bringing to the front.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.800
It's really aimed at making
it easier for all of you

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.590
from an advertising standpoint
to reach those users, to reach

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.070
them effectively, to reach the
high value users that you need

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.030
to, and to automate that
as much as possible,

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.910
bringing them into your app.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:55.990
Scott's history about
Google, about the work

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.380
that we did to really bring
websites to life, web search

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.320
to life, is an analogy that
I want to draw on as well.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.310
Because, if we think
about paid ads at Google,

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.840
we've generally
followed along with what

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.580
our friends on the
organic side have done.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.580
Yes, we do have our usual
church and state policies,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:19.300
but we've tried to
make the ads that we

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.410
show to users as
native, as integrated

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.430
in our experience as possible.

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.900
If you go all the way
back to 2002, 2003,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.770
this was the very
inception of AdWords,

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.454
of Search ads on Google.

00:22:34.454 --> 00:22:36.370
And we're doing the same
thing here with apps.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.990
We're essentially
following that history

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.300
and following that path.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.800
And we're using a
lot of the lessons

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.850
that we've learned
over the last 15 years

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.900
to bring app
advertising to Google

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:52.480
in much the same way that we
brought website advertising.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.770
This brings me to
app install ads.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.610
So we have app install ads as
an offering today across just

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:00.250
about all of our channels.

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.670
Between Search, Display,
YouTube, in-app.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.820
And we try to make it as
easy as possible for you

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.480
guys to create these creatives,
to get them distributed,

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.190
to get these ads
targeted and put

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.130
in front of the eyeballs
of the right users,

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.580
so that you're driving
high-value lifetime

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:21.170
users to your application.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.920
Perhaps the most
exciting announcement

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.570
that we've made in this
space over the last-- well,

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:29.720
I think since we even got
started in app advertising,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.280
is the fact that we are now in
the process of bringing ads,

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.970
Search ads, to the Play Store.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.300
We've currently been running
a beta, an early pilot,

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.422
with a number of advertisers.

00:23:42.422 --> 00:23:43.630
This is going extremely well.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.260
If you think about
it, the Play Store

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.580
captures the very
moment of intent

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.830
when a user knows that she needs
a certain mobile application

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.990
to solve a problem, the
task that she has laid out

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.330
before her.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.310
And you see a couple
of examples here.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:04.620
When this launches, we will
show at most one ad at the top.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.267
It will be clearly labeled
as such, as we always have.

00:24:08.267 --> 00:24:09.850
And, again, we're
seeing great results

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.560
both for users and
advertisers as we're

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.780
rolling this pilot out.

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.630
We're going to expand
the coverage of this.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:20.260
We're going to get this
in all of your hands,

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.930
really, in the next
couple of months.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.290
So keep an eye on this
as we roll it out.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.025
YouTube has been another
phenomenal channel

00:24:28.025 --> 00:24:28.775
for app promotion.

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:33.350
We started working with
our YouTube friends

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:35.790
a lot more closely
on this last year,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.710
and we really brought
some of these ads

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.560
to life around the
middle of 2014.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.790
It's still early days for
app promotion on YouTube,

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:46.490
but the results, as far as
our advertisers are concerned,

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.830
have been phenomenal.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.960
The engagement is
incredibly rich.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.610
The amount of eyeballs and users
they intersect with on YouTube

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.600
is massive.

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.595
And I think this next quote
really sums it up best.

00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:02.840
So Deepak is a good
friend of ours,

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.380
and he's the Chief Revenue
Officer at Machine Zone.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.650
Machine Zone is one of
the largest mobile games,

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.340
from a user and revenue
perspective, in the world.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.470
And if Deepak knows
anything, Deepak really

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:20.320
knows how to acquire users and
how to acquire them at scale.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.320
And any of you who've
done this, or who've

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.070
done it for a large
audience, know

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.300
that you need to really
embrace all of the channels

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:27.770
that you have.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.750
And Machine Zone and
Deepak really do that.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.170
They have tried just about
all of the channels that

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.360
are out there.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.550
So to hear this
feedback from him,

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:41.880
the YouTube provides users that
are 15% more valuable than he

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.490
can get from any
other video platform,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.620
to me says a hell of a lot.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.220
And this is why advertisers
are clamoring more and more

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.070
for access to this
great YouTube inventory.

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.060
We're trying to make
it easy as well.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.340
Because, as we introduce
all of these new channels--

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.874
Search, Display, YouTube,
Play Store-- the last thing

00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:01.290
you're going to
want to have to do

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.620
is sit there and
hand-craft your campaigns

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.790
to make sure they work for
each and every one of these.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.952
So our first step in
simplicity and automation

00:26:09.952 --> 00:26:11.660
is what we're showing
on the screen here.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.210
Earlier this year, we launched
the ability for advertisers

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:20.010
to extend their existing
AdMob in-app app promotion

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:23.040
campaigns to the mobile web.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.470
What we do is we
take all of that

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.442
carefully crafted
targeting criteria

00:26:26.442 --> 00:26:28.390
that you have so
carefully assembled

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:32.740
for your in-app promotions, and
we take it and we lift that up

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.880
and we drop it over to
the mobile web space.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.610
So we can find your
users that are roughly as

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.310
valuable at roughly
the same CPI,

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.140
but in the mobile web
rather than in-app.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.380
And this enables you to find new
unique users that you wouldn't

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.827
have acquired otherwise.

00:26:49.827 --> 00:26:51.660
And advertisers are
seeing stunning results,

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.600
if you ask me.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.490
Through nothing more
than a checkbox,

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.600
advertisers are
extending their reach

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.720
and are acquiring roughly 30%
more unique users with nothing

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:04.000
more than that checkbox.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.060
So as we started to see
the success of this,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.150
and we thought more and more
about automation at scale,

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:12.604
we wondered if we could
take this one step further.

00:27:12.604 --> 00:27:14.020
And that's really
where we came up

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.970
with this concept for
universal app campaigns.

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.100
Why stop with the connection
between the AdMob network

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.680
and the mobile web network?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:28.190
Why not automate this at scale
for as many advertisers as

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.770
possible?

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:31.280
Universal app
campaigns, which has

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.120
been in beta and early pilot
for the last couple of quarters

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.980
and is rolling out to all of you
in the next couple of months,

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.250
gives app promoters and app
developers the simplest way

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:47.170
to acquire valuable
users at scale.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.582
We're talking about
roughly three inputs

00:27:49.582 --> 00:27:51.290
from the advertiser
or the app developer.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:52.889
You got to tell me
what your app is;

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:54.930
we can go then and find
all the great information

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.570
we need to about your app.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.250
You got to tell me
how much money you're

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.949
willing to put into the
system, what your budget is.

00:28:00.949 --> 00:28:02.990
And then you have to give
me some characteristics

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.698
about the type of
users you want to find,

00:28:04.698 --> 00:28:07.230
but this isn't heavy-handed
targeting criteria.

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.380
This is like, find
me roughly users

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.690
at this CPI or this
target lifetime value.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.120
And that's it.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.422
We do the rest.

00:28:15.422 --> 00:28:16.880
And for those of
you at the keynote

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.080
yesterday, you understand the
power of the machine learning

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.920
technology, the artificial
intelligence and machine

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.916
learning technology,
that we have at Google.

00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:28.290
And we essentially take those
handful of inputs from you,

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.950
and we use our bidding
algorithms, our automation

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.130
algorithms, these massive
machine learning systems,

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.870
to scan across all of these
different networks between Play

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.500
and YouTube and Google
Search and AdMob.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:46.030
And we work to find the next
cheapest install, agnostic

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.920
of channel, that satisfies
that goal that you've

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.670
set out for us.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.150
The results have
been incredible.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:56.160
Advertisers have to do very,
very little effort here

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.570
and are finding that this
scales much, much better

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.720
than individual campaigns.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.390
Because they're able
to find-- the best

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:06.870
way to think about this is,
we can acquire a set of users

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:11.250
for you very, very cheaply on
the search side of the world.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.490
I think about when
those navigational type

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.470
queries come in.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:18.600
That's an exact match; it's
a very low cost per install.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.420
But then in order to truly
grow your volume in search,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.830
you may find that you
see a significant step up

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.610
in price from a cost
per install perspective.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.720
What Universal App campaigns is,
is it helps us spread that out.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.980
So we might find that next
tranche of cheaper users

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.100
to acquire sits in
the AdMob space,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.940
or maybe on the Play Store.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.630
And our bidding
algorithms can work

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.030
across all of these
different properties

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.620
to maximize the number of users
we acquire for you at the least

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.240
cost possible.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.210
We are incredibly excited
about what we're building here,

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.380
and we hope all of you
in the audience try it.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.990
One of the things that's really
a benefit to us at Google,

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:06.020
as we approach this
app promotion space,

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.150
is the fact that, for the
better part of the last 15 years

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:14.290
or so, we've been working
on ads-targeting technology.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.870
And we bring all of that
to bear in this apps space.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.110
I was talking about
our machine learning,

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.872
and the key algorithm that
we use in the ad space

00:30:23.872 --> 00:30:25.580
is something called
Conversion Optimizer.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.160
Very simply,
Conversion Optimizer

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.040
works to maximize the
number of conversions--

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.810
in this case, installs--
that we can deliver

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.180
to an advertiser,
given a certain price

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.020
or given a target
cost per acquisition.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.700
For the app space, we've tuned
those conversion optimized

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.760
models to take into account
all kinds of signals

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.450
about our users as they
sit on our platforms.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.450
So we can do these
kinds of things.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:56.900
We can bid higher
for users who we

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.770
believe are more
inclined to make

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.774
an in-app purchase overall.

00:31:00.774 --> 00:31:02.190
So if you're a
game developer, you

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.740
rely on IAP to
make a living, you

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.350
want to find users who are going
to spend money in your app.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:12.090
So we start to be able
to identify these,

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:14.930
and we know they're more
valuable and will bid higher.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.660
We can go even further, though.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.510
We can start to predict-- we can
actually do this quite well--

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:23.010
we can predict the probability
that a particular user,

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:27.779
an individual user, will
actually purchase in your app.

00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:30.070
I got to tell you-- when I
talk app developers and game

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.910
developers about this
specific technology,

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:36.550
I mean, their wallets
come out almost instantly.

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:39.340
It's like, well, if you can
deliver me paying users,

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.520
I'm willing to pay
whatever it takes.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.800
And this is the core of
what we're focused on when

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.710
we talk about app promotion.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:47.850
And we do things
like expanding reach

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.840
as well, if that is helpful.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.770
We can bid lower, but we can
bring more low-cost users

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.980
in if you want volume.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.230
The results are extraordinary.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.300
When we do this right,
campaigns that leverage

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.620
this technology
are 24 times more

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:08.310
likely to generate a buyer.

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:15.440
And therefore, the cost of
acquiring a buyer drops by 90%.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.440
Because, if you're interested
in buyers and only buyers,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.601
you're wasting a lot of
money bringing non-buyers

00:32:20.601 --> 00:32:21.350
into the equation.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.222
Acquiring users acquiring
valuable users at scale--

00:32:27.222 --> 00:32:28.930
isn't the only thing
you need to do here.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.845
You absolutely need to
understand your data.

00:32:31.845 --> 00:32:33.470
You need to understand
the performance,

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:35.650
you need to understand what's
working and what isn't.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.470
Because, ultimately,
it's you're were dollars

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.120
that you're paying to
acquire these users,

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.619
and you want to
make sure that those

00:32:40.619 --> 00:32:43.390
are invested the best possible.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.827
The thing that really
stuns me and my team--

00:32:46.827 --> 00:32:49.160
we've been out talking about
the importance of analytics

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.140
in apps for the better part of
the last four years-- and yet,

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.630
still, our surveys indicate
that only 21% of app developers

00:32:56.630 --> 00:33:01.160
actually use some form
of analytic solution.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:06.670
I have no idea how the
other 79% of app developers

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.390
run their businesses.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.650
So we really implore you
to use an analytic solution

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:14.107
of some kind.

00:33:14.107 --> 00:33:15.940
And I'm going to spend
a few minutes talking

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.180
about our analytic solution
for this, which is Google

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.940
Analytics for mobile apps.

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.210
Now, Google Analytics has been
working on mobile app solutions

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.880
for the last two to three
years, and they're really,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.900
really becoming quite robust.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.980
On the buy side now,
Google Analytics

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.370
gives you access to all of these
core app-user-based concepts--

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:41.450
things like lifetime
value reporting.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:47.050
In this example, you understand
the value of users in aggregate

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.810
as they spend a longer and
longer time on your app.

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.400
And eventually it asymptotes
to roughly lifetime value here

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:58.340
of about $9, but you also see
how that increases over time.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.140
Cohort analysis is
pretty interesting,

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:03.100
because it breaks
this down by days.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.780
A lot of larger
app developers are

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.320
starting to do things like run
TV ad campaigns in conjunction

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.540
with what they're doing online.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.310
And that's an
example you see here

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:15.530
where there might have been a TV
campaign run on the February 4

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:19.120
date, which is what's
driving higher retention.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.409
You need to understand
how external events might

00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:23.575
be changing the types of
users that you're acquiring

00:34:23.575 --> 00:34:29.210
and might be changing how those
users engage with your app.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.280
ARPU, of course
is a key concept--

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.420
sorry, average
revenue-per-user, or ARPU,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.501
is a key concept to most app
developers care an awful lot

00:34:36.501 --> 00:34:37.000
about.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.370
I want to know how much
value each user's driving

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.520
in aggregate.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.340
It also helps you think about
how you should be targeting

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.389
your cost per install,
because in order

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.550
to get a positive ROI
back out of the system,

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.060
you can't be paying more to
acquire users than they're

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.170
driving back to you.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.550
Jason Titus made a number
of announcements on stage

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.120
yesterday about our approach
in this mobile analytics world,

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.920
and I want to reinforce
those right now.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.730
Our analytics team
understands how important

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.570
it is that they remain neutral.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.580
And one of the key
ways to enable that,

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.080
and to show you that we're
really trying to be neutral

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.160
and to be agnostic to the media
you buy or the media you track

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.320
or the tools you use,
is we're continuing

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.790
to pursue an incredibly
transparent, open, and reliable

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:38.930
approach to mobile analytics.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.390
And we are committed to this.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.530
We are incredibly
committed to this.

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.830
Our mobile app analytics
tools-- Google Analytics now

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:55.960
supports iOS conversion tracking
across over 20 ad networks

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.810
that you see behind me here.

00:35:57.810 --> 00:35:59.640
So Google Analytics
integrates, not

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:02.260
just with networks like
the Google Search network

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.110
or Google Search
or AdMob, but also

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.820
all of these networks on iOS.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.260
And we integrate with a
number of these networks

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.560
on the Android side as well.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.750
We've got to stay open,
we've got to say flexible,

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:17.140
and we've got to be as
transparent as possible

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.190
to continue to grow
this vibrant ecosystem.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:25.730
Many of you who care about
tracking installs and value

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:27.760
across a variety of
different networks

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.030
use third-party
measurement partners.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.400
These are good friends of
ours, like the folks at Tune

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.180
and Kochava as well as Adjust.

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.060
We've been working very, very
closely with all these folks

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.080
and more to make
sure that you can

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:44.360
use these third-party
tools as reliably as you

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.250
would use Google Analytics.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.870
You can now integrate your
third-party measurement tools

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.930
tracking and reports
directly into AdWords.

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.490
And our teams have been working
with the brilliant teams

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.340
at these companies for
the past couple of months

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.420
to make sure that the data
that's being pumped in

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.740
is as robust and
reliable as possible.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:21.480
To summarize, you've got to
think about all of the ways

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.194
that you can get users
to engage with your app,

00:37:24.194 --> 00:37:25.360
that you can get discovered.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.480
Because remember-- there
are so many apps out there,

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.490
and it is so hard to
rise above the noise.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:33.570
Scott talked about a
number of incredible ways

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:35.680
that you can leverage
all of these free tools

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.280
that we offer you on the
search side of the world.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.770
It's amazing to
see how much we've

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.811
done-- it's amazing to
see our commitment there--

00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:45.770
but definitely think about all
of the app indexing techniques

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.320
that Scott talked about.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.910
Because users are
coming to Google

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:50.830
Search on their mobile
phones more than

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:52.120
they ever have before.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.680
And when they look for content
that you've got in your app,

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.690
you should be that top result.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.920
Remember that you can use
AdWords for app promotion,

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.740
that we're working to make
it damn simple for all of you

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.740
to reach as many users at scale
across all of our platforms

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:09.120
as possible while still
driving the maximum value.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.550
And lastly-- first, make sure
you're leveraging some kind

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.220
of analytics tool, because
you're crazy if you don't.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:19.200
And second, remember that we
have Google Analytics, which

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.060
is free, is robust,
integrates with a variety

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.400
of third-party ad networks,
and is available to all of you

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.430
today.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.900
And we continue to show that
commitment towards openness

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.264
and extension to embracing
our partnerships by showcasing

00:38:37.264 --> 00:38:39.680
that all of our friends with
these third-party measurement

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.010
tools-- again, like
Tune and Kochava--

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:45.970
can integrate directly
now into AdWords.

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.390
We hope you're as excited as
we are about all of these tools

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.370
that we've released
over the last few weeks

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.420
to really give you
the power to drive

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.456
your apps, your
businesses, at scale.

00:38:56.456 --> 00:38:57.830
With that, we'd
like to thank you

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.710
all for your time and
your attention today.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.020
Have a great rest of your
time at Google I/O. Take care.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:06.770
