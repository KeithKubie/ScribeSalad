00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
This week on Wheel of Science,

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.200
we're talking asteroids, right, Neil?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.910
You ain't talking about my asteroid, for sure.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.770
This is Wheel of Science.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.780
(exciting music)

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.500
Hey everybody, welcome to Wheel of Science.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.090
The interactive show where we answer your questions

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.080
about the universe,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.620
and by we, I certainly don't mean me.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.650
We have with us,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.020
the one, the only,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.420
your own personal astrophysicist,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.600
Doctor Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.570
What's up, Neil?

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.530
Church, how you doing?

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.280
Thanks for asking man, I'm great.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.700
Where are you beaming in from?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.560
From Vancouver, British Columbia.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.240
And for geographically challenged Americans,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.220
that's Canada, filming the last few days of Cosmos.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.480
God, you are all over the place, man.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.280
Would love to be you right now.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.340
Let's not get into your fantasies.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.020
Okay, all right, it's time to talk asteroids.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.900
Are you ready, Neil?

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.560
I'm ready, Chick, spin that wheel.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.980
Daniel Tickner wants to know,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.480
"What is the easiest way

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.750
"to defend the earth from asteroids?"

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.350
I didn't even know they were trying to attack us.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.920
What you wanna do is first find out

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170
that it's headed our way.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.770
Then as early as you possibly can,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.830
slowly deflect it out of harms way.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.930
Because if the earlier you get it,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.860
you don't have the deflect it by very much,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.400
and that angle accumulates,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.450
and gets wider and wider and wider,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.310
so that it completely misses earth.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.680
The later you do this,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.980
the more significant you have to deflect it so

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.330
that it does not hit earth.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.670
And if it's headed right at us,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.490
you have to deflect it the entire diameter of the earth,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.990
just to avoid collision.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.960
So the earlier the better in all cases.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.210
So how would you do that?

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.860
Well, one way is you can like paint one side

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.420
of the asteroid jet black,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.590
and that'll absorb more sunlight than the other side,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:01.910
and when that happens,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.330
it radiates at a different rate from one side to the other,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.230
and that difference in radiation rates

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.050
has a pressure that pushes it into a new orbit.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.010
But there's still issues at how much spray paint

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.140
do you need for this?

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.400
What would you actually take out there

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.480
to accomplish this?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.350
And these asteroids are large.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.710
The ones we're worried about are miles across, okay.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.570
And if your European, kilometers across.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.110
But that's a lot of spray paint,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.480
so what, is there another way to do it?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.990
Yes, you can send a space ship out there,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.120
and have a space probe

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.130
and park it near the asteroid.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.070
So here's the asteroid and here is the space probe.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.060
Just park it there.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.140
Now what's gonna happen is,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.120
the gravity's gonna wanna attract to one another,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.880
but you don't let that happen.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.700
You fire little retro rockets.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.710
So that pulls the, the, the space ship a little farther way,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.850
and then the asteroid falls towards it.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.960
And it's very steady,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.850
but it is in effect,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.760
a gravitational tractor beam.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.900
It's like a gravitational tether.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.930
And that way you can measure how effective it is,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.430
and how long you should do it,

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.350
and so that's clearly the best way

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.720
to protect earth from asteroids.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.270
So blowing it up Armageddon style,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.520
that's not a good choice?

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.470
No, in America, especially,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.370
we're really good at blowing stuff up,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.840
but we're not as good at knowing where

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.020
the pieces will land,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.480
so you don't know what effet exploding it will have

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.190
after you've blown it up.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.090
So what you're saying Neil,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.340
is Bruce Willis is a fraud.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.880
No, no, the way I put it is,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.200
if we are gonna blow it up for whatever reason,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.660
I'd send Bruce Willis.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.450
All right, Neil, it's time for another question,

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.280
are you ready?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.200
Spin the wheel.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.100
Mathew Vincent Liberto wants to know this,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.240
"When considering the asteroid belt,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.310
"where did all the asteroids come from?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.910
"I'm genuinely curious,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.250
"also, if there were an asteroid headed towards earth,

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.460
"how would it be made known to the public?"

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.590
Okay, Neil, so where did the asteroids come from?

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, first let me say where they are.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.010
Most of them are between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.880
Hundreds of thousands of them,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.670
and they're craggy chunks of rock left over

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.930
from the formation of the solar system.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.470
And we think many of them try to become planets,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.510
like planetesimals, and that,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.800
and the solar system back then

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.470
was basically a shooting gallery.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.860
And as they're trying to become planets they get broken up

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.520
into bits and pieces.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.340
So they're really the vagabonds of the solar system.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.930
So, what you're saying is it's space garbage, like Pluto?

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.210
Chuck, don't get me started.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.140
Okay, I'm joking, I'm joking, okay,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.130
how about the second half of Matt's question?

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.480
How are we gonna know that we're all gonna die?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.770
Well, all the movies always show governments detecting

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.950
the asteroid with some special telescopes,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.630
and then keeping it a secret.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.910
Excuse me, you can not keep the sky a secret.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.160
It is above all our heads.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.820
And there are countless thousands of amateur astronomers

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.370
with backyard telescopes

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.570
that look into the universe and find these things.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.340
And so, you realize that most comets,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.890
up until recently most comets

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.840
were found by amateur astronomers,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.770
and asteroids, too.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.760
So now we have specialized telescopes

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.780
but they're controlled by us,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.900
not by the government.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.840
So, yeah, if we find one,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.610
you're gonna know the next day.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.600
The next day, 'cause that stuff will go public.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.300
And then everybody will find out at the same time,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.170
very likely by the internet.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.960
And it is no secret anybody can keep.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.460
Sorry, Neil, I don't believe you.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.780
I got a feeling they're not telling anybody anything,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.900
Until next time,

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.730
and then they're gonna take that information

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:38.860
this is Chuck Nice,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.060
and escape on their own.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.530
from Wheel of Science saying,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.260
keep that asteroid.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.240
Or maybe that's just what I would do,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.930
I'm an awful person.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.270
Which makes me wonder,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.310
if we were gonna get hit by an asteroid,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.820
would you wanna know?

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.460
Vote in the poll on the screen right now,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.210
and see what everybody else thinks.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.320
Hey, man, thanks for being here.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.900
As always, it's my pleasure.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.820
Until next time,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.460
this is Chuck Nice from Wheel of Science saying

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.540
Keep that asteroid!
