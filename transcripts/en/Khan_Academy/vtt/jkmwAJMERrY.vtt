00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:04.930
Now that we have a reasonable understanding of why austerity is very difficult.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.275
1) There probably isn't the political will to do it.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:10.608
And even more, it might drive Greece into a bigger recession.

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:14.509
And we also understand why defaulting isn't an option for Greece

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.392
and we understand what a monetarily independent Greece would have done.

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:26.179
We can now get a good sense of what Greece is likely to do, outside any other intervention,

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.844
outside any help from other Euro Zone members.

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:37.052
In future videos, we will talk about why other Euro Zone members do have some incentive to try and stop Greece from doing what I'm about to articulate.

00:00:37.052 --> 00:00:44.127
So in an ideal world, Greece, if it had its own currency, would just print away and be able to inflate away its obligations.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:48.311
Also, if it had its own currency, and this is not necessarily a good thing to do,

00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:51.599
because it will undermine investor trust going forward,

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:57.350
but even defaulting would be an option, because they would still have access to their own currency

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.360
and then they could just keep printing and then lending to that government,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.730
then the government could continue to pay the nominal obligations,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.066
but since they're getting inflated away, in real terms they would become lower and lower.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:15.492
So what Greece, if it doesn't get any help from other Euro Zone members,

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:27.600
if it does not get bailed out in some way, what is likely to happen is that Greece leaves the Euro.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.733
And the actual mechanics of that, and it will probably go back to a new form of the drachma.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:43.703
And the way that that would actually happen mechanically is that they would declare a banking holiday.

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.941
And it sounds like a very nice thing like everything which had a world "holiday" in it

00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:53.259
but a banking holiday is essentially a forced shut down of all of the banks for some period of time,

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.891
over which they can do transition into the new currency.

00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:02.073
And so, entering into the banking holiday the Euro was the currency,

00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:08.114
and the money you had in your bank was denominated in Euro,

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:11.847
but exiting the banking holiday the drachma will be the currency,

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:14.986
and the money that you have in the bank will be the drachma.

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:19.976
And what the government will essentially do is set some type of conversion rate over that banking holiday.

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:31.414
They'll maybe say every one Euro you have will be converted into one drachma.

00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:33.761
And then just the exchange markets will determine

00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:38.066
what the actual exchange between a euro and a drachma is going forward.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:41.647
And so then everybody would buy and sell in drachma.

00:02:41.647 --> 00:02:45.181
And the government would also say all of our obligations are now in drachma.

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:50.369
Which would essentially be a default because if they told to their debtors

00:02:50.369 --> 00:03:03.365
that "we no longer owe you....[where is the number?] 356 billion euros",

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.598
or actually close to 400 billion or whatever the number is,

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:10.666
"we do not longer owe you 400 billion euros",

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:18.622
they are now going to say "we owe you 400 billion drachma."

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.883
Or they can even say, we're only going to pay you 200 billion drachma,

00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:22.577
or a 100 billion drachma. But no matter what they say,

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:27.390
even if they say they are going to give you a trillion drachma, that would still be a default on the debt

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:36.493
because these debtors, in order to fulfill these obligations, they were expecting euro.

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.398
And if you give them anything other than euro,

00:03:38.398 --> 00:03:42.950
if you give them strawberries or bananas or drachma, that is a default.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.305
So no matter how many drachma they say they're going to give,

00:03:46.305 --> 00:03:50.348
this would constitute a default on their debt.

00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:55.650
But the Greek people could actually then move on with their lives.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.210
And there's all sorts of crazy things that would happen,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.932
but at least now the government would be able to print its own money and use

00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:08.852
it to buy government debt, and continue to fund government spending

00:04:08.852 --> 00:04:12.684
and eventually inflate away its obligations.

00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:17.194
You could imagine a situation that, right now,

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:36.380
its real GDP is, let's say it's the equivalent of 100 drachma.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.149
And then by just keep printing drachma, the actual productivity of the economy doesn't change.

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:45.058
It actually might improve if money is printed, but you don't get to hyper inflation.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:51.124
Let's say over the next 10 years that the real GDP doesn't change,

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:57.062
but the nominal GDP, due to inflation over the next 10 years, becomes 500.

00:04:57.062 --> 00:05:07.531
Prices in general, ...so inflation, you had 5x inflation.

00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:11.009
Things become worth 5 times as much, you produce the same goods and services,

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.033
they are now worth 5x as much. But now, that debt that you have,

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:19.978
your taxes are going to grow with inflation because they are a % of your GDP

00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:24.715
but your actual debt obligations won't change.

00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:29.849
So in real terms, they'll be 1/5 as much, which all of a sudden, makes them sustainable.

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.457
Now, as I said, this is not a simple thing to do. And not a painless to do.

00:05:34.457 --> 00:05:38.946
And we haven't even started talking about the repercussions for the rest of Europe, and why this might be scary,

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:44.270
and make other people suspicious of countries like Spain and Italy, etc.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.976
And even in Greece this would be painful. Because you can imagine,

00:05:47.976 --> 00:05:50.909
you can imagine, we're already starting to see this in May of 2012.

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.611
The government will say every euro in your bank account will now be a drachma,

00:05:55.611 --> 00:06:02.268
but the people there they know better than just believing that a drachma is going to be worth the same as a euro.

00:06:02.268 --> 00:06:07.181
They're going to know that as soon as the drachma starts exchanging on foreign exchange markets,

00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:20.562
that the actual reality is 1 drachma is going to be worth something closer to maybe .6 of a euro.

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:23.981
Or .7 of a euro.

00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:26.957
Let's say it's .7 of a euro.

00:06:26.957 --> 00:06:31.190
So essentially by this happening, everyone's savings and deposits,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.646
in real terms, in terms of their global buying power is going to go down by 30% overnight.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.216
And the Greek people are already seeing that.

00:06:38.216 --> 00:06:42.627
They are seeing the possibility of a banking holiday, and a conversion to the drachma.

00:06:42.627 --> 00:06:49.369
And so that's why you have people waiting in line before this happens and trying to withdraw their euros.

00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:55.112
So people are starting to withdraw their euros,

00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:57.755
and if they have a Swiss bank account they can deposit it there

00:06:57.755 --> 00:07:01.343
or they can just take the euros and stash in their mattresses.

00:07:01.343 --> 00:07:05.711
And that by itself is a little bit scary. The bank's deposits are depleted.

00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:08.644
But remember, they have a fractional reserve banking system.

00:07:08.644 --> 00:07:15.145
They do not expect everyone to show up on one day and expect all of their deposits to be accessible.

00:07:15.145 --> 00:07:18.678
So this is essentially going to lead to a run on banks.

00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:26.393
And you're already starting to see this in Greece, and it is actually rational behaviour.

00:07:26.393 --> 00:07:32.025
If you think that 30% of your savings is about to swiped away because of this thing right here,

00:07:32.025 --> 00:07:36.464
I'm going to give you .7 of a euro for every euro you have,

00:07:36.464 --> 00:07:39.834
you would rationally go to the bank and get your deposit back.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:43.452
But because everyone is going to start doing that, the banks won't have their reserves.

00:07:43.452 --> 00:07:48.309
The Greeks don't have their own central bank that can back up the banking system there.

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:56.593
So this might lead to massive bank failures.

00:07:56.593 --> 00:08:00.832
And essentially, the entire Greek banking sector could go down because of this.

00:08:00.832 --> 00:08:04.243
And they don't have an independent central bank, independent of the European central bank,

00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:08.398
to kind of fight the fires the way that the Fed would in the US.

00:08:08.398 --> 00:08:11.942
So this is not a clean situation; it is not a painless situation.

00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:15.942
But, outside any help, it seems like the only option that Greece has at this point.
