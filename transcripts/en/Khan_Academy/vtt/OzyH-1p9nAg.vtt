00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.860
What I want to do is give you a
broad overview of all of the

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.180
wars that France was
in at this time.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.039
And then talk about in a little
bit more detail exactly

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.480
what Napoleon was up to.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.630
And his role in either beginning
or ending many of

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.300
these wars.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.080
So you might remember from 1792
to 1797, you had your war

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.330
of the First Coalition.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.250
And the players there
were Prussia,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.840
Austria, and Great Britain.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.080
I'll just write Britain
for short.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.820
And this was essentially
started by the French.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.920
You might remember, King Louis
XVI was alive then.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.440
He supported the war, because
he thought that they would

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.140
lose and maybe reinstate him.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.050
Or that it would make
him popular.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.120
The revolutionaries liked the
war because they wanted to

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.430
spread the Revolution.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.620
And you might remember it ended
at the Treaty of Campo

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:14.060
Formio in 1797, due mainly to
Napoleon's victories in Italy.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.960
At that time, he was in charge
of the Italian campaign.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.250
And the government
of France at that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.050
time was the Directory.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.490
In power to a large degree
because of Napoleon's ability

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.750
to defend them.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.230
Then from 1798-- let me do this
in a different color--

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.505
from 1798 to 1802, you have
the Second Coalition.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.470
Now you might immediately
see, Napoleon took power

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.050
at the end of 1799.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.310
So this war spanned some of the
Directory being in control

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.150
and some of Napoleon as First
Consul being in control.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.020
And here the players-- once
again you have Austria and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.680
Great Britain-- they tend to be
always at war with France

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.090
at this period, especially
Great Britain.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.960
And instead of Prussia,
you have Russia.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.090
And actually, just to help you
visualize what the Austrian

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.970
Empire looked like at this
time-- and the Prussian

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.530
Empire, this map doesn't
do it justice.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.440
Let me go down to this map.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.380
That's in 1810.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.450
Let me go a little
bit earlier here.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.050
This is in 1805.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.780
And I'll draw the boundaries
a little bit

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.240
bolder than they did.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.590
So this is France.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.940
These are the boundaries
of France.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.480
Actually, it was able to
take some territory

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.730
in what is now Italy.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.060
I could do the whole boundary
if you like, but I think you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.230
get the idea.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.180
But the one empire that existed
then that doesn't

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.390
exist in its current
form, was Prussia.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.400
Doesn't even exist at all.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.200
There is no Prussian Empire,
or Prussian nation, or the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.010
country of Prussia anymore.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.800
You can see there it had some
overlap with Germany, some

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.230
overlap with Poland, some other
countries, won't go into

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.680
detail there.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.930
Then you have the
Austrian Empire.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.760
Austrian Empire is
right over there.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.280
As you can see, it encompasses
much more than just the modern

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.890
nation or country of Austria.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.940
Then you have the Russian
Empire, which, give or take,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.610
looks not too different
than Russia today.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.570
But the big difference between
the world-- there's many

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.640
differences-- between the world
now and the world then

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.510
was that there was no
nation of Germany.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.330
You had a bunch of people
speaking German, but they were

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.400
divided into a bunch of
small little states.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.690
This map doesn't show it.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.960
Some of them were under Austrian
control, some of them

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.760
were under Prussian control.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.390
And this loose confederation of
German kingdoms and states,

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.250
this was called the
Holy Roman Empire.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.500
Let me write that down.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.610
And as Voltaire famously said,
they were neither holy, nor

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.570
Roman-- they didn't speak Latin,
they weren't Italian,

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.610
they were German.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.610
It wasn't holy, this
wasn't controlled

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.200
by a religious figure.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.019
And it wasn't an empire, it
wasn't a tightly-controlled

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.339
state that was kind of expanding
its boundaries.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.210
It was just a loose
confederation of kingdoms.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.630
So that gives you a
visualization of what the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.030
world looked like right then.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.945
So with that in mind, let me
go back to my overview.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.810
Right there.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:45.370
And then the Second Coalition,
in 1801 you had

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.550
the Treaty of Luneville.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:55.090
Once again, this was a defeat
of the Austrians, mainly due

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.350
to the military capabilities.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.270
Napoleon was now in
charge of France.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.070
But he led once again,
an Italian

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.970
campaign against the Austrians.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.240
This is his victory in
Marengo right there.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.700
I'll go into a little
more detail on that.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.850
And that essentially declared
victory on Austria, allowed

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.410
Napoleon to take more territory

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.650
along the Italian peninsula.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.910
You can see it right there.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.450
And then later he had the Treaty
of Amiens with the

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.630
British in 1802.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.150
And that really ended
the coalition.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.000
I guess you could say the
coalition ended in 1801,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.380
because Austria was out of it.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.610
Russia was kind of just
passively observing.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.380
They participated.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.690
But they didn't really give
or take or lose anything.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.120
And then I could say at this
point the United Kingdom,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.450
essentially I guess the best
explanation of why that it was

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.200
war fatigue.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.480
But we'll see that they weren't
tired for long.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.580
Because then in May of 1803, you
have the beginning of your

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.880
Third Coalition .

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.320
And then I'll go to a little
bit more detail about this.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.770
The Third Coalition, Britain
declares war on what we could

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.090
call the French Empire.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.300
And this isn't going
to end until 1805.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.200
So you can see, Great Britain
is essentially at war almost

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.170
continuously.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.630
There's a few gaps
give or take.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.760
But there's always
this tension.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.935
This is the Third Coalition.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.060
And once again, I could write
the United Kingdom if you

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.010
like, because they actually now
are the United Kingdom of

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.150
Great Britain and Ireland.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.750
You have the United Kingdom
in there, we

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.330
have Russia in there.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.975
And once again, we
have Austria.

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:45.010
And there were other players.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.770
There was Portugal.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.520
But these were the
prime players.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.700
And we'll see in this video
that this, the war of the

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.520
Third Coalition, really ended
with Napoleon being the

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.820
dominant power in Europe.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.590
And ended with him essentially
thinking that he is

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.560
unstoppable.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.330
So I'll do a little bit
more detail on that.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.420
This resulted in 1805, with
the then Emperor Napoleon.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.560
And we'll talk about how
he became emperor.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.290
But in 1805, Napoleon-- maybe
I should say 1806, because

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.800
this ended at the end of 1805--
Napoleon views himself

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.360
as unstoppable, as invincible.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.320
He got some good victories
that fed his

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.130
already large ego.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.110
So with this as an overview,
let's review a little bit of

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.540
the life of Napoleon and the
roles that he directly played

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.170
in pretty much all of
these conflicts.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.630
So the first time we heard about
Napoleon was in 1793.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:48.930
And I'll just draw
it right here.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.260
You're might remember, there
were all of these Royalist

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.770
insurrections going on against
the revolutionary government.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.090
And they had this bright
artillery captain in Toulon

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.160
who put down an uprising
there in 1793.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.510
He got some, I guess you could
say, France-wide, or

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.100
nationwide fame from
doing that.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.720
Then in 1795, you might
remember, the Directory was

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.770
trying to get formed in Paris.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.340
So this is 1793.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.660
Then in 1795-- let me do a
better color than that.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.160
That's hard to read.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.940
In 1795, he defended the
Tuileries by essentially

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.210
sending out that grapeshot and
mowing down people to keep the

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.549
Royalists from taking out the
revolutionary government.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:44.039
So once again, hugely,
hugely popular.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.650
So all of that was occurring
during the war

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.110
of the First Coalition.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.090
And then Napoleon was made the
general in charge of the

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.470
Italian campaign.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:09:00.520
And in 1797, he was essentially
able to end the

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.460
war of the First Coalition in a
victorious way for France by

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.770
defeating Austria and Italy.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.470
And that ended the
First Coalition

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:08.650
with the Campo Formio.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.900
This was Napoleon.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.340
Then, you might remember, OK,
he's this hugely popular guy.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.350
He actually started publishing
some newspapers.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.290
And he actually sent some
military generals to put down

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.310
further counter revolutions on
the part of the Royalists.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.490
So he became even more
and more popular.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.800
And the Directory was
a little bit afraid

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.580
of him at this point.

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.700
So they said, hey why don't you
go do whatever you want.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.650
And that's when Napoleon
left from Toulon

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.030
and he went to Egypt.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.090
He went to Egypt with his
visions of grandeur, where he

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.790
did all of the damage
down there.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:55.210
And killed and won multiple wars
against the Ottomans in

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.550
both Egypt and Syria.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:01.570
But unfortunately for him, his
good friend Horatio Nelson

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.710
destroyed his whole fleet in
the Battle of the Nile.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.660
Horatio-- let me draw that
in a darker color.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:13.370
So that is Horatio Nelson
destroyed his

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.540
entire fleet there.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.870
So they were stranded.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:21.000
In 1799, Napoleon was
essentially able to abandon

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.790
all of his troops and
then come back to

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.470
France on his own.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:34.040
So this is in 1799, Napoleon
makes his way back to France.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.760
And then we saw in the last
video, he takes power with two

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.400
of the directors as the three
consuls of France.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.130
But in short order, he is able
to declare himself as First

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.820
Consul in 1799.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.070
This is hard to read.

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:05.190
And is essentially the dictator,
or the authoritarian

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.140
ruler, of France.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.150
But all of while this was
happening, remember, this was

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.220
all during this war of
the Second Coalition.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.080
In 1798, he wasn't much help
in that war, he was out in

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.510
Egypt doing all of these
silly things.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.840
They were at war with Britain,
that's why Horatio Nelson went

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.370
and destroyed his fleet.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.780
But even after he takes power
at the end of 1799 or early

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.060
1800, they're still at war.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.200
So Napoleon, he decides
to take charge.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:40.850
So he leads the troops across
the Alps into Italy.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.140
And once again, this pattern
is emerging.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.460
And this one actually wasn't
very clear in the beginning

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:47.690
that it was going
to go his way.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.210
The Italian campaign, it
started very badly.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.300
But eventually, he was able to
win against, once again, the

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.590
Austrians at the Battle of
Marengo and Hohenlinden.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.550
I know I'm probably not saying
all of these well.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.640
But once again, through Napoleon
directly leading the

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.890
troops, he was able to end the
war of the Second Coalition.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.260
And then the United Kingdom, or
Great Britain, however you

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.990
want to call it-- many times
when people use the word Great

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.130
Britain it's referring to the
entire United Kingdom of Great

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.110
Britain and Ireland.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.880
If you wanted to be formal,
Great Britain refers just to

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.700
the island of Great Britain that
has England and Scotland

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.930
and Wales on it, while
this is Ireland.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.680
But I don't feel like keep
repeatedly saying United

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.100
Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland, which was now united

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.510
in the early 1800s.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.090
I'll just keep saying
Great Britain.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.780
But there was just fatigue.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.420
So the war essentially ended
with Great Britain as well.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:51.060
This is, as we said before, this
was the Treaty of Amiens.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:55.340
But very, very, very,
short-lived peace.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:02.300
Because in 1803, with Napoleon
still in power, the Third

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.670
Coalition formed.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.400
And in the next video, we're
going to see exactly how

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.260
Napoleon was able to once again
be victorious over these

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:17.040
powers to become essentially,
in his mind, invincible.
