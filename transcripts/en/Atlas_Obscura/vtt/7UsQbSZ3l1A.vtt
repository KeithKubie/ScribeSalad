00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:15.711
- We don't know exactly

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:19.120
what these ivory manikins were used for

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.710
but we know about 100 of them
still exist in the world.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.340
Many of them were made
in the late 17th century.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.270
And, most of them are female.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.280
I'm Anne Garner, Curator of
Rare Books and Manuscripts

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.513
at the New York Academy of
Medicine here in New York City.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.260
Today, we're gonna look
at some 17th century

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.730
ivory, anatomical manikins
that show the secrets

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.083
of the human body.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.300
There's something very
powerful about handling

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.920
these objects partly because
they're so mysterious.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.960
What we think is that they
were probably collected

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.740
as status symbols by male physicians.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.110
There's at least one account of a woman

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.200
who was walked through the
stages of her pregnancy

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.200
using one of these manikins.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.203
If you lift up her torso,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.060
immediately you see what's inside.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.923
Here we have her abdominal
wall as one layer.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.793
Then we're down to her
intestines which also come off.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.723
And behind the intestines
is the real money shot.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.570
You have a fetus.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.640
And, all of these manikins that we know of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.020
that are female are pregnant.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.960
There's something that feels devotional

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.350
about the way that they're positioned.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.610
They all feel very precious

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.400
and almost like votive offerings to me.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.100
And, by appointment,
you can come visit these

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.723
and see for yourselves
how delightful they are.
