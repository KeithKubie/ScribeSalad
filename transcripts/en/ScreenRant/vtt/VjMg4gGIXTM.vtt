00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.350
Casting a movie comes with huge pressure.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.360
The person in charge has to find exactly the
right balance of traits and talent in one

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.300
place in order to be successful.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.830
And a bad performance can ruin everything.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.300
On top of all that, the desired actor has
to be available, understand the storyteller’s

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.200
vision, and have chemistry with the other
performers on set.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.560
That’s a lot of boxes to check.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.410
And while a lot of professionals will have
a good sense of who and what the movie needs,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.870
some directors prefer to throw curveballs.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.080
Here are 10 Casting Choices That Would Have
Never Crossed Your Mind.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.080
The Rock, Willy Wonka - Charlie &amp; the Chocolate
Factory

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.080
Willy Wonka is an intimidating dude.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.080
Being a candy baron is tough work, so anyone
looking to get into the business better be

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.080
built like a brick shithouse.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080
The Rock knows this.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.080
And according to his IMDb page, Tim Burton
did too.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.310
The director had his eye on the People’s
Champion to play Willy Wonka in the 2005 reimagining

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.780
of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.541
Except that if you want to take a role away
from Johnny Depp, you’ll have to pry it

00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:48.541
from of his cold, dead hands.

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:49.541
And while the reviews about his performance
are split, there’s no denying that he was

00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:50.541
the safe bet.

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:51.541
It would be kind of awesome so see one of
those surly Oompa Loompa’s on the receiving

00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.200
end of a People’s Elbow, but not all movies
can be perfect.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.630
Al Pacino, Han Solo - Star Wars
When George Lucas set out to make Star Wars,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.780
he pissed off the entire universe.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.879
The odds were stacked against him from the
start.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.090
Production was plagued with budget issues,
destroyed sets, and casting was difficult.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.020
Actors couldn’t figure out if it was a serious
movie or one aimed at kids, and stayed away

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.159
as a result.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.620
Given how iconic the franchise has become,
it’s nearly impossible to imagine humankind’s

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.140
historical cinematic landscape without it.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.370
And Harrison Ford as Han Solo is an important
part of it.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.830
But in order for that to happen, a few other
leading men had to turn down the role first.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.710
And among them was Al Pacino.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.530
The actor says that after reading the script
for A New Hope, he was totally confused.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.590
Which is interesting when you consider he’s
starred in some of the most complicated movies

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.400
ever made.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.670
Joaquin Phoenix, The Hulk - MCU
Joaquin Phoenix’s resume is as diverse as

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.880
it is long.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.290
But one blockbusting genre is conspicuously
absent — he has not been in a single superhero

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.040
movie.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.310
However, somewhere between Edward Norton’s
departure and Mark Ruffalo’s appointment,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.720
there were rumors that Phoenix just had to
sign on the dotted line to play the next Hulk.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.420
The actor has shown extreme versatility, and
fans were excited to see what his complex

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.540
take on the character would look like.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.900
But alas, it did not happen.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.120
And we’re left forever wondering what he’d
look like as an angry, green behemoth.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.280
Christian Bale, Jack Dawson - Titanic
Be nice to your employees, because you never

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.030
know when they’re going to turn around and
write a book about you.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.400
Penned by one of his ex-staffers, a story
about a rivalry between Christian Bale and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.560
Leonardo DiCaprio made the rounds a few years
back.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.280
It alleges that the bad blood stems from DiCaprio’s
ability to swoop in and steal parts right

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.920
out from under Bale’s nose.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.750
He’s like the guy everyone pretends to hate,
but who is somehow still invited to parties.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.800
Apparently the rift has been growing since
the nineties, and when Bale thought he’d

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.170
landed the role of Jack in Titanic, he wasn’t
just wrong, he was spectacularly wrong.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.320
DiCaprio strikes again!

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.410
Nicolas Cage, Aragorn - The Lord of the Rings
Trilogy

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.010
These days, Nicolas Cage is the man of a million
memes.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.349
But before his hair turned into a bird, the
actor was being considered for a role in one

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.739
of the most unendingly successful franchises
of all time: The Lord of the Rings.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.190
Cage has spoken about almost playing Aragorn,
but not being able to commit to traveling

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.989
for a grueling three-year shoot.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.620
That’s not the only big role that got away
either; he was cast as Superman in a movie

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.720
that was never made.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.159
It’s a good thing the actor doesn’t believe
in regrets, because if he did, he might actually

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.540
have a couple.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.480
John Krasinski, Captain America - MCU
Before we start let’s get one thing clear:

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.280
we love Chris Evans.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.870
He’s a wonderful man.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.970
The best.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.569
So it seems wrong to even think about anyone
else donning Captain America’s suit.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.909
But think back, try and remember a time before
the MCU.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.880
It was simpler back then, and TV was king.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.099
For a show that seemed to contain so many
regular people, The Office was a ratings juggernaut.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.099
Stripped of all the things that make them
glamorous, audiences fell in love with the

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.099
cast of characters.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.940
The show proved to be an effective launching
pad for John Krasinski, who then auditioned

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.060
to play the first Avenger.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:24.000
He even got to try on the suit before having
his dreams ground to dust by Evans.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.529
Robin Williams, Jack Torrance - The Shining
In his quest to take the story from page to

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:35.219
screen, Stanley Kubrick considered several
actors in casting the lead role for 1980’s

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.569
The Shining.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.819
The character of Jack Torrance needed to have
a certain energy, but not be too energetic.

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.960
And he’d recently heard of this guy named
Robin Williams.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.669
After seeing some of Williams’ performances
on episodes of Mork and Mindy, the director

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.680
decided against casting the exuberant comedian.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.129
He wanted energy, but not that much.

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.409
So Jack Nicholson wasn’t the first choice,
but that doesn’t mean he wasn't the perfect

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:59.409
choice.

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.300
And delivered a performance iconic in its
own right.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.240
It’s hard to know how the casting would
have altered the trajectory of Williams’

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.649
career, but audiences did have a few opportunities
to see the actor in some serious fare before

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:13.119
his untimely passing in 2014.

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:16.300
Jack Black, The Green Lantern - The Green
Lantern

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.159
Imagine a world in which 2011’s The Green
Lantern wasn’t funny by accident, like Daredevil.

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:28.369
But funny on purpose, like Deadpool.

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:31.129
Now imagine Jack Black as the leading man.

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:34.080
The vision you’re having right now was almost
a reality.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.439
Black was attached to an earlier version of
a Green Lantern script written by comedy legend

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.419
and SNL alumni Robert Smigel.

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.789
The actor argued that the studio was hesitant
to mess with the “zillion dollar formula”

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:49.539
they use to create superhero movies, and the
project was thrown in the trash in favor of

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.740
a more serious approach.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:06:01.029
Tom Cruise, Tony Stark - Iron Man
At this point it should be pretty clear to

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.219
anyone paying attention that Robert Downey
Jr. was born to play Iron Man.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.509
The fast-talkin’ smooth operator is a character
right up his alley, and the fact that Tony

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.770
Stark’s kind of a dick is just a bonus for
everyone watching.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.629
So obviously the big screen adaptation of
the character was written for RDJ, right?

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:18.629
Wrong.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.610
For years, Tom Cruise was attached to the
project in it’s early development, but wasn't

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.319
feeling it after he saw the character evolving.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.259
Cruise gave a somewhat recent interview in
which he explained that, as an actor, he prefers

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.879
to “make a different kind of movie”.

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:38.410
Nicole Kidman &amp; Johnny Depp - Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith
Because of the dramatic rumors swirling around

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.210
during the time of filming, it’s impossible
to picture Mr. and Mrs. Smith being played

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.319
by anyone other than Brad Pitt and Angelina
Jolie.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.550
It was the beginning of Brangelina.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.559
That might not seem like a big deal now, but
back in the day it was headline news.

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.270
And it almost didn’t happen.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.080
Pitt had been loosely attached to the project
for a while, but Jolie stepped into the role

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.919
only after Nicole Kidman dropped it.

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:03.759
Johnny Depp was in talks with production as
well, but decided that he didn’t have the

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:04.759
time.

00:07:04.759 --> 00:08:03.460
Considering Depp starred in 13 movies between
2000 and 2005, we’re inclined to agree.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.639
