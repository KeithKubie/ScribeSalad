00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:08.764
- [Voiceover] The three Serra sculptures

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:12.119
in this gallery were conceived
and built for this room.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:14.719
They were brought in
through a 40 foot door

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.545
that open onto the empty
lot next to the museum.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:20.851
Each weights between 100 and 200 tons.

00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:23.385
This one called "Band"

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:26.195
snakes horizontally for more than 70 feet.

00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:28.408
- [Voiceover] This piece
unfolds its curvature

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:29.751
in a new template.

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.833
It has nothing to do
with any of the pieces

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.300
that have come before.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.068
It's totally different vocabulary.

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:38.652
What I'd like you to do
is walk the entire piece.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.360
You can walk inside and
outside continuously

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.058
if you'd like and never stop.

00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:45.350
- [Voiceover] There are four volumes.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.358
They move in and out, and
the piece moves in and out.

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:49.499
There's a shift between inside and outside

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.074
that seems continuous.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:52.963
There are some spaces when you go into,

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.234
you think you've been in before,

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.529
but you realize you haven't.

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:57.079
You sense that they're similar,

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.273
but they're all dissimilar.

00:00:58.273 --> 00:01:01.553
It's difficult to one
space from the other.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.466
The entire sheet of steel,

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:08.634
as it ungulates though the
space changes continuously,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:13.168
and its interior exterior
is continually exchanging.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:15.772
- [Voiceover] Serra
says that the sculpture

00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:19.047
creates new spaces within
the architecture of the room.

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:20.327
- [Voiceover] Look, if
this room were empty

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:23.296
it's like a field of space
bounded by these walls.

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:26.075
Then, when you walk
into a piece like this,

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:28.518
you're just dealing with
the sculpture volume,

00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:30.855
not the volume of the
architecture of this room.

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:33.174
- [Voiceover] Serra worked out "Band"

00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:36.437
in a series of inch to a
foot scale lead models.

00:01:36.437 --> 00:01:37.904
- [Voiceover] I built "Band" in models for

00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:40.717
about three years, and then
I built it in steel mill,

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:41.864
and then I went to look at it.

00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:44.799
It was definitely a new experience,

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.054
and I didn't know what to make
of it for a couple of days.

00:01:49.207 --> 00:01:50.456
It wasn't a questions of quality.

00:01:50.456 --> 00:01:53.802
I didn't understand the space
of it. That surprised me.

00:01:54.817 --> 00:01:56.303
- [Voiceover] Finally,
Serra felt that he had

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:57.573
a grasp of this sculpture,

00:01:57.573 --> 00:01:59.338
and it's newly created form.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.109
- [Voiceover] Thought it was
better than I thought it was.

00:02:02.493 --> 00:02:04.446
I've been looking at 40 years of work.

00:02:04.446 --> 00:02:06.016
You make distentions, and I think this is

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:08.718
as interesting as
anything else in the show.

00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:10.403
- [Voiceover] Serra was asked if "Band"

00:02:10.403 --> 00:02:12.140
would lead him in new directions.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.533
- [Voiceover] I think it
all ready has, you know.
