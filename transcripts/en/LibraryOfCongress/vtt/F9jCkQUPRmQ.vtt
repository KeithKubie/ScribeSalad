00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.080
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: First of all,
thank you very much for being here.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.700
I'm very pleased to see
this amount people here.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.690
This is great, because it's
supposed to be a very comfortable,

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.780
casual type of interaction here.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.160
I will be playing a few pieces, and
I'll play some examples of things,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.420
but other than that, it's
really just a chance to talk

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.290
about what's going on,
and I'll show you some

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.090
of these very interesting
manuscripts that we have

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.170
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.200
I should say, first of all,
my name is David Plyler,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.520
and I work in the Music Division.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.170
One of my great interests
in music, really, is Liszt,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.030
the music of Franz Liszt.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.710
I've given a few talks
before, you might have known

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.570
about the funeral odes that we also
have at the Library of Congress

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.860
and the historical
Hungarian portraits.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.690
A lot of these pieces tend
to be late in Liszt's life

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.630
when he composed them,
and for some reason,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.770
I'm particularly drawn to those.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.040
What we're going to be looking at
today is the largest collection

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.740
of manuscript sources for
the third book, third year,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.370
of the Annees de Pelerinage,
the years of pilgrimage.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.370
The first two books came
out and, I think, the 1850s,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.220
although they were written in the
1830s, various pieces from them.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.750
The first one was the Swiss volume.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.180 position:56%
The second one was the Italy volume,
and the third one is sometimes kind

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.830
of erroneously called Italy,
but is it based on kind

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.770
of more spiritual types of things
in Liszt's life in the 1870s,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.920
for the most part, although
he continued to make revisions

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.860
to these pieces up until
their publication in 1883.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.550
It's one of, I think it's
widely regarded as one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.800
of his best late sets of piano
pieces, with good reason.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.140
They're very -- to me,
the very visionary works,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.120
and very meaningful.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.930
You can just tell that he
put a great deal into them.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.210 position:56%
One of the most famous pieces in
the piano literature happens to come

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.970
from this Les jeux d'eaux a la
Villa d'Este, which is, you know,

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.200
the fount of all fountains
that often came after it

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.900
with the Ravel and Debussy.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.810
That work, I will not be
playing today, thankfully for me,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.200
because it's a monster,
but it's a beautiful piece

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.300 position:56%
and a wonderful piece, but we do
not have the material for that work.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.510
What we do have are the materials
for the first three pieces

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.860
of the set and then the
fifth work in the set,

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.370
I thought I would just
take them in order,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.160
because they offered different
aspects of the editing process

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
and the sketch process that
will go take a look at.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.590
So the first piece, I believe,
is one of Liszt's favorite pieces

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.090
of his towards end of
his life called Angelus,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.780
and it's basically he subtitles
it A Prayer to The Guardian Angel.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.070
He made, I think there's six
different versions for the piano

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.080
of this piece before you get to the
final version, and there's also,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.740
potentially, two or three
versions for string quartet.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.600
There's also another version for
string quintet or string orchestra,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.270
and these all come into play
in kind of interesting ways

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.010
with the manuscripts that we
have at the Library of Congress.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.360
The one that gets referenced

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.000
in literature the most is a
copyist manuscript by a student

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.820 position:56%
of Liszt named Ricard Burmeister,
and he, at least that's what's given

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.100
to us in an unknown hand
on the copyist manuscript.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.790
So we think it was his, but you can
see Liszt's annotations and going

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.210
over it in this manuscript and
we'll be of the take a look

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.660
at that physically over here.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.990
We have a second round
that is never referenced,

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.400
at least that I can find, in the
same hand, Burmeister otherwise,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.790
where he takes the edits of
the first one and puts them

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.650
into the second version, and
it's getting awfully close

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.190
to the final version, but
is still not quite there,

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.560
and the different types of
alternate things that come

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.490
up in this particular piece tend
to be additions for decision

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.090
to make or repeat of an idea.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.890
This is a -- it's actually
interesting excuse me.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.190
I just need a quick drink.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:09.040
This idea that the repeat is kind
of central to Liszt in general.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.190
The way that he puts mature

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.640
out there often involves a
statement and then a restatement.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.820
Sometimes that restatement is in
another key or something like that,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.240
but it's kind of a central thing.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.250
If you listen to most of the
Liszt pieces that you like,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.550
you'll notice that there is
this type of developed repeat

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.790
or a literal repeat of some of
the expository types of material.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.970
What becomes interesting
is when these types

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:40.800
of repeats have an echo effect on a
more microlevel, or they have kind

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.730
of an insertion or
an elongation effect.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.030 position:56%
And so those are the types of things

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.290
that we'll see the
Liszt, in the Angelus.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.370
So first time just to play a couple
of these examples of the type

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.360
of material that are getting
this type of treatment repeated.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:12.510
So to give you context, here's
the version without the repeat.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:29.450
[ Music ]

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.910
So what wasn't repeated, which
is a little bit hard to know

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.750
when you haven't heard it repeated,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.030
was just this little
chunk right here.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.040
[ Music ]

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.510
So in the final version, he
adds -- he does it twice.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:52.040
[ Music ]

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.850
And then it continues on.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.110
So a very minor thing, but it's
the kind of thing that tends

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.920
to change the pacing
of the entire work.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.200
Another example of this.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.060
Another example of this
takes an earlier version

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.360
that was further explored,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.770
and I'm kind of extrapolating
what I think Liszt was going to do

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.910
in this version, and this is

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:24.180
where in the final version,
what you have is this.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:40.420
[ Music ]

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.510
So the part that repeated was this.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.400
[ Music ]

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:53.810
So it was originally not repeated,
and in fact, the harmonic rhythm

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.580
of the entire section that comes
after it was quite different

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.530
but the same harmonically,
but it's just more compacted.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.830
It sounded like --

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:13.180
[ Music ]

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.480
Something like that.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.850
The rest of the material
is obscured.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.200
Liszt crossed off all these
things are wrote on top of them.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.470
So it's not easy to tell
exactly what he's doing.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.760 position:56%
But an earlier version of this
piece, he does that sort of a thing.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.370
So that's another type of
change that you'll find.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.210
I won't lay this example,
but there are things

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:39.140
such as little margin
additions that come into play.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.180
So he'll be doing something and
then just do it again in the margin

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.290
as an afterthought, as another
repeated thing, but again,

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.280
it's the same idea, just
repeating an idea, a small,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.580
usually two measures long.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:58.690
Then we have a different way
of dealing with transitions.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.240
So here are a couple of
examples of ways that Liszt dealt

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.890
with a transitional
passage, or actually,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.190
the end of this particular section.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:26.320
[ Music ]

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.640
So that's the first one.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.140
It's in the earliest manuscript,
and he crosses this out,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.210
and in its place, but
something like this.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:55.160
[ Music ]

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.630
So that's close to the final
version but not yet there.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.010
In that copyist manuscript
is the second one,

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.890
he does put the final
version, after crossing

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.310
that which we just heard out.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.610
He puts that in.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.640
So you'll hear that in a moment.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.970
Another type of change has
to do with the repetition

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.560
of two-bar chunks, as well, but
in this case, they're chunks

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.090
that evolve in terms of where
the music is moving from.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.770
I apologize if I have to
go back and forth so much.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.310
I made versions of all the
manuscripts on top of each other,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.610
so that you can kind of see them,

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.710
but it makes it a little bit
awkward when I try to find them.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:55.510
Okay, so here's the earliest
version of this passage.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:03.120
[ Music ]

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.510
Here's the second version.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:15.100
[ Music ]

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.130
Now there are two very
important differences here.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.000
I mean, relative to some of
the other changes maybe not

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.350
that important, but I think
they're quite important.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:23.650
You hear this.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.950
[ Music ]

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.250
And the new edition is adding this.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:27.550
[ Music ]

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.620
So it just does something to the
spacing in the pacing of the work,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.450
and there's also a
difference comes into play

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.120
with respect to the voicing.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.540
So the octaves.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.510
So you hear this in
the first version.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.100
[ Music ]

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:47.980
You have this low bass
octave included,

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.510
and when he changes,
it goes to this.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.060
[ Music ]

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.960
So you lose that low octave,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.660
and I think that there's a
practical reason for this,

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.060
because Liszt was very much,

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.680
he always does the
octaves mostly for color.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.510
It's not so much about volume
or something like that.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.010
In this case, I think he ended
up liking that particular color

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:13.390
of the just using the one octave

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:17.350
because he was making an
alternate version for harmonium,

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.180
and so in the final version of
the piece that was published,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.220 position:56%
there's this one particular passage,
the biggest passage of work,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:30.060
where you have harmonium
option available.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.280
The harmonium range is not as
large as that of the piano.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.820
So it's been reduced, and that's
why it's given us another option.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.990
In the manuscript that we have,
one of the manuscripts that we have

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.700
at this, Liszt put in
three different spots

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:49.230
where he has alternate harmonium
parts that lose this octave

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:54.650
in the appropriate spots, and
so that's one of the reasons

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:56.760
that I think it's not there.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.110
One the other interesting things
about this I should say is

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.770
that both manuscripts that we
have related to Angelus say

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:10.140
that they're transcriptions
from the string quartet version,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:16.560
which is a little -- is probably
just wrong, but it also could be

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.950
that Liszt made several
different versions

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.370
of the string quartet version,

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.580
and then this particular
copyist was working from that,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:29.630
and I'm not quite sure which
it is, but the timing of it,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.870
the earliest drafts that come from
well before and they're for piano,

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:36.670
and they're for this
1882 draft that we have.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.600
But it's interesting that it
still kind of find its place

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.320
until its publication in 1883.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.310
You get this real sense of
the piece is not finalized,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.540
although earlier iterations
are beautiful

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:52.950
and quite interesting
and worth turning out.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.530
On that note, I should say
that are in if you aware

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.340
of the pianist Leslie Howard?

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.920
He is a very interesting pianist
and musicologist who did --

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.280
he's in the Guinness
Book of World Records

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.820
for doing largest solo recording
product of a pianist ever,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.420
and that is the complete
piano works of Liszt.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.010
That includes 99 CDs plus.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.040
So it's -- and he's still going
and doing on projects now.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.650
So I mean, I'm not sure how
he really got through it,

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:32.370 position:56%
but he plays through five of the
six versions of Angelus in that set,

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.150
and there are a few others that
he actually doesn't play some

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.400
of the alternatives that
we're going to hear today.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.740
So I imagine eventually he might
add another supplemental volume

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.040
to include these things.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.970
But he does, if you want to
hear these things in the context

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.630
of an entire performance,
it's worth checking out.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.510
Just so you're aware of that.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:57.920

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.990
They do. So the question was how
do you know which one is which?

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.290
The problem is that you have

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.120
to always update unless
you find a new one.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.590
But often, they'll use what
we call serial numbers.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.740
There's a new catalog
is been in the works

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.150
for 20 something years
that's coming out.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:20.600
But they have earlier drafts that
are definitely given as 162A/i,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.500
and so that way you can at least
add a -- by the third draft,

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.560
you can add a 3 or
something like that to it.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.930
So that's definitely
something that they do.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.580
So let's go ahead -- I'm just
going to give you a sense

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.500
of what the final version
of this piece sounds like,

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.750
and then we'll move
onto the next one.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:49.130
So this is the Angelus.

[ Applause ]

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.390
So it's a lovely piece.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.550
You can hear very
proto-Impressionist in some ways.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.930
Something that I left out is
these little details like this,

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:39.510
these two measures were
left out of the original.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.040

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.840

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.180
[ Music ]

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.830
So there's little details
like that that just kind

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:52.510
of have this very nice effect.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:56.660
One thing that is a hallmark
of this particular piano set is

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.150 position:56%
that you have a lot of these endings
that are just single-line gestures,

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.570
which may seem unusual for Liszt,
but as he was getting older

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.190
and into more religious aspects
of his music, they often tend

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.290
to be there, and often,
they're just beautifully done

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:14.250
and simply put forward.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.420
So we're going to move
on to the next work,

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.490
which is the most recent
acquisition for the library.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:24.740
It's a very exciting one, because
it's the -- for the first Trinity,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:32.240
which is a Cyprus Trinities, and
it was unknown before it came

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.240
onto the market that there was
this manuscript even exists.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.870
In fact, it's two manuscripts.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.730
It's a holograph manuscript in
Liszt's hand, and then you have

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.590
that represents an
early version of it,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.040
and then you have a copyist
manuscript with further corrections

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.350
and changes also in Liszt's hand.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:53.540
So it's a very different
kind of a piece.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.810
A very dark piece, and
it's -- so it's like a --

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:03.110
well, maybe like a dirge or
something like that is kind

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.110
of the more, other
way to describe it.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.680
Let me just pull it out here.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.520
So with this one, what I'm
going to do is show you some

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.970
of the main points of departure
from the original in this one,

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.830
and it starts to deviate
quite a bit.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.480
There was actually an entirely
new middle section to the piece

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.300
that people haven't heard, and
you can see why Liszt moved away

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:36.940
from us, but you can also see
how he incorporates elements

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.090
of these things that he ends of
getting rid of in other pieces

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:44.340
of the set so it helps to
actually make argument for the set

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:51.050 position:56%
of the whole third book is being a
-- making sense together as a cycle.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.560
So it helps to contribute to
that, just having these sketches

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.390
and these other types of materials.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.760
So on the first page of it,
there's actually a flap,

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.490
and I found some material
on the underside of flap

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.140
that gives a little bit of a sense

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.540
of what he might have
been going for.

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.560
So here's how it is,
this little passage.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.870
Here's how it is the final version.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:36.030
[ Music ]

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.680
Sets the final version.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.190
Here's an original
version that I kind

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:46.510
of made fit I think the way he
was originally looking at it.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:26:07.170
[ Music ]

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.660
See, hear a very different
descending line

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:14.050
and also a little slightly
faster harmonic rhythm there.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.790
So that's the first spot.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.020
So here's another way.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.900
He's transitioning
into kind of a very,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.880
another lugubrious middle section,

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.720
and it seems like he gets lost a
little bit, and he crosses this out

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.660
and eventually, he's not
expect anybody to do this.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.470
So this is really unfair actually,
because Liszt said no to this,

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:43.770
but I'm playing it anyway.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.130
So don't hold it against him
if you don't make something,

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.430
but there are elements of it

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.400
that are quite beautiful
in of themselves.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.010
So I think, you know,
we can veto Liszt here

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.510
and say let's hear it anyway.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:10.210
[ Music ]

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.510
And that's instead of --

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:21.180
[ Music ]

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:27.050
So it's like this extension.

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:32.930
Then after this big section, it
goes in a very different direction.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.230
So I'm going to play --

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:38.050
this is material that he didn't do
anything with, although it, again,

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:41.240
appeared later, and
we hear stuff like it.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.510
So after we've been building
up, it turns into this.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:28:35.040
[ Music ]

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.580
So I just butchered that
end part, but that's --

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.790
you get the idea that there's
this material that's being used,

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:47.050
and it sounds slightly familiar,
because he did end up using it

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:51.430
in the final version,
just a very different way.

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.030
So first of all, this --

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.040
[ Music ]

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.740
This new lead material
we've heard before

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.510
from the section preceding it, but
this stuff, where it's going --

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.430
[ Music ]

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:10.620
That kind of material is used quite
differently, and the way that --

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.920
so what you'll hear, and I'll try

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.810
to play this a little bit
slower see you can hear it.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.510
It gets turned into this
kind of massive buildup.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:32.850
[ Music ]

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:36.090
So this little offset thing
eventually morphs into that,

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:39.780
and it's role there is
transitional between sections.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.200
So it's something like a proto
idea that he thought of a way

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:51.550
to do something different
with that later.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.650
Then towards the end, we get this
gorgeous chordal section that goes

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.220
through the very end, and he had
several different ideas about how

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.130
to handle this, and
I'm going to pull up --

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.910
I'm going to do a combination
of the two versions

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.210 position:56%
that have been secured back to back,

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.060
instead of playing
the whole thing twice.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.960
So what's interesting
here is that --

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.290
I'll just play this little section

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.030
and then I'll play another
section that's slightly elongated.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:31:16.200
[ Music ]

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.500
Then it continues from there.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.330
So it's this really beautiful
thing that he rejected.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:24.280
So instead of that, here's a second
version had something similar

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:32.110
to that, but a kind of ending
at this -- as it moves on.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.620
Oh, here it is.

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.510
So just from the very
end of that, you hear --

00:31:38.510 --> 00:32:07.040
[ Music ]

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.150
So that's a very different type
of idea, and this is the second --

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.820
a copyist manuscript
that Liszt added

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.420
that in and then crossed it out.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.410
So the actual version of
that is played with it also.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.940
So you hear instead --

00:32:27.510 --> 00:33:10.040
[ Music ]

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.420
And then it goes on from there.

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.930
The last thing I'll show to you
about this piece until we get

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:19.530
to the end are these multiple
temps that he had at this change,

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.600
when I get to the 4:4 section
at the end of the piece,

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.110
which I'll just play a
little bit of what it turns

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.410
out in the final version,

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.510
and it just has this --
it comes to rest here.

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:41.040
[ Music ]

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.890
And it continues like this.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:48.000
You'll hear, in a moment, but
in the version that he did,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:56.510
his first attempt was this.

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:14.040
[ Music ]

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.810
It alternates between
those two chords.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.370
That he goes off a little bit
and it doesn't quite work out.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.510
So he starts over and
he goes to this.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:58.040
[ Music ]

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.340
Without the C sharp I added.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.980
So he's still trying to figure
out what to do harmonically here,

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.280
and I think that his instincts
were that you could do all kinds

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:11.590
of things, but maybe it was
better to be simpler in the end,

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.620
and so I'm going to
play through this piece

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.520
so you can hear what it's like, and
just know that there's just a lot

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:27.710
of depth in this manuscript that's
really interesting to look at.

Oh, sorry, so Aux cypres
de la Villa d'Este,

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.170 position:56%
or in this manuscript version, it
was the [inaudible] de Villa d'Este.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:43.140
So the cypress trees, and
then it has a subtext Trinity.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.500
So like an elegy.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.890
That's the word I was looking for.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:50.360
That's better than dirge, I think.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.600
This opening is fantastic,
because it has --

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.540
it's in G minor, but you
hear B flat to F sharp,

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:57.870
and that's how it's spelled.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.120
And so immediately,
you're playing a third,

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.940
but it looks like you're
playing a fourth.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:10.510
So he likes sets it up
so interestingly, to me.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:43:09.510

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:18.350
So I don't know if you caught
it there, but in the center,

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:22.100 position:56%
I tried to pretend like I was trying
something different in the way

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.310
that Liszt did in the manuscript

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:31.070
to give it a more realistic
-- yeah, I mean, maybe.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:38.190 position:56%
But yeah, no, he's definitely -- you
know, it's one thing you can tell

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:42.180
from the manuscripts is that Liszt
was, of course, a great improviser,

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:45.900
and sometimes, and this is what
you'll see in this next piece

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:47.380
that we're going to
take a look at is

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:52.470
that what he would do is basically
create a continuity draft,

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:55.170
where you come up with an
idea that maybe is not going

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:59.230
to be the final idea, but it's
stuck in there, so that by the time

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.900
that he gets around to
rewriting it or editing it,

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:06.060
he has a full kind of
section to deal with.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.100
So that is something that he
does in some other pieces.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.580
So the next piece we're
going to take a look

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.760
at actually has the same
name and our manuscript.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:20.360
It's Danse Epressin der Ville
d'Este [assumed spelling],

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.540
and ends up having the same
name in the final set, as well,

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.870
but it's called the second Trinity.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:32.070
So this one is quite
beautiful and quite interesting

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.660 position:56%
in a different way, and what we find

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:38.190
from the manuscripts here,
and this is a sketch.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.270
It's not a complete draft.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.020
There's another continuity
draft that's related

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:47.320
to this that's been recorded,
but not this section,

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.540
the sketch that we're
going to take a look at.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.960
But you can already
see that he's working

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.680
with different harmonies
and things like that.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.880
So that's kind of one of the
more interesting things coming

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.180
into play here.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.920
So for instance, from the
very opening of the piece,

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.770
the original way that
he had it was this.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:09.070
[ Music ]

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.510
And then in the final way it's --

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:18.040
[ Music ]

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:21.320
So the difference there is
that he puts and F sharp

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.560
in the base to then move down.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.510
That's the only difference, but --

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.110
[ Music ]

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.410
But it ends up having
this very different feel

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:32.210
to it when it starts --

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:36.040
[ Music ]

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.920
It's just crunchier
and more chromatic,

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.860
even though that's not
a whole step there.

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.970
So that's one of the
things that comes into play.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:45.240
Also, I should mention
this all along,

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:49.250
is that there's this thematic
transformation is happening

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.420
with these very simple
melodies throughout,

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.510
and so in the final version,
the one that matters here is --

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.040
[ Music ]

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.840
And then eventually you hear.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.100
[ Music ]

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.300
Just an extension of that idea,
but in the initial drafts,

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.600
Liszt had a very different idea.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.510
He changed that melodic
line to this.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:16.460
[ Music ]

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.760
So it's not that -- does leap down
and then a chromatic scale up.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.460
It's a very interesting other
type of alternative melody,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.260
and then that leads into some
different kind of material,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.510
and the final version we hear --

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:36.340
[ Music ]

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.640
In this one, we hear this.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.510
The first, early version,
we hear this.

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:51.340
[ Music ]

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.660
There's nothing inherently better
about what he ended up with.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:58.230
In fact, that one has a
resolution, more dissonance to it,

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.900
it's kind of interesting.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:02.980
You would say more
interesting in the abstract

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.410
that maybe didn't quite
fit the way he wanted it

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.560
to than the actual piece.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:11.510
He then turns that, what was --

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.040
[ Music ]

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.510
That idea gets turned into a
bigger one when it comes back.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:22.360
[ Music ]

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.610
And the same thing.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.630
So that same kind of
different way of dealing

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:33.060
with those chords comes into play.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:40.510
When he starts -- introduces
another theme --

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:59.320
[ Music ]

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.620
That's how he ends up.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:07.510
That's where he ends up, but in
the original version, it's this.

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:42.640
[ Music ]

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.850
So we lose a couple of measures,

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:47.210
and the harmonic rhythm is
very different also there.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.960
So that's one of the changes, and
then we have the next section,

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.690
another substantial type of change.

00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:56.510
Here's how it was originally
in the early manuscripts.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:11.040
[ Music ]

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.010
And so forth.

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:16.450
Next doing -- this is a weird
thing to turn the pages for.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.730
So kudos to Nick.

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:20.070
Thank you.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.870
In the final version, it's this.

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:39.130
[ Music ]

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:41.250
So it's a bit fuller, more chords,

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:46.650
and a little bit more
ostentatious, if you will.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.660
Then in the -- at the
end of that section,

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.510
he keeps it very simple
in the final version.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:59.120
[ Music ]

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.510
But in the original
version it was this.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:17.450
[ Music ]

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:20.510
So quite a different harmonic
setting of that same material,

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:25.210 position:56%
which I think is kind of fascinating
to see, but he moved away from that.

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:29.280 position:56%
Then we get this kind of not bizarre
section but one that's often hard

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.510
to make heads or tails out of
with these arpeggios that go up.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:41.040
[ Music ]

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.430
I think they're meant to go up to
the top and kind of spill down.

00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:48.510
In the original version,
what we have is this.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:57.560
[ Music ]

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.500
So the foreshortened version,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:06.510
and then kind of a very
simplified moving on.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:15.040
[ Music ]

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.140
Now this transition, where
it's going from this,

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.040
and I have to play
these back to back seat

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:23.510
and here they sound
like -- it goes to this.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:49.050
[ Music ]

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:51.450
When we hear the full thing, we
hear that list actually expands

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.520 position:56%
that entire section, but by the
time it gets to that similar passage

00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.600
that we just heard, he's changed
it quite a bit into this very kind

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.560
of hauntingly beautiful
idea, and that's, again,

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.540
it's all based on that same thing.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.510
Same idea.

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:32.040
[ Music ]

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.880
So it's added a contrapuntal
line, as well.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:39.010
So it's a very interesting
change that he makes there.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.020
He does the same thing
with the repeated section.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.510
Remember I said lots of
these things come in two

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:51.740
with the different versions,
and then we lose a big chunk,

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.510
where he just goes into
different territory,

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:57.510 position:56%
and this territory sounds like this.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:23.240
[ Music ]

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.510
And then it moves into what you
think is going to be B major.

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:34.160
[ Music ]

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:35.460
I checked the manuscript,

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.990
and it definitely has the
four sharps, A natural there.

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:44.580
So that's a similar treatment that
you heard earlier in that version.

00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:51.510
In the version that he ends up
with, sounds more like this.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:54:05.300
[ Music ]

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:07.480
So the role of the
tremolo is reversed.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.180
So in this case, now you
have the melody in the bass

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.950
and the tremolo on the right hand.

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:14.530
Whereas, originally,
they were opposite.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.970
The last thing I think I'll show

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:25.510
about this particular
version is another interesting

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:27.810
harmonic revival.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.510
So after this passage of this
figure stuff get done, it goes.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:50.150
[ Music ]

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:52.510
And the second one again is --

00:54:52.510 --> 00:55:04.320
[ Music ]

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:07.770
And then, after this point,
it just kind of drifts away.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.890
There's a little bit of arpeggios
stuff, and then it just kind

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:12.620
of goes away, and we're close
to the end of the piece,

00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:14.160
but it's just not quite the end.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.880
So now I'm going to
play through this one.

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.720
You can hear with the
final version is.

00:55:36.510 --> 01:05:21.510
[ Music ]

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:28.070
[ Applause ]

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:29.460
Thank you.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:30.900
So the last piece we'll
take a look at --

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.100
first of all, you'll notice that it
again had that single-line ending,

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.410
which is just kind of an
inspired stroke there,

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:41.540
but it's also something that keep
consistent throughout the piece

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.030
as a whole.

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:45.290
This last piece that I'm going
to play, which is the last one

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:48.150
that we have, is the
fifth in the series.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.790
It's last one we have
manuscript material for.

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:55.780
It deviates quite significantly
from what the final version is.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.800
So I'll play passages here that
are just completely different.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.690
It also dates earlier.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:06.410
I believe 1867 might be
around the first draft,

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:12.270
but it's not quite clear when
it was, but it's another type

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:19.510 position:56%
of trinity basically, but this
time, the title Sunt Lacrimae Rerum,

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.920
There are Tears for These Things.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:27.310
And he says it's in a Hungarian
mode, and most likely referring

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:33.950
to the 1848/1849 revolution
and also the types of friends

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:36.570
that he lost at that time.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:38.690
One reason that it's a
definite tie in for that is

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.950
that the historical Hungarian
portraits that he wrote

01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:45.140
around in the 1870s,
a little bit later,

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:48.400
also very specifically named
these people, some of whom died

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.550
in the revolution, and then he also
uses some of the similar material,

01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:56.970
if not the same, in certain spots.

01:06:56.970 --> 01:07:00.640
So that's one way we kind
of hear what's going on.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.700
So I'll just play a couple
major different [inaudible]

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:05.000
in the final version.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:46.270
[ Music ]

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.500
And it comes back to it there.

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.800
Again, Liszt crossed this out.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:54.270
So he doesn't want you to hear
it, but we played it anyway.

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:58.080
So in the original, it doesn't
have that whole section.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.590
This idea that is here
is side by side.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.510
In the original version,
we hear this.

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:16.180
[ Music ]

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.980
The final version, we hear this.

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:31.040
[ Music ]

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:33.970
So we have an extension
by a measure.

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:39.730 position:56%
This happens three other places with
similar types of ideas like that.

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:41.450
I will play them for
you, but that is --

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:45.120
these are additions that he
made in the later versions,

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:51.530
as opposed to subtractions.

01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:54.060
So [inaudible] to do that.

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:57.510
There are little differences
that you find --

01:08:57.510 --> 01:09:03.010
[ Music ]

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:04.810
You really fast repetitions, where
in the final version, it's --

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:08.060
[ Music ]

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:10.280
Just little things like
that, that means more

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:11.580
to the pianist that it's changed.

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.030
So it's a little easier to
play in the later version.

01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:19.050
So he was kind there at least, and
then you have this really strange,

01:09:19.050 --> 01:09:22.840
tumultuous, low area that ends in
a cadenza in the original version,

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.000
and here's what that sounds like.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.510
I won't give away the nice
surprises in the original but --

01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:57.040
[ Music ]

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:59.540
And then he actually has
an alternate version,

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:03.510
and I'll just play the
end of that, which is --

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:16.080
[ Music ]

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.300
And so that's very different
from the final version,

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:21.950
which you'll hear what he
does differently there.

01:10:21.950 --> 01:10:25.760
Then we get to the
more Hungarian section,

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.530 position:56%
which has a very boring
accompaniment part at the beginning.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.510
At least that's my opinion.

01:10:31.510 --> 01:11:05.740
[ Music ]

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.970
It kind of continues like that.

01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:10.580
Some differences from the
original, which you'll hear,

01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:12.760
or the final, which you'll hear.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.510
Then we have another type
of change, which is this.

01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:33.040
[ Music ]

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:37.510
Then it continues something
like this.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:49.040
[ Music ]

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.310
It continues on, just
keeping that same basic --

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:53.600
[ Music ]

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.900
But I can't see it underneath.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:57.850
It's something like that.

01:11:57.850 --> 01:11:59.150
Then he gives up on that.

01:11:59.150 --> 01:12:00.450
I don't think he actually
gives up on it.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.310
I think he just covers it up
with the music that you hear,

01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:08.290
and then you get to this very
wild ending, which is harder --

01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:09.820
well, I shouldn't say that.

01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:11.120
I'll jinx myself.

01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.950
But harder, in some ways, then
the final version that he did.

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:15.870
He definitely has these
triplets in the right-hand,

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:19.510
as opposed to [inaudible]
in the final version.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:13:45.720
[ Music ]

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:49.130
That's how he ends the piece.

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:51.130
You'll hear that it's quite
different than what he ends

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:55.430
up going for, and actually,
it seems a bit more positive

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:57.180
than what he finally
ends up going with.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.760
The last thing I want to do
is I'm just going to play

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.330
through this piece, and I
personally want to thank everybody

01:14:03.330 --> 01:14:07.440
for being here, and afterwards,
I'll be happy to show you some

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:10.450
of the manuscript items that
we have up here and turn pages

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.750
for you and stuff like that.

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:13.940
So it's kind of part of the point
is just to get a chance to look

01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:16.180
at the actual things and see how --

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:19.640
what kind of adaptations
I've made from them.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.940
All right, thanks.

01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:31.510
So this is Sunt Lacrimae Rerum.

01:14:31.510 --> 01:21:14.510
[ Music ]

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:19.040
[ Applause ]

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.340
Thank you.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:28.330
So thanks again for coming, and
that was kind of a strange ending.

01:21:28.330 --> 01:21:31.170
We can talk about that, too,
but why don't you come on up

01:21:31.170 --> 01:21:35.780
and take a look at the manuscript.

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:39.470

of Library of Congress.
