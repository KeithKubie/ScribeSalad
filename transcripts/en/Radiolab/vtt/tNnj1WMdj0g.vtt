00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.230
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.130
Radiolab and we're still talking about certainty versus doubt.

3
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:09.650
And in this final story, the two once again collide,

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.180
but this time it's in a way that's almost unimaginable.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.090
<v 1>I remember running along a railroad track,</v>

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.630
a seldom used railroad track, but just thinking, God,

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.800
it would be a blessing if a train just came along in front of me. It was like

8
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.100
<v 0>we need to warn you now if there are younger sensitive listeners listening right</v>

9
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:34.870
now, this next piece depicts graphic violence and it can be pretty disturbing.

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.320
So if you're listening with kids, uh,

11
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.660
this would be a good time to ask them to leave the room or a to for you to put

12
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:44.880
on headphones. This piece comes from our producer Pat Walters.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.070
I guess we could just start at the beginning. So could you just, I don't know,

14
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:54.780
set the scene. It was 1985. Yes, it was 1985.

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.310
Um, so this is penny penny Burnson and in 1985 penny and her husband Tom,

16
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.300
I'm here with living in Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Michigan in a little

17
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.360
town called Manitowoc.

18
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.300
On a small third generation family business and what kind of business was that?

19
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.610
Bernstein's candies are open seven days a week,

20
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:13.980
10 to ten three hundred sixty three days a year.

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.060
But sometimes in the summer opinion time would cut out early and go to the

22
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.260
beach. That's where we went that day. July 29th,

23
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.440
1985 blue skies probably in the seventies perfect day to be at the beach with

24
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.130
your family.

25
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.760
They parked the car two three o'clock in the afternoon and set up camp near the

26
00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:34.560
water and I was reading a book about Lizzie Borden, the infamous x murderer,

27
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.630
but after about like an hour of reading this book,

28
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:38.580
Penny set it down and said to my husband,

29
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.770
I can't believe I'm reading this gruesome book. On a beautiful day,

30
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:43.950
I'm going to go for a jog, penny peds north along the water.

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.550
And when I was within about half a mile of my starting point,

32
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:51.960
there was a guy standing with a leather jacket slung over his shoulder and as I

33
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
jog by, he said, it's a great day. I glanced at him and said,

34
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.590
it's a beautiful day for a jog. It didn't really think anything of it.

35
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.070
Jog three miles turned around and I saw the same guy come out from under a half

36
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.170
fallen tree and head towards me.

37
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.340
She started to run and we should say it.

38
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.810
This next part gets graphic and violent.

39
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
Made the mistake of running into the water to try and get away from him and

40
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.640
realized how slowly I was running in the water.

41
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.410
As I got ran back to the beach, this man caught up with me,

42
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.930
put me in a choke hold and said,

43
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.330
we're going to take a little walk up into the sand dunes.

44
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.470
He pushed me up over this first sand dune where we're no longer visible to

45
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:37.530
anybody. Started asking me to do sexual things.

46
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.990
He was trying to remove my swimsuit and I twisted to try and get away and he

47
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.720
tightened his script and said, do what I tell you. I've got a knife.

48
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.360
Two thoughts went through my mind.

49
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.270
Stay really calm and get a good look at this guy.

50
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.980
Caucasian, Sandy, blonde hair, curly beard and mustache. Erie hands, Short,

51
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.950
stubby fingers. He pushed me down on the ground and was kneeling over me and uh,

52
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.040
when I was refusing he would,

53
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.700
what he would do was he would strangle me until I would about lose consciousness

54
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.700
and he would loosen his grip and say, now, are you going to do it?

55
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.850
And I would refuse. And as I'm talking,

56
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:18.310
I managed to get one leg up and I kicked him in the groin.

57
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.710
But unfortunately it didn't incapacitate him. It enraged him and he said, no,

58
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.180
I'm going to kill you now. You're going to die.

59
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.170
<v 2>Meanwhile,</v>

60
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.460
Tom is getting worried because she was so predictable in her patterns.

61
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.420
She would normally be gone 45 minutes to an hour. After an hour and a half,

62
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.540
you started pacing the beach at two hours. He called the cops.

63
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.090
The police brought in jet-skis were like, were you,

64
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.140
were you thinking that she'd,

65
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.970
I thought I was fairly convinced that she probably had drowned in Manitowoc.

66
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.510
You don't think about crime. You didn't lock your doors. You didn't, you know,

67
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:52.190
many people left their keys in their car.

68
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.310
<v 0>He started, I'm hitting my head on either on a rock or a tree stump,</v>

69
00:03:58.311 --> 00:03:59.240
some hard object.

70
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.650
At one point he broke my nose and then strangled me till I lost consciousness.

71
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.950
Sometime later, penny woke up when I came to, um,

72
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.780
I was lying on my back in the sand. She's sad that she was naked and alone.

73
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.040
I thought maybe he's in the woods, you know, watching to see if,

74
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.400
if I've survived or if he's accomplished what he set out to do.

75
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.730
So I tried to stand up, was too weak and fell over.

76
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.090
And she noticed when she fell down that her hands were covered in blood.

77
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.953
And I thought, yeah,

78
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.050
<v 3>mm,</v>

79
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.010
<v 0>this is evidence. I need to preserve this. So I crawled through the sand,</v>

80
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.410
kind of on my knees, on the heels of my hands,

81
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.650
<v 2>making sure she was keeping her fingers up out of the sand.</v>

82
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.280
As soon as I saw her, I knew that she had had been beaten.

83
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.440
You never want to see someone like that. And you know,

84
00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:49.670
I hope I never see that again.

85
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.460
<v 0>The paramedics, the rest opinion of the Er. Next thing she remembers,</v>

86
00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.030
she was lying in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors and nurses stitching

87
00:04:59.031 --> 00:05:03.440
facial cuts, and then there's a female deputy who is questioning me.

88
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.560
She has opinion to describe the guy, Caucasian sandy blonde hair,

89
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.600
early [inaudible] stubby fingers.

90
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:11.540
The next morning the cops brought Penney down to the police station for a lineup

91
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.230
and this is where you like go into a room and there's a one way mirror.

92
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.170
You can see them. They can't see you. There were nine guys,

93
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.500
each of the nine had a number around their neck from one to nine she looked at

94
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:24.650
one guy than another than another,

95
00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.370
and when I came to, I don't know if he was number three,

96
00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:30.920
I don't recall exactly one particular guy of the nine.

97
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.540
The hair on the back of my neck stood up.

98
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.370
I remember the color draining from my face. Visceral gut reaction like,

99
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:43.210
oh my God, this was the guy. Barely any time had passed into the attack.

100
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.563
<v 2>She was positive.</v>

101
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.840
<v 0>The sheriff wasn't surprised. They'd had their eye on this guy for a while.</v>

102
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.950
His name was Steven Avery. He'd been arrested for some small time stuff,

103
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:58.951
Berkeley cruelty to animals and most recently attempted assault rifle point.

104
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.320
He'd pulled a gun on a woman, so to the DA and dated him for attacking penny.

105
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.900
The trial was fast, very fast.

106
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.900
Penny got on the stand and said bye for some certain that Steven Avery was the

107
00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:13.620
man who assaulted me. She, she,

108
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.890
she had no doubt she looked people squarely in the eye.

109
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.390
Her recollections were unequivocal. She was a very strong witness.

110
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.260
This is Fred Hazelwood. He was the judge on the case. You're on mandatory. Cody.

111
00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.060
Tell me what, tell me about his alibi.

112
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.150
His alibi was that he just didn't have the time to commit the crime cause he was

113
00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:35.700
shopping. He bought some paint, I believe, or drywall compound.

114
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:40.530
I'm not sure what he was also working that day before the alleged assault,

115
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:43.890
helping his family poured cement for some project at hole.

116
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.330
That was his testimony and the testimony of a whole bunch of other witnesses.

117
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.510
16 only problem was nearly all of them were family and the stories were too

118
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.360
similar. This is Tom, again, virtually identical,

119
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.870
sounded like they had gotten together and talked.

120
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.740
That was a credibility issue that affected the defense witnesses and there was

121
00:07:04.741 --> 00:07:07.800
one other big problem for Avery is close.

122
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.900
<v 2>There was not a microscopic speck of concrete dust on any of the clothes that he</v>

123
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.170
wore that day.

124
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.120
And he indicated to trial that he had worked the end of the concrete shoot.

125
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.380
Well anyone that has ever done that at the end of a concrete truck knows that

126
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:25.060
that just comes out and splashes

127
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.980
<v 0>after deliberating for two days. The jury found Steve Avery guilty,</v>

128
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.670
guilty on three counts as I recall. Yeah. Sexual assault,

129
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.900
15 years attempted murder, 15 years and I believe false imprisonment,

130
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.670
two years for false imprisonment, 32 years altogether to be served consecutively

131
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.580
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

132
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.580
<v 0>so you go back to the chocolate shop and try to carry on with life as it was</v>

133
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:57.690
before essentially. But that obviously wasn't too easy.

134
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.580
Nightmares, flashbacks. She was angry, you know, blowing up at my kids,

135
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:03.300
her husband.

136
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.940
Sometimes I wouldn't want my husband to be protective and other times he would

137
00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:09.300
think he was being protective. And I would say like I can take care of myself.

138
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.830
When a guy on the street whistled at her,

139
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.590
I turned around and just let loose with every obscenity in the book. You know,

140
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.760
I just, she started seeing a therapist,

141
00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:22.260
which helped a little but even a year after Steve's conviction she was still

142
00:08:22.261 --> 00:08:23.790
struggling with all this anger.

143
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.480
And then one snowy afternoon,

144
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.210
maybe winter of 86 87 you went to see a talk by the social worker,

145
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.940
Dr Mark on bright from the University of Minnesota.

146
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.640
And I don't remember exactly what he said,

147
00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:39.410
I don't think he used the word forgiveness,

148
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:44.090
but he said at some point victims reached the point where they understand that

149
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.420
the anger and hatred they're feeling is really damaging themselves in their

150
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.030
families and they need to let go of it.

151
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:54.650
And I left the presentation at the next break I went home,

152
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:56.100
I got my country skis,

153
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.740
I went to point beach state park and skied to the point where I was exact spot

154
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.550
where I'd been assaulted and basically said to myself, Steve,

155
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:07.050
you don't have power over me anymore.

156
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.860
So that was a turning point.

157
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.650
<v 4>Penny actually started working in the prisons.</v>

158
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:15.630
She'd go and tell inmates or story

159
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.540
<v 0>hoping to teach the impact of crime and hope that they might make the leap to</v>

160
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.140
changing their behavior. Meanwhile, Steven Avery, um,

161
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.330
has a number of appeals and he's turned down at all his appeals.

162
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.160
She had told the district attorney, if anyone,

163
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.350
someone just breathed Steven Avery's name in court,

164
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.810
I want to be notified and I want to be there for every hearing.

165
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.870
And I did show up. I,

166
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.560
I'm getting more and more angry every time there is appeal.

167
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.850
Like is there no finalities there no closure to this.

168
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.210
<v 4>He kept asking the court to review the evidence over and over again</v>

169
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.400
<v 0>and I'm thinking, why is he so persistent?</v>

170
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:52.910
<v 3>Mm.</v>

171
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.140
<v 4>And then one Sunday morning in early September, in 2003,</v>

172
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.700
18 years after Steve Avery's conviction pending gets a call from her lawyer

173
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:05.720
friend Janine and Janine has called and said, can I stop by?

174
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:09.110
I want to talk to you about a restorative justice initiative that Marquette

175
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.680
frankly was the truth, but it wasn't why I was driving a Manitowoc.

176
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.060
On a Sunday on her way.

177
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:17.750
Janine called Penny's husband who had left town for a business trip that

178
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.990
morning. Janine told me what she had just discovered and heard.

179
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:24.480
It was about a DNA test, chess time to turn around.

180
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.060
And Tom and I both pulled into the driveway together simultaneously.

181
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.170
I walk outside and both of them are Ashen and in that moment

182
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.060
<v 0>she knew, I knew instantly.</v>

183
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.590
<v 4>Well I always remember the look on her face.</v>

184
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.560
<v 0>The DNA is back. Ken is not Steven Avery.</v>

185
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.870
<v 4>She just, she just fell apart.</v>

186
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.250
I told her I wanted to go in and sit down and um,

187
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.460
she went and sat on the couch next to time and explained to her the Wisconsin

188
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.230
innocence project had reevaluated some of the biological material from the crime

189
00:11:03.231 --> 00:11:03.560
scene,

190
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.560
<v 0>some hairs and determine that an innocent person has spent 18 years,</v>

191
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.360
I think it was 18 years,

192
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:14.570
one month and 13 days in prison for something he did not do.

193
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.720
<v 4>Yeah, no, she looked very frightened and I said, penny,</v>

194
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.130
I want you to remember all the good you've done working in prisons,

195
00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:26.060
all the men you've reached. You know, if, I mean, she didn't say much.

196
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:26.620
I remember

197
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.520
<v 0>for feeling if I wrote down every good deed I had done from the day I was born</v>

198
00:11:30.521 --> 00:11:31.390
until today,

199
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:36.760
it would not possibly be sufficient to balance the scales in terms of this

200
00:11:36.761 --> 00:11:38.410
horrendous error that I've made.

201
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:43.030
That day was worse than the day I was assaulted.

202
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.150
And there was one more thing then I learned. Not only was there an exoneration,

203
00:11:49.151 --> 00:11:49.984
but there was a hit.

204
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.130
<v 4>The court told</v>

205
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 1>penny that the DNA belonged to a man named Gregory Allen,</v>

206
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.330
who at that moment was in prison for a very brutal rape of a woman in Green Bay,

207
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:05.800
Wisconsin. You'd actually been charged with an attempted assault,

208
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.120
um, the same beach where I was assaulted. His nickname was the Sandman

209
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.450
<v 0>because he liked to come up or the sand dunes and grab someone.</v>

210
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.070
And for 10 years while Steve Avery was in prison, he'd walked free.

211
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.390
So I'm thinking how many other women have had their lives turned upside down and

212
00:12:23.391 --> 00:12:26.870
inside out because I miss identified the man who assaulted me.

213
00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.740
<v 2>As it turned out, Gregory Allen was serving his sentence,</v>

214
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.120
a 60 year sentence at the prison in Green Bay where penny had actually been

215
00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.500
working. And as a matter of fact,

216
00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.730
he was about two weeks from being in penny's next class.

217
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.490
No Way. And No, absolutely.

218
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.020
And so penny would never have known this man that would have been sitting feet

219
00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:50.900
away from her in his cell.

220
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.960
They found a scrap book where he had documented all the appeals of Steven Avery

221
00:12:56.001 --> 00:12:59.060
over all those years. Oh, that's really creepy.

222
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.560
That's more than creepy. September 11th, 2003,

223
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.590
Steve Avery was set free.

224
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.240
<v 1>As soon as he walked out of the gate of the prison, he was mobbed by reporters.</v>

225
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.340
It was the news story in Wisconsin and he was considered a celebrity.

226
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.640
There was a legislator who actually put together, um,

227
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.200
a Steven Avery Fund that people can contribute to because they really had no

228
00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:30.201
resources and no job skills because he's been in prison for 18 years.

229
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.760
Um, you know,

230
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:37.050
there was a beauty salon in Green Bay that gave him a makeover.

231
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.260
I remember sending my husband out of town and saying, no,

232
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:42.550
I just need to be alone.

233
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.430
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

234
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.290
<v 1>and I decided I'm going out running,</v>

235
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.270
and I remember running along a railroad track,

236
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.810
a seldom used railroad track, but just thinking, God,

237
00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:58.740
it would be a blessing if a train just came along in front of me. It was like,

238
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.170
<v 3>what do I do? [inaudible]</v>

239
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.800
<v 0>I can't make this right. She says,</v>

240
00:14:06.801 --> 00:14:08.750
every time she saw Steven Avery's face,

241
00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.520
he was on the front page of the new art local Manafort newspaper.

242
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.890
Every everyday for two to three weeks, two things would happen. She'd think,

243
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.370
how could I have done this to this man? But at the very same moment,

244
00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:21.890
she thought that the hair on the back of my neck would stand up.

245
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.080
You had an after you knew after I knew. I knew intellectually he was innocent,

246
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.970
but emotionally,

247
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:32.510
this is the man who I've seen in my nightmares and flashbacks for 18 years.

248
00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:36.360
So there's two weeks after where his face is in the paper every day.

249
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.710
It must have been very strange. It was strange. Yeah.

250
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.670
And then it's also strange to feel like an offender. A little aside here.

251
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.740
And when I saw Gregory Allen's picture,

252
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.740
the picture of my actual perpetrator [inaudible],

253
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:52.400
there was absolutely no physical, um,

254
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.460
reaction from me. I would swear I'd never seen him before in my life.

255
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.130
So my therapist said to me,

256
00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.160
you will never be able to attach to Gregory Allen the feelings you had towards

257
00:15:03.201 --> 00:15:03.861
Steven Avery.

258
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.560
What you have to do is work on removing those feelings from Steve [inaudible]

259
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.430
and looking at Steve as this is an innocent person.

260
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:15.170
Not long after his exoneration penny had written to Steve asking if she could

261
00:15:15.171 --> 00:15:16.730
meet him and apologize in person.

262
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.230
And about a year and a half after his exoneration, he agreed.

263
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.960
I was so nervous. Can you set the scene? Are you in?

264
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.910
We're a little room small office,

265
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.540
like a two room office in a legislative building in the state capitol.

266
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.540
There's a cell phone, a few chairs. Penny got there first.

267
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.210
Eventually Steve Walked in. Steve had, uh,

268
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.520
his attorney Keith Finley there from the innocence project. I stand up,

269
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:43.430
I extend my hand to Steve. He gives me this hardy handshake.

270
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.580
Our lives have been intertwined for almost two decades,

271
00:15:46.581 --> 00:15:50.210
and it's the first time we've physically touched, touched.

272
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.980
He sits down,

273
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.490
we talked about things like he had a nephew who was killed in a car accident

274
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:59.000
when he was in prison and couldn't go to the funeral. His grandmother died.

275
00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.400
He couldn't go to her funeral. His wife had divorced him.

276
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.090
He's a strange from his children. Um, and some of them I know,

277
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.440
he had one daughter who really stood by him and so I brought up these losses and

278
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.610
apologized for each one individually. He, he's very quiet,

279
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.900
sort of just acknowledge them with a nod of his head and he said,

280
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.951
I don't blame you.

281
00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:23.090
I blame the police because it turned out in the weeks before penny was attacked,

282
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.450
the police had been watching Gregory Allen because he was unknown sex offender.

283
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.720
They were actually tailing him for the two weeks prior to my assault,

284
00:16:32.721 --> 00:16:37.580
checking on him sometimes as often as a dozen times a day on July 29th,

285
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.340
1985 the day I was assaulted. They checked on him once in the morning.

286
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:42.950
And then due to a high volume of police calls,

287
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.970
we're unable to check on him any more that day and that's the afternoon I was

288
00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:50.640
assaulted eventually after opinions,

289
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:53.810
Steve had been sitting in that little room for awhile. Time was up and weed,

290
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.200
there was no more to be sad and I stood up and walked over to Steven and said to

291
00:17:00.021 --> 00:17:03.770
Steve, is it okay if I give you a hug? And he didn't even respond.

292
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:05.840
He just grabbed me in a big hair bear hug and I said,

293
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:10.670
so only he could hear Steve. I'm so sorry. And he said, it's okay. This was over

294
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:20.440
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

295
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.710
<v 0>and for him to say, it's okay, it's over.</v>

296
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.250
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

297
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:31.150
<v 0>when I know full well it's his journey's just beginning and he's got a hell of a</v>

298
00:17:31.151 --> 00:17:32.260
road. Yeah.

299
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:33.550
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

300
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.190
<v 0>that's one of the most grace-filled things that's ever been said to me.</v>

301
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.630
[inaudible] fast forward about two years after that meeting,

302
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.500
I get a call from Janine guest ski, my attorney friend,

303
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.420
the one who delivered the news about the exoneration who says something's

304
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.923
happen.

305
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.280
<v 1>There's a woman photographer who's missing Teresa Halbach disappeared October</v>

306
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.970
31st after visiting the suspect Steven Avery to take pictures of a car.

307
00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:16.630
He was selling three n they are searching the Avery property.

308
00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.560
I encouraged her, I tried to tell her stay out of this,

309
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.160
but anyone in the local news and said, I cannot believe this,

310
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.310
<v 4>but she didn't believe it could be Steven Avery,</v>

311
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:28.890
that she didn't believe he would be capable of such a thing.

312
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.690
And other people in town thought that too,

313
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.120
that this was just another false accusation.

314
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.990
<v 1>But eventually after a couple of days of searching search,</v>

315
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:43.700
the remains of Teresa's body burn human bone and teeth were for eventually found

316
00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.300
in a burn barrel at the Avery auto salvage yard.

317
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.030
<v 4>Steven every claim that he was innocent that he was set up by the police.</v>

318
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.790
But a few months later his nephew came forward and he tells police in an

319
00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:59.650
interrogation that the day of the murder he went to Steven Avery's trailer here

320
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.800
heard screams inside.

321
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.140
Steven came to the door and a tee shirt in gym shorts who sweating and inside

322
00:19:06.141 --> 00:19:08.630
the nephew sees Teresa Halbach bound to the bed.

323
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.500
And what happens next according to Stephen's nephew,

324
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:15.290
is one of the most awful things I've ever heard.

325
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.940
Steven asks his nephew to Rape Teresa with him and then together they kill her.

326
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.460
<v 0>Oh my. Oh my God.</v>

327
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.080
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

328
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.720
<v 0>you start questioning your own judgment.</v>

329
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:36.910
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

330
00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.880
<v 0>I can't even trust my senses. I can't trust my eyes to tell me what,</v>

331
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.900
you know what I thought I recorded accurately about the world.

332
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.400
And then when he gets convicted for killing Teresa, it's like,

333
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.840
you know what kind of character judge am I? No, I can't even judge character.

334
00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:56.674
I can't.

335
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.850
She had been certain twice and Rome twice and then a worse thought occurred to

336
00:20:02.231 --> 00:20:02.500
her.

337
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.940
Would Teresa Halbach be alive today if I hadn't missed identified my assailant?

338
00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.770
Meaning what exactly? Like, well, I accused Steve of something he doesn't do.

339
00:20:11.771 --> 00:20:13.990
He's convicted. He spends 18 years in prison.

340
00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.590
Prison is enormously damaging to guilty people.

341
00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.200
What happens to someone who is innocent?

342
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.140
<v 4>In other words, did her initial certainty that Steve Avery was her assailant,</v>

343
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:30.690
did that turn him into the guy who murdered Teresa Halbach? No,

344
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:33.690
I uh, no, no.

345
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.790
Judge Hazelwood doesn't fight that argument. Not at all. Not at all. For one.

346
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.030
If you look at the group of people who can set free after a wrongful conviction,

347
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.760
the vast majority of them do. Okay.

348
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.950
They don't commit serious crimes after they've been released from prison.

349
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.980
And this was a man with a violent past. Oh yeah.

350
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.880
Well before Penny ete pulled the gun on a woman's in the broad light of day and

351
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:56.410
demanded that she come with them.

352
00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.460
Nothing happened because the police intervened. But what if they hadn't?

353
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.220
<v 5>I saw the potential for violence in him. Uh,</v>

354
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.120
but I would be wrong to say I saw in him a Teresa Halbach.

355
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.350
<v 4>I didn't until I asked him if this case had shaken his confidence in his</v>

356
00:21:15.351 --> 00:21:16.880
judgment the way it had for penny.

357
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.480
<v 5>Um, first I tried to figure out what in the world did we do wrong?</v>

358
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.710
And, um, I pretty much came to the conclusion that, uh,

359
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.570
at least as far as the courts are concerned,

360
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.260
we did get it right and we still got a bad result. That's,

361
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.630
that's going to be a problem.

362
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.500
As long as humans judge other human activity,

363
00:21:39.501 --> 00:21:41.000
we're not always going to get it right.

364
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:44.060
That's actually the one thing we can be certain of it says.

365
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.630
But cases like Avery are, are rare.

366
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.710
I was 25 years on the bench and 15 years or more as a lawyer before that.

367
00:21:54.441 --> 00:21:57.200
And I don't think I've ever seen one quite like Steven Avery.

368
00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.640
<v 4>He says, Steven Avery is an outlier. He's the lesson you don't learn.</v>

369
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.180
<v 5>Yeah. It's like I was fishing last spring in Sanibel</v>

370
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.230
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:16.060
<v 5>on Sanibel island and I was in up to my waist, uh, trying to, uh,</v>

372
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:20.390
a fly casting for a snuck to kind of fish. And uh,

373
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.080
all of a sudden this rather dark shape,

374
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.050
swam right by me about eight feet long.

375
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.320
I thought to myself, that's a bull shark.

376
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:37.440
And here I am waist deep and this shark swam maybe a foot away from me as he

377
00:22:37.441 --> 00:22:42.060
went by. What if they bumped into me? Yeah,

378
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.110
what are the odds of this happening? But, uh, you know, life is like that.

379
00:22:46.111 --> 00:22:48.820
We've, we faced the unexpected, the unknown and,

380
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.560
but you're not going to never go fishing there again, are you? Oh No, no,

381
00:22:52.561 --> 00:22:54.570
I wouldn't, that wouldn't keep me from going fishing.

382
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.140
<v 4>Then again, the judge didn't get bitten.</v>

383
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.550
I kept thinking over and over at the end of this, like the Halbach family.

384
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.910
How did they move on after something like this? Did you call them? I tried.

385
00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:10.820
I reached out to a couple of the family members, but I never heard back.

386
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:12.763
<v 0>And what about Benny?</v>

387
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.450
<v 4>Well, she and Tom sold the chocolate shop and moved to Chicago.</v>

388
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.510
<v 0>Well, I'm retired. So right now I'm doing a lot of volunteer work, um,</v>

389
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.570
center on wrongful convictions, children's hospital.

390
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.230
I volunteer at the Morton Arboretum.

391
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.980
And so a variety of things and all together. Yeah,

392
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.020
she seems to be doing just fine. I mean, I questioned much more.

393
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.110
I questioned things a lot more. Yeah,

394
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:42.111
I think there's much more doubt and I think I'm much more comfortable living

395
00:23:42.571 --> 00:23:45.090
with uncertainty. I've kind of had,

396
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.090
<v 4>I mean I have to be</v>

397
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.353
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

398

<v 1>Pretty sure Pat Walters for more information on anything that you heard in this</v>

402
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.560
hour, visit radiolab.org thanks to pat,

403
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.170
thanks to Lulu and all the producers who helped us with this episode.

404
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.820
And thank you guys for listening.

405
00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:57.940
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

406
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.780
<v 1>so that was the story as we told it back in 2013,</v>

407
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.240
couple of years later, uh,

408
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.110
Netflix released the documentary series called making a murderer.

409
00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:12.970
It's a really deep dive into a part of the story that we only mentioned towards

410
00:25:12.971 --> 00:25:14.410
the end and rather quickly,

411
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:18.730
which is the conviction of Steven Avery for the murder of Teresa Halbach.

412
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.320
Now we sort of talked about it based on our best understanding of the evidence

413
00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:25.290
at the time. Making a murderer goes really,

414
00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:28.380
really deep 10 hours deep into this question.

415
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.690
And there are some details that they uncover many,

416
00:25:30.691 --> 00:25:35.691
many details that made us think differently about how we understood that aspect

417
00:25:36.121 --> 00:25:39.220
of the story and how we presented it, who spat with more detail.

418
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.040
<v 4>So let me just walk you through real quick a few of the things that are</v>

419
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.080
important to that part of the story.

420
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:47.480
Given the way that we told it in our original piece.

421
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.800
First thing is the confession. We say that, you know,

422
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.680
Steven was arrested for this murder and then his nephew came forward and

423
00:25:54.681 --> 00:25:55.514
confessed.

424
00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.540
Turns out that that confession is not a very straightforward piece of evidence.

425
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.460
It came from his 16 year old nephew who has a very low IQ and a fourth grade

426
00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:08.120
reading level that the nephew didn't come forward exactly,

427
00:26:08.121 --> 00:26:10.280
but rather the police pulled him out of class,

428
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:13.340
questioned him many times without an attorney,

429
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.760
asked him hundreds of very leading questions.

430
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.470
And the kicker of that part of it is that this story that he told about all

431
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:23.480
those awful things that happened in the bedroom,

432
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:28.510
there's no actual physical evidence to back up any of it.

433
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.020
So that's the confession.

434
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.110
The other thing is the context in which this whole thing is happening.

435
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:38.500
Steve had filed a huge $36 million civil suit against the county right after

436
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.860
he'd been exonerated. It was going really well.

437
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:45.780
Some major evidence against the county had come out.

438
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:51.020
This is what was happening when Theresa hobbits body was found in Steven Avery's

439
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:55.830
backyard. So when we said Steven every claimed that he was framed by the police,

440
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.940
there's actually a little more teeth to that statement then you might've assumed

441
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.770
when you listen to our story originally

442
00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.100
<v 0>and there's lots, lots more, it's a filmmakers spent 10 years on this.</v>

443
00:27:06.101 --> 00:27:09.970
They find out things that make you question the evidence the police use to

444
00:27:09.971 --> 00:27:11.020
convict Steven Avery.

445
00:27:11.021 --> 00:27:14.920
And it made pat start to wonder if every should've ever been convicted at all.

446
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:20.020
So he called up the filmmakers. Hello. Hi Pat, this is Moira. Hi Laura.

447
00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.910
Hi Pat. Their names are Moira Demos and Laura are a charity. And uh,

448
00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.240
he basically asked them,

449
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.360
<v 4>do you think Steven Avery is innocent?</v>

450
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.543
<v 0>I mean,</v>

451
00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.530
one of the many things I learned through this decade long experience is,

452
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.690
you know, the humility to, to accept that. I don't know. Um,

453
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:44.070
we don't think the truth emerged. Um, here with respect to the Halbach case,

454
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:46.710
we don't, we don't know what happened to her.

455
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:50.670
It doesn't mean that we're convinced of Steven Avery's innocence or if that or

456
00:27:50.671 --> 00:27:55.560
that that was even of concern to us. You know, I, I think of it as, you know,

457
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.210
I don't know whether it's the carrot or the sort of cardboard rabbit that's on

458
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:03.030
the dog track. That's, you know, it's, it's making the dogs run.

459
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:05.910
I mean it's the engine that gets this story going,

460
00:28:05.911 --> 00:28:09.000
but it's the story that's the point. Not the,

461
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.020
not the thing that we know that people are interested in clearing Steven Avery

462
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:16.320
or Brendan Dassey, his name was never our objective. You know,

463
00:28:16.321 --> 00:28:20.040
one of the themes in the series is the danger of a rush to judgment.

464
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:25.110
And you know, we now see that in 2015 in the responses to the series,

465
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.530
you know, people are being very quick to name suspects,

466
00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:31.710
to spout opinions about who did it. And,

467
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.670
<v 4>but I w I feel like it just makes me wonder like if like you spend a week</v>

468
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.630
learning about something and then at the end of the week you say, okay,

469
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.960
now I'm going to say something about what I know or you spend a month thinking

470
00:28:46.151 --> 00:28:51.151
about something or three months and at the end of it you have to say something.

471
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.730
<v 0>Well, I actually think that's one of the points of the series.</v>

472
00:28:54.731 --> 00:28:57.430
I do understand how that's hard to grapple with.

473
00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:02.460
And I think we are trying to challenge the viewer to deal with how hard it is to

474
00:29:04.661 --> 00:29:07.690
embrace ambiguity. Perhaps you can never

475
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.810
reach a place of certainty, but you should put some energy into it.

476
00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.520
Um, so if we let go of certainty and, um, you know,

477
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.680
demand a system that gives you a sense of reliability,

478
00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.810
at least, you know,

479
00:29:25.811 --> 00:29:30.610
that can be a goal that can maybe alleviate some of those terrible feelings.

480
00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:34.810
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

481
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.610
<v 0>Thanks again to reporter Pat Walters and of course, to the filmmakers,</v>

482
00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.660
Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos.
