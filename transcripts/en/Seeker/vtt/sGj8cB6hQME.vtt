00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.899
Do we chose what we eat or do the bacteria
living in our gut decide?

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.090
Hello everyone!

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm Reina and this is DNews.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.570
The friendly bacteria that live within us
may not only be affecting food cravings but

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:17.570
also our moods.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.840
Research has shown that this may even lead
to a causal relationship with obesity.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.009
Researchers from UC San Francisco, Arizona
State University and University of New Mexico

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.380
have concluded that microbes do in fact influence
eating habits and food choices to favor consumption

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.620
of specific nutrients that the microbes themselves
thrive best on.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.570
In the past it was thought that microbes passively
took in whatever nutrients we ingested.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.230
Bacterial species have different nutrients
they thrive off of; some favor sugars, others

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.120
can favor starches, fats, et cetera.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.900
And because the human gut is directly linked
to the immune system, nervous system, and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.600
endocrine system, the community of microbes
that live within you influence your eating

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600
choices!

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.120
The gut microbiome does this by releasing
signaling molecules, which allow the cells

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.630
to perceive and respond correctly to the microenvironment.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.610
Then, those signals go on to influence our
physiologic and behavioral responses.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.590
The Director of Human and Social Evolution
at UCSF, explains "Microbes have the capacity

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.600
to manipulate behavior and mood through altering
the neural signals in the vagus nerve, changing

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.579
taste receptors, producing toxins to make
us feel bad, and releasing chemical rewards

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.579
to make us feel good."

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.439
For example, in mice particular strands of
bacteria can increase anxious behavior.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.820
In a nutshell, the bacteria didn’t like
what the mice were eating so they chemically

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.280
signaled a reaction that would cause the mice
to feel anxiety.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.939
The mice would then correlate the food to
be causing the anxiety and cease to continue

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.939
eating it.[a]

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.190
On a larger scale, clinical trials discovered
that drinking a probiotic containing Lactobacillus

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.079
casei (kay see ee), which can relieve gastrointestinal
pathogenic bacterial disease, actually improved

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.079
low moods.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.039
Dr. Carlo Maley, director of the UCSF Center
for Evolution and Cancer explains

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.030
"Bacteria within the gut are manipulative.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.759
There is a diversity of interests represented
in the microbiome, some aligned with our own

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.469
dietary goals, and others not."

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.719
The speed with which the microbiome can change
may be encouraging to those who seek to improve

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.030
health by altering microbial populations.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.359
This usually happens through food and supplement
choices, by ingesting specific bacterial species

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.219
in the form of probiotics, or by killing targeted
species with antibiotics.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.410
According to researchers, optimizing the balance
among bacterial species in our gut may allow

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.950
us to lead less obese and healthier lives.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.770
Researchers[b] proposed further studies to
investigate the power microbes hold over us.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.250
They say that "Targeting the microbiome could
open up possibilities for preventing a variety

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.980
of disease from obesity and diabetes to cancers
of the gastro-intestinal tract.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.080
We are only beginning to scratch the surface
of the importance of the microbiome for human

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.080
health.”

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080
What do you think?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.740
Would you get a gut microbe transplant in
hopes of improving your health?
