00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:06.939
Happy holidays!

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.360
This year, we got you the trailer you requested
the most

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.190
... for some reason.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:21.020
After 42 volumes of comics, 18 movies, and
15 seasons of television...

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.230
one live action adaptation will ignore everything
people loved about the Dragon Ball franchise

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.650
in America’s biggest insult to Japanese
culture since Hiroshima.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800
Dragonball: Evolution.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.050
Prepare for Fox’s half-assed attempt to
cash in on their expiring rights to Dragon

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.050
Ball.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.960
It’s an adaptation that steals from everything
except the source material,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.660
featuring elements of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.660
The Matrix,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.590
Lord of the Rings,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.880
Twilight?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.220
and The Last Airbender?

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.620
"Shadow Crane strike is the most basic of
all the air-bending techniques."

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.870
Oh, come on!

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.100
When the Sith Lord Piccolo escapes his ancient
prison, somehow...

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.960
Goku, a student at video game high school,
must find the dragon balls before something

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.190
about an eclipse or else something about Oozaru
the evil monkey werewolf.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.720
It...doesn’t make any sense.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.390
Can I get a little help here?

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.860
We’ll take it from here Honest Trailer Voice
Man Voice!

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.880
Thanks guys, I’m totally lost.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.830
Alright, listen up!

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.880
Dragon Ball is the epic saga of a martial
artist who...

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.040
Wait, that’s Goku?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.580
This is an outrage!

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.900
I never went to school!

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.580
Also, I don’t *think* you’re white.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.010
I’m a Saiya-genie!

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.820
Anyway, it’s about Noku here’s quest to
collect all 7 wish granting dragon balls before--

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.290
Whoa, when did I get a hot Asian sidekick?

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.030
Maybe this movie isn’t so bad.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.549
"I am Muten Roshi, the Invincible!

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.549
Hahahaha!"

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.900
"My grandfather is dead."

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
Nope.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.900
It sucks.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.390
And along the way Goku is joined by his best
friend Krillin, who should

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.590
be showing up in the movie any second now...

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.590
any second...

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.940
You’re not in the movie.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.870
I gotta be honest guys, this still seems pretty
stupid.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.260
But, like, the show is way better!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.910
I fly around on a magic cloud, fight a shapeshifting
man pig...

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.040
And help a 300 year old man get laid!

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.200
Have we sold you yet?

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Not really.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.230
But thanks for trying.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.230
You bet!

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.630
Bye bye Honest Trailer Man Voice Man!

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.630
Hey!

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.590
My roof!

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.590
Sorryyy!

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.590
Ugh...

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.290
Power up for a movie that doesn’t just sound
bad, it looks bad,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:54.629
as the epic ki attacks from the cartoons are
replaced with CGI hand farts.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:03.269
Squirm as the awkward level goes over 9000,
in a movie full of

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.950
Long pauses,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.340
"You're different."

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:14.670
"I like different."

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.670
Terrible dialogue,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.670
"Grandpa!

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.970
I'm so happy to see you!"

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.610
and Justin Chatwin’s forehead vein.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.000
So, gather up all of the balls

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.190
Heh heh

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.460
for the one wish that everyone can agree on:
make this movie never exist!

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.690
Starring...

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.599
How dare they make a movie about Kakarot and
not include me?

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.120
Oh God not another one...

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.360
I’m Vegeta, prince of the Saiya--

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.739
oh my god is that the Beta-Male?

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.150
He's like a Tiger with Down’s Syndrome.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.159
Never mind.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.159
Bullet dodged.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.159
Definitely.

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.159
Would you like to do the honors?

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:52.600
Of course I will!

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.629
Starring...

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.659
Geico

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.659
TeeTees

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:56.659
The Mask

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.890
The Ki Maker

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.620
Crouching Tiger, Dead Career

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.500
Nobody’s Favorite Ghostbuster

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.230
Mighty Joe Young

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.879
And Not-Lara-Croft

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.330
Oh, God, What a steaming pile.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.780
Dragonball: Evolution

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.049
So wait, Kakarot wishes a guy he just met
back to life at the end of the movie,

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.289
but he lets the man who raised him from birth
stay dead?

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.659
... I can dig it.

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.599
Special thanks to Team Four Star.

We're doing 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:51.889
this again?

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.099
Fine.
