00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.850
Let's look at the same setup again, lens is a symmetric so the focal lens will

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.930
be on both sides of the lens, let's imagine that I have a 3D object on

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.050
this part of the scene here, and, the image plane is being formed on this side.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.740
So I put an object here, basically remembering what we,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.700
looked at in the last side, any parallel light goes through,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.230
goes through the focal point here, continues on,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.560
anything that goes through, the optic will point here, goes to unadulterated and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.400
then the third line, of course, the opposite of the converse of this one,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.990
anything that goes with the focal point will become parallel on the other side.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.160
So in essence, these three lines, will converge at this point and this is where

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.190
the image will be formed, so this is where the image point is for this object.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.510
So, rays from points on a plane parallel, to the lens,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
focus on, a point that is far away here, and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.070
we will actually now come up with an equation that basically connects the object

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.940
distance from the lens, to the focal length to where the image is formed.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.330
So here, of course would be my tree again, as we've noticed, on the other side,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.590
it'll be formed upside down, and again, just calling this distance of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.430
the object from the lens itself to be o and the distance to the image as i.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.500
So this is what is referred to as a lens equation, and mathematically,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.790
basically, it's 1 over the distance of the object from the lens plus 1 over

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.490
distance of the image from the lens is equal to 1 over the focal length.
