Google Friend Connect is launching deeper
integration with Twitter. Now, through Twitter,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.559
friend connect sites can reach millions more
users.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.510
With these new updates, you can sign on to
any friend connect site using your Twitter

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.080
ID.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.360
When you click to sign in, you first enter
your information with Twitter, then they send

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.239
it back to Friend Connect. Then, your Twitter
picture and name are displayed.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.750
You can invite your Twitter followers to check
out the site at the time that you join. Without

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.520
leaving the site, you can tweet about your
new membership and include a link. Just like

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.390
on twitter!

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.890
Likewise, you can invite followers to the
site at any other time, by clicking the "invite"

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.260
link in the members gadget.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.190
You can also tweet when you post a comment
to a discussion on the site. So if there is

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.170
an interesting conversation, you can let other's
know about it.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.120
All of your tweets are instantly broadcast
to your followers

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.660
For site owners, the best part is that you
don't need to do anything. If you already

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.760
run a FriendConnect-enabled site, this just
works.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.790
