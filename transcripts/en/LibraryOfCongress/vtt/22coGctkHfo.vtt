00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.190
&gt;&gt; David L. Paterson:
Good afternoon.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.650
Many of you have read
some of Katherine's work.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.330
Some of you have met her and
some of you know her very well.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.380
I've had the honor of knowing her
for 50 years, 120 days, six hours

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.250 position:56%
and give her to a couple of minutes.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.510
My mom, I'm very proud
to introduce her.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.090
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.980
Many of you know her
works of fiction.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.950
She's an incredible storyteller,
but as her son growing up with her,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.480
there were many stories that we
enjoyed that were from our history

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.100
and our lives, which she
would be talking about today.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.460
So I'm not going to
waste any more time

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.780
with me bragging about my mother.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.510
I'm going to introduce
her, Katherine Paterson.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:21.050
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.350
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Hi.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.190
Thank you for coming
to this large room.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.110
I walked in a little nervous,
but I see that my friends

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.740
and relatives are here,
so that helps.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.710
I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.370
I was listening to David speaking.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.200
I had already told my children
that none of them could speak

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.230
in my funeral because all they
do is get up and make fun of me.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.300
And now, maybe I'll have to
reconsider because, you know,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.630
they might say something nice.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.000
It's really, really great.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.120
I always swore that I
would never write a memoir.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.670
One, I don't have a good enough
memory to write a memoir.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.630
And two, I could not believe that
those who are nearest and dearest

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.940
to me would want to be minor
characters in the story of my life.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.650
So then, I began to realize
that some of the stories

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.130
that I've been told by my
parents were not being told

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.340 position:56%
to my children and my grandchildren.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.820
At that time, my husband is
quite ill and I was not--

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.780 position:56%
anyway, ready to write another
novel, so I thought this is the time

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.150 position:56%
to write down some of those stories.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.170
I gave them to my friend
and it's a graph to read.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.250
And I just said, "Katherine,
if you're thinking

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.470
of publishing these,"
which of course,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.870
any writers always
thinking of publishing.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.780
And she said, "You've got to
connect the stories of your life

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.960
with the stories you have written.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.580
So I went back and rewrote
and tried to do that.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.320
Now, when people asked
me about my memoir,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.720
I patiently say that
it is a non memoir.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.300
It is not a connected narrative
the way a real memoir should be.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.520
And they said, "Well, what is it?"

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.680
"It's just stories in my life."

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.970
"And what is the name of it?"

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.270
"Stories of My Life."

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.570
[ Laughter ]

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.870
So here it is.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.610
And I sort of start out
by asking three questions

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.290
that we're not talking to children

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.140
because my audience
is often of children.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.100
The three questions which
I am most often I ask,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.690
when did you first begin to right?

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.360
How did you become a writer?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.250
Two, where do you get your ideas?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.440
And three, how does
it feel to be famous?

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.950
Now, you understand
I write for children,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.730
and my fame such as it is
is at a very narrow world.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.690
But, I'm going to read to you
first of all my answer or most

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.110
of my answer to the question,
how does it feel to be famous.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.080
The questioner is young and
earnest and has just confided

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.710
that although she doesn't
know what she wants to be,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.130
she knows that she
wants to be famous.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.760
I don't really know how
to answer her question.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.820
How does it feel to be famous?

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.220 position:56%
And then I remember things that
happened after Bridge to Terabithia,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.130
the Newbery Medal, I would
be invited somewhere to speak

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.770
and there would be a lovely dinner
at which I was the honored guest.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.580
The people on either side of me

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.500
at the table would say something
gracious and congratulatory.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.410
And then they would turn to
the person on the other side

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.020
and never speak to me
again for the entire meal.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.160
There were a few times when the
person in charge made it clear

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.090
that she'd hire me out for
the weekend and she did expect

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.440
to get her money's worth.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.380
I'd come home and whine to
my long suffering husband.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.840
"I'm a human being."

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.920
I'd say. "Why can't you just
treat me like a human being?"

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.370
And then I remembered Anita.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.390
When I was in Chandler Junior
High School in Richmond, Virginia,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.740
all of us new kids were
put in the same homeroom.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.950
It was a wonderful thing because we
could make friends with each other.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.280
We didn't have to try to cope
with the already cemented cliques

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.580
that populated the
rest of the school.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.880
I made several friends that
year, but there was one new girl

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.260
that we were all shy around.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.060
The reason we were shy around
Anita was because she was famous.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.540
She was the youngest member
of the Carter sisters.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.860
Her mother, Maybelle, had been part

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.450
of the legendary country
music group the Carter Family.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.320
Her older sister June went
on to marry Johnny Cash.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:53.120
At that time, her old sister and
her mother and Anita sang regularly

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.260
on the radio and in
concerts all over the South.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.650
We didn't make friends with Anita,
because we didn't know what to say

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.680
to someone who was famous.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.960 position:56%
Because she had moved around the
country a lot, Anita needed catching

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.700
up in a couple of subjects.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.080
And for some reason, I
was asked to tutor her.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.920
I'm sure it was not in Math.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.250
To my amazement she was so
shy that even one on one,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.080
she barely spoke above a whisper.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.970
Yet that summer, I went
to a concern in the--

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.120
at a stadium, and on stage,
Anita was transformed.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:46.230 position:56%
The huge crow loved her and she
obviously loved performing for them.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:52.900
"If it hard for me at 45 to
deal with the little bit of fame

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:58.660
that I have, how must
it have been for Anita?"

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.540
I wondered.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:08.410 position:56%
So I wrote Come Sing Jimmy Jo about
James, a shy boy who becomes a star.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.140
If you want to know what
Katherine Paterson is really like,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.770
you should read that book.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:20.980
Like James and perhaps
Anita, I'm a shy show-off,

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.100
a very private person
who loves to perform.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:32.040 position:56%
When my friend Nancy Graff read this
section on feeling famous she said,

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.840 position:56%
"Oh come on, Katherine, you know
you get a kick out of being famous."

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.140
We both laughed.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.030
I mean, I was thrilled to be
introduced to the empress of Japan

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.150
and hear her say, "Katherine
Paterson?

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:49.410
Who wrote Bridge to Terabithia?"

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.540
Sometimes I can't believe
my own life.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.080
I find my self standing on a
stage or sitting at a table

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.110
with writers I have known
and admired for many years,

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.880
really famous people and
think, "This is me here

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.080
with these amazing people."

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.910 position:56%
But that doesn't mean I feel famous.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.970
Famous is not an emotion like
love or hate or jealousy or fear,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.810
feelings with which
I am well acquainted.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:23.420
You can't feel it, but you
can learn over the years

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.230
to sit back and enjoy the perks.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.720
My special friend when
I lived in Takoma Park,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.490
Maryland, was Gene Novovitch.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.830
Gene was an established
writer when I first met her.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.590 position:56%
But not long after we became friends
my second novel was published,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:49.930
then the next four that
all won national prizes.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.110
Gene stood by me in my
triumphs, just as she would

00:09:53.110 --> 00:10:00.380
through my troubles, and always
with a wonderful sense of humor.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.110
Soon after the first Newbery, I
was scheduled to give a speech

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.580
that I knew had to be a good
one, since it seemed to me

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.170
that almost every important
children's writer and critic

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.630
on both sides of the Atlantic
was going to be in the audience.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:22.890 position:56%
We were on vacation at Lake
George, so I sent the speech to Gene

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.830
for her comments and
revised accordingly.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.600
But I was still anxious.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.650
I called her and told her
she'd just have to pray for me,

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.790
as I was afraid I was
going to fall apart.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:43.320
Gene, a devout Roman
Catholic, promised she'd pray,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.860
but told me to calm down.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.990
It would be all right.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.160
It was all right.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.630
And I called her to tell
her it had gone all right

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.670
and thanked her for her prayers.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.920
"If I'd known how efficacious Roman
Catholic prayers were," I said,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.370
"I might have converted long ago."

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:15.420
"Well, I did pray," she said,
"and he said, "Katherine who?"

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.820
[ Laughter ]

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.660
When I moved to Vermont, Gene
got in touch with Grace Greene,

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.730
a friend I had made soon
after moving, and I--

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:30.670
and told her that as long as I was
in Maryland and even in Virginia,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:36.340 position:56%
she had been able to keep me humble,
but Vermont was just too far away,

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:40.360
so she was turning
the job over to Grace.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:47.320
I wondered if Grace had taken
the job a little too seriously

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.490
when she told me the
following story.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.910
A small group of us gather
periodically to do pastel painting

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.930
and on the night of January
5th, 2010, I was missing.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.520
Grace had gotten an invitation,
so she knew that I was

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.540
in Washington being presented
as the new Ambassador

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.890
for Young People's Literature, but
when the others asked where I was,

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.930
Grace said, "She's in
Washington being made a

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.480
national embarrassment."

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.240
When she realized what she had
said, she tried to correct herself.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.980
"Oh, no, I mean natural
embarrassment."

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.860
Gene would have loved
that very Freudian slip.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:42.590
So real friends like mine are
more precious than awards.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:50.510 position:56%
Since that's true, I know I am truly
blessed and gratitude, unlike fame,

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.480
is something you can actually feel.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:13:00.870
Now, I don't think it's a secret
with anyone that I was born

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.970
in China, if you know
anything about me.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:08.980
And twice during my childhood, we
had to come to the United States

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:15.190
because of World War-- of the World
War, first war between and Japan.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.400
And then when it was feared
that America would soon be

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.890
in the war, a second evacuation.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:27.910
By the time I was five, I have
been through war and evacuation

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:34.010
but nothing prepared me for the
American public school system.

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.000
I only remember one classmate

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.060
from the first grade
at Kinder Park School.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.950
Her name was Martha and
she had a beauty mark

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.780
on her cheek beside her lip, which
we all thought was very exotic.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.370
She was the queen of the class,
and although I didn't know much

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:58.420
about Valentine's Day, I knew
hat everyone was expected

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.220
to give Martha a valentine.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:07.230 position:56%
When the valentines were passed out,
the pile on Martha's desk proved

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.310
that everyone, including
me, had complied.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:18.140
I waited a bit anxiously, but
the valentine delivery boy passed

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:24.730
by my desk every time without
putting anything on it.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.070
I don't think I was
particularly surprised.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.010
I understood somehow that I
was invisible in that class.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:37.050
But on the way home, I
realized that my older brother

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.820
and sister were carrying
valentines they had received,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:46.300
which they happily showed off
to mother as soon as we arrived.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.880
I was embarrassed when
she asked to see mine.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.900
I hated to confess that I
didn't have any to show.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.170
It seemed like a character flaw.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:01.550
But mother was outraged, "How could
any teacher let a little girl come

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.720
home from first without
a single valentine?"

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.880
It was a question she
seemed to pondered more

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.320
than once over the years.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.700
After I was an established writer,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.030
she asked me why I
didn't write a story

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.840
about the day I didn't
get any valentines.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.580
"Why mother," I said.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.510
"All my books are about the day
I didn't get any valentines."

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.540
[ Laughter ]

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.670
And then second evacuation in the
United States eventually took us

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.380
to Winston-Salem North Carolina
where I became a student,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:45.130
a very unhappy student at the
Calvin H. Wiley Elementary School.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:52.040
There were terrible things about
the school for me initially.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.340
But the worst of all was Pansy, the
seventh grade bully, who along were

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:02.490
with her two large friends,
terrorized me on the playground.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:07.910
Since there were no girl friends
to hang out with during recess,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:13.220
I would stand trembling as close
to the school building as I could,

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.090
watching Pansy and her
friends coming toward me

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.840
from the bottom of
the huge playground.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.420
"I'm going to report you,"
she said to me one day.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.370
"You're walking on the grass."

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:35.060
I looked down at the hard,
bare ground under my feet.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:38.840
"There's no grass here,"
I protested.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:46.730 position:56%
"Of course not," she said, "because
people like you keep walking on it."

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:52.580
Now being reported was like
being indicted for a felony.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.300
I lived in dread for days.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.660
I couldn't tell my
parents, they had gone

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.790
to my aunt Katherine's
funeral in Lexington.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.620
And even after they returned,
I couldn't tell them.

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:10.820
I was sure the disgrace would have
been too much for them to bear.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:16.960
Every recess Pansy would tell me
that any moment, I would be called

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.150
to the principal's office.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:26.350
One day I was so frightened that
I broke into tears in music class.

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:30.820
Mrs. Obershein, the beautiful
music teacher quietly took me

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.690
out into the hall and gently
asked me what was the matter.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.950
I blurted out my crime
and Pansy's threat.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:41.690
She didn't laugh.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.720
She didn't even smile.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:49.630
She simply assured me that I
would not be expelled for walking

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:56.940
on the imaginary grass, indeed
she was quite sure I wouldn't even

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.080
be reprimanded.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.090
I should just go to the girls' room
and wash my face and come to class

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.190
when I was feeling better.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:13.600
I recognized that some of my
best writing had its seeds

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.830
in that awful year, but I
can't remember once saying

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:24.630
to my nine-year-old
self, "Buck up, old girl.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:29.210
Someday you're going to make a
mint out of all this misery."

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.010
There were, however, a
few people that I remember

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.010
with great fondness
from that horrible year.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.900
One was, of course, Mrs. Obershein,
who not only taught me how

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.330
to do-re-mi, but also showed
me that there were adults

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.720
who could deeply empathize with
a child's irrational fears.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.150
Another was the librarian of
the Calvin H. Wiley School,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:09.110 position:56%
who made the library a sanctuary and
a source of comfort and delight--

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.810
sorry, in an otherwise
frightening place.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:25.280
And then-- And then
there was Eugene Hammet,

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.520
the other weird kid
in the fourth grade.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:34.520
I have told the story
of Eugene so many times

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:41.730 position:56%
that I am sure there are people in
the audience that could lip sync it,

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.060
but I can't resist
telling it again here.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.710
In fact at this point, I
usually say, "How many people

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:55.320 position:56%
in this audience have never heard me
tell the story of Eugene Hammett."

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:03.790
Good. Because I have sworn
I will continue to the story

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.890
as long there's one hand goes up.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:18.140 position:56%
Though Eugene and I became friends
sometime in the course of that year,

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:23.910
there was an important
difference between me and Eugene.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:29.320
I was weird through
no choice of my own.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.790
I spoke English, as my
friends in Shanghai had,

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.970
with something of a British accent.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:43.640
I could hardly afford lunch, much
less closes, so my classmates would

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.980
from time to time recognize
on my back one

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.840
of their own donations to charity.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.840
On December 7th, the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.740
and because it was known that I had
come from that part of the world,

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.900
there were dark hints that
I might be one of them.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:14.770
Eugene on the other hand, was weird
by choice or mostly by choice.

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.310
I guess he didn't choose his looks.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:25.300
He was a perfectly round
little boy who wore full-moon,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:32.040
steel-rimmed glasses, long before
John Lennon made them acceptable,

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.880
and sported a half-inch
blond brush cut.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:45.770 position:56%
My only ambition in the fourth grade
was to become somehow less weird.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:52.510
Eugene's declared ambition
was to become a ballet dancer.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.910
In North Carolina, in 1941,
little boys, even well-built

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.840
or skinny little boys, did not want

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.600
to be ballet dancers
when they grew up.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:16.570 position:56%
Now, sometimes outcasts despise each
other, but Eugene and I did not.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.700
We were friends for the rest of the
fourth grade and all of the fifth,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.870
sixth and seventh grades.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.290
During my public school career,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:29.540 position:56%
Calvin H. Wiley was the only school
I went to for much more than a year.

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.270
And by the time Eugene and
I were in the seventh grade.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.440
I had fulfilled my modest ambition.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.830
I was no longer regarded
as particularly weird.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:47.400
Eugene on the other hand continued

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:55.310
to march r should I say
dance to a different drummer.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.120
We moved the summer
after seventh grade.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:05.160
I grew up at last and had a full,
rich life in which people loved me

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.330
and didn't call me names,
at least not to my face.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.630
But from time to time over
he years I would think

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:17.410
of Eugene and worry about him.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.560
Whatever could have happened

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:25.460
to my chubby little friend
whose consuming passion was

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.740
to become a ballet dancer?

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:34.920
After many decades
and scene changes,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:40.450
the Paterson family was
living in Norfolk, Virginia,

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:46.340
and our son David had become,
at 17, a serious actor.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.660
But in order to get
the parts he wanted,

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.810
he realized that he needed
to take dancing lessons.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:58.500
There was, however, a problem.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:06.400
Even in 1983, boys in Norfolk,
Virginia, did not generally aspire

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.360
to become ballet dancers.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.640
He asked me to find out
about lessons he could take

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.390
without the rest of the
soccer team knowing about it.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:24.390
My friend Kathryn Morton's daughter
took ballet, so I said to Kathryn,

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.790
"David needs to take ballet
lessons, but he's not eager

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.600
for all his buddies
to know about it.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.190
Do you have any recommendations?"

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.590
"Well," she said.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.880
"If he's really serious,

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.180
Gene Hammett at Tidewater Ballet is
the best teacher anywhere around.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.360
Of course, you might find
him a bit strange, but--

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.610
" "W-w-w-wait a minute," I said.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.580
"Gene who?"

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.920
"Hammett," she said.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.460
"He sends dancers to the
Joffrey and New York City Ballet

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.500
and Alvin Ailey every year.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.900
He's especially good
with young black dancers.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.680
Terribly hard on any kid
he thinks has talent,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.530
but he'd give his life for them."

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.400
"Gene who?"

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.780
I asked again.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.410
"Hammett," she said.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.470
"You may have seen him around town.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:23.470
He's enormous and wears
his great flowing caftans.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.310
He does look a bit strange,
but he's a wonderful teacher."

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.410
"You don't happen to
know where he came from?"

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:35.570
"Well, he came here from New York."

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.380
"New York?

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.250
He wasn't a dancer?"

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.740
"Oh, yes. He was quite
good in his time.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.070
You wouldn't it by
looking at him now,

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.450
but he was a fine dancer
20, 30 years ago."

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.160
"You wouldn't happen to
know where he grew up?"

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.460
"Oh, I don't know," she said.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.300
"North Carolina somewhere I think."

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.270
"Next time you see
him, would you ask him

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:04.310
if he remembers anyone
named Katherine Womeldorf

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.780
from Calvin H. Wiley School?"

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.710
Some days later the phone rings.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.010
"Katherine?"

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.230
Said an unknown male voice.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.700
"This is Gene Hammett."

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.770
"Eugene! Do you remember me?"

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.000
"I even remember a joke you
told me in the fourth grade.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.220
I asked you why if you were born
in China you weren't Chinese.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.190
And you said, 'If a
cat's born in a garage,

00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.510
does it make it an automobile?'"

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:39.300
[ Laughter ]

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.010
See if I started writing then,
I could write funny books.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:46.490
"And what about you?

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:52.100
You danced in New York, and now
you're famous teacher of ballet.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.700
It's hard to imagine.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.440
You were a little round boy
the last time I saw you."

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.740
He laughed.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.580
"Well," he said, "now,
I'm a big round man."

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.740
I saw Eugene a number
of times after that,

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.990
and he was indeed a big round man.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:14.090
But I also saw pictures of
him leaping like a Baryshnikov

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:17.480 position:56%
from the boards of a New York stage.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.870
And even I missed knowing him
when he was slim and gorgeous

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.480
and at the height of his career,
I wouldn't give anything for known

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:32.270
that he-- it had happened as
he had determined it would,

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:35.910
back then when we were both
weird little nine-year-old

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.650
at Calvin H. Wiley School.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:43.420
I tried a couple of times
to put Eugene into a novel,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:48.600
but I found that you can't
put real people into books.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.900
Characters in books
have to be believable.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.630
And real people especially people

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.120
like Eugene are simply
not believable.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.720
I did try to put Pansy,
the seventh grade bully

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.900
into Bridge to Terabithia.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.280
It was going to be
the perfect revenge

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:14.080 position:56%
for all those terrifying recess
hours she caused me, but here again,

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.120
I don't know why Pansy was a bully.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.800
I know that people aren't born
bullies and that no one is a bully

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.690
or a snob, who is comfortable
with himself or herself.

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:29.580
But I had to know why
Janice Avery was a bully.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:33.450
And when I knew, I
feel sorry for her.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.810
Before I finished the
book, I rather liked her.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:41.340
It ruined my plan for revenge.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:47.070
I heard somewhere that unless you
can find yourself in your villain,

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.380
he or she will remain in
a cardboard character.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:56.350
Good advice for fledging
writers, I believe.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:11.140
I asked David's permission
because the book that--

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.550
if you know anything about me,
the book that you know is Bridge

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:18.710
to Terabithia and I asked David's
permission to read the story.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:24.550
And he gave me that permission.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:30.740
And this is a story you
may already know again.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:40.470
But, I'm going to read it and then
we'll take some time for questions.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:44.760
If the fourth grade at Wiley
School was the most miserable year

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.660
of my childhood, I think I would
have to choose the year 1974

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:53.240
as the most painful
year of my adult life.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.920
I was working on The Master
Puppeteer when I was sent

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.340
to the hospital to see
about a suspicious lump

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.040
that turned out to be a malignancy.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.700
It was obvious that I--

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.500
It is obvious today that I
survived my bout with cancer.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:14.140 position:56%
In the year since I have enjoyed
remarkably good health, but in 1974,

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.460
I didn't know what
the future would be

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.600
or if I had one to look forward to.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.740
Now children are often
afraid of death,

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.610
and I certainly was as a child.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.950
But I was 41 years old now
with four young children,

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.140
and it was not only
the dread of dying,

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:35.170
but the idea of leaving
my children behind

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.110
that I could not bear to imagine.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.790
I knew my lovely husband
would be fine.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.570
There would be women lining up
around the block to snatch him

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.450
up the moment I was
out of the picture.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:50.900
One of them might even turn out
to be a better mother than I was.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.820
But, surely I thought, no one,
however fit to replace me,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.050
could ever love those
children the way I did.

00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:04.150
Of course, my death would
not leave my children alone.

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:07.510
They had a loving father and
grandparents and aunts and uncles

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:11.900
and a whole congregation of
people who would care for them.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.500
Lin and John were not
only brother and sister,

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.650
but the closest of friends.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.790
Mary had a wonderful teacher with a
daughter just Mary's age who looked

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.210
after her while I was in the
hospital and, would, I knew,

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.650
continue to care for her.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.030
And David had Lisa.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:34.520
Lisa had come into our
lives the previous autumn.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:39.010
The small school that our
children attended was closed

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.660
and all the students were moved

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:46.010
to a much larger elementary
school across town.

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.280
David, our second grader
was miserable.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:57.530 position:56%
In the little school he was both the
class artist and the class clown.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:01.550
In his new school,
he was simply weird.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:06.720
Every day he came home and
declared that he was never, ever,

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.450
ever going back to that
school and you can't make me.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.710
And I, his mother, who had been
in fifteen different schools

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.230
by the time I was 18 and
had been initially despised

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.320
at nearly every one,
was over-identifying

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:25.800
with my seven-year-old, probably
exacerbating his misery, but,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.660
nevertheless getting him up every
morning and grimly piercing--

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.270
pushing him out the door,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:37.070
fearing that his unhappiness
would never end.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.250
Then one afternoon, our
bright funny little boy

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:45.750
that I thought was gone forever
came running into the house.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.690
"Me and Lisa Hill are making
a diorama of Little House

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:52.010
in the Big Woods," he
announced cheerily.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.750
I had never heard the name
before, but from then on I was

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:01.000
to hear hardly any other name.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.100 position:56%
"Now I'd like to promise you girls,"
I say when I'm talking to students,

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.260
"that I was thrilled that my
son's best friend was a girl.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:14.960
But unfortunately,
all I could think was,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.280
they thought he was weird before,
now he's never going to fit in."

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:25.830
But then I met Lisa, and
my worries evaporated.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.260
Anyone would be fortunate to
have her for his best friend.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.480
She was bright, imaginative
and funny.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.910
She laughed at his
jokes and he at hers.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.960
She was the only girl daring enough

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.190
to invade the second
grade boys' ball team.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:47.620
She and David played together after
school in the woods below her house

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.460
and talked to each other in
the evenings on the phone.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:55.990
"It's your girlfriend, David,"
his older brother would say.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:59.270
But David would take
the phone unperturbed.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.410
Girlfriends are people who
chase you down on the playground

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:04.940
to grab you and kiss you.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:06.660
Lisa was no more a girlfriend

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.510
than Margaret Thatcher
was a Playboy Bunny.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.250
[ Laughter ]

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:19.490
Then on an August morning,
the phone rang.

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:23.180
It was a call from the
Hill's next door neighbor.

00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:28.340
"I thought you ought to
know," Mrs. Robinson said,

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.110
"hat Lisa was killed this morning."

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.640
While the family was on
vacation at Bethany Beach,

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.110
on a day when the lifeguards sensed
no danger from thunder far off

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:44.990
in the distance, a joyful
little girl, dancing on a rock

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:53.970
above the beach, was felled by a
bolt of lightning from the sky.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:58.450
How was I to make sense of
this tragedy for my child?

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.720
I couldn't make sense
of it for myself.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:10.440
So, eventually, I began to
write a story, because I knew

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.300
that a story has to make sense.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:21.050
It has a beginning, a middle and an
end, and when you get to the end,

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:26.490
even if you cannot articulate
intellectually what has happened,

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:32.370
you know emotionally, that you
have come from chaos to order.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:40.310
In thus spoke Zarathustra,
Nietzche says, "One must have chaos

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:46.030
within to give birth
to a dancing star."

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:52.770
And somehow, as dark as
life itself sometimes seems,

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:55.330
at the end of a well-told story,

00:35:55.330 --> 00:36:04.080
the dancing star will
shed light on the chaos.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:08.920
So, I began to write what I
could not understand or explain,

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:13.960
but when I came to the place in my
story when I knew that if I went

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.650
to work the next day I
would write the chapter

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:23.560
in which Leslie Burke would die,
I did the only thing I could do

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.060
to keep her alive,
I didn't go to work.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:31.470
I caught up on my mail.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.910
I rearranged my bookshelves.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.770
I think I was even reduced to
scrubbing the kitchen floor,

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:42.250
anything to keep from
writing the fatal chapter.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.720
It was just then that I
happened to have lunch

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.270
with a former Richmond classmate.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.830
"How's your new book coming?"

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:53.030
She asked.

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.320
Now, no one, as the
longsuffering members

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:02.020
of my immediate family know all
too well, no one is ever supposed

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:08.130 position:56%
to ask me how my work is coming, but
Estelle had known me longer than any

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.720
of them, and she has no respect.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:16.050
So I blurted out an answer,
"I'm trying to write a book

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:19.380
about a friendship
between a boy and a girl

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.870
in which the girl dies," I said.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.750
"But I can't let her die.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:29.580
I guess," I added,
thinking I was very wise,

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.320
"I guess I can't face going
through Lisa's death again."

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.750
Estelle looked me straight
in the eye.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:43.420
"I don't think it's Lisa's
death you can't face," she said.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.520
"I think it's yours."

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.540
I knew she was right.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.490
If it were Lisa's death I
couldn't face, it was one thing,

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.290
but if it was my death
I couldn't face,

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.830
then I would have to
finish the book.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.120
I went home that afternoon, and
with sweat pouring down my arms,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.240
wrote the chapter and in a
few days finished the draft.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:10.790
It was the most painful
writing I had ever done,

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:16.090
so painful that I simply could not
stand having it around the house,

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.910
so I did what no real writer
would ever do, I mailed the draft

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:24.070
to Virginia Buckley before
the sweat had evaporated.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:27.970
As soon as I mailed the manuscript,

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.230
I knew that I had made
a terrible mistake.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:35.890
Every day I expected the letter
that would tell me politely,

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.310
maybe even a little sorrowfully,

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:43.430
that I had obviously lost whatever
talent I had shown up until then,

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:47.830 position:56%
that my career as a writer was over.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.160
Instead I got a phone call.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.430
It was Virginia, saying
that she wanted to talk

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.080
to me about my new manuscript.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.380
I stopped breathing.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:03.920
"I laughed through the
first two-thirds," she said,

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.260
"and cried through the last."

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.010
I began to breath again.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:14.710
"Now," she continued,
"Let'' turn it into a book."

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:18.980
And then she did what I
believe the great editors do,

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:22.790
she asked me about the question
that would do just that.

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:27.790
"Is this," she asked, "
a story about friendship

00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.320
or is it a story about death?"

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:37.030
Until that moment, I had thought
I was writing a story about death.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.930
Hadn't it been a year
of death in our lives?

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.580
But as soon as she asked the
question, I knew I was wrong.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:49.860
"Oh," I said, "it's a
story about friendship."

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:56.550
"Then you need to go back
and write it that way."

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:01.150 position:56%
She went on to remind me that in any
true friendship both friends change

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.030
and grow because they
know each other.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:07.390
"I see how Jesse has changed
because he has known Leslie,

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:12.530
but I don't see how knowing
Jesse has changed Leslie.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.340
How has Jesse made a
difference in her life?"

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:22.260 position:56%
That was the problem that had to be
solved to turn my pitiful little cry

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.140
of anguish into a real story.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.510
And as I pondered it, up from
the dust of the playground

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:36.380
at Calvin H. Wiley School arose
Pansy and her two gigantic cohorts

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:41.060
who had bullied me when
I was a fourth grader.

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.020
I meant to leave much more
time for questions and I seemed

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.960
to be I don't know who's
flashing things at to me.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.560
I have 10 minutes left,
so let's stop

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.510
and at least have a few minutes--

00:40:53.510 --> 00:41:01.420
[ Applause ]

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.400
Thank you.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.940
The questions are often
the most fun, so.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.730
I just saw in my hotel
room a New Yorker cartoon

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:22.290
in which the writer says,
"That's a very good question.

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.750
Would you ask it again tomorrow?"

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I have a question--

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.900
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Is there-- are there--

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.120 position:56%
yeah, somebody is waving back there.

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So, I
know you've written--

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.900
so you've mentioned how
Bridge to Terabithia came

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.010
from your story about your family.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.600
You've also written from your
experiences in China and Japan.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.860
My question is about
Jacob Have I Loved,

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.160
which is my personal favorite book.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.460
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.760
So I'm-- yeah.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.670
So I'm just curious where
that story came from and how

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.630
that came alive for
you in that process.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.930
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I have to
tell you I'll be 84 next month

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.360
and my hearing-- even with
hearing aids is imperfect,

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.330
but I think you're asking
me about Jacob Have I Loved.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:04.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yes.

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:05.930
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: OK.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:09.970
I wrote the book because
I had lovely adult friends

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.510
who would say things to
me like, what do you know,

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:17.730
my mother always loved him best
or if my sister hadn't so and so

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.280 position:56%
when I was seven-years-old, my whole
life would have been different.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.270
And I thought, she's really
strange, these people still hang

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.340
up on their childhood jealousies.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.770
And I began to think
about it, I thought,

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:31.650
"This is a universal problem.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:35.120 position:56%
We have more trouble with our
siblings than we do with our pairs."

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.720
Floyd [assumed spelling]
had it all wrong.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.970
I mean, you go to the Bible,
what's the first murder?

00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:45.020
And you'd go through-- and so I
thought, "Hmm, I will write a book

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.640
about this universal theme."

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:54.780
And when I sat down to write, I was
so angry, every morning that I sat

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.560
down to the typewriter
that I could barely type.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:06.280
And I thought, "Hmm, maybe it
is not my friend's problem."

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.520
But writing a book is a lot
cheaper than psychotherapy.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thank you.

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:17.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Hi.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.200
Thank you so much for being here.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:27.140
I just wanted to-- well, OK, so in
2010, I was about nine-years-old

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.730
and I had the privilege to
play Mabel in the Bridge

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.220
to Terabithia stage version.

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.780
And I always had this
question ever since 2010,

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.790
which was why did you
choose to use children

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.350
as your protagonists
in many of your books?

00:43:44.350 --> 00:43:45.650
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Why did I choose--

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:49.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: To use
children as protagonists.

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.880
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Why
do I write about children?

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.550
All my books are about children.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:59.670
You know, if-- it's always
amusing to me when people say,

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:06.830
"When will you get to write a real
book, you know, about adultery

00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:10.060
and suburbs or something?"

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.540
I truly love writing for children.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.830
I think they are best readers.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.560
I don't-- none of my
friends who write

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:25.270
for adults have readers who've
read their book 17, 20, 30 times.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.670
And I have new generation
of readers coming

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:34.080
up who always want their reading
to be the best book they ever read.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.960
They're reading with
expectation and hope.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:41.100
And they give you--
they're not cynical.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:46.070
And there are good readers
and they read in depth.

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.620
Whereas adults so afraid
they're not going

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.330
to read everything,
they just read too fast.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:52.820
I do that myself.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.590
So I think I have the
best readers in the world.

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:01.880
I'm not-- after 40 more
years still remain.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:08.280
Why do I want to write for books
that will be remained in six weeks?

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.980
I think-- I have the best
readership and the best position.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.770 position:56%
And I've been very fortunate through
the years because I've been allowed

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:17.640
to write what I want to write.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.690 position:56%
I had the same literature [phonetic]

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.950
for 40 years, more
than 40 years now.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:29.370
And I think that's maybe
something of a record.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.680
She's retired now.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:35.060
And I told her when she
retired, I would, but here I am.

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:40.260
So, it's been wonderful life
for me and I have minutes left.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.560
Well, just go head.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Thank you.

00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.160
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
You have a question?

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Well, I
like to but a little late.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.410
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Oh, but
I'm supposed to go back and forth.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:50.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: As my
kindergarten students would say,

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.040
she took my question.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.510
I was just going to open it
up to say what can you say

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.030
about Jacob Have I Loved,
that's my absolute favorite book

00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:59.120
of yours as well.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.420
I want to change a little bit then
to I'm about to be a mother of two,

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.370
I'm an only child, I think identify
with this even as an only child

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:12.200
as the sibling relationship, so
maybe just for the benefit of all.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:17.420
Any advice on motherhood
of siblings?

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:20.310
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I think
probably I'm not the person to--

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.260
there's a chapter in
this book on motherhood

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.590 position:56%
and then motherhood list than ideal.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:27.890
And--

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Which it always is.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: And you will
find out what kind of a mother I was

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:38.710
if you read the book and not be too
admiring and not ask me for advice.

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:42.270
I'm just very grateful they all--
four of them have survived me.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:46.460
And have-- are still nice for me.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:47.760
Didn't you see that one?

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.060
That's way--

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: You did
something great.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.010
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.250
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I don't
usually call them sweet, but--

00:46:54.250 --> 00:46:55.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Thank you.

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:56.850
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: --

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:59.030
anyhow, they've been fun
children to live with.

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:05.670
And I guess I was an old mother
and so I was always eager to see

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:08.480
who that would be and how they'd
turn out and never occurred to me

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:13.060
that I ever should tell them
what they should turn out to be.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:19.200 position:56%
And they've been-- as my mother just
say, very satisfactory children.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:20.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Thanks.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.950
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: So
I've got two minutes left

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.510
and I guess we'll take
your question,

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.260
I'll try to be a short answer.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: OK.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:28.860
So good afternoon.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.510
My question is more of a general
tactics of how to writing a book.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:35.280
I've thought about writing
a book, writing something

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.760
about my family history back
in China during 1950s and--

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.610
from 1950s to 1970s even though
we're just ordinary people,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:46.610
but I thought about it,
but I ended up giving

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:48.660
up because I think it
will be too detailed,

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:52.480
too much full of the life
routines, things like those.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:58.180
So, my question is, is there
any method, any kind of magic

00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:02.820
to turn all of these and
routine that status quo

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:05.520
of daily life into
real magical book?

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.060
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Any magic?

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:13.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: I can't find a
better term in English, I'm sorry.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.420
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I
do have a hearing problem.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.150
So what I'm hearing you
saying, you wanted to write

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:21.630
about your family and
your childhood.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:25.620
And I think frankly,
everybody should do that.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:31.230
I really do think, just the
process itself is wonderful,

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:36.110 position:56%
and your children and your
grandchildren will thank you for it.

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:41.220
I-- There's so many things I wish
I had asked my parents [inaudible]

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.860
like why in the world
was my mother who grew

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.580
up in Georgia really before
people had radios in the house.

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:53.620
Why was she a Brooklyn Dodgers fan?

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Right.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.230
Right. Right.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: So that's
the kind of question you need to ask

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.460
and that's the kind of heritage
you need to leave your children.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.630 position:56%
And I think probably they're going o
be waving those thing and telling me

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.100
to shut up, but thank you
so much for being here.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.400
