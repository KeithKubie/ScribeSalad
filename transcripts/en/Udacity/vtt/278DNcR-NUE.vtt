00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.320
Let's understand what happens when you click

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.910
the mouse on your computer. Let's say you're

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.030
running the Google Earth application and you select

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.970
the point that you want to visit on

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.380
the globe by clicking the mouse. When

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.800
you click the mouse, first the hardware controller

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.190
that is interfacing the mouse, which is a

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.070
hardware device. To the system using the conduit

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.030
of the bus is going to raise an interrupt

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.200
on the interupt line which is one of the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.060
dedicated lines on the bus. This conduit, which I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.280
call the bus, contains, as you know, data lines and

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.150
address lines and one of the things it also

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.200
contains is an interrupt line or multiple interrupt lines.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.870
And the controller asserts this interrupt line to indicate

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.060
to the CPU that it wants attention. It's sort of like,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.480
if I'm teaching a class and you all

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.230
were a live audience. If you have a question,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.350
you might raise your hand and that's exactly

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.090
what happens when you click the mouse. The equivalent

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.140
of raising your hand in a classroom is

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.790
what the controller is doing, but asserting the interrupt

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.300
line on the bus. Asserting the interrupt line on

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.380
the bus results in an interrupt to the CPU,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.670
now the processor at this point of time,

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.960
is running some program. Perhaps your Google Earth

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260
application is being run on the CPU at

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.690
this point of time. An interrupt is a hardware

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.680
mechanism for alerting the processor that something external,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.440
in this case the mouse click, requires the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.170
attention of the processor. It's sort of like a

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.020
doorbell in a house. Someone is ringing the doorbell,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.290
someone has got to pay attention to who is at the door. Remember that the CPU is

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.930
a dumb animal. All it can do is execute

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.620
instructions. Right now, it's executing some application. Now, an

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.870
interrupt comes in, some other program has to run

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.870
on it, in order to field that interrupt, answer

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.780
the doorbell. Who's that entity? That is the operating

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.700
system. The operating system, which is also a collection

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.930
of programs, schedules itself to run on the processor so that it can answer the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.030
doorbell. So the operating system is the one that fields this interrupt, finds

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.860
out, who it is intended for, and passes it to the program for appropriate

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.130
action for this particular interrupt. This example

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.700
of a mouse click and what happens between

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.840
the hardware and the software is a good way to segue into the abstractions

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.650
provided by an operating system for managing the hardware resources.
