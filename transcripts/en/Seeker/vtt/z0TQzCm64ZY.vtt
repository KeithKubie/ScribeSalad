00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.090
You’re sweaty, get chills, and generally
feel terrible.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.060
You, my friend, have a fever.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:11.080
But, before you reach for the medicine cabinet,
you may want to reconsider breaking it.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.180
Hey there, Kaylee here with DNews.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.320
Throughout the day, your body temperature
can vary depending on the time, your level

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.029
of activity, and age, although it averages
to about 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.029
Celsius.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.310
Fun fact: at night, your core body temperature
drops slightly, allowing you to fall asleep.6

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.410
But a temperature over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit,
or 38 degrees Celsius, usually means that

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.660
you have a fever caused by infections or an
illness.5

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.921
Fever, also known as pyrexia, is an important
part of the immune system’s response to

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.090
an invading bacterium or virus.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.720
The immune system produces pyrogens, which
travel through the blood to the brain, finally

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.010
reaching the hypothalamus, the body’s thermostat.2
This then raises the body’s temperature

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.740
above the normal range, and, lo and behold,
you are lying in bed, covered in blankets,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.450
fondly remembering the times when you felt
normal.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.030
If you’re really uncomfortable, you might
decide to take an antipyretic, or fever-reducing

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.040
medication.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.719
This will inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase
and reduce the level of prostaglandin E2 in

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:14.499
the hypothalamus.9 In plain English, the medicine
overrides the signals that tell your hypothalamus

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:17.529
to elevate your body temperature and will
reduce it instead.

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:20.259
But having a fever is actually a good sign!

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.200
It means that our bodies are beginning to
fight off the infection.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.999
Previously, scientists believed that the elevated
temperature might inhibit the growth of some

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.060
viruses or bacteria and potentially even kill
them.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
However, a study published in the Journal
of Leukocyte Biology found that a fever also

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.560
helps certain types of immune cells to do
their job better.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.630
In the study, researchers injected mice with
an antigen and then monitored the activation

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.560
of a type of lymphocyte called CD8+ cytotoxic
T cells, which are capable of killing cells

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.640
infected with viruses and even cancer cells.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.249
Half of the mice’s body temperatures were
raised 2 degrees Celsius while the other half

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:55.249
was left alone.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.259
The results showed that the mice whose temperature
was raised had more of the CD8+ T cells than

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.389
the control mice.1 3

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:05.979
This suggests that elevated body temperature
may enhance the function of the immune system,

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.649
meaning that we can get better faster.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.040
If left untreated, a fever will normally only
last two or three days, but the duration can

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.310
vary.7 8 So, as uncomfortable as it is, you
may be better off not taking any medicine

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.310
to reduce it.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.950
HOWEVER, it is important to note that this
is only recommended for mild fevers.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.219
If your body temperature is over 108 degrees
Fahrenheit, you may be in trouble.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.659
If it becomes too high, you’ll definitely
want to go see a doctor.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.959
Fevers from infections rarely get this high,
and are instead usually caused by heat strokes.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.090
See, when your body temperature gets high,
you sweat to cool down.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.379
As a consequence, your body loses water and
salt, which are essential for normal functioning.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.299
And if you’ve already lost a lot of water
and become dehydrated, you may not be able

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.409
to sweat fast enough to dissipate the heat,
causing your body temperature to rise even

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.409
further.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.090
You know how your parents always tell you
to stay hydrated when you are sick?

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.090
Yeah, that’s why.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.640
At such a high temperature, proteins and cell
membranes, especially in the brain, can be

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.409
destroyed or malfunction.

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.500
Heart muscle cells and blood vessels can break
down, damage can occur to internal organs,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.080
and, in the worst case, a fever can cause
death.4

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.359
While a fever may help you get over your infection
faster, the brain and body can only handle

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.359
so much.

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.299
What’s the worst fever that you’ve ever
had?

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.680
And what do you normally do to get over it?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.280
Let us know in the comments and if you want
to know more about temperature’s effect

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.659
on sleep, head over to my personal channel,
Explorium, to find out if sleeping naked is

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:36.999
better 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:42.769
for you.
