00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.150
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.590
The story of how most
countries in the world

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.290
came to adopt legal reinforcements
for technological protection measures,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.100
commonly known TPM's, is
very long and complicated.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.430
In this last segment
of the lecture, I'll

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.350
provide you an abridged
version of the story.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.130
If you'd like more detail you
might consult chapter three

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.590
of my book, Promises to Keep, from
which this abridged version will

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.450
be distilled.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.070
In the early 1990's,
entertainment companies

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.110
dismayed by the increasing
frequency with which

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.380
digital copies of their products
were being copied and redistributed,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.380
and by the apparent inability of
the law to halt this behavior,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.250
began to experiment with encryption
as an alternative way of preventing,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.640
or at least discouraging,
unauthorized uses their products.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.230
Examples of such experiments included
the content scramble system, commonly

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.390
known a CSS, which is used
to inhibit reproduction

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.250
of the copies of audiovisual
works housed on DVDs,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.920
the secure digital music
initiative, commonly

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.870
known as SDMI, which was supposed
to provide even stronger protection

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.820
for sound recordings, and
the Real Audio and Real Video

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.670
format's developed by the
firm Real Networks that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.630
enabled users of those formats to turn
on or off of a virtual switch, which

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.110
controlled whether person's to
whom formatted works were streamed

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.012
could make copies of this works.

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.970
As the entertainment
companies soon discovered,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.640
this strategy was at best imperfect.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.100
Every time they deployed one of these
technologies someone, surprisingly

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.620
often a teenager, would crack it.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.370
Once the technological
wrappers had been removed,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.020
the naked digital files could
be re-distributed promiscuously.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.669
So the entertainment companies
began to look to the law for aid.

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:19.460
To understand the nature
of the strategy it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.460
may help to turn, once
again, to copyright theory.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.460
You'll recall, I hope, that the premise
of the welfare theory of copyright,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.360
and of intellectual property in general,
is that intellectual products are

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.900
public goods that will be
produced at suboptimal levels

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.170
unless the government
intervenes in some way

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.250
to stimulate their
creation and dissemination.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.510
Over the centuries, governments
had used five different techniques

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.940
to provide the necessary stimulus.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.110
The five options, with which
you should now be familiar,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.540
are listed on your screen.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.190
Until this point in the lecture,
we have been overwhelmingly

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.950
concerned with the fifth
option, the essence of which

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.980
is that the government protects authors
and artists against competition--

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.100
in other words, forbids competitors
to make, distribute, or perform

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.730
copies of their works
without permission.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.410
That, as you well know, is the
fundamental principle of copyright law,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.440
at least as seen through
the lens of welfare theory.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.460
When the entertainment companies
sought the assistance of the law

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.070
in buttressing their
shaky encryption systems,

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.570
they were in effect stepping
outside the zone of copyright law

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.040
and relying on an altogether
different approach.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.370
In particular, they were employing
a variant of strategy number four.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.880
They were relying upon a
self-help approach, specifically

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.350
technological protections
for copies of their works,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.500
and soliciting legal
reinforcement for that strategy.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.420
In this respect, their approach
was analogous to trade secret law.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.950
In that context as well, companies
rely on self-help, specifically efforts

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.900
to keep their innovations secret,
but then turn to the law for aid

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.089
when economic espionage or faithless
employees cause that secrecy to fail.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.320
In short, the entertainment
companies new approach was not really

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.320
an example of copyright law at
all, even though, as you'll see,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.700
they plugged the statutory reforms
they sought into the copyright statute

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.580
in the United States.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.770
In truth, this approach is a
different animal altogether

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.920
and had quite different
strengths and weaknesses.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.020
For that reason, it's sometimes
referred to as paracopyright.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.520
OK.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.470
Back to our story.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.400
The law in the United States
as it existed in the mid-1990's

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.920
failed to provide the entertainment
companies the aid they sought.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.970
To be sure, the federal statutes
contained a few specialized provisions

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.960
that forbade circumvention of
particular encryption systems.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.140
For example, it was illegal
to manufacture or distribute

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.790
devices designed to descramble the
signals provided by cable television

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.850
systems or digital
satellite systems, but there

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.590
was no provision forbidding
encryption circumvention in general.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.630
Judge-made law was even more unhelpful.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.687
For example, in the case of Volt
Corporation vs. Quaid Software

00:05:28.687 --> 00:05:30.520
the Fifth Circuit Court
of appeals had ruled

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.670
that the creation and sale of a software
program designed to circumvent the copy

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.380
controls on a diskette did not
make the creator of such a program

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.890
liable for contributory
copyright infringement,

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.100
because the program had a substantial
non-infringing use, mainly

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.610
enabling the making of archival copies.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.560
And as I explained in lecture number
nine, in the Sega enterprises case

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.830
the Ninth Circuit had refused to
find a game manufacturer liable

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.780
when it circumvented Sega's lockout
mechanism preventing unlicensed game

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.585
developers from building games
compatible with its Genesis console.

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:11.150
 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:19.390
So, existing law was unhelpful the
companies therefore sought new law.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.280
The path to the reforms they
wanted proved circuitous.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.450
First, they plead their case to the
Information Infrastructure Task Force,

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.570
commonly abbreviated as the IITF, the
group appointed by President Clinton

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.970
to articulate and implement
the administration's

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.880
vision for the National
Information Infrastructure.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.930
The crucial subcommittee within
the IITF was the working group

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.110
on intellectual property
rights chaired by Bruce

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.200
Lehman, a former copyright
industry lobbyist

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.800
who had recently been appointed the
commissioner of patents and trademarks.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.070
Lehman and the IITF proved receptive.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.920
In their preliminary report, known
as the "green paper," and again

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.490
in their final report,
known as the "white paper,"

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.440
they recommended the
adoption of a quote,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.840
"prohibition on devices,
products, components, and services

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.560
that defeat technological
methods of preventing

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.780
unauthorized use of
copyrighted materials."

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.960
Ignoring the objections of some
vigorous critics of this proposal.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.560
Surprisingly however, Congress was
more attentive to the critics arguments

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.200
and moreover was distracted by an
upcoming election, and as a result

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.960
failed to adopt the
administration's recommendation.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.650
So Mr. Lehman cleverly pursued
an alternative approach.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.110
Instead of continuing to
pound on Congress's door,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.290
he turned to treaty making.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.310
In 1996 in his capacity as
the United States delegate

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.170
to the World Intellectual
Property Organization,

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.410
Lehman pressed for adoption
of a new treaty that

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.430
would embody the critical
provisions of the now rejected

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.210
argument in the white paper.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.670
He didn't get all that
he wanted, but he was

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:19.890
able to secure-- specifically in Article
11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty--

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.030
a moderate version of the provisions
that he had originally sought.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.910
Quote, "contracting parties shall
provide adequate legal protection

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.900
and effective legal remedies
against the circumvention

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.770
of effective technological measures
that are used by authors in connection

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:42.280
with the exercise of their rights under
this treaty or the Berne Convention.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.950
And that restrict acts in
respect of their works,

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:51.210
which are not authorized by the authors
concerned or by or permitted by law."

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.970
Lehman then returned to the United
States and approached Congress

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.880
with a new argument.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:01.140
Congress, he argued, needed to modify
federal law in the United States

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.880
to fulfill the obligations to
which the United States would soon

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.360
be subject under the new treaty.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.300
There ensued a protracted hard fought
battle among the relevant interest

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.750
groups, a battle chronicled
by Pam Samuelson.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:20.430
Lehman and his allies eventually
emerged bloody but victorious,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:25.940
specifically as part of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.760
as you now know conventionally
abbreviated to DMCA.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.570
They obtained two new
provisions now embodied

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:38.190
in sections 1201 and 1202
of the copyright statute.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.750
Of the two provisions,
1201 is the more important.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.450
The critical language is
indicated on your screen.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.980
Section 1201(a)(1)(A) provides that no
person shall circumvent a technological

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:51.890
measure.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.890
It effectively controls
access to copyrighted work.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.260
Section 1201(a)(2) provides that no
person shall manufacture or import,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:05.700
offer to the public, provide or
otherwise traffic in any technology

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.380
product service device component or
part thereof that is primarily designed

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.540
or produced for the purpose
of such circumvention.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.800
Finally, section 1201(b)
contains a similar ban

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.810
on the production or distribution
of technology, primarily designed

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.850
to circumvent technologies
that effectively protect

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.930
the exclusive rights
of a copyright owner--

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.800
the exclusive rights to
reproduce the work adapted,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.240
performed publicly, and so forth.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.110
Parties injured by
violations of these rules

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.090
can bring civil lawsuit to halt
the practices and collect damages.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.540
In addition, willful
violation of the rules

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.210
for commercial advantage
or personal gain

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.830
subjects the offender to
substantial criminal penalties.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.370
 

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.240
As you undoubtedly noticed, there
are some important ambiguities

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.900
in these provisions.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.190
What exactly does circumvent mean?

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.510
For example, if I give my password to a
friend who then uses it to gain access

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:10.640
to a copyrighted recording
or program, have I

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.230
or has she circumvented the
technological protection

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.510
system that requires that password?

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:23.220
What does it mean to effectively
control access to a copyrighted work?

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.310
What activities other than
manufacturing and distributing

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.300
are encompassed by
the ban on trafficking

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.220
in circumvention technologies?

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.880
Some of these ambiguities are addressed,
though not with great clarity,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.690
by definitions contained in
other parts of the statute.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.800
 

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.400
The prohibitions contained
in 1201(a) and 1201(b)

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:51.090
are tempered, as you can see, by a
list of exceptions, some of which

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:53.230
are also vague.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.660
For example, technologies
that are not primarily

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.060
designed for circumvention have a
more limited commercially significant

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:07.600
purpose other than convention and
are not marketed for circumvention

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.300
are exempt.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.040
Nonprofit libraries, archives,
and educational institutions

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.700
are sometimes permitted to
engage in circumvention in order

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.850
to decide whether to
acquire copyrighted work.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.100
Circumvention activities for the
purpose of reverse engineering

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:26.170
to achieve interoperability
among computer programs, security

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.580
testing, encryption research,
and controlling minors

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.190
access to pornography
are all privileged.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.180
Finally, every three years
the librarian of Congress

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:41.630
is required to promulgate
regulations exempting

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.040
from the anti-circumvention
provision persons who would otherwise

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.170
be adversely affected in their
ability to make non-infringing uses.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.440
The most recent round
of regulations in 2010

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.340
generated some intriguing safe harbors.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.640
 

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.850
In culmination, the
importance of the issues

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.790
addressed by these statutory
provisions and the ambiguity of several

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:14.620
of their dimensions have generated
a great deal of litigation.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.520
The principal cases
are listed on the map.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.060
If you follow the links you will find
summaries of their facts and holdings

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.950
and copies of the opinions themselves.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:29.290
In the first and arguably most
important wave of these cases,

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.360
the copyright owner's that
had pressed for these statutes

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.570
and that stood to benefit most from
expensive interpretations of them

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.870
prevailed decisively.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.170
In later cases, however,
the courts have rejected

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.040
especially aggressive
applications of the provisions.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:50.640
A very rough generalization concerning
the pattern of outcomes in these cases

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.980
is that the more they have to do with
the kinds of entertainment products

00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.537
that initially provoked the statute--
music, films, games, and so forth,

00:14:00.537 --> 00:14:03.620
the more likely the courts are to find
that the behavior of the defendants

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.540
were unlawful.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.830
By contrast, in cases
where the plaintiffs have

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.520
sought to rely on these
statutory provisions

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.890
to support business models unrelated
to traditional entertainment products

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.010
the courts have been
much less sympathetic.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.520
That's a crude guideline, to be
sure, but for better or worse

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.200
it has some explanatory force.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.220
By way of illustration, I'll
describe two of the cases.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.180
Here's the first.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:38.540
In 1999, John Johansen,
a 15-year-old Norwegian,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.630
reverse engineered a licensed DVD player
and used the information he obtained

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:48.590
to write a short program designed
to descramble a signal that had been

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:54.000
scrambled by the CSS security system--
the system that I described a minute

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.990
ago that is designed to
prevent ripping DVD's.

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:04.180
Johansen's program, which he
called DCSS, was relatively simple.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.240
The original version consisted
of 60 lines of computer code.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.810
It has since been reduced to seven.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.160
Although Johansen's original purpose
apparently was the relatively benign

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.340
goal of developing a DVD player that
could operate on the Linux operating

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:27.420
system, his creation enabled many
other less innocent uses of the video

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.190
recordings distributed on DVD's.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.200
Once descrambled, they could be
stored, compressed, reproduced

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.840
and redistributed.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.560
Copies of DCSS spread
quickly over the internet.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:45.560
Within a month, many websites offered
user-friendly downloadable versions

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:50.350
the program in both source
code and object code.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.510
The major film studios, seeking
to stop or at least slow

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.450
the spread of what they
regarded as an infection,

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:02.160
invoked the DMCA to demand that
the operators of those websites

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.820
remove the program from their servers.

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.530
Some of those operators,
including Eric Corely,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.410
the editor of a print
magazine boldly named 2,600:

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:21.250
The Hacker Quarterly, and an
accompanying website refused to comply.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:26.030
In response, the studios brought suit,
accusing Corley and others of quote,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:30.520
"trafficking in
circumvention technology."

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.495
Judge Lewis Kaplan found that the
defendants had indeed violated Section

00:16:34.495 --> 00:16:39.210
1201(a)(2), the ban on trafficking
in technology designed to circumvent

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.500
restrictions on access
to copyrighted works.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:49.070
In his judgment, none of the
statutory exemptions were applicable.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.550
He then rejected the defendant's
argument that the statute so construed

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.380
would violate the First Amendment's
protection for freedom of speech.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.170
In his final ruling, Kaplan
ordered the defendants

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.100
to remove the program for
their servers, and more

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.450
controversially, to disable all
hyperlinks to other websites

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.069
where copies of the
program could be found.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:13.910
 

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.780
The Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit affirmed, like Judge Kaplan,

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.180
the Court of Appeals found all
of the exemptions inapplicable,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.890
nor did the statute, even
when thus broadly construed,

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.250
violate the First Amendment.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:32.150
The court conceded that the
anti-trafficking provisions in general

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.370
and as applied in this
case, did restrict speech,

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:39.810
but that restriction it
ruled is content neutral,

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.510
advances a substantial government
purpose unrelated to the suppression

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.180
of expression, mainly
assisting copyright owners

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:51.310
and preventing unwanted
access to their property,

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:55.930
and burdened speech no more than
necessary to achieve that end.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:57.525
And thus, it's constitutional.

00:17:57.525 --> 00:18:00.700
 

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.730
The ruling in the Corley
case seems to have

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.950
had little effect on the
distribution of DCSS.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.630
While the case was ongoing,
hackers and Corley sympathizers

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:17.260
continued to distribute the program in
a wide variety of formats-- on t-shirts,

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:23.330
in the form of a haiku,
set to music, and so forth.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.210
On the other hand, the ready
availability of DCSS on the internet

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.410
still today does not seem to
have adversely affected the use

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.200
or profitability of commercial DVD's.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.540
The revenues generated
by which are tracked

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:44.240
by the yellow sectors of
the graph on your screen.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.740
As you can see, the ready
availability of DCSS starting in 1999

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:54.560
certainly did not prevent the DVD format
from conquering the home video market.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.890
Perhaps copyright owner's
anxiety was unfounded.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.250
In any event, the Corley case
has proved highly influential.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:08.600
Its crucial features include a lenient
interpretation of the requirements

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.950
that technological protection
measures effectively control access

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.650
to a copyrighted work, an expansive
interpretation of the prohibition

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:24.060
on trafficking in circumvention
technology, rejection of the position

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.210
that TPM's must accommodate the
privileges traditionally enjoyed

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:32.920
by users under the fair use
doctrine, and last but not least,

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.860
the declaration that despite
these interpretations,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.310
the statute does not run afoul
of the federal constitution.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.900
 

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.850
An example of a decision that took
a more skeptical view of TPM's

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.085
and invocations of the
law to reinforce them,

00:19:51.085 --> 00:19:54.320
is Chamberlain, decided
by the Court of Appeals

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.650
for the Federal Circuit in 2004.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.620
Chamberlain manufactures and
sells garage door openers,

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.390
these are devices that enable homeowners
to avoid the inconvenience of getting

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:10.560
out of their cars to open their
garages when they returned home.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.090
A homeowner need only press a button
on the remote control depicted

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.790
at the bottom of this
photo, and the machine

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.900
depicted at the top of the
photo will cause the door open.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:26.490
Chamberlain's system
incorporated a copyrighted quote,

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.820
"rolling code," close quote, computer
program that constantly changed

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:37.682
the transmitter signal needed
to open the garage door.

00:20:37.682 --> 00:20:39.640
Now as you know, with
some frequency homeowners

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:44.030
lose or break the remote controls
necessary to run their systems.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:48.790
The defendant in this case,
Skylink, catered to such consumers,

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:53.340
offering them replacement
generic remote controls

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.600
capable of opening
Chamberlain's doors, as well as

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.780
those of other garage
door opening companies.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.860
Chamberlain was unhappy,
primarily it seems

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.620
because Skylink was undercutting
Chamberlain's ability

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.860
to sell its own replacement
remote controls.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:14.590
So Chamberlain brought a DMCA suit
against Skylink contending that

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.770
Skylink's products quote, "circumvent
the security inherent in rolling

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.230
codes," close quote, and
therefore that quote,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.260
"Skylink is in violation of
the anti-trafficking clause

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:32.200
of the DMCA's anti-circumvention
provisions, specifically 1201(a)(2),"

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.490
close quote.

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:37.980
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
eventually rejected this claim ruling

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:43.180
broadly that 1201 prohibits
only forms of access

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:48.900
that bare a reasonable relationship to
the protections of the Copyright Act

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.030
otherwise affords copyright owners.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.150
As David Nimmer, the
son of Melville Nimmer

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.810
and a notable copyright
scholar in his own right,

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:06.080
points out it's very difficult to derive
such a limitation on the scope of 1201

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.600
from the language of the statute or
from the legislative history, and indeed

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.960
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit in the more recent MDY case,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.730
refuse to follow the Federal
Circuit in restricting

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:23.430
the reach of the
statute in this fashion,

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:28.550
but MDY involved video games,
not garage door openers.

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:32.070
Though the statute itself makes no
reference to the nature of the device

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:36.920
in which the copyrighted work
guarded by the TPM is embedded

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.060
and thus as Nimmer argues the
distinction between Chamberlain and MDY

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.840
is hard to justify on the basis
of statutory interpretation.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:48.190
It's neither surprising,
nor terribly troubling,

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.770
that the courts are more protective
of entertainment products

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:56.060
where unauthorized reproduction
is arguably pernicious than they

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.640
are of more industrial
products where we have long

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.630
thought competition is
socially beneficial.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:05.660
 

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.960
So that's where things currently
stand in the United States.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.110
The legal reinforcement of TPM's
is by no means limited to the US.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:18.290
90 countries currently are
signatories to the WIPO Copyright

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.740
Treaty and the WIPO Performances
and Phonograms Treaty

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.850
that as we've seen impose
on member countries duties

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.520
to adopt and enforce rules
of this general sort.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.230
How have other countries sought
to implement the principle?

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.440
The responses, as you might
expect, vary considerably.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.660
As my colleague Urs Gasser points out,
the language of the relevant treaty

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.760
provisions leave member
countries considerable discretion

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.870
on several fronts.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.770
Most importantly, the
treaties leave countries

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.320
free to decide whether
to buttress only TPM's

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.030
that reinforce the kind of exclusive
rights enjoyed by copyright owners,

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.150
namely the rights of production,
distribution, public performance,

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.100
and so forth.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:11.390
Or also TPM's that limit user's ability
to gain access to copyrighted works.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.930
 

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:17.940
The countries are also free if
they could figure out how to do so,

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.020
not to penalize circumventions of
TPM's for the purpose of exercising

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:26.210
one of the privileges recognized
by the copyright system,

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:31.850
such as the privilege of
engaging in fair uses.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.580
On the latter issue, the European Union
has adopted an approach very different

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:38.750
from the United States.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.730
You'll recall that in
the US the DMCA contains

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:47.660
a list of specific exemptions
to the coverage of Section 1201

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.040
plus an administrative mechanism
enabling the Librarian of Congress

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:56.320
periodically for three years
to add additional exceptions.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.340
That list is widely considered to be
very narrow, enabling copyright owners

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.810
in the United States to use TPM's
to curtail lots of activities

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.540
that they would be unable
to forbid by invoking

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.920
the regular rights under the
copyright statute itself.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:20.010
The EU, by contrast,
requires member countries

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:25.330
to create mechanisms to ensure the TPM's
do not interfere with the privileges

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:30.350
that consumers enjoy under copyright
law, unless the right's holders develop

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.650
and implement such
mechanisms voluntarily.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:37.740
Gasser points out the
countries within the EU

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.710
have sought to accommodate
that obligation differently.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.660
Greece and Lithuania,
for example, have set up

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.710
mediation systems in
hopes of reconciling

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:52.810
TPM's with the traditional
privileges of users.

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:57.010
The United Kingdom has set up a
special administrative mechanism

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:02.040
that purports to enable aggrieved
users to challenge TPM's that constrain

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.490
their freedom to make lawful
uses of copyrighted materials.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.350
And Ireland permits aggrieved
users to appeal directly

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.380
to the Irish High Court.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:17.570
Whether any of these mechanisms
is effective is far from clear,

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:23.610
but they at least purport to tilt
the scales more toward consumers

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.000
than does the United States.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.160
During the past 15 years, controversy
over legal reinforcement of TPM's has

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.500
been intense.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.470
My guess, for what it's
worth, is that in the future

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.460
the controversy will gradually fade.

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.580
The reason is not because countries
will converge upon a solution

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:52.080
to this issue that satisfies all
parties, that's extremely unlikely.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.240
The reason rather, is that TPM's
and their legal supplements

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.050
are designed primarily to
protect business models that

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:05.750
rely upon distributing copies of
copyrighted works to consumers.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.620
Increasingly nowadays the
businesses that have traditionally

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:14.670
depended on copyright law are shifting
to cloud-based business models that

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:20.680
do not depend upon providing
consumers copies of works.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.940
As a result, for better or
worse, technological shields

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.440
enveloping such copies
will become less important.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.610
At the same time, alternative
practical and legal mechanisms

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.216
for preserving the traditional
privileges of consumers

00:27:36.216 --> 00:27:37.340
will become more important.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.080
 

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.020
Thanks for your attention.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:47.700
Next week we'll take up the last of
the topics in this lecture series--

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.260
the remedies the law provides
for copyright infringement.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.174
