00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:01.967
Sal:The longest day of the year in

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:08.366
Juneau, Alaska is June 21st.
It's 1,096.5 minutes long.

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:09.966
Half a year later when
the days are at their

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:14.866
shortest the days are
about 382.5 minutes long.

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:19.225
If it's not a leap year
the year is 365 days long

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:23.753
and June 21st is the
172nd day of the year.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:26.227
Write a trigonometric function that models

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:29.535
the length L of the T-th day of the year.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:32.446
It's going to be L as a function of T,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.902
assuming it's not a leap year.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.967
I encourage you to pause
this video and try to do

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:40.216
this on your own before
I try to work through it.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.966
Let me give a go at it.

00:00:42.966 --> 00:00:45.167
Instead of first starting
at L of T I'm going

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:48.694
to actually start with
L as a function of U,

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:53.588
where U is another variable
I'll use as an intermediary

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:57.419
variable that will help
set it up in a simpler way.

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:09.534
Where U is days after June 21st.

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:12.098
Let's just think about this a little bit.

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:15.366
June 21st.

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:18.154
If we're thinking about in
terms of U, U is going to be

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:21.830
equal to zero because it's
zero days after June 21st.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.367
But if we're thinking
about it in terms of T,

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.671
June 21st is the 172nd day of the year.

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.895
172.

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:33.366
What's the relationship between U and T?

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:35.900
It's shifted by 172 days.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.865
U is going to be equal to T minus 172.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.225
Notice when T is 172, U is equal to zero.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.433
Let's figure out L of
U first and then later

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:54.656
we can just substitute U with T minus 172.

00:01:55.475 --> 00:01:58.367
First of all what's happening
when U is equal to zero?

00:01:58.367 --> 00:01:59.600
Let me write all of this down.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.832
What is happening when U is equal to zero.

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:07.976
U equals zero is June 21st
and that's the maximum point.

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:11.151
What trig function hits its maximum point

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.800
when the input into the
trig function is zero?

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.330
Well sine of zero is zero
while cosine of zero is one.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.500
Cosine hits its maximum point.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.430
It seems a little bit easier
to model this with a cosine.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:28.309
It's going to be some amplitude

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:34.623
times cosine of, let's say,

00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:38.566
I'll write some coefficient
C right over here.

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:41.273
Actually just let me use a
B since I already used an A.

00:02:41.273 --> 00:02:47.683
Some coefficient over
here times our U plus some

00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:52.381
constant that will shift the
entire function up or down.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:55.433
This is the form that our
function of U is going to take.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:59.191
Now we just have to figure out
what each of these parts are.

00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:01.100
First let's think about what the amplitude

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.700
and what the mid line is going to be.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.894
The mid line is essentially how

00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:07.400
much we're shifting the function up.

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:09.933
Let's get our calculator out.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.827
The mid line is going to be half

00:03:11.827 --> 00:03:13.466
way between these two numbers.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:24.116
We could say 1,096.5 plus 382.5

00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:30.266
divided by two gets us to 739.5.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:36.400
That's what C is equal
to. C is equal to 739.5.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.670
Now the amplitude is how much
do we vary from that mid line.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.500
We could take 1,096 minus this or

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.666
we could take this minus 382.5.

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.110
Let's do that.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.398
Let's take 1,096.5 minus

00:03:55.398 --> 00:04:03.564
what we just got, 739.5

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:12.415
and we get 357. This is how
much we vary from that mid line.

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:15.075
A is equal to 357.

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:18.469
This right over here is equal to 357.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.016
What's B going to be equal to?

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:22.981
For that I always think,
"What's the behavior of the

00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:25.954
"function, what's the period
of the function going to be?"

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:27.841
Let me make a little table here.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.766
Let's put some different inputs from U.

00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:40.300
When U is zero we're zero
days after June 21st,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.901
we're at our maximum point.

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:45.540
And we already said that what
we want the cosine function

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.290
to evaluate to at that
point is essentially we want

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:59.904
it to evaluate as 357 times
cosine of zero plus 739.5.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:05.900
Now what's a full period?
A full period is a year.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.233
At a year we get to the
same point in the year,

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:10.301
which is I guess a little
bit of common sense.

00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:13.300
You go all the way to 365,

00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:17.163
when U is 365 we should
have completed a period.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:19.666
We should be back to that maximum point.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:28.400
This should essentially be
357 times cosine of two pi.

00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:31.330
If we were just thinking in terms of a

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.500
traditional trig function, if
we just had a theta in here,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.666
you complete a period every two pi.

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.134
This should be equivalent to
what I'm writing out over here.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.800
Plus 739.5.

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:48.817
One way to think about it is B

00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:52.515
times 365 should be equal to two pi.

00:05:52.515 --> 00:05:55.392
Notice this is going to be B times 365,

00:05:55.392 --> 00:05:56.867
so let's write that down.

00:05:57.233 --> 00:06:01.133
B times 365.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:05.354
That's the input into the cosine

00:06:05.354 --> 00:06:08.569
function needs to be equal to two pi.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.134
Or B is equal to two pi over 365.

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:20.692
B is equal to two pi over 365.

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:23.767
We are almost done. We
figured out what A, B and C

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:28.619
are and now we just have to
substitute U with T minus 172

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:29.966
to get our function of T.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:31.266
Let's just do that.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:34.100
We get -- we deserve a little
bit of a drum roll now.

00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:39.412
L of T is equal to A,

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:50.563
which is 357 times cosine
of B two pi over 365.

00:06:50.907 --> 00:06:55.761
Two pi over 365 times

00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:58.300
not U, but now we're going
to write it in terms of T.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.433
We want to think about day of the year,

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:01.966
not days after June 21st.

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:11.660
So times T minus 172 and then
finally plus our mid line.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.292
Plus 739.5.

00:07:16.972 --> 00:07:19.866
We are done.

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:21.900
It seems like a very
complicated expression but

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.894
if you just break it
down and think about it,

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:27.700
make the point that we're
talking about the extreme point,

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.166
either the minimum or the maximum.

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:33.966
Make that when the input into
our function is zero or two pi.

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:36.119
Zero is actually the easiest one.

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:39.366
Then later you can worry about the shift.

00:07:39.366 --> 00:07:41.882
Hopefully you found that helpful.
