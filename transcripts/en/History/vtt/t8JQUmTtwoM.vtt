NARRATOR: The attacks
on September 11, 2001

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.815 line:0%
introduced the American
people to a new foreign enemy,

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:18.818 line:0%
al-Qaeda, a militant
Islamist organization

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.421 line:7%
led by Osama bin Laden.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.523
American intelligence
agencies, though,

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:28.227
had known about al-Qaeda and
its threats since the 1990s.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.797 line:0%
Yet they failed to
adjust their policies

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.665 line:0%
and share intelligence
that could have

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:35.301 line:7%
prevented the 9/11 attacks.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:36.502 line:7%
Why?

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:39.172 line:0%
One reason, they
did not understand

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.541 line:7%
how grave this threat could be.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.677
But the anti-Western sentiments
and political volatility

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.180
that created the
conditions for al-Qaeda

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:53.386
and other like-minded groups to
rise go back nearly a century.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:56.422
In 1918, near the
end of World War I,

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:59.592
the Ottoman Empire, which had
ruled Arab lands for almost

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.595
500 years, collapsed.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:05.731
Britain and France stepped in,
dividing the land between them,

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:08.734
forming the modern boundaries
of the Middle East.

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:12.839 line:0%
Then came the creation of the
Jewish state of Israel in 1948.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:16.209 line:0%
Originally, the UN had
intended to partition Palestine

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.878 line:0%
into an Arab state
and a Jewish state,

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.849 line:0%
but the Arabs rejected the
plan they viewed as unfair,

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.885 line:0%
sparking a decades-long
conflict between Israelis

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.755 line:0%
and Palestinians and the
surrounding Arab countries.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.757 line:0%
Osama bin Laden
would internalize

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.227 line:0%
both European influence
in the Middle East

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.197 line:0%
and the Palestinians' defeat
as great humiliations,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.502 line:0%
pointing to America's
support for Israel's success.

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:45.238 line:0%
His grievances with the
US, however, were not

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.840 line:7%
only based in past politics.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:51.210 line:0%
They were rooted in
religious ideology.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.480 line:0%
Bin Laden followed the
teachings of Sayyid Qutb,

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:57.350 line:0%
an Egyptian thinker credited
with inspiring today's

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:59.852 line:7%
global jihadist movement.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:03.256 line:0%
In the late 1940s, Qutb
spent two years studying

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.892 line:0%
in the US, where
he became disgusted

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:10.263 line:0%
by what he perceived as the
depravity of American culture.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.199 line:0%
Qutb longed to reinstate
what he considered

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.268 line:7%
the height of civilization--

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.404 line:0%
seventh-century Arabia, when
Muhammad and Muslim armies

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.405 line:7%
ruled.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:20.606 line:7%
How?

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.608 line:0%
Qutb argued all
Muslims must take up

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.913 line:0%
arms against the nonbelievers,
which included any Muslims who

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:29.815 line:7%
rejected his brand of Islam.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.785 line:0%
This philosophy would be used
by bin Laden and al-Qaeda

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:35.521 line:7%
to justify mass murder.

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.423
Qutb's personal
story, too, would

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:40.426
become inspiration for revenge.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.229
In 1954, Qutb was
imprisoned for planning

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.698
the assassination attempt of
secular Egyptian president

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.934
Gamal Abdel Nasser.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:51.537 line:0%
In prison, he was regularly
beaten and tortured,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.273 line:0%
which only strengthened
his resolve to keep writing

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:56.776 line:7%
and galvanizing his supporters.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.712 line:0%
Nasser, threatened by
Qutb's rising influence,

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.915 line:7%
had him executed in 1966.

00:03:02.948 --> 00:03:05.318 line:0%
But instead of
killing a movement,

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.720 line:7%
Nasser created a martyr.

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.922 line:0%
Qutb's, story in his
book, "Milestones,"

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:13.926 line:0%
would become an inspiration
for generations of extremists,

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.996 line:0%
including Ayman al-Zawahiri,
who would go on to become

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.465 line:7%
bin Laden's right-hand man.

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:23.970 line:0%
Born in 1951, Zawahiri possessed
strong Islamist sentiments

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.438 line:7%
from a young age.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.740 line:0%
At just 15, he founded
a militant cell,

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:30.943 line:0%
calling for the overthrow of
the secular Egyptian government.

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:34.013 line:0%
At 22, he joined the
Egyptian Islamic Jihad,

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:37.283 line:0%
with the goal of establishing
a theocratic Islamic state

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:38.684 line:7%
in Egypt.

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:42.321 line:0%
Like Qutb, Zawahiri would
be imprisoned in 1981

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:46.025 line:0%
in connection with the murder of
then president Anwar el-Sadat.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:49.695 line:0%
Zawahiri, too, would be
beaten and tortured in prison.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:53.633
But this only strengthened
his extremism.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:57.570
Just a few years earlier,
in 1979, the Soviet Union

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.039
invaded Afghanistan
to aid the communists

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.974
in the Afghan civil war.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.777
Bin Laden had been working
to help finance, recruit,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.046
and train Arab freedom fighters.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.384 line:0%
Known as mujahideen, they had
declared jihad, or holy war,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:13.653 line:0%
against Soviet troops
in Afghanistan.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:17.023 line:0%
It's during this war that bin
Laden would meet Zawahiri, who

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:20.359 line:0%
led a faction of the Egyptian
Islamic Jihad after his release

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:21.761 line:7%
from prison.

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:24.664 line:0%
In 1989, mujahideen
finally succeeded

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:28.668 line:0%
in pushing the last remaining
Russians out of Afghanistan.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.037 line:0%
Emboldened by this
victory over the Soviets,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.540 line:0%
Osama bin Laden, along with
Islamic scholar Abdullah Azzam,

00:04:34.573 --> 00:04:36.075 line:7%
formed al-Qaeda.

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:39.812 line:0%
Then, in 1990, Saddam
Hussein invaded Kuwait.

00:04:39.845 --> 00:04:43.049
The US sent troops to
its ally Saudi Arabia.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.651
But the presence of foreign
Christian troops in Saudi

00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:48.521
Arabia, home to Islam's
two holiest sites

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:52.958
of Mecca and Medina, enraged
Saudi-born bin Laden.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.429
Bin Laden would cite this
grievance as a major motivation

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.364
for the 9/11 attacks.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:01.067
Over the next decade,
Zawahiri and bin Laden

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.936
would work closely
together, eventually merging

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.938
their two terrorist networks.

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:08.974 line:0%
Like Zawahiri, bin Laden had
grown critical of the regimes

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:11.577 line:0%
in the Middle East, who
maintained relationships

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.380 line:0%
with Western nations
and failed to bring

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:18.584 line:0%
his idea of a properly Islamic
government to fruition.

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:20.586
To counter these
regimes, bin Laden

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:23.522
looked to fight the
United States directly,

00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:26.592
believing violence would force
the Americans to withdraw

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:30.396
from the Middle East entirely
and allow groups like al-Qaeda

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:31.997
to take control.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.735 line:0%
Throughout the '90s, the West
experienced multiple attacks,

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:39.004 line:0%
including the 1993 bombing
of the World Trade Center,

00:05:39.037 --> 00:05:42.141 line:0%
the bombings of the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:47.580 line:0%
in 1998, and the 2000 bombing
of the USS Cole in Yemen.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.583
While the 1993 World Trade
Center bombing was never

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.018
officially linked to
al-Qaeda, the motivation

00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:56.122
echoed bin Laden's sentiments.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:58.758 line:0%
With so many warning
signs, how then

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.860 line:0%
did the most powerful
nation in the world

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:03.963 line:0%
fail to anticipate the
9/11 attacks, which

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.899 line:7%
seemed so long in the making?

00:06:06.932 --> 00:06:08.768
American law
enforcement agencies

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:12.505
fought amongst themselves and
lacked coordinated intelligence

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.039
sharing.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:18.043
They also failed to fully
appreciate history, how decades

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:21.914
of violence and volatility had
created a powerful movement

00:06:21.947 --> 00:06:24.917
of religious
fanaticism and hate,

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.119
determined to take
revenge against what

00:06:27.152 --> 00:06:30.656
they perceived as the
source of their discontent--

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.626
the center of Western
values and power,

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.461
the United States of America.

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:38.664
