00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.100
Hi, I’m Craig. I’m not John Green, but
I do have patches on my elbows, so I seem

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.080
smart. And this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, a new show, hurray!

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.460
Why are fireworks legal or illegal? We
might find out. Will we find out Stan?

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.020
Anyway, I have a question for you. Have you
ever wondered where your tax dollars go or

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.960
why people complain about it so much? Or who
pays for the highway that runs past your house?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.909
Or why you use the textbooks you use in science
class? Or why you need a license to drive,

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.510
or to hunt or to fish or to become a barber?
I’ve always wanted to cut my own hair, back

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.239
when I had it.
Have you ever wondered why you have to be

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.559
21 years old to drink alcohol but only 18
to vote? Or gamble. Sometimes voting is a

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.160
gamble - actually always. Do you get confused
when you hear people talk about news about

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.320
Wall Street regulations, or Obamacare, or
the national debt? Do you wonder why there

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.019
are so few cell phone carriers and cable companies?
How about why it’s ok for student groups

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.309
to lead prayers in schools but not for the
principal to do so? Have you ever wondered

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.140
if there are any limits on when, where, and
how the police can search your home, or your

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.980
car, or your locker, or you, or your friend,
or your grandma, or your grandma’s friend?

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.350
And do you know why you can stand outside
a government office with a sign and a bullhorn

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.860
complaining about military action that you
think is unfair and the police can’t stop

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.580
you, but you can be fired from your job for
doing the exact same thing?

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.970
Have you ever been sued? Or fined? Ever wonder
what the difference is between being sued

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.190
and being fined?
Have you ever wondered why the government

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.250
does the things it does and why it doesn’t
do other things? Have you ever wondered what

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.860
it would be like if we had no government at
all? That would be anarchy. Can we play the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.720
Sex Pistols, Stan? That’s probably illegal.
Why is it illegal?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.920
And probably the most important, have you
ever thought about how you can change the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.210
things that seem unjust or unfair or that
you just don’t like?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.400
Ok so that was more than one question, and
obviously there isn’t a single answer to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.030
all of those questions, except in a way, there
is. The study of government and politics.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.880
And that’s what we’re going to talk about
today, and this whole series: Crash Course

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.440
Government and Politics - aptly titled.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:57.920
[Theme Music]

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.220
So let’s start by doing what human beings
do when confronted with complicated questions

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.680
they can’t answer. We’ll answer a simpler
one. In this case, what are government and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.840
politics and why do I need to learn about
them.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.700
Government is a set of rules and institutions
people set up so they can function together

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.330
as a unified society. Sometimes we call this
a state, or a nation, or a country, or Guam.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.060
And I’ll use these terms somewhat interchangeably
- except for Guam, that might be a little

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.840
confusing. So, we study government in order
to become better citizens.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.030
Studying government enables us to participate
in an informed way. Anyone can participate,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.390
but doing so intelligently that takes a little
effort, and that’s why we need to learn

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.290
about how our government works.
Politics is a little different. Politics is

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.340
a term we used to describe how power is distributed
in a government. And in the U.S it basically

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.540
describes the decisions about who holds office
and how individuals and groups make those

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.530
decisions.
Following politics is a lot like following

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.569
sports in that there is a winner and a loser
and people spend a lot of time predicting

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.280
who will win and analyzing why the winner
won and the loser lost.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.540
The outcome of an election might affect your
life more than the outcome of a sports game

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.260
though. Unless you’re gambling - which might
be illegal.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.490
Government is really important. Everyone born
in America is automatically a citizen, and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.209
many people choose to become citizens every
year so that they can have a say in the government.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.810
The USA is a republic, which means that we
elect representatives to govern us, and a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.500
democracy, which means that citizens are allowed
to participate. This ability to participate

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.190
is something we take for granted, but we shouldn’t.
History tells us that that citizen participation

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.850
is the exception rather than the rule. But
we’re not going to look at history. Who

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.709
has time? That’s what history courses are
for with that other guy.

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.150
So one way people can participate in government
is through voting. And many people will tell

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.590
you that that’s pretty much the only way
we can participate in government and politics,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.300
but THEY’RE WRONG. And I love pointing out
when people are wrong. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.240
Sure, when you mark a ballot, you are participating
in the political process, but there are so many other

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.380
things you can do to be an active citizen.
You can contact your representatives and tell

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.599
them what you think about a political issue.
People used to do this by writing letters

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.090
or sending telegrams, but now they tend to
call or send email, although there’s nothing

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.730
like a good old-fashioned angry letter.
People can work for campaigns or raise money

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.920
or give money. They can display yard signs
or bumper stickers. They can canvass likely

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.349
voters, try to convince them to vote or even
drive them to the polls on election day.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.540
You participate in politics when you answer
a public opinion poll. Or when you write a

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.130
letter to the editor or comment on an online
article. You participate in politics when

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.890
you blog, or tumbl, or make a YouTube video,
or tweet. I guess even YouTube comment counts.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.099
First!
Ever been to a march or a rally or held a

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.800
sign or worn a t-shirt with a slogan on it,
or discussed an upcoming election at the dinner

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.290
table and tried to convince your parents who
to vote for? You’ve participated in the

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.930
political process.
And if you’ve actually run for office you’ve

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.689
participated, even if you didn’t win, and
if you did win, congratulations, now get back

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:24.580
to work. You should already know this.
But probably the most important thing you

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.840
can do to participate in government and politics
is both the easiest and the most challenging.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.160
Become more educated! Anyone can be a citizen,
but to be a good citizen requires an understanding

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.409
of how government works, and how we can participate.
It requires knowledge and effort and we have

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.879
to do it because otherwise we end up being
led rather than being leaders. We learn about

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.979
politics because knowledge is our best defense
against unscrupulous people who will use our

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.479
ignorance to get us to do things that they
want rather than what we think should be done.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.259
Thanks, Thought Bubble. That was my first
Thought Bubble narration! Hurray! You guys

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.610
are fun. This is fun.
So that’s where we comes in. Over the course

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.939
of this series we will be looking in depth
at American government and politics.

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.379
We’ll be talking about stuff like the structure
and function of the branches of government,

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.439
the division of power between the national
government and the state governments, what

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:10.779
political parties are, what they do, and how
they are different from interest groups.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.029
We’ll examine the role the media plays in
government and politics, how the legal system

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.789
and the courts work and how they protect civil
rights and civil liberties.

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.879
We’ll look at political ideologies: what
it means when you say you are a liberal or

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.469
a conservative or a libertarian or a socialist
or an anarchist – okay we probably won’t

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:29.039
talk about anarchy because that’s sort of
the rejection of government. Again, Sex Pistols,

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.379
Stan? Can’t... copyright issue.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.180
I’ll take care of it. ANARCHY - WOOO! I’ve
been known to do that from time to time.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.330
We’ll try to understand the forces that
are shaping American government and politics

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.729
today. And we’ll work towards becoming more
involved and developing our knowledge so that

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.289
we make our government more responsive and
our politics more inclusive.

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.240
By the end of this series – and actually
before the end – you will understand how

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.439
our government works and how you can make
it work better for you and your community.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.680
Not only will you be able to answer most of
the questions I started this episode with,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.909
but you will become, if you pay attention
and think for yourself, a more engaged and

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.289
active citizen. And you might have a beard
- if you don’t shave.

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.980
Next week we’ll talk about Congress, how
it works, and what it does, when it does anything.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.409
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next week.
And that’s my first Crash Course episode!

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:17.849
Are we out of poppers Stan? I’ll just throw
‘em… wooohoo! Bang! Wooo! Bang!

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.109
