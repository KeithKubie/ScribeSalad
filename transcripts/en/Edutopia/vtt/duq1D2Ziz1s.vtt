&gt;&gt;You see now, you could
draw a little mouse.

00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:12.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Most schools
have computer labs

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:15.756
where students come a few
periods a week to do homework

00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:17.366
and polish their digital skills.

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.056
But EAST labs are different.

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:26.446
EAST stands for environment and
spatial technology and in labs

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:29.926
like this one at Horace Mann Middle
School in Little Rock, Arkansas,

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.766
students spend five periods
a week and countless hours

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.096
after school designing buildings.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:39.756
&gt;&gt;If you put a door,
I guess, right here.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Making films.

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:42.556
&gt;&gt;Play it from there.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:44.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And dreaming
up ambitious projects

00:00:44.786 --> 00:00:46.896
that they see through to fruition.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:50.556
&gt;&gt;I made a model based
on a greenhouse outside.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:54.386
&gt;&gt;Rick: I tell them the first
day, this is not a computer class,

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:56.956
this is a problem solving class

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:01.996
in which you take a community service
project that may be very well an idea

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:03.796
and you make it a reality.

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:06.986
Not pie in the sky, make it happen.

00:01:07.386 --> 00:01:11.306
Believe that you can do it,
and that really opens a lot

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:11.936
of doors for these kids.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:15.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To participate in
the nonprofit EAST initiative,

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:19.376
schools need to raise about one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.646
which covers the cost of technology
tools and ongoing teacher training.

00:01:23.796 --> 00:01:25.336
&gt;&gt;Turn it to the side
so like they can look.

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:28.376
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Many EAST projects
have an environmental theme.

00:01:28.376 --> 00:01:30.806
&gt;&gt;Adiba: Our project is
the bird sanctuary project

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.506
and students can come out
during their lunchtime

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:37.856
and during their class
time to observe the birds.

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:39.406
&gt;&gt;We can just like
move it down, can't we?

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:39.766
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.846
&gt;&gt;Adiba: The average teenager only
goes outside twenty minutes a week,

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:47.036
and this project hopefully will
help kids learn about nature

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:49.036
and appreciate the birds [inaudible].

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.306
&gt;&gt;Rick: I don't select
the projects for them.

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:55.976
They buy into those projects
because they believe in them.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:58.466
&gt;&gt;We contacted the people
who own the rights--

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.736
&gt;&gt;Rick: They want to
make a difference.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:05.406
They have been told for the
past ten, twelve years that,

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:08.106
"You're too little, you're
too young, you can't do it."

00:02:08.106 --> 00:02:11.096
And then all of a sudden,
you say, "Yes, you can do it.

00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:13.746
Give me a plan, find the money."

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:16.406
And these kids are
very inventive about it

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:19.256
and they become very passionate
about what their cause is.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:22.206
&gt;&gt;Justin: We're actually
designing a stadium to go

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:23.486
out where our football field is.

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:26.906
Hopefully, they'll actually come
up with enough money to build it.

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.876
Right now, it's gonna cost really
expensive, 'cause we've come up to

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.326
where it's gonna be
turf versus grass.

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:35.016
And then the popcorn and everything.

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:35.876
&gt;&gt;Popcorn?

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:37.976
&gt;&gt;Popcorn, that's important.

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:40.866
&gt;&gt;To raise money for the school.

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:42.316
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:44.236
&gt;&gt;Narrator: One project
began as an effort

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:46.846
to document a dark chapter
in American history.

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:50.436
&gt;&gt;Rick: The Japanese American
internment project started

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:55.006
out as a very simple idea and the
idea was to find the two camps

00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.346
that existed in south
Arkansas and GPS them.

00:02:58.346 --> 00:02:59.996
&gt;&gt;Student: This is the camp.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.836
All around it are cotton fields.

00:03:02.836 --> 00:03:04.776
All I'm trying to do
is put things on a map

00:03:04.776 --> 00:03:08.436
so people can tell
there's history lying just

00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:10.316
so far away, just that far.

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:15.086
&gt;&gt;Rick: What ultimately happened
is, these kids became so passionate

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:19.426
about what had occurred that
they wanted to make the citizens

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:23.166
of Arkansas aware of what had
happened in their own backyard.

00:03:24.306 --> 00:03:26.596
So it became a documentary film.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:31.076
That documentary film came about
because they figured out a way to go

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:35.466
to California and interview
Japanese Americans.

00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:36.666
&gt;&gt;Man: You know, like I always say,

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:41.156
the wound has healed
but the scar remains.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:46.676
And it remains as a reminder that
this should never, ever happen again.

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:49.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: More than
thirteen hundred copies

00:03:49.826 --> 00:03:52.456
of the student film have
been distributed worldwide,

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.046
and the production
led to the creation

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:57.076
of a memorial garden at the school.

00:03:57.886 --> 00:04:01.956
&gt;&gt;Lauren: It made me more serious
about what changes kids can do

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:06.246
and that we can actually make an
impact, and people will listen to us.

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:11.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What we're looking for
now is ideas from students on how--

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:13.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students also make
an impact on their community

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:16.136
through service learning projects.

00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:18.156
Working with the local
Audubon Society,

00:04:18.156 --> 00:04:21.516
Mann students surveyed the
Fourche Creek watershed adjacent

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:22.266
to their school.

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:27.796
&gt;&gt;Rick: The number one goal of
this particular project would be

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:34.726
to really get students to tune in to
their environment, where we're able

00:04:34.726 --> 00:04:39.216
to literally take down the four
walls of the science classroom

00:04:39.216 --> 00:04:41.036
and put students out in the field,

00:04:41.036 --> 00:04:44.956
where they're doing real
world data collection.

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:46.576
&gt;&gt;Nineteen point nine.

00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:52.476
&gt;&gt;Neelam: We are testing the water
quality for dissolved oxygen,

00:04:52.946 --> 00:04:57.126
turbidity, fluorite and
a coupla other things.

00:04:57.206 --> 00:05:00.196
&gt;&gt;Student: The temperature in the
air is twenty-nine point nine.

00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:06.376
Temperature in the water,
about twenty-one point six.

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:09.526
&gt;&gt;Mary: So many of the students
that we work with in rural,

00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:12.936
urban and suburban areas
do not get outside.

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:16.886
Their only knowledge of
nature is based on television

00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:18.586
and so it's a very superficial.

00:05:18.776 --> 00:05:22.246
Sometimes when we go out, they
think they're gonna see monkeys,

00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:23.846
and they will say things like,

00:05:24.196 --> 00:05:26.056
"I've never had my tennis
shoes off concrete,"

00:05:26.396 --> 00:05:30.916
or "I didn't know birds made sound,"
which to me is such a travesty,

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:33.566
because Arkansas is an
incredibly blessed state.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.556
&gt;&gt;Neelam: Well, I like
learning about the environment

00:05:35.726 --> 00:05:38.296
because it's something
that has a lot to do

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.856
with our lives and the way we live.

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:46.336
And I hope to become a
pediatric radiologist,

00:05:46.406 --> 00:05:48.386
and if that doesn't
work out, I was thinking

00:05:48.386 --> 00:05:50.996
about being an environmentalist.

00:05:50.996 --> 00:05:52.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Horace Mann
students presented a video

00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.976
of the Fourche Creek project
and showed off their other work

00:05:56.196 --> 00:06:00.066
at the annual EAST conference, where
more than two thousand students

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:03.826
and facilitators from around the
county come to attend workshops...

00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:05.746
&gt;&gt;-- use a drawing program, you
should know what layers are--

00:06:05.906 --> 00:06:08.776
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Present projects
and compete for awards.

00:06:08.876 --> 00:06:12.616
&gt;&gt;Mary: We do have a medallion for
each one of the finalist winners

00:06:13.186 --> 00:06:16.006
to symbolize and remind
them of the environment

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:17.276
that they have worked to protect.

00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:21.356
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a rock concert
atmosphere in which hard work,

00:06:21.676 --> 00:06:26.036
imagination and community
service are celebrated.

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:29.816
&gt;&gt;David: The critical element
of EAST is the subset of skills

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:33.256
that EAST kids are developing
as a result of their projects.

00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:35.546
It's not to say their
projects aren't important.

00:06:35.546 --> 00:06:39.756
They are very important, but the
skills are absolutely primary

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:43.356
and these are the skills that are
today being called twenty first

00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:44.116
century skills.

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:48.416
You look at the communication skills,
at how personable these kids are,

00:06:48.416 --> 00:06:50.226
how well they interact
with grown ups.

00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:54.556
&gt;&gt;Around here is La Jaima and that
site is a little warmer as well.

00:06:54.846 --> 00:06:57.936
&gt;&gt;David: Their problem solving
skills, tolerance for ambiguity,

00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:01.946
their sense of being able to do
things that they didn't even know

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:05.946
where possible, those are
amazingly important skills,

00:07:05.946 --> 00:07:09.226
and that to me is the
underpinning of this whole program.

00:07:10.336 --> 00:07:13.716
When kids leave EAST, they
are prepared for the world.

00:07:14.386 --> 00:07:16.166
&gt;&gt;Rick: What does it feel
like to be out like this?

00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:16.706
&gt;&gt;Nice.

00:07:17.126 --> 00:07:17.696
&gt;&gt;Very cool.

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:20.586
&gt;&gt;Rick: Think this is a
place that you could learn?

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.366
&gt;&gt;All: Yes.

00:07:25.706 --> 00:07:27.656
