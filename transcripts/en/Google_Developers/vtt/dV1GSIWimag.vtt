00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.230
David: Good afternoon, everyone. My name is
David and this is Jez and we're

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.830
both engineers in the Sydney office who work
on the Maps API.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.459
Jez: So we're talking today, our session's
called "Moving Beyond Markets:

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.710
Advanced Maps API Customization".
David: And just as with all the other sessions,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
umm, there's a wave where you
can take notes, see notes being made live,

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.890
and also ask questions which we'll
try to answer at the end of the session. And

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.369
also I just wanted to mention that
all of the samples that we're showing today

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.360
will be available publicly at URLs
at the end. Don't worry about taking down

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.680
any code snippets or anything. It'll
all be there in the end.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.390
Jez: Cool.
David: Great. Let's get going. So today we're

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.550
gonna be, umm, talking about
the JavaScript v3 API so this talk's basically

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.690
gonna be useful for you if you've
used the v2 API or the v3 API, or if you'd

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.410
like to learn some of the things you
can do with the JavaScript that's not too

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.820
high level.
Jez: Or if you're interested about cool new

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.350
things that we're going to announce
at the end of this session.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.350
David:
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.960
David: So, today. Today.
Jez: Today we're going to start with some

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.259
very basic customization, some things
that you can do -- you could do with the v2

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.250
API. We're gonna talk about custom
markers, customizing driving directions, custom

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.240
controls, some really simple
things you can do to make your Maps stand

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.610
out more.
David: Mm hmm.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.530
Jez: Then we're gonna launch into some more
advanced stuff.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.670
David: Right. So the first of the two things
we're gonna do is probably Jez's

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.689
favorite section and that's advanced Street
View customization. So really

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.751
innovative new things you can do in the v3
API such as bring in your own imagery

00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.371
ask connecting it to existing imagery to get
a really immersive experience that

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:50.689
you could have never got before.
Jez: I think you're underselling our third

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.689
point there --
David:

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.680
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
Jez: -- which I think is actually my favorite

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.020
thing. We're gonna be a bit
cagey about it but it's something new and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.799
something that will allow you to take
Map customization to a new level. Really,

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.409
really brilliant stuff. It's
exciting.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.900
David: Well, let's start at the beginning.
Jez: Okay.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.410
David: So standard marker is standard. I mean,
we love the standard marker, we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.080
love the standard look of Google Maps, but
a lot of the time when you're on an

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.500
API site that's all you see is just the standard
Google UI and having something

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.150
a little different that can really stick in
people's memory, make the site

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.710
really stand out or, you know, make the map
actually part of the web site

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.260
instead of this sort of stand alone thing
which isn't actually connected.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.360
Jez: Exactly. So what are we going to do to
really make our Maps stand out in

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.780
terms of our markets? Well, you've got a case
study I believe.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.110
David: I do have a case study. Umm, in my
spare time I've been working on a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.520
bit of a community service web site called
"zombietrackersRus" and here we see

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.740
one of our standard sort of zombie web pages.
You can see them all congregating

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.770
around the mall. But the standard marker just
isn't working for me here.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.770
Jez: Yeah. It's not really scaring me. I'm
not looking at these markers and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.850
saying I should be freaking out and getting
away from the zombies or planning my

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.400
escape route from these markers 'cause the
markers are kind of nice. They're

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.740
kind of nice; right?
David: Kind of friendly. Ooh.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.780
Jez: Now, that's looking better.
David: So you can see straight away you've

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.610
got a whole new experience.
Not only are you seeing visually straight

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.040
away what the marker represents but we can
do all

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400
sorts of things like actually position the
markers to point at one another so

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.940
you can really see those zombies encroaching.
Jez: Encroaching? So you can even drag them

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.170
around.
David: Drag them around. They spin. It's that

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.170
simple.
Jez: Cool.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.010
David: Great. So now -- so now I'm really,
like, aware of where the zombies

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.010
are and I won't, you know, freak out about
it.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.840
Jez: I was actually working on a similar web
site.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.470
David: Oh yeah?
Jez: Ninja tracker. Yeah.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.890
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
David: Nice.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.230
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
Jez: And you can to that with the Maps API

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.080
v3 as well, just like that.
David: All right. So we've got our custom

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.810
markers.
Jez: So how do we do that? What's the code?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.730
David: It's -- actually, to get a simple marker
on the page it's really simple

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.250
to -- I just said "simple" twice then.
Jez: You do that a lot though, Dave. You're

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.340
a simple kinda guy, I think.
David: All you have to do is pass in the URL

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.180
of the image that you'd like to
use as the marker in the icon field of the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.320
marker constructer and that's all you
need for a basic marker.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.820
Jez: Cool. But we can do some better stuff
with the custom markers -- right?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.820
David: Right. So in the case of the zombies
we actually used a giant sprite of

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.880
zombies who are all rotated in different directions
and in different lurching poses.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.620
And so using the marker image, you can actually
take full advantage of that so

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.100
you get the performance of having sprites
but without much effort. So here you

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.510
want -- you just need to give things like
the size of the sprite you're using,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:50.940
where on the sprite you are, and whereabouts
in that part of the sprite should

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.271
the marker be anchored onto the map.
Jez: Cool. And you can also scale it as well.

00:04:55.271 --> 00:05:00.590
David: Right. And finally you can also take
a similar one of those marker

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.810
images and make a shadow, put them all together
with a custom click ranging

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.211
shape so that if you have a strange shaped
marker you can still get to the map

00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:12.330
around it, and then if you pass those options
into the marker constructer you get

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.280
the -- the fully customized marker. But marker's
just really, like, the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.340
simplest case.
Jez: It is. So let's go onto something a bit

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.670
more --
David: Advanced.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.680
Jez: Yeah.
David: Custom directions.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.650
Jez: Okay. So custom directions at the really
simple case looks a bit like

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.560
This, and if you're gonna show us exactly
how we can take this, which is pretty

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.810
much the sort of standard out-of-the-box thing
you get with directions in the API

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.810
and -- and make it a bit more interactive,
a bit more custom.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.530
David: So this is my custom directions. It
doesn't look too much different but

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.900
there's actually a lot of stuff happening
here. I've used my own Polylines, I'm

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.240
using my own markers, and I've actually rendered
the left hand marker in my own

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.110
way, my own CSS.
Jez: Listened panel? That looks like it's

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.657
on the right to me, Dave.
David: I think you have to turn around, Jez.

00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:06.590
I don't know. I don't know my
lefts and my rights. Umm, it's using -- I'm

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.210
using my own dom. The other thing
is, because I've made all the Polylines myself,

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.720
I can actually add my own
behavior to the map. So you see when I hover

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.840
over a region, it changes colorand also the
corresponding step is highlighted, and similarly

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.440
if I hover over a
step, then the Polyline is highlighted. So

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.600
just really little things like this
can change the behavior of your map significantly

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:40.010
and make it more memorable or
more interactive. And, again, not too difficult.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.980
Umm, all we need to do is
instead of passing the directions response

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:52.190
to the standard directions renderer,
which will give you in two lines normal UI,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.020
instead you pass it to your own
function in which you can go through the response

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.730
and actually read all the
information about it and draw the bits that

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.430
are relevant to you on the map. So
our response is made up of multiple routes

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.370
which have multiple legs and then each
leg has multiple steps. In the common case,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.730
though, you're only having a single
rout and a single leg because you were just

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.360
asked for one set of directions
between two points. So you only have to worry

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.820
about rendering a set of steps.
So here you can see we're just taking the

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:27.510
first route and the first leg and in
every step, creating some list of elements

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.930
and adding them to our dom. So going
from here to, you know, a little bit more

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.240
complicated is iterative and quite
simple.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.730
Jez: Cool. All right. Well, let's talk about
custom controls. Umm, custom

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:46.270
controls are really very easy to do. Umm,
so what we've got here is instead of

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.069
having the standard, umm, pan and zoom controls,
we've just put some arrows in

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:56.740
the corner of the screen which, umm, manipulate
the map like this -- really

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.860
simple example but we'll show you how easy
it is to do because in actual fact,

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.870
custom controls are nothing more than divs,
which just ineract with the map in the

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.610
JavaScript. So all we're doing is creating
a div element, styling it however we

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:18.480
like, and then all we're doing is when we
get a click on that element, we're

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.500
making the map do something cool. Is that
function actually in the API?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.700
David: I'm not sure I've ever seen a map do
something cool before, Jez.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.980
Jez: I've seen a map do lots of things cool,
actually but I don't think the

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.930
function's quite there. So if you guys wanna,
like, request that on the issue

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.050
tracker I'd like to see.
David: I'd star it up.

00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.770
Jez: Yeah. I would, too.
David: All right. Umm, the only thing that

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.640
really sort of, uh, that you can do
intrinsically with controls is that you can

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.320
position them dynamically on the
map. So you can give one of these, uh, control

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:56.080
position constants and the map
will actually flow all of the controls intelligently

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.760
so that the -- we don't get
any overlap or anything like that. Because

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.700
it's well because they're just divs
you can also position them anywhere you want

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.140
absolutely anywhere on the map or
relative to the div.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.560
Jez: Right. So that's actually one of the
things that's changed between v2 and

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.190
v3 -- whereas in v2 you always had to worry
about making sure that your control

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.470
wouldn't overlap one of the standard Google
controls that you'd added to the map

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.110
and so if they'd changed size you're in a
bit of trouble chasing it around the

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:29.120
map. With this, you just give the div to the
map and it'll look after making

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.650
sure everything fits nicely and nothing overflows
 -- I mean, flows into each

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.160
other.
Jez: Mm hmm.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.330
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: Finally, umm, before we get into some

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.400
of the more advanced topics I'm
just gonna touch upon custom KML handling.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.300
Now, think, often KML's a bit overlooked
in the API, but it really shouldn't be because

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.940
it's a powerful way to add a
lot of data onto your map, but also a good

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.331
way of separating the HTML and the
script, which is rendering the map from the

00:09:55.331 --> 00:10:00.350
actual geographic data, so you can
have in one place a list of all the events

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.430
or a list of all your shops and in
another place, that's where you actually worry

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.970
about the presentation of it.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:12.180
David: So this is what a standard KML looks
like on the map.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.270
Jez: Mm hmm.
David: I've rendered here just a list of all

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.870
the meteor impacts on the earth.
Jez: The what impacts?

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.080
David: Meteorite.
Jez: All right. I see what you said. Sorry.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.430
I couldn't really understand
your Australian accent there, Dave.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:29.750
David: And so it'll just draw a standard marker
for you. You can actually

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.230
change the image in the KML but you can't
change anything else. So when you

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.390
click, you get a standard info window with
the HTML content that was inside.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:40.620
Jez: That was the description field; right
Dave?

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.710
David: That's the description field.
Jez: Cool.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.380
David: So you can do a little bit but that's
about the limit of the

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.050
customization we can do.
Jez: So how can we make this better? How can

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.790
we make this our own?
David: If we take over the rendering of the

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.070
KML we still get it rendering the
markers for us so we get really high-performance

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.490
markers so we can add hundreds,
thousands of them to the map. But instead

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.320
of using the info window, we can
render it ourselves.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:10.940
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: So here, in the right hand panel, you

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.850
can see I've taken the same
Information, and I've rendered it myself,

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:18.200
and I've applied my own CSS so I don't
have to worry about different things on the

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.610
page interfering with it.
Jez: Great.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.390
David: And the other thing --
Jez: As well as that. Yeah, you go -- this

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.120
is your slide?
David: This is my slide. The other thing is

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.790
we've actually been able to add
behavior as well to the KML. So I don't know

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.670
if you can see just around the
bottom of that marker there I've actually

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:38.089
drawn a circle about how large -- how
large a radius was made when it hit the ground,

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:40.670
how large the crater is. Is it
here?

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.580
Jez: We sort of emphasized it to make it obvious.
David: We widened it a little bit to make

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.839
it more obvious.
Jez: That would have taken out half of Africa.

00:11:45.839 --> 00:11:51.350
David: But you can see --
Jez: It was a while ago, though.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.770
David: You can see just with -- by taking
over KML I've actually changed the

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.720
experience quite substantially. And, again,
it didn't actually take much code

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.870
to get it done.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:09.640
David: So the first thing you wanna do is
when you make a KML layout -- sorry,

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.310
that should be google.maps.kml there. Umm,
is you're passing the suppress windows

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.240
option into the constructer and that just
says, hey, when you -- when someone

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.830
clicks, don't do anything for yourself. I'll
be here to help you out. The

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:29.480
second thing is then to add a listener for
that click event and when somebody

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:35.360
does click on the marker, not only do you
get the position at which the marker

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.670
was clicked but you get a whole heap of meta
information from the server about

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.779
what was actually in the KML. So in this case
the description field is actually

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:47.680
a full HTML body that I can add to the dom
or manipulate, and in our case we just

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.470
passed through the radius and added a circle
overlay to the map.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.120
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Jez: Cool. So with all of the stuff we've

00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.640
talked about so far, this -- you can
make your site look pretty sweet. Like, it

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.660
looks pretty good, you can customize
it, you can -- you can take the things that,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.990
you know, make it look like Google
Maps and customize them so they can fit with

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:14.180
your site but I want to go a bit
further. So let's talk about some of the more

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.460
advanced things that we can do
with the API v3 now.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:23.121
David: Sounds good. Okay. So we're gonna start
with Street View in v3. And

00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:27.470
so we're gonna show a demo which shows how
you can actually put your own custom

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.070
panoramas into Street View and also link them
into the existing Street View

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.970
imagery. So we have here a map of the area
around the office, uh, the Google

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.750
Sydney office. We're going to go into Street
View and you can see here that

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:47.710
we've got a link here on Darling Island Road,
which is one of the roads that surrounds the

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.970
office into the Google Sydney office, and
we can also see we've got the logo

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.959
there which is a custom marker which is inside
the panorama object.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.790
Jez: So I guess the first thing you notice
there is things like markers and

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:02.870
info window, you can actually take from your
map and bring along with you into,

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.640
umm, into your Street View really simply.
David: Absolutely. So let's go inside Google

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.100
Sydney. So this is the reception
and we can see links going off in different

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.790
directions towards the cafe and
towards, uh, the -- the area around -- near

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:20.690
us that we like to call the blue
room. So let's go through to the cafe. Beautiful

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.670
view of Sydney.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:28.769
David: Our well-stocked drinks fridge.
Jez: Ha ha.

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:36.080
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: And so you can see that -- that this

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.450
is using just our own imagery that
we took -- Dave and I took one afternoon with

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.790
a camera and a tripod.
Jez: Last Friday, actually.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.680
David: Last Friday it was. Yes?
Jez: Umm --

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.780
David: And we put it straight into Street
View and we integrated it with existing Street

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.170
View imagery.
Jez: So how do we do this? Let's start with

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.519
the simple things. To add
Street View to the map, it's really, really

00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:03.150
easy. All you need to do is either
in the options for the constructer add Street

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:07.749
View controls true or set the
Street View control option to true, and then

00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:14.140
you can get the panorama object by
just going map.getStreetView. So to add a

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:19.350
custom marker, because Street View in
v3 is entirely implemented in HTML, umm, and

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.899
you just interact with it with
JavaScript, and the other objects that you

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:30.290
can add to the map pretty much don't
care whether it's a map or a panorama. So

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.760
in this case the only thing we need
to do to get our custom marker on there is

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.480
change the map parameter for the
marker to the panorama.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.709
David: Right.
David: And that'll put it in panorama for

00:15:38.709 --> 00:15:41.410
us.
Jez: So you can do this with markers and info

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:46.390
windows, and your own overlays that
you create yourself and Polyline support is

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:48.210
on its way.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:52.670
David: Okay. So when you've got custom panoramas,
what you need to do is to

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:57.790
make sure that they wrap around 360 degrees
and then split them into tiles,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.970
much as you would do if you were creating
a custom tile layout yourself. Umm,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.079
so what we've got here is the tiles that make
up the imagery and they're square.

00:16:07.079 --> 00:16:12.961
You can see they're square, and they've just
got a gray space at the top and

00:16:12.961 --> 00:16:17.459
Bottom, and they're just indexed by the zoom,
the x coordinate, and the y

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:23.069
coordinate and the ID of the room that they're
currently in. Beautiful.

00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:26.140
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Jez: So, uh, the next thing you need to do

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:32.769
is to set up the geometry, basically
the mapping of -- of where the rooms go, how

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:37.459
they link together. So what we've
got is the -- uh, this is linked from the

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:44.970
blue room, our origin hitting field
tells Street View which, uh, angle, which

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:51.110
heading the panorama starts at so when
you've got your 00 tile what that's heading

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:56.760
towards, and then just an array of
links which determine at -- where you can

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.029
go from this room and what heading it
should be on.

00:17:00.029 --> 00:17:03.209
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: As long as we've got that, we've got

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:11.269
this set pano provider function
which takes a function, when given a pano

00:17:11.269 --> 00:17:17.789
ID, will, uh, return this object here --
determining the, uh, the stuff you need to

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:24.049
know to -- the stuff that the API
needs to know to render your pano. So the

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:27.369
important things are the location; the links,
which

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:32.440
are just the links that we saw in the last
slide; the size of the tiles; the

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.730
size of the world, which is the size of your
entire panorama so it knows how many, umm,

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:43.740
how many tiles there are around 360 degrees;
the origin heading which I spoke

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.519
about; and this function here called gettileURL,
which returns the URL of a

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:53.389
particular tile parameterized by the zoom;
and the x and the y.

00:17:53.389 --> 00:17:54.389
Jez: Great.
David: And the last thing we have to talk

00:17:54.389 --> 00:17:59.389
about is how to link it into existing Street
View. It's actually really simple. The panorama

00:17:59.389 --> 00:18:03.059
object has links
changed event, and when that gets called we

00:18:03.059 --> 00:18:12.100
actually, uh, get the pano ID, the
pano, for -- for the panorama. We get the

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.340
links for the existing panorama, and
we check the -- if this is the pano ID that

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.749
we care about. So in this case this
IUF one is the one on Darling Island Road

00:18:20.749 --> 00:18:25.509
outside the Google office. We just
add our link to that, the link that goes into

00:18:25.509 --> 00:18:30.090
Google Sydney and will send us to reception.
David: Great.

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.369
Jez: Cool. That -- it's that easy. It is.
Yes.

00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:36.400
David: All right. So now we come to the last
exciting section.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.429
Jez: Mm hmm. I'm looking forward to this.
I am.

00:18:39.429 --> 00:18:44.720
David: So up to now we've customized what
we put on the map, and we've

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.179
customized Street View. What else, what left
can we possibly do, Jez?

00:18:49.179 --> 00:18:54.450
Jez: Well, I was wondering because everything
we've done we've really kind of

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.859
focused on, you know, making this our own,
but there's one thing that we just

00:18:59.859 --> 00:19:03.229
haven't been able to customize yet and that's
the map itself.

00:19:03.229 --> 00:19:06.320
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: You don't like the map?

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:07.710
Jez: I like the map --
David: I think it's a nice map.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.609
Jez: I like the map. I do like the general
Google sign but sometimes I wish we

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:16.179
could modify it in some way.
David: Yeah?

00:19:16.179 --> 00:19:17.570
Jez: Yeah.
David: Like what?

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:21.850
Jez: I don't know. Could -- could you perhaps
do something that would, like,

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.840
make it all desaturated a bit? Make the colors
less intense.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.119
David: So, like, gray? Gray's good.
Jez: That's very interesting. So we can gray

00:19:31.119 --> 00:19:35.090
scale the map; hey? I don't
want it just completely black and white. Can

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:38.429
we maybe bring it up a bit? Make
it a little bit more colorful.

00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:40.389
David: Oh, you want it faded out.
Jez: Just fade it a little bit. Desaturate

00:19:40.389 --> 00:19:41.389
it a little bit.
David: I think I can do that.

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:46.149
Jez: So compare that to what we had originally.
Let's have a look.

00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:48.200
David: Oh yeah. I see what you're talking
about.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.279
Jez: Okay. Cool. So we're desaturated a little
bit. What if I wanted to, like, change the

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:56.279
colors altogether in could I make it blue
for example?

00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:01.480
David: Like that?
Jez: Ah. So now we're getting somewhere. Okay.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.639
So we can change the hue of
the whole map.

00:20:04.639 --> 00:20:06.879
David: But I'm not really happy with it, Jez.
Jez: Yeah?

00:20:06.879 --> 00:20:11.721
David: I think it looks too cluttered.
Jez: Yeah. I was just thinking the same thing,

00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.070
actually.
David: I was thinking maybe we should get

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.979
rid of some of the roads.
Jez: Some of the roads? Okay. How about get

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:18.690
rid of the local roads? Just the
really small ones. We'll keep focus on the

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:25.419
big ones. Ah, cool. So we can
actually now take out individual features

00:20:25.419 --> 00:20:27.080
from the map. Is that what you're
telling me?

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.960
David: I think we can do more than that, Jez.
Jez: Great. 'Cause what I was really, really

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.880
wanting to do was -- I wanted a nighttime
map 'cause I'm a bit of a nighttime person.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.210
David: A bit of a night owl?
Jez: Yeah, that's right. So can we invert

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.500
the lightness of the map?
David: I reckon we could.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.460
Jez: Ah, cool.
David: It's a bit dark.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.710
Jez: It's a bit dark.
David: It is a bit seedy almost. I don't know,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.260
Jez. How's that?
Jez: That's looking better. I -- I do have

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.210
a problem, though, 'cause there's
parks up here but the parks are always the

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.359
same color to the water so you really
can't get -- can we make them stand -- I really

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:02.440
want the parks to stand out like
really, really much.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.471
DeWitt: Oh. I'll set them to your favorite
color.

00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:08.350
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
David: What do you think, Jez?

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.909
Jez: Yeah. It looks good. I'm liking that.
I'm liking that a lot. I don't

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:16.299
know it might not be to everyone's taste.
David: If you add this to your web site it'll

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:17.990
be a bit --
Jez: How about we go back to a bit more traditional

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.389
color for parks.
David: Let's go to green.

00:21:19.389 --> 00:21:22.669
Jez: Okay, great. So we can make the parks
green, everything else is blue,

00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:26.690
it's nice and light. But the labels on the
parks are -- are green as well,

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.510
Dave. Can we just change the geometry of the
parks, not the labels?

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.510
David: Oh, you just want the geometry?
Jez: Just the geometry.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.240
David: I think I can do that.
Jez: Okay. Great. All right. Cool. Uh, what

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.820
else do we wanna do?
David: Still a little cluttered.

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:43.230
Jez: Get rid of some of the extra labels that
we don't really need. All right. Cool. I like

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.929
this map.
So we've got -- so, what have we got here,

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:49.239
Dave?
David: Well, we've changed the color schemes,

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:54.149
we've changed the lightness,
we've changed the darkness, we've changed

00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:57.739
what features are showing, what labels
are showing. We pretty much customized every

00:21:57.739 --> 00:22:00.739
aspect of the map.
Jez: Cool. So now that we've got this -- this

00:22:00.739 --> 00:22:04.429
styling available, there's a
whole -- a huge range of different things

00:22:04.429 --> 00:22:09.779
we can do. So here's some styles you
can create now with this new feature called

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:11.779
map styling.
David: Nice API.

00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:15.760
Jez: So here's a sepia toned map. We've got
some other themes we can do.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.760
&gt;&gt;[Clapping]
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:23.100
David: I like that one.
Jez: You like that one? You can even remove

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.440
things like completely remove all the
roads from the map. I use it to highlight

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.059
particular features so this one
highlights the transit routes around San Francisco

00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:34.249
or even just remove
everything just to get the, uh, outlines of

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:36.629
the shoreline, like that.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:41.459
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
David: Thank you.

00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:45.129
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
David: That looks kind of difficult to do,

00:22:45.129 --> 00:22:47.710
Jez.
Jez: You'd be surprised how easy this is to

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.659
do.
David: All right. Convince me.

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:55.100
Jez: So all you have to do is create these
style objects and there's three

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.639
elements to a style. There's the feature type
that you want to manipulate, and

00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:06.169
we have a shallow hierarchy of features so
you can apply styles to, for example,

00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:12.289
all of the roads on a map or just the local
roads or the arterial roads; the

00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:16.059
element type, so that's the geometry or the
labels, that's what we did when we

00:23:16.059 --> 00:23:20.169
were manipulating just the geometry of the
parks but we didn't wanna change the

00:23:20.169 --> 00:23:26.330
color of the labels; and then a styles parameter,
which determines the

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:32.059
particular things that you want to do to the
element. So for example, uh, this

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:36.679
is reducing the saturation by 50 percent.
So let's have a look at some of the

00:23:36.679 --> 00:23:40.619
other examples we can do. So this is taking
just the local roads and turning

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:46.850
the visibility off. And we can also apply
multiple styles to a particular

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:51.479
feature. So this is -- we're making the hue
of the parks green and we're

00:23:51.479 --> 00:23:57.120
decreasing the lightness to make them a nice
robust dark green color. So these

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.049
are the stylers that you can apply. We got
a normal map up at the top and the

00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:07.019
other elements that you can manipulate -- the
saturation, the gamma, the

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:12.190
lightness, the hue, and there's an invert
lightness property which will change

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:17.929
everything. As well as thatthere's also the
visibility, which will, uh, change

00:24:17.929 --> 00:24:19.899
what? Visibility.
David: [Laughing]

00:24:19.899 --> 00:24:23.169
David: Great.
Jez: And to activate a style, it couldn't

00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:28.450
be easier. We have a new class called
a styled map type, and it just takes one of

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:34.099
those style objects, and then you just
simply add that styled map type to the map

00:24:34.099 --> 00:24:38.019
and set the map type, and you'll have
your styled map. It's that easy.

00:24:38.019 --> 00:24:42.309
David: So I think it's actually interesting
to see what you can do with this.

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:46.249
Like, it's all well and good to just -- just
make a new style, but how does it

00:24:46.249 --> 00:24:50.580
come into practice? And we've got a great
example here from NBC.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:56.149
Jez: So our partners at NBC local have this
thing, uh, called "moods" which

00:24:56.149 --> 00:25:01.029
determines the, uh, particular mood that a
particular city has about a

00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:04.879
particular story and these are all color coded.
So what they've done actually

00:25:04.879 --> 00:25:10.679
is, is to take the color coding of the map
 -- sorry, of the mood and then apply

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:14.140
it to a map of the area where the story is
 -- is breaking.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.909
David: So it's a really simple effect but
something that really would have

00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:22.010
taken a lot of effort before.
Jez: It wouldn't have even been possible before,

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.640
Dave. I'm putting that out
there. I don't think it even would have been

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.799
possible before.
David: And now, a couple lines of code.

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:37.771
Jez: That's right. Cool. So, uh --
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:25:37.771 --> 00:25:40.599
David: We can go over to this one.
Jez: So we have a map style wizard available

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:42.571
that should be live --
David: Now.

00:25:42.571 --> 00:25:44.940
Jez: About now.
David: You're looking at it.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.479
Jez: You're looking at it now. Right -- where
you can play with all the things

00:25:48.479 --> 00:25:52.269
so you can manipulate the different features
and apply different styles to them

00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:56.859
and see how it comes out. And then once you've
done that you can get the, umm,

00:25:56.859 --> 00:26:01.390
the JSON code which we'll -- which you can
just plunk in straight to your --

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:05.429
David: So for example if you wanted to --
Jez: I just realized I said "plunk". You were

00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:10.110
gonna say "plunk" and you
didn't so I said plunk because you put it

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.159
in my head.
David: Plunk.

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:13.809
Jez: Plunk. Yeah.
David: Does everyone know what plunk means?

00:26:13.809 --> 00:26:15.169
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Jez: Okay. Well, see.

00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:18.369
David: You out-Aussied them, Jez.
Jez: I out-Aussied them.

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:20.629
David: He means replaced.
Jez: [Laughing]

00:26:20.629 --> 00:26:24.429
Jez: Umm, this isn't just about advanced maps
customization. It's about Aussie

00:26:24.429 --> 00:26:27.590
slang as well.
David: All right. So I guess if you wanted

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.639
a really quick demo, what would we
do?

00:26:29.639 --> 00:26:34.480
Jez: What would we do? Oh, this is great.
David: Let's change the color of the water.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.960
Jez: Let's change the color of the water.
David: All right.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.599
Jez: What color? What color should we make
the water?

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:42.259
David: Red.
Jez: Red. Okay. Red. That's pretty easy. Ha

00:26:42.259 --> 00:26:45.389
ha.
David: Hang on here. Any more requests?

00:26:45.389 --> 00:26:48.440
Jez: Cool.
David: Feel free to shout anything out.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:50.470
Male in audience: Saturated.
Jez: Saturated.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.769
David: Yeah. Okay.
Jez: Do it, Dave. Make it bright red.

00:26:54.769 --> 00:27:03.780
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Jez: And turn down the lightness a bit.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.780
David: Turn down the lights.
Jez: There we go.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.330
David: So you can see there's absolutely nothing
canned about the styles as you

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:10.289
change the JSON or as you set the JSON, the
style gets rendered for you

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:11.289
immediately.
Jez: Immediately.

00:27:11.289 --> 00:27:13.529
David: It's pretty amazing.
Jez: Absolutely dynamic.

00:27:13.529 --> 00:27:17.799
David: So this wizard is gonna be available
from the public docs and also from

00:27:17.799 --> 00:27:23.909
the -- the code samples from today. So please,
take it and see what you can

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:26.570
create.
Jez: So this is -- this is, you know, a really

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:31.719
great new feature. It's a way
to really make the maps your own. So not only

00:27:31.719 --> 00:27:35.559
now can you add your own custom
markers and custom controls and stuff but

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:41.599
you can take the, uh, the base map
itself and manipulate it and to make it really

00:27:41.599 --> 00:27:45.179
fit in with your site or to do
some cool features like we saw with NBC.

00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:50.129
David: Great. All right. Well, we're starting
to come to a close but before

00:27:50.129 --> 00:27:55.649
we do, I'd just like to quickly give a plug
to the Google Developer Qualification,

00:27:55.649 --> 00:27:59.519
which you probably heard a few times now at
a few of the sessions you've been to

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:04.220
but it's just a great way for -- as Geo developers
to be qualified and

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.999
recognized as engineers using the Maps API.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:28:06.999 --> 00:28:12.849
Jez: So all the code from today's talk is
gonna be on

00:28:12.849 --> 00:28:16.710
beyond-markers.appspot.com.
David: And if you have any questions we'd

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:17.950
love to answer them or feel free to
just send them on through the Wave.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:24.080
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Jez: I'll switch over to the Wave now, in

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.450
fact.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:33.062
David: Yes. At the front.
Male audience member 1: So the demo that you

00:28:33.062 --> 00:28:37.710
just showed just a moment ago is that actually
manipulating the pixels or is it requesting

00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:42.979
new images when you change those --
and the reason I ask is, does that then rely

00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:46.279
on HTML5 and the canvass object or
is that gonna work in older browsers?

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:49.859
David: Right. This is all done completely
service side so it's got support for

00:28:49.859 --> 00:28:51.070
all browsers.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:58.639
Male audience member 2: Uh, how do you capture
the image, the static image of this one? I

00:28:58.639 --> 00:29:01.719
think
right now Google Maps has this static maps

00:29:01.719 --> 00:29:02.719
support.
David: Right.

00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:05.759
Male audience member 2: And things like right
now I think I have problems with static maps

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:10.210
where if you have lots of notes and -- sorry,
if you have lots of markers and

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.570
these markers has custom icon. I think it
has a limitation on how much -- how

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:19.009
long the URL that you can send. Do you have
any way to resolve that?

00:29:19.009 --> 00:29:21.909
David: Umm, at the moment there's no support,
like, once you've reached the end

00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:27.519
of the URL that's it. I know that some of
the future things they might be

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:30.769
looking at is, say, KML support where you
can render KML directly onto static

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:35.149
maps, but at the moment really you've just
gotta work with --

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:37.450
Jez: It's one of the orientations of the web;
right?

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.870
David: Right.
Jez: We really did try, with static maps in

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.919
particular, we really did try to
make the -- the parameters as concise as possible.

00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:48.139
But you still have to run
into a limit at some point.

00:29:48.139 --> 00:29:50.100
David: Yeah.
Male audience member 2: Okay. Is it available

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:57.379
on Google Enterprise Premier as well?
David: Yeah. It's available to everyone.

00:29:57.379 --> 00:29:59.299
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: Hi.

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:04.029
Male audience member 3: Is there a roads attribute
that references cycling?

00:30:04.029 --> 00:30:05.399
David: Good question.
Jez: Umm, I don't believe so, not at the moment

00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:08.409
but that's -- we're -- we're
expanding the API. I think it's fair to say

00:30:08.409 --> 00:30:13.330
that we're expanding the API for
maps styling so it's probably something that

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.109
we'll get to.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:30:15.109 --> 00:30:19.999
Jez: Yes?
Male audience member 4: Uh, is there any performance

00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:27.049
impact of styling the map and -- or,
like, picking colors with opacity or anything

00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:31.190
like that?
Jez: Umm, intrinsically, no, there shouldn't

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.230
be any impact. The only impact
you're likely to see is users are less likely

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.369
to have a cached version of tiles
if they've used a different slide for example.

00:30:40.369 --> 00:30:44.489
So, uh, if -- if you're using
the standard map tiles then they potentially

00:30:44.489 --> 00:30:48.919
have been cached from visiting
Google.Com or from, uh, anything or any --

00:30:48.919 --> 00:30:52.529
David: Any intermediate cache.
Jez: Exactly. Or any intermediate cache. So,

00:30:52.529 --> 00:30:57.049
uh, potentially they might have to
fetch the new tiles.

00:30:57.049 --> 00:31:02.999
Male audience member 4: So the regular style
is also render real time, it's not cache?

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:04.070
Jez: Yes.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.139
Audience: Okay.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:31:05.139 --> 00:31:12.960
Male audience member 5: Uh, for the styling,
will it be possible to, uh, limit it to a

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.710
region? Because, uh, we have a university
campus where the labels, they're not

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:22.649
really -- uh, the labels from Google we don't
like it and with what you showed

00:31:22.649 --> 00:31:25.169
today we can just wipe those labels --
Jez: Right.

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:30.769
Male audience member 5: And replace them with
labels that they would prefer to see, but

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:34.019
it
will effect all the labels for the map on

00:31:34.019 --> 00:31:37.460
the chosen university campus?
David: Yeah. At the moment everything's just

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:41.179
done on category rather than sort
of a geographical region. It's definitely

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:45.669
something we'd like to look at doing.
Like, if you think about the implications

00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:51.309
you can do with that, there's thousands
of things, but at the moment we're just -- just

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:53.289
categories.
Male audience member 5: Okay.

00:31:53.289 --> 00:31:55.440
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Male audience member 6: Can you bring in other

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.259
types of layers and mix and match? For
instance, if I just wanted the ocean to be

00:31:57.259 --> 00:32:05.619
the terrain view -- or satellite view,and
I wanted the other parts to be maps, can you

00:32:05.619 --> 00:32:09.710
splice those two together?
David: At the moment it's only actually supported

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.710
for the base map types so --
Male audience member 6: Yeah. OK. I was also

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:12.799
gonna second his notion on adding, geographical,
like,

00:32:12.799 --> 00:32:18.700
separators and polygons. That'd be awesome.
David: No worries.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.049
Jez: Add it to the issue tracker. Add a feature
request.

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:25.450
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
Male audience member 7: Hi. Umm, sometimes

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:26.450
the maps is only the starting point. I may
use the

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:27.450
marker to get more information like in info
window or the rendering service

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:34.789
that you showed before. Umm, do you plan to
provide something else, I mean the

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:44.830
side bar, like in the Google Maps?
David: Umm, at the moment, no. It's -- umm,

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:51.200
we only fetch the information when
you click on it. So there's no, umm --

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.450
Male audience member 7: Like your rendering
services. I mean, it's hard to get something,

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:01.820
umm, really nice looking when you add a lot
of information in an info window.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:07.749
So, umm, maybe you have some guidelines or
some ideas on how to show more

00:33:07.749 --> 00:33:13.390
information that -- on the -- info window.
David: I would definitely, umm, steer away

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.879
from using the info window whenever
you had that sort of content to show. I don't

00:33:16.879 --> 00:33:21.570
think we have any standardized
way of rendering that other than there's the

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:26.159
standard directions renderer for
the panel. Umm, yeah. I would -- you know,

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:30.089
it's really what you want your web
site to look like. So I wouldn't necessarily

00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:31.320
make the panel any different to
the rest of your HTML content. Yeah.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320
Male audience member 7: Yeah. OK.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:39.749
Jez: Shall we take a question off the Wave?
David: Sure.

00:33:39.749 --> 00:33:44.570
Jez: I'm getting, you know, really sort of
weird angles so I can hardly read

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:49.299
It on the thing.
David: Well -- a new question that just came

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:51.879
through. This all
excellent, thanks. Any chance we will be able

00:33:51.879 --> 00:33:56.419
to change the font to more
customize the map or fit in with your branding?

00:33:56.419 --> 00:33:59.569
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: Not that we've heard of.

00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:02.119
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
David: Umm, I don't know. It could be on the

00:34:02.119 --> 00:34:06.059
road map but I haven't heard
anything. Umm, I think that's probably a lot

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:10.079
more difficult to pull off but
you never know.

00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:12.220
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]
David: Ask for stars.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:19.179
Jez: Ask for stars. That's right.
David: Umm, have mouse events on encoded polygon

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:26.900
events improved for v3? I
believe -- well, is Ben here? No Ben. There's

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.770
been a lot -- or is there a Ben?
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:37.410
David: Hey, Ben. Ah. I know, umm, Ben has
put a lot of work into changing the

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:42.470
way polygons are rendered on maps so I'm not
sure if he's actually had any

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:45.420
optimization on click-ability. Maybe you wanna
speak to that, Ben?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.410
Ben: Hi, this is Ben. Can you please repeat
the question? Sorry.

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:54.550
David: Uh, sure. Umm, have there been any
improvements for mouse events on

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:56.220
encoded Polylines?
Ben: Yes. They're fast.

00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.620
David: They're fast? There you go. So the
answer is, yes.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.681
Ben: I'm happy to elaborate later.
David: Try v3 and if you find bugs, please

00:35:04.681 --> 00:35:11.275
file them in the issue tracker
because that's the only way we're going to

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:12.275
be able to improve.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:35:12.275 --> 00:35:15.880
David: Umm, the last one was, uh, the new
track element in KML that has been

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.250
introduced in Google Earth. Will Maps support
it? Oops. Sorry.

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:23.650
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: Will we support tracking KML and/or

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:29.140
how can we draw custom paths on the
map?

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:35.390
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]
David: At the moment, umm, Track Web is supported

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.390
directly through the KML
Layout, but I can't see why it won't be supported

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.040
in the future. As to -- I'm
not aware of the API myself.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.710
Jez: No, the KML.
David: Umm, come and chat with us later, and

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:48.360
we'll try and find someone who can
give you a more concrete answer. At the moment

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:56.130
I think the answer's no.
Jez: There's one more question, which I guess

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.710
might wrap it up if we don't get
any more.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:01.300
David: All right.
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:07.830
Jez: Will colorization API available for maps
for Flash? That's an interesting

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:16.020
question. Umm, uh, possibly. Maybe a -- that
may be a question for our product

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:22.070
manager. He's trying to hide in the corner.
Sorry? If there is sufficient demand. That's

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:26.720
a good product manager answer. That's right.
David: The answer is, star it up in the bug

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.720
tracker.
Jez: That's right.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.540
David: And we'll find it.
Jez: All right. That's it from us. Thanks

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.330
very much.
David: If you have any questions, just grab

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:32.690
us.
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
