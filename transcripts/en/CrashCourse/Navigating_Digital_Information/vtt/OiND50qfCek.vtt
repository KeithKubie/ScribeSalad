00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
Hi I’m John Green.

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.789
This is Crash Course: Navigating Digital Information.

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:08.910
So what would you say if I told you that 90%
of people polled say that they love Crash

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.860
Course and think we offer consistently reliable
and accurate information on the most important

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.290
educational topics.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.290
You might say, “Hold on.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.290
I’ve seen the comments.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.340
That can’t be true.”

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.210
And you’d be kind of right, but I would
also be kind of right, because I did do that

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.730
survey, and 90% of people did agree with those
positive statements about Crash Course--but

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.540
I surveyed 10 people who work on Crash Course.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.320
It would’ve been 100%, but Stan said, “Is
this for a bit?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.540
I’m not participating.”

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.551
Anyway, whether it’s 4 out of 5 dentists
or 9 out of 10 crash course viewers, source

00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.380
and context can make all the difference.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.800
We like to think of data as just being cold,
hard facts, but as we’ve already learned

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.789
in this series, there is no single magical
way to get at the singular truth.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.010
We have to place everything in its context--even
statistics.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.480
In fact, especially statistics.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.320
INTRO

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.020
Okay, so data is raw quantitative or qualitative
information, like facts and figures, survey

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.499
results, or even conversations.

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:25.130
Data can be derived from observation, experimentation,
investigation or all three.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.419
It provides detailed and descriptive information
about the world around us.

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:34.329
The number of teens who use Snapchat, the
rate at which millennials move in or out of

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.679
a neighborhood, the average temperature of
your living room -- those are all data points.

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.819
And data is a really powerful form of evidence
because it can be absorbed quickly and easily.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.779
Like we often consume it as numbers, like
statistics, or as visual representations,

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:50.719
like charts and infographics.

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.669
But as Mark Twain once famously noted: “There
are three kinds of lies.

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:58.229
Lies, damned lies, and statistics.”

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.000
Statistics can be extraordinarily helpful
for understanding the world around us, but

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because statistics can seem neutral and irrefutable,
they can be used to profoundly deceive us

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
as well.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.860
The truth is neither data nor interpretations
of it, are neutral.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.260
Humans gather, interpret, and present data
and we are flawed, complex, and decidedly

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.260
unneutral.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.110
Unfortunately, we often take data at face
value.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.680
Just like with photos and videos, we can get
stuck in the “seeing is believing” trap

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.629
because we don’t all have the know-how to
critically evaluate statistics and charts.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.440
Like a Stanford History Education Group study
from 2015 bears this out.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.750
SHEG, developed the MediaWise curriculum that
this series is based on.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.829
And they asked 201 middle schoolers to look
at this comment on a news article.

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.090
As you can see, the comment includes healthcare
statistics, but doesn’t say where they came

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.090
from.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.750
It doesn’t provide any biographical information
on the commenter either.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.219
But, 40% of the students indicated they’d
use that data in a research paper.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:05.439
In fact many cited the statistics as the reason
they found the comment credible and useful.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:11.189
The sheer existence of quote unquote data
enhanced its credibility despite there being

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.700
no real reason to trust that data.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.790
Whenever we come across data in the wild,
we should ask ourselves two questions:

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.959
Does this data actually support the claim
being made?

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.530
And is the source of this data reliable?

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.930
Here’s an example when it comes to data
relevance.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.079
At the 2018 U.S. Open, Serena Williams was
penalized for yelling at the umpire and smashing

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.719
her racket during the game.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.609
On the court, she argued that men yell far
worse things at umpires and physically express

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.800
their emotions all the time without being
penalized and a few weeks later, journalist

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.920
Glenn Greenwald cited a New York Times story
in a tweet:

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.439
“Now, NYT just released a study of the actual
data: contrary to that narrative, male tennis

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.090
players are punished at far greater rates
for misbehavior, especially the ones relevant

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.170
to that controversy: verbal abuse, obscenity,
and unsportsmanlike conduct”

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.299
Well that sounds very authoritative.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.890
And also he linked to a table that showed
that far more men have been fined for racket

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.879
throwing and verbal abuse than women during
grand slam tournaments.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.910
However, as statistician Nate Silver helpfully
pointed out, this stat only shows that men

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.539
are /punished/ more, which could be because
they misbehave more.

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.590
So all these statistics actually show is the
raw number of punishments, not the rate of

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.009
punishment despite Greenwald’s claims.

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.490
To get the rate of punishment we’d have
to divide the number of punishments by how

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.280
many times men and women misbehave, and that
data isn’t provided here.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.070
So the data in the end does not support Greenwald’s
tweet at all, making his claim that male tennis

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.000
players are punished more frequently… problematic
at best.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.520
To be fair Serena Williams claim is also anecdotal,
although, you know she does watch a lot of

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.520
tennis.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.690
We also need to investigate whether the source
providing the data is reliable, and we can

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.560
do that through lateral reading.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.080
That means opening new tabs to learn more
from other sources about:

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.530
who commissioned the research behind data
, who conducted the research, and why

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.830
We also need to know if the source of the
the information is authoritative, or in a

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.919
good position to gather that data in the first
place.

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.479
Like remember in episode 3 of this series
when we talked about the claim that Americans

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.000
use 500 million straws per day?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.120
We couldn’t confirm how many straws Americans
actually use every day, but we did see that

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.570
sources across the web cited that statistic
even though we found out that it came from

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.070
a 2011 report written by a then-nine year
old child, Milo Cress.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.509
To come up with the figure, he called up straw
manufacturers to ask how many straws they

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:41.509
made.

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.919
There’s no way of knowing if those manufacturers
were telling the truth, or if the group he

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.669
called is representative of the whole industry.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.669
He was 9.

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.730
He was obviously a very bright and industrious
9 year old, but he was 9!

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.380
Apologies to all the 9 yr olds watching.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.150
Thank you for being careful in how you navigate
digital information friends.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.000
A more reliable source of such far-reaching
information might be a nonpartisan research

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.440
organization like the Pew Research Center.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.330
They’re known for reliable, large-scale
studies on U.S. trends and demographics.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.009
Once we know who a source of data is, whether
they’re authoritative, and why they gathered

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.759
it, we should ask ourselves what perspective
that source may have.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.009
They could have a vested interest in the results.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:27.909
Like the beauty influencer you follow who’s
always saying 92% of users of this snail slime

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.690
facial get glowing skin in 10 days.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:35.290
That study may be accurate but there also
may be a hashtag-ad in the caption to quietly

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.650
let you know that the brand in question is
paying them.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.789
But forget about snail slime.

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:41.930
Have I told you about Squarespace?

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.669
We have to take into account when people cite
data that helps them make money.

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:47.669
Including me.

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.270
Alright, so once we know more about where
our data comes from, it’s time to analyze

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.120
how it’s presented.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.930
Data visualizations, like charts and graphs
and infographics, can be amazing ways of displaying

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:04.159
information because one they’re fun to look
at, and two the best infographics take complex

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:09.150
subjects and abstract ideas and turn them
into something that we understand.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.410
Like I love this one that shows how factual
movies “based on a true story” really

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.410
are.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.949
Oh, and this one on cognitive biases.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:21.900
Although I might be cognitively biased towards
appreciating a graphic about cognitive biases.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.629
The great thing about data visualization is
that it’s a creative field, limited only

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:27.689
by a designer’s imagination.

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:33.230
But of course with artistic license comes
the ability to present data in ways that sacrifice

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.230
accuracy.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:39.300
It’s really quite easy to invent a nice-looking
graphic that says whatever you want it to

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.300
say.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.120
So we need to read them carefully and make
sure there’s actually data behind a data

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.310
visualization.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.879
For instance, look at this chart.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:51.330
It makes a claim that, when guns are legal,
lives are saved because gun owners prevent

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.260
deadly crimes -- the “good guys with guns”
theory.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.000
But if you read the fine print, the chart
acknowledges that statistics are not kept

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.560
on crime /prevention/, or crimes that never
happened -- so these figures are not based

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.689
on real data at all.

00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:10.270
The chart also says that fewer homicides take
place when guns are legal than when they’re

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.270
banned.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.659
But what it doesn’t say is where this change
would supposedly take place, and over what

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:17.000
span of time.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.440
For instance homicides went down in Australia
after strict gun control legislation was passed

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.960
on the other hand they also went down in the
United States as gun ownership increased.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.300
What is clear upon closer inspection is that
this graphic, which initially appears to have

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.940
some pretty dramatic estimates about gun control,
is by its own admission mostly speculation.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.580
To trust a data visualizations we need to
make sure that it is based on real data AND

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.510
that the data is presented fairly.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.030
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.150
Here’s a graph that was posted to Twitter
by The National Review, a conservative site

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.740
that often denies the effects of climate change.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.620
It uses data from NASA on the average global
temperature from 1880 to 2015.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.770
It looks like a nearly straight line, with
only a slight increase at the end and the

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.930
tweet, “the only #climatechange chart you
need to see”

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.600
implies that it once and for all shows that
the climate isn’t really getting warmer.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.890
However, the y-axis of this chart shows -10
to 110 degrees,

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.280
which makes the scale of this data very small.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.600
One might say that the chart misleads by zooming
out too far.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.020
If, for instance, the scale was truncated
to show just 55 to 60 degrees, as in this

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.500
Washington Post graphic using the same data,
the change over time looks much more dramatic.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.010
And the original post also leaves out some
much needed context.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.440
The entire globe shifting its average temperature
by even a couple degrees over the period shown

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.160
is extremely unusual
and has an outsized impact on how the climate

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160
functions.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.610
The first chart does not present the change
in this data or its significance in good faith.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:57.430
On the other hand, data visualization can
also be very misleading if it zooms in too

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.430
much.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.370
this chart produced by the administration
of President Barack Obama shows how a truncated

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.010
y-axis can /create/ manipulation, not solve
it.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:11.000
The data behind this chart on graduation rates
is reliable, but by zooming in the scale to

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.030
show from around 70 to 85%, it makes the change
throughout Obama’s administration look much

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.030
more dramatic.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.020
Here’s what it would look like if you could
see the entire scale.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.640
The increase in graduation rates looks much
less significant.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.730
This follows the proportional ink principle
of data visualization.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.350
The size of a filled in or inked area should
be proportional to the data value it represents.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.520
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.460
So a few simple tweaks to how data is presented
can really make a big difference in how it’s

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.460
interpreted.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.940
Whenever we encounter data visualizations,
we need to check that the data is accurate

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.380
and relevant, that its source is reliable,
and that the information is being presented

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.670
in a way that is honest about the conclusions
it draws.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.750
Actually, once you get the hang of sorting
the useful, well-designed data visualizations

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.510
from poorly designed ones, the bad ones can
be pretty entertaining.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.200
If you’d like to see some exceptionally
terrible charts, take a spin through viz.wtf

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.240
or the subreddit data is ugly.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.680
I especially fond of this completely indecipherable
chart about the Now That’s What I Call Music

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.870

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:20.690
The challenge and opportunity of images is
that they are so eye-catching that we sometimes

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:26.660
forget that they’re created by and for humans
who have the ability to manipulate them for

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.020
their own ends.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:34.330
To make our information of lower quality and
thereby make our decisions of lower quality.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.820
And the use of infographics and big data have
become even more popular as our attention

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.160
spans have waned.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.770
After all, it’s much easier to read a pie
chart than an essay or an academic report.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.490
Plus it fits into a tweet.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.560
In summary, whether you’re encountering
raw data on its own or visual representations

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.830
of it, it’s very important to keep a critical
eye out for reliability and misrepresentation.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.100
Thank you for spending several minutes of
your waning attention with us we’re going

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.660
to get deeper into that next time
I’ll see you then.
