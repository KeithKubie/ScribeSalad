MARTIN AGUINIS: Hey, I'm
Martin, and I'm standing here

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.320
with Tao and Ja Young
from our UX Research team

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.850
here at Google.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.650
So I wanted to
start by asking you,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.810
what do you exactly do
as part of UX at Google,

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.370
specifically in Flutter?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.680
TAO DONG: I see UX
in general as trying

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.590
to make sure our product
development is centered

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.920
on user needs and to make sure
they are usable and useful.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.170
But our work on
Flutter is a little bit

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.150
different from
general UX, because we

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.119
will have a developer product.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.940
And we try to make sure the team
understands that programming

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.720
and app development is an
inherently human process

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.020
and human activity.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.440
We want to make sure the
features, the documentation,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.680
the API we design and
implement, satisfy user needs

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.580
and allow the developer to
move as fast as they could

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.015
without frictions and seams
when they use our tools.

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:56.890
MARTIN AGUINIS: Could
you maybe share with us

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.470
a recent study or
something you've

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.870
done to try and understand
our users as part of a Flutter

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.380
effort?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.005
JA YOUNG SUNG: I've been running
Flutter User Survey, so thanks

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:05.940
all for participating in.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.920
We've learned a
lot from our users,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.806
and our main goal is to bridge
the gap between the users

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:12.180
and our engineers,
so that we can

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.750
help our engineers to
prioritize their time and effort

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.860
in developing Flutter.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.943
MARTIN AGUINIS: So in doing
these types of things,

00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:22.200
was there something that was
surprising or shocking as you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.880
did these research projects?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.340
TAO DONG: Yeah, so we had
a recent online experiment

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.900
where we look at different ways
to improve our error messages.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.640
And many of the
community members

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.260
actually participated
in this experiment--

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.560
thank you for your
participation-- but one thing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.040
we found is that adding a little
bit of styling in the error

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.030
message, like
color or structure,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.920
and maybe omitting
some of the details

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.560
can greatly improve
the error message

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.080
comprehension by sometimes 30%.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.980
So we're exploring to formalize
these guidelines to make

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.060
sure Flutter's error messages
will be more usable and easier

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.365
to understand in the future.

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.240
MARTIN AGUINIS: What
motivates you personally

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.792
to work on Flutter every day?

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.750
JA YOUNG SUNG: I think
the fact that Flutter is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.940
open source project is awesome.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.130
I can see that
engineers from Google

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.380
and also the community
members outside of Google

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.870
work together to create
this app called Flutter.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.800
So it's awesome.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
MARTIN AGUINIS: Awesome.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.640
Well, thank you so much.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.590
I had the privilege to
work with you guys on some

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.673
of these projects as well,
and it's very exciting,

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:25.180
and really appreciate you
sharing some of your work.
