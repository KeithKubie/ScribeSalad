00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.820
 
I'm very fortunate to be alive

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830
 
 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.640
 
we all fell on the floor because we

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650
we all fell on the floor because we
 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.820
we all fell on the floor because we
didn't want to get shot and we lay there

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830
didn't want to get shot and we lay there
 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.890
didn't want to get shot and we lay there
on the floor for about 15 minutes and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900
on the floor for about 15 minutes and
 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.830
on the floor for about 15 minutes and
then at some point everyone started

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840
then at some point everyone started
 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.779
then at some point everyone started
getting up and running away we ran

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789
getting up and running away we ran
 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.350
getting up and running away we ran
across the room and I threw myself

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360
across the room and I threw myself
 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.600
across the room and I threw myself
across the barrier and I went through

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610
across the barrier and I went through
 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.020
across the barrier and I went through
the emergency exit and then I ran for

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030
the emergency exit and then I ran for
 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.709
the emergency exit and then I ran for
about two minutes on the streets until I

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719
about two minutes on the streets until I
 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.380
about two minutes on the streets until I
found an open door to some building and

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390
found an open door to some building and
 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.090
found an open door to some building and
I hid in somebody's apartment

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
 
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.900
 
I saw people on the floor so people

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910
I saw people on the floor so people
 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.810
I saw people on the floor so people
probably dead and I I wish I could help

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
probably dead and I I wish I could help
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.610
probably dead and I I wish I could help
somebody but I was I was thinking about

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
somebody but I was I was thinking about
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.700
somebody but I was I was thinking about
saving my life and it's it's really hard

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.009
saving my life and it's it's really hard
to get rid of those images because they

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019
to get rid of those images because they
 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.820
to get rid of those images because they
keep popping up in my head

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830
 
 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.730
