00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760
Nikki Glaser. You have it all

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.900
The name of a professional porn
star

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.777
and the body or an amatuer porn
star.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:16.616
You know I'm a big supporter of
the Me Too movement

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:21.521
but remember, Nikki. Me Too
shouldn't just be what a guy

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.458
says to his friend when he tells
him he had sex with Nikki Glaser

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:27.727
Noted.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.963
There are so many celebrities
here tonight.

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:35.768
We have men from movies, women
from TV, and Lil Rel from

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.971
I'm guessing, the California
Raisins?

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.411
Oh, and now, the lovely Cybil
Shepard is here.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:50.083
I remember years ago when I
heard there was going to be

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:54.587
a movie, a TV movie, about me, I
thought "Oh, God, no."

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.389
because they're always so
dreadful

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:59.992
I was really nervous. Well you
can imagine when relief when I

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:03.329
found out Cybil Shepard was
going to play me

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:07.901
I thought, Cybil Shepard? Great.
No one will see it.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.741
No, Cybil. Isn't it interesting
that your career basically

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:17.543
ended after that roll?

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:21.647
as if you'd offended someone.
Someone with power

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.085
Someone with vast resources and
money.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.955
Who could cook up such a plan?

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.592
Who could craft such a scheme?

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.495
I was me bitch.
