00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.300
Solve for y and
check your solution.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.772
20 minus 7y is
equal to 6y minus 6.

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:09.230
So what I really
want to just do is

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.154
isolate all of the y's on
one side of this equation.

00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:14.320
And then if there's some
coefficient in front of it,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.070
I can divide both sides
by that coefficient.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.730
And I could isolate the
y on either the left side

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.420
or the right side
of the equation.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.660
Actually, let me
do it both ways.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.434
So first, it looks like it'll
be a little bit simpler if I

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:28.850
isolate it on the
right hand side,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.308
and I'll show you
that in a second.

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:33.140
So if I want to put all of the
Y's on the right hand side,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.510
how could I get rid of the
Y's on the left hand side?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.110
I have a minus 7y, or you
could use the negative 7y.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.480
I can add 7y to both
sides of this equation.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.172
So I'm just adding
7y to both sides.

00:00:46.172 --> 00:00:47.880
Then the left hand
side of the equation--

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.550
we have 20 minus 7y plus 7y.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.800
Those are going to cancel out.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.039
You're going to be
just left with 20.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.830
And on the right hand
side of the equation,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.160
you're going to have 6y
plus 7y, which is 13y.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.720
And then you have your minus 6.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.022
And I want only
y's, or multiples

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:08.980
of y's, on the right hand
side of the equation.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.320
So I need to get rid of
this minus 6 over here.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.550
So let's add 6 to both
sides of this equation.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.830
And then on the right hand
side, I have 13y minus 6 plus 6.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.170
That's just 13y-- got
rid of the minus 6.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.600
And I have 20 plus 6.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.570
So that is 26.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.280
So I get 26 is equal to 13y.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.130
I've isolated the y on
the right hand side,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.370
although it's being
multiplied by 13.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.890
So if I just want a y
on the right hand side

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.690
or 1y on the right hand side,
I can divide both sides by 13.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.420
Or the equivalent
statement would

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.380
be to multiply both sides
by 1 over 13-- same thing.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.800
So let's divide both sides
of this equation by 13.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.020
On the right hand side,
13 times y divided by 13.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.880
Well, that's just going to be y.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.240
So this is just y.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.160
And then 26 divided
by 13-- that is 2.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.309
So our solution we got
is y is equal to 2.

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:06.600
Now I want to take a step back.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.370
Why did I say it would
be a little bit easier

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.230
to put the y's on the right
hand side of the equation?

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.060
Well, because that's the way
I got a positive coefficient

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.010
in terms of y.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.170
I got 13y.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.912
If I had subtracted
6y from both sides,

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:23.370
I would have got a negative 13
on the left hand side, which

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.680
would have been a
legitimate thing to do.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830
Let me just show you
what I'm talking about.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.180
So I could have done the
problem this way-- 20 minus

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.520
7y is equal to 6y minus 6.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.920
Now let me just subtract
6y from both sides.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.590
So minus 6y, or negative
6y, from both sides.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.850
The left hand side over
here is 20 minus 13y.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.370
The right hand side--
I got rid of that 6y.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.550
I just have the minus 6 here,
or it's just a negative 6 now.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.980
And now I can subtract
20 from both sides

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.300
to isolate the y's on
the left hand side.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.950
So I'm subtracting
20 from both sides.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.220
I'm doing that to
get rid of this 20.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.860
And so on the left hand
side, I have a negative 13y,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.290
and on the right hand
side, I have a negative 26.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.320
Now I want to divide both
sides of this equation

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.890
by negative 13,
and what do I get?

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.320
Negative 13 times something
divided by negative 13

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.490
is just that something.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.580
I just get a y.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.320
And then negative 26
divided by negative 13 is 2.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.880
So I did it two different ways.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.270
Over here, I isolated the
y's on the left hand side.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.074
Over here, I did it on
the right hand side.

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:41.490
I picked the right
hand side first

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.970
so that everything
stays positive,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.669
but this is an equally
valid way to do it.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.710
Now the last thing I want
to do is just make sure

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.579
that we got the right answer.

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.370
We should probably feel
pretty comfortable.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.290
We got the same answer
doing it two different ways,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.456
but let's actually check it.

00:03:54.456 --> 00:03:56.630
Let's put y equal 2
back into the equation

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.500
and verify that we
get the equality.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.130
So we have 20 minus 7y is 2.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:11.930
So 7 times 2 should be
equal to 6 times 2 minus 6.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.970
So this should be 20 minus 14.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.810
I want to do multiplication
first-- order of operations.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.850
So this is 20 minus 14
should be equal to 6 times

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.166
2 is 12 minus 6.

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:26.224
20 minus 14 is 6.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.440
12 minus 6 is 6.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.010
6 is, indeed, equal to
6, so it all checks out.
