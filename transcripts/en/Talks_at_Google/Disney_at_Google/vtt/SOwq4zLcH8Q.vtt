00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.680
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK, hello everybody.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.680
Thank you for coming.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.680
And for waiting.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.730
We're here with the director of "Brave."

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.690
The new Disney Pixar movie.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.810
It's terrific I saw it yesterday.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.130
Mark Andrews, thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.130
[applause]

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.130
&gt;&gt;Mark: Hi.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.130
Hi.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.519
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And you're a long time animation
veteran.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.310
Worked as a story supervisor of "The Incredibles."

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.679
Worked on the story for "Iron Giant."

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.539
For a couple of the Pixar shorts "One Man
Band" and "Jack-Jack Attack" which are really

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.539
hilarious.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.940
So it's just an honor to have you here at
Google and thanks again so much for coming.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.940
My name's Ryan.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.989
I don't know if anybody cares but I lead the
Google doodle team and we're all Pixar sycophants

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:43.989
on the team.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:44.989
And we love everything that you guys do.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:45.989
&gt;&gt;Mark: [laughing]

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.780
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And again, it's an honor
to have some time to talk with you.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.920
&gt;&gt;Mark: Great.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.920
Great.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.929
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, I realized you also
use some Google products yourself.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.719
You have a blogspot blog?

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.739
&gt;&gt;mark: Uh-huh.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.420
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And it's mostly pictures
of you sword fighting.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.420
&gt;&gt;Mark: Uh-huh.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.140
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And videos of you sword
fighting.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.990
And so, you sign your name "Mandrews" on your
blog posts.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.680
Is that, do people call you Mandrews inside
of the Pixar universe.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.890
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.890
Yes.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.250
That's just my you know when you get to Pixar
you get your email things.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.630
So it's just you know, M. Andrews and it just
turned out to be Mandrews.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.970
So it just kinda stuck.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.130
So now I'm Mandrews.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's good, that's awesome.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.000
And so if people need to email you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.780
&gt;&gt;Mark: They just say Mandrews.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.100
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Mandrews.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.100
Awesome.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.810
And then I read that you didn't originally
plan to be in animation.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.450
Can you kinda give us a little of your epic
journey and how you ended up in, not just

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.140
the industry, but in one of the most coveted
and storied traditions in all of history.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600
&gt;&gt;Mark: Ooops.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600
Ah.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.030
I've been drawing all my life.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.759
You know, ever since I was three.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.090
My dad worked in Lenwood, California.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.020
He was a schoolteacher and counselor and dean
of the high school there.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.789
And computers were just coming out.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.660
So he would bring home the reams of the white
and green computer paper.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.840
'Cause they would only print whatever numbers
on one side, so he'd bring home stacks of

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.950
this stuff for me.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.420
That was just folded, you know.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
Reams of it.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.060
And I would just draw on it and draw on the
opposite side.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.360
So I've been drawing all my life and did high
school and stuff.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm not ambitious.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.670
I didn't have any aspirations to do anything.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.330
I didn't know what I was gonna do after high
school.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.330
I just drew.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.930
I was gonna be a Marine after high School.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.050
All my friends were goin' in the armed services.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.920
My best friend's in the Navy.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.090
I have other friends who were in the Marines.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.620
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That explains some of the
sword fighting.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.620
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.069
Well I've been doing martial arts all my life.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.620
And sword fighting.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.290
And so out of high school, I didn't take any
college prep classes or nothin'.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.880
So high school ends, and I'm all "What do
I do now?"

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.230
So I'm talking to a Marine Recruiter.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.550
I'm not ready to go right into the Marines
right then and there.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.849
So I'm all "Ahh, well, City College I guess."

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.500
So I went to City College and that's where
I got my first formal training as an artist

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.490
and life drawing, perspective, and just drawing.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.099
Which was more like rendering.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.180
You know, crosshatching.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.790
And I did two years of City College.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.830
And this was all in Santa Barbara.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.760
And one class, one semester this guy was offering
this animation course.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.420
And I'd been into Japanese animation my whole
life.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.010
You know, Kimba the White Lion, Speed Racer,
Star Blazers, RoboTech.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.840
You know all this stuff.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.500
Akira had come out when I was graduating high
school and I was just "Whoa, this is amazing!"

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.189
So I'm doing animation class and I'm doing
my own kind of anime type stuff that's just

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.189
ultraviolent.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.189
You know.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.200
Fun thing.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.720
And he tells me, the instructor tells me about
Cal Arts, which is up in Valencia.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.150
California Institute of the Arts.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.489
And I'm all, "You can actually do this for
a living?

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.489
Wow.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.489
I better apply."

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:22.950
So me and my brother applied at Cal Arts and
we got in and I remember calling my recruiter

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.080
the Marine Recruiter and saying "Sorry man,
I'm goin' to art school."

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.680
So, he was kind of upset.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.640
[laughter]
So I did four years of Cal Arts and got my

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.450
degree in film.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.450
Whoopee.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.990
And got out and starved for a year.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.290
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Yeah.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.080
What was starving like for you?

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.080
How did that

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080
&gt;&gt;Mark: oh, it was fun.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.300
It was livin' off a credit card and eating
potato chips and hot dogs.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300
That's it.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.900
That was the cheapest food I could find that
was kinda substantial.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.330
I couldn't do ramen every day.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.350
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Even though you had a predisposition
for Japanese culture.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.600
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes, yes.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.970
But not a predisposition for Japanese food.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.970
Yeah.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.920
&gt;&gt;Mark: I like things that are cooked.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.550
So, all my friends got jobs in the animation
industry and I was the only one who didn't.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.050
I went to the Disney internship right out
of school.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.050
I was the only one out of five who didn't
get fired because I rocked the boat.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I read about that.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.280
And I'm kind of curious.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.450
I mean, like, how did you rock the boat?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.800
I mean, were you a punk?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800
Or were you

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800
&gt;&gt;Mark: They.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800
No.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800
No.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
I was just being me.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Was it the hot dogs?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800
&gt;&gt;Mark: It was the hot dogs.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.680
I was just me, and at the end of the internship
they want you to kind of do a presentation,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
right?

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.810
That this is what I wanna do.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.810
And they were really looking.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.850
I mean this was the hype.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.220
They were animating Lion King when I was there.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.070
And they were rolling out Pocahontas and Hunchback
of Notre Dame and all these things were just

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.320
comin' off of Beauty and the Beast.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.620
So it's startin' to go up.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.410
And DreamWorks is just being created at this
time.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.100
So this was like Golden Age of animation.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.600
So they wanted animators 'cause they didn't
have enough.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.710
And I could animate.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.280
But what I was really falling in love with
was story boarding.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:12.370
So I was the only one out of five interns
who presented two presentations.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.300
And because I presented two presentations,
one in animation and one on story, they don't

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.530
like to make a decision at Disney.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.250
And that's rockin' the boat.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.220
So they came in and looked at it.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.430
And I thought you know, you guys pick.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.430
Either or.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.430
I'm happy.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.430
But they couldn't.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.840
And that just totally threw them and so I
was the only one who didn't get hired.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.410
And then I was blacklisted at Disney.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.410
And they wouldn't hire me.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.680
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I mean it sounds like, I
mean blacklisted seems like you would have

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.460
to have punched somebody named Disney in the
face.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.460
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.460
I don't know.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.250
I was automatically branded a rabble rouser

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.250
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.250
That's like

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.250
&gt;&gt;Mark: For doing two presentations.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.050
You know, and then I went off and starved
for a year.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.050
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.750
&gt;&gt;Mark: And then I got into TV animation.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.230
I was working at Hanna Barbara.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.940
Well, I went back to Cal Arts where I was
teaching a sword fighting class and fencing.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.340
To make some money to eat and live.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.120
And then I got a job on TV.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.430
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So Disney now, I mean obviously
as Pixar is part of the Disney family

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.430
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yup

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.320
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Are there people in the
hallway you've gotta like avert eyes with

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320
because they were

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.760
&gt;&gt;Mark: All those people are gone.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: They're all gone?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.760
Who blacklisted me.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.760
They're all gone.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760
And I survived!

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760
[laughter]

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.300
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I would imagine, and how
much is sword fighting actually?

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.090
I mean that's a good survival skill.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.150
I mean you know, even if things would

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.150
&gt;&gt;Mark: If zombies attack.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.150
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Even if things really go
down.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:30.150
&gt;&gt;Mark: I'm good.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.720
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But in corporate, I mean,
the machinery of corporate.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.220
&gt;&gt;Mark: It's like "The Book of the Five Rings."

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.220
You know.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.220
You treat it like that.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.220
Kind of you know.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:39.220
Hit first.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, but then you went into
TV animation but then it's still like you're,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.120
I would imagine that's starting from the ground
up.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.410
Kind of bottom of the heap?

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:52.251
&gt;&gt;Mark: The good thing about the TV animation,
was you're turning around, you're doin' half

00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.330
an hour episodes in like eight weeks.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.630
So I have to story board a half an hour of
stuff in eight weeks.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.630
So.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.840
And you don't get to redo it.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.780
You kinda do it and it goes off to Korea or
Japan to be animated and that's that.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.580
And then it airs on TV.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.960
So I did five episodes for "the New Adventures
of Johnny Quest."

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.470
Which is a great learning process because
you're just doin' it from your gut.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:21.361
And then Warner Brothers' animation started
up because DreamWorks started up and it was

00:08:21.361 --> 00:08:22.361
being successful.

00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:26.600
So now everybody in Hollywood, all the studios
wanted their own animation business.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.680
And they still kinda do.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:38.300
So, I met a bunch of great people at Disney
who left Disney to start over at Warner Brothers.

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.210
Bill Perkins is one of them.

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.340
He was the art director on "Aladdin" and he's
fantastic.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.210
So I got to know him with my friends who were
working at Disney.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.000
You know, of the internship.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.750
And he went over to Warner Brothers and called
me and my brother.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.190
And says "Come on over here, guys.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.740
This is going to be wildly different."

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:03.570
So we went over there and got hired with Warner
Brothers and then started doing "Quest for

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.960
Camelot" which nobody ever saw.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.960
So don't.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.230
And then "Iron Giant" with Brad Bird.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.970
And that's when I met Brad Bird for the first
time.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:19.340
And then I stayed to do, I was head of story
on "Osmosis Jones."

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.800
And then I got called to work on the first
"Spiderman" movie with Sam Raimi.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.800
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Wow.

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.990
&gt;&gt;Mark: And so I went into live-action storyboarding.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What was that connection?

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:28.130
How did you get hooked up with that?

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.440
&gt;&gt;Mark: Jeff Lynch, who was my head of story
on "Iron Giant."

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.320
After "Iron Giant" was over, I'm doing "Osmosis
Jones" for the next two or something years.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.950
He went on and Sam Raimi was starting up some
movies there at Warner Brothers.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.810
So Jeff got hooked up with him and Jeff went
on to be his story board artist and second

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:55.390
unit director on "Simple Plan", "The Gift",
"For the love of the game", and then finally

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.580
they got, there was a whole Spiderman controversy.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.970
Of what studio gets Spiderman.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:05.160
And Sony came out on top after getting all
through the red tape.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:11.270
So I'm at home workin' on my graphic novel
"Tales of Colossus" you guys can get on

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.270
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Blogspot.com

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.270
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah, blogspot.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.270
You can check it out.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.890
"Tales of Colossus" You can get on Amazon.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.890
$14.99.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:22.820
And, put my kids through school, please.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.860
And so I'm sittin' there working on my comic,
my graphic novel.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.620
And I get a phone call and I pick it up and
it's Jeff Lynch.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.820
He's all "Hey, I want you to come down and
work on Spiderman."

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.600
I'm all "Totally, I'll be down tomorrow!"

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.970
He's all "Fantastic!"

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.760
I hang up the phone, I walk down the hallway,
I'm tellin' the truth.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.950
I walk down the hallway to go back to my little
office and the phone rings again.

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.410
I'm all "Oh, it's Jeff telling me what gate
to go to at Sony."

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.470
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Mmm-hmmm
&gt;&gt;Mark: So I come back and pick it up and

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.580
it's "Hello?"

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.820
"Hey, Mark, it's Brad!"

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.940
"Hey Brad!"

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.220
Brad does the same exact imitation of me.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.220
The exact
[laughter]

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.430
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Raspy voice?

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.760
&gt;&gt;Mark: Same raspy voice.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.810
His imitation of me, my imitation of him is
identical.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.260
So we don't sound like this.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.260
"Hey Mark!

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.310
What's goin' on?"

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.420
I'm all "Brad, what's going' how's it up at
Pixar?"

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.490
'Cause he'd been, you know just started up
at Pixar.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.820
He's all "How's the North Bay?"

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.350
He's all "Oh, man, I love it!

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:20.030
And you know what, I love it so much, I want
you to come up here and be head of story on

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.030
Incredibles."

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.030
I'm all "Totally, dude!

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.410
I'm totally, I'd totally come up!

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.222
I'd check in with my wife and we'd totally
move up there to work with you so, when do

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:28.222
you want me?"

00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:29.222
He's all "Uh, kinda now."

00:11:29.222 --> 00:11:34.730
I'm all "Uhhhhhhh, I kinda' accepted a job
already on Spiderman.

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.320
Do you really need me?"

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.570
He's all "What??"

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.570
I'm all "Jeff Lynch called me."

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.570
He's all "That, Jeff Lynch."

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.910
I'm all "So when do you need me?"

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.630
He's all "No worries, you got some time.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.630
About nine months."

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.630
And I'm all "OK, great."

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.560
So I did back to back superhero movies.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.140
I boarded on "Spiderman", boarded on most
of that movie.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.330
And then I moved up north with my wife and
my newborn and started on "Incredibles."

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.330
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That sounds

00:11:58.330 --> 00:11:59.750
&gt;&gt;Mark: And then been at Pixar ever since.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.750
Twelve years.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:01.750
So.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:02.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's incredible.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.750
I'm a big fan of "Iron Giant."

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:04.750
That was just like a

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.750
&gt;&gt;Mark: Oh great.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: a beautiful, wonderful movie.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.750
&gt;&gt;Mark: Thank you.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.850
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and of course "Incredibles"
is one of my favorites from Pixar as well.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.940
So you weren't a Disney guy, like dyed in
the wool.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.680
Like you weren't, you didn't see "Pinocchio"
45 times.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
&gt;&gt;Mark: No, no.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.090
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And it wasn't your dream.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.610
&gt;&gt;Mark: Nine old men?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.610
Who?

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.610
I didn't care.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.580
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and you were more actually
into the anime.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.320
Japanese stuff.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.860
What kinda' pulled you towards that as opposed
to the traditional or the resurgence of Disney

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.860
animation [inaudible]

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.860
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.860
Well, the.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.860
I mean, I appreciate all that stuff.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.630
I've seen all the Disney movies.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:44.070
But to me as a kid, when I was a kid, cable
TV just started.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.150
It was ON TV.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.190
Anybody remember ON TV?

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.270
It was the first cable channel ever.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:53.180
And they had three kinda stations.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.480
And my uncle who was a professional bachelor,
he was married eight times like Henry the

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.590
Eighth.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.200
He'd date.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.920
Marriage was like dating to him.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.150
But anyway.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.450
He was the coolest guy ever.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.770
Sports cars, and.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.540
But he had ON TV, he had all the best.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:17.270
And we would, my brother would look at the
TV Guide and see what was ON TV, and he's

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:21.560
all "Look, dude, the Apple Dumpling Gang is
on at eight o'clock.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:27.240
But at the same time at ON Channel 3 is Mad
Max."

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.820
Which is rated R. And we're like 10 at the
time.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:31.820
No question there.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.390
&gt;&gt;Mark: I'm all "Dude, we gotta go over."

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:39.360
So we would lie to our parents and lie to
my uncle and say "We wanna come over and watch

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.070
Apple Dumpling Gang" on TV.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.260
And he'd go, “Yeah, sure.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.260
Come on over.”

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.850
So my parents would drop us of.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.850
He'd go off on some date.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Like, hang gliding or something.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.110
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.850
And we'd sit there and as soon as he'd leave.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.850
Click!

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.940
And then we'd turn on Mad Max.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.040
So I grew up on R rated movies when I was
a kid.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.230
[laughs] So to watch Bambi or Sleeping Beauty
I'm like "Hoooo-huuum."

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:06.670
I mean, I appreciated the animation but I
could never, you know, get behind it because

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.360
of the level of the intensity of the stories.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.400
Then I find Japanese animation and it's

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400
It's the real deal.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400
&gt;&gt;Mark: it's insane.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400
It's insane.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.750
I'm all "Supernatural Beasty City, are you
kiddin' me?

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.160
This thing's insane.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160
Ninja Scroll?

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.980
These guys are nuts.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:22.980
Akira?

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:23.980
Oh my God."

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:29.070
So that was what I really appreciated about
Japanese animation is that in that culture,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.530
animation isn't just for kids.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.920
It's for everybody.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.920
Right?

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.380
&gt;&gt;Mark: It's an art form that you can tell
any story in.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.320
And the different levels of intensity of the
story and the film-making behind those, to

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.410
create that intensity was right up my alley.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:46.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: But it, maybe it, was it
important you actually saw that as a kid?

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.740
So I mean, did that impact the way you thought
of children's entertainment?

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.550
Or what children are capable of enjoying?

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.550
Or?

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:53.550
&gt;&gt;Mark: Totally.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.550
I mean, I think that.

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.130
My littlest kid, he's six now.

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.130
Ford.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.130
I have four children.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.790
I have a daughter and three boys just like
Fergus in the movie.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:09.180
But he is kinda grown up with his older brothers
and sisters.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:14.150
So he watches like, Ghost Rider and Wrath
of the Titans and, you know.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.839
He's watching these movies and he'll turn
to me and I'm all "Whaddyou think, Ford?"

00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:18.960
And he's all, "It's alright."

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [laughs]

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.330
&gt;&gt;Mark: you know, PG-13 movies.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:25.650
But every once in a while he'll regress, so
we'll get back home and he'll have me read

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.650
him "Hop on Pop".

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.210
You know, 'cause he needs a little bit of
that too just to balance.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:30.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Pressure down.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.210
Yeah.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.210
A little bit of a kid.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:33.210
&gt;&gt;Mark: Just to take it down a notch.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:34.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Dr. Seuss is pretty cool.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:35.210
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.210
Dr. Seuss is cool.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:37.210
Just not violent.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.210
Well, ah

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.210
&gt;&gt;Mark: I mean, blood spraying, fine.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.210
He's like, I didn't, they lacked the motivation.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.210
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.640
&gt;&gt;Mark: You know, and I'm all "OK, six year
old."

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.540
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I mean, it's a funny thing
in children's entertainment.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.170
You know, there's like, Brothers Grimm and

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.170
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.170
Pretty dark stuff.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.170
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Historically.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.170
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.170
Yeah.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:56.589
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What is it about professional
storytellers that want to terrify children.

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:59.110
&gt;&gt;Mark: Well, I think it's good for them to
get terrified.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.440
&gt;&gt;Mark: I mean because that's what's comin'
down the pike.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.440
You know.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440
I think we shelter our children too much.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.730
&gt;&gt;Mark: I think we shelter our children a
little too much.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.170
'Cause we don't wanna deal with the crying
or whatever.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.100
The nightmares and them getting out of bed
and sleeping in your bed.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:20.160
So, I think what the Grimms and the folk tales
or Aesop's fables, they're saying "Look, we're

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.580
gonna put it in a form that you can digest.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.220
But the lesson is real because when you grow
up, there's people out there that are gonna

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.580
hurt you, rob you, steal you, kill you, take
advantage of you.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.000
And you need to be prepared so that you're
not naïve.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.690
And there are real consequences out there
in the real world."

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.510
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It kind of shows in "Brave"
in a way, it's sort of an anti-princess story

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.510
in a way.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.510
&gt;&gt;Mark: Absolutely.

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.610
From top to bottom, that's one thing that
we were doing.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:56.430
Because, and, you know, bless Pixar for being
one of these companies that is pushing the

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.480
bounds of animation today.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: yeah.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.810
&gt;&gt;Mark: That we can do something darker.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:03.430
Because every Pixar movie there's an honesty
in it.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.760
There's an honesty in the message.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.750
There's an honesty in looking at the characters
and what they have to go through.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.520
We don't have a lot of villains in Pixar movies.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.560
It's the main characters, their own problem.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.270
They have to get over their own self.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.300
Just like we all have issues.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.250
And there's something more real about that
and relatable, right?

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.250
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.250
Definitely.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.960
&gt;&gt;Mark: I don't have a nemesis in real life,
you know?

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.190
So, watching movies with a nemesis you're
just all "So what?" you know?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.700
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It's too easy.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.390
&gt;&gt;Mark: But for "Brave" we were telling that
darker tale and we were embracing that darker

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.429
tale because it's important.

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:46.020
This kid, Merida, she's a teenager.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.420
She's on the cusp of adulthood.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.500
She's at that transitionary spot.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.470
I like to talk when we were making I referenced
Peter Pan all the time.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.630
I said "It's Peter Pan with teeth."

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.620
Because that's that same story in Peter Pan.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.660
It's Wendy's all, her biggest dilemma, she's
getting kicked out of the nursery.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.000
Sleeping with her two brothers.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.030
Boo-hoo.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:12.360
But she goes on this journey and she realizes
"Oh yeah, these guys are childish and idiots

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.520
and stuff and I'm above.

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.950
I'm ready for more.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.890
I am an adult".

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.520
Merida has to go on the same journey but in
a more hard-hitting way.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I wanna talk a little
bit about the star of the movie.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080
&gt;&gt;Mark: Uh-huh.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.600
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Which is definitely Merida's
hair.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600
&gt;&gt;Mark: Uh-huh

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.450
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Tell me, I wanna know a
little bit about the animation that went into

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.450
that.

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:39.290
And the sort of symbolism of hair in this
film that seems to be there.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.580
Give me your thinking about that.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:46.240
&gt;&gt;Mark: Well, you know, movie making is a
visual story telling medium.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.150
And everything that we do supports the story.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.570
The design of the backgrounds, the design
of the castle, I mean, what we're trying to

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.890
say about the land.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:18:59.890
About the characters.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.309
It's all in the design.

00:19:01.309 --> 00:19:06.880
And for Merida, right off the back we knew
she was gonna have this relationship with

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.580
her mother where they were at odds.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:14.130
And if her mother is the queen, who's going
to be regal and noble and wear these long

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.400
flowing gowns that are bejeweled and a crown
and this long hair that's tied up in a braid

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.910
and she's very much in control, what's the
direct opposite of that?

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:27.750
That's the rough hewn dress that looks like
it's tearing open and ripping with the puffy

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.800
sleeves.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.160
And this mass of curly, unbridled wild hair.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.300
You know.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.850
It just had to be red.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.930
Because she's passionate and fierce and independent.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.650
So that as soon as she walks out on-screen
you know exactly what her story is.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:54.590
Without the filmmakers having to go into any
exposition to see what her character is like.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.030
And everything that she does reinforces her
look.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:06.320
She's spirited, she'll talk back, she does
things her own way.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.630
She doesn't make any excuses.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:14.559
And she doesn't compromise so we can have
fun with this character and really get behind

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.040
her and get behind that look.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.310
And it's really iconic and dynamic as much
as she is.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:25.690
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I saw the extra clips
in "The Incredibles" and in that you have

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.110
very closely cropped hair.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.550
Maybe more like Marine style.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:29.550
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:31.660
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Now you're growing your
locks a bit.

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.700
What does your hairstyle tell about your character.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:40.680
&gt;&gt;Mark: Well, you know, since it takes place
in the middle ages, I just wanted to grow

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.760
my hair out.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.090
To just kind of grow it out and be in the
spirit of the movie.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.900
I instituted, when I came on board to direct,
"Kilt Fridays" So everybody started buying

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.830
up kilts and we wore our kilts every Friday.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.850
At work.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:01.440
So it's just to motivate.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.610
And, 'cause we know we're workin' on somethin'.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.040
Everybody's been workin' on it for a long
time.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.790
To kind of keep that passion and energy goin'
'cause it ain't done yet.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.910
You kind of go out of your way to kinda do
this things to kinda pick up the energy and

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:17.910
things.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.320
Because we knew we had something very special
with this movie.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.910
And everybody who's working on it really dug
it.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.970
Knew they were workin' on something special
and workin' on something kind of new.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.340
And we're pushing the boundaries on what we've
done before.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.590
'Cause we've had hair.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.140
We've had cloth.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.140
And simulators and stuff.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.760
We've just never had this much before.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.960
To the levels that we're doing.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.390
I mean even the backgrounds with our effects
team was amazing.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:48.370
The stuff that they had to do in the movie
that's pretty much invisible.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.450
Rain and water and the fires.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:52.450
Hard as hell to do.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.809
I mean, there's lots of organics to sell this
kinda time period and place.

00:21:57.809 --> 00:21:59.630
And that's everything that the computer hates.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.520
The computer hates organics.

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.780
It wants straight clean Tron-like lines.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:07.780
You know?

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.780
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So Google's kind of a nerdy
company.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.780
Lots of engineers.

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.220
I heard another interviewer speaking about,
you guys rewrote almost the entire software

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.280
after this for the cycle.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.280
What went into that?

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.280
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.280
Yeah.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.280
It was 25 years old, right?

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.280
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.920
&gt;&gt;Mark: We don't even have cars that are 25
years old

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.920
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [chuckles]

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.670
&gt;&gt;Mark: without hefty overhaul.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:33.390
So it was time at the studio they decided
we needed to revamp the system and kind of

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.100
create it anew.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.450
And give us all these more powerful tools
and stuff like that.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.090
So, but when do you do it?

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.190
We gotta make a movie?

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.190
Right?

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.350
We gotta use this software.

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:49.750
So "Brave" kind of got assigned to do that.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.610
And everybody said "Yeah.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.610
OK.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.660
Yeah let's do it."

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.320
Which kind of added to the development of
"Brave” because we're developing a software

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.380
system at the same time.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:06.660
So that kind of made the movie in production
increased the length that it was in production.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.660
To make up the stuff.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.420
I mean the software just to do her hair was
two years to develop.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.000
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.070
&gt;&gt;Mark: The water.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.410
So there's a scene where they're playing in
this river.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.960
To do that scene it took a year just to do
the water effects for that scene.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.540
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I'm sure, yeah.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.150
&gt;&gt;Mark: It just took us a long time.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.020
But there's lots of other stuff.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.050
There's animation controls and things that
we did with rigging.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:36.700
We had to rewrite the software that we had
for her hair, to create the hair.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:37.820
Just create the hair.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.390
And then we had to have a whole new software
package to move the hair.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:42.460
And simulate the hair.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.510
That went into the dresses and the clothes
and stuff .And if you looked at "The Incredibles,"

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.820
the first time that we're really doing humans
throughout the movie.

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.720
We had hair, and we had cloth sims.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.820
And they were wrestling matches to do it.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.750
And that was just a "super suit".

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:57.750
That was nothing.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.230
It was one layer.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.440
And Violet had that long straight hair.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.809
And then Merida has all this big curly locks
and everybody's go seven layers of clothing

00:24:07.809 --> 00:24:08.809
on.

00:24:08.809 --> 00:24:10.340
Fergus has got seven layers on.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.340
That's all simmed.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.010
And it's all talking to each other and stuff,
and reacting to each other.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.500
So we've come a long way since "Incredibles."

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:25.870
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So I mean, it seems that
story is the, sort of, sort of leads the way

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.870
at Pixar.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.130
Which is I think why your movies are so incredible.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.130
&gt;&gt;Mark: um-hum.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.620
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: have there been times you
tell the engineers you wanna do something

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:35.059
and they curse at you and kick and scream?

00:24:35.059 --> 00:24:36.059
I mean, what's the example

00:24:36.059 --> 00:24:37.059
&gt;&gt;Mark: [laughs] Right.

00:24:37.059 --> 00:24:38.059
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: of where they told you like,
you're insane.

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:42.530
Do they have to take a walk and suck it up
or is it something that they actually can

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.580
win a battle or two?

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.280
&gt;&gt;Mark: They never say "No."

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.350
Because they like the challenge, too.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.350
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.700
&gt;&gt;Mark: I mean, who wants to work on the same
old thing all the time.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.700
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.250
&gt;&gt;Mark: That's one thing I really like about
Pixar as a company is that they never wanna

00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:59.390
plateau.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.540
They never wanna be comfortable.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.160
As soon as they get comfortable and they get
complacent, we're not gonna be doing good

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.960
movies at all.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.809
So we constantly wanna push it.

00:25:07.809 --> 00:25:11.000
And the technology is always driven by the
story.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.919
So we show up and we go "We wanna do this
thing in Scotland with hair and kilts!"

00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:19.309
They're all, and they go "OK.

00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:22.870
How do we do that?" and they go over hear
and talk.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:28.140
I'll be in the room and I'll say "I want wolves!"
and I walk out.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.880
And they'll be all "How do we do wolves?"

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.620
[mumbling] And they start talkin' and drawing
diagrams and math comes out.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:36.980
Which is one reason I leave the room

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.980
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Sure.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.309
&gt;&gt;Mark: and technical diagrams.

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:42.000
And we have physicists.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.730
And all kinds of people that are workin' at
Pixar.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:49.940
One of our SIM guys made a nanotube radio.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.919
At Berkeley.

00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:53.930
That's what he did before coming to work.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.930
I'm all "How does this compare?"

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.059
He's all "This is so much more fun!"

00:25:57.059 --> 00:25:58.410
I'm all "OK."

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.520
Just makin' things go, you know, like this.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.540
But they love the challenge and they go for
it and they'll come back and say "We can't

00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.490
do it.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.490
We can't do that.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.990
But we got this other thing."

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.920
And then you find ways of getting what you
want.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:26.060
But they usually don't say, throw down their
fists and pound the table and get upset.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.690
They're like "How do we do that?"

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:30.430
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: They know you're a sword
fighter.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.490
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.490
Yeah.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:33.490
I'm super intimidating.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:34.490
At work.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.550
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [laughs] Yeah.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.179
You mentioned Kilt Friday's.

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:42.950
And other ways you try to keep the crew motivated.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:47.340
You know it's' a very long development cycle
for a film, compared to what we work on

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.340
&gt;&gt;Mark: It can be.

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.340
Yeah.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:50.340
Sure.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.340
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: at Google.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.020
So, you know, how do you sustain the excitement
years in, you know?

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.640
To keep people motivated and fresh.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.780
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: 'Cause when it comes out
it seems like, you know, there's a beautifully

00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.780
crafted thing.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.870
And you don't get a sense of the labor.

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:02.870
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:03.870
And you shouldn't.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.870
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:09.350
&gt;&gt;Mark: But, it's just, I think, I mean for
me, I like the challenge.

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.000
And I like the problem solving aspect of story.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.660
You know, how do you take an idea or develop
an idea from scratch and get an audience to

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.789
care about it and emote and react to it?

00:27:21.789 --> 00:27:25.050
And there's a billion and one ways to skin
a cat.

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:32.980
There's so many potential ways to go on a
movie to show off a character or to describe

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.080
this bit of information.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.550
But what's the right way?

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:40.861
So that everything falls in line and the audience
is with you.

00:27:40.861 --> 00:27:41.861
You know?

00:27:41.861 --> 00:27:45.450
And this crying or laughing or on the edge
of their seats.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.780
So I love that problem.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:53.480
And I think everybody at Pixar kinda has that
fascination to solving the problem.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.900
You know?

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:00.340
And especially when we have these stories
that we ourselves dig and we're fans of.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.400
We're our harshest critics at Pixar.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.750
We put up the movie and storyboard reels and
we watch it.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.190
Everybody together.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.610
And we go "That totally blew.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.450
What did we do wrong?" and we tear it down
and we do it again.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.440
And we do this constantly.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.090
Look at it because one of the lessons we learn
is that the proof is in the pudding.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:27.050
So you can talk about it all you want of what
the scene should be or what the story should

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.419
be or the direction you should go.

00:28:29.419 --> 00:28:35.559
But until you actually see it playing in time
in context, with everything involved working,

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:39.510
or not working, that's when you know.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.210
I mean, you guys all see movies right?

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.210
You guys all see movies?

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.470
How many people saw a sucky movie recently.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.470
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [chuckles]

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.680
&gt;&gt;Mark: What do you see after you see a sucky
movie?

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.750
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Gripe about it.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.530
&gt;&gt;Mark: You gripe about it.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.320
And you talk about what they should have done,
right?

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:59.500
That they dropped the ball or it wasn't invested
or it wasn't interested.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.330
That's what we do all day.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.330
That's my job.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:06.350
Is to make a movie, a sucky movie.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.820
Look at it, and then gripe about it.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.580
Say "Man, they didn't have any motivation.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.910
That character was totally pointless in the
movie.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.880
Why did they go here, they should have gone
here.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.880
Hooooooo."

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.419
And then take it down and do it again and
stick it up and go "Less sucky.

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:23.890
But still the ending I'm not.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:24.890
I don't care."

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.320
And then you take it back and put it back
up and that's what we do.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:32.820
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: You mentioned all the details
that go into the Pixar films.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.860
And I just wanna say that they're appreciated.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:38.250
Like it's really wonderful to see so many
things put together.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.210
And you know, the one of the triplets lip-synching
to the story is awesome.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:46.059
'Cause the triplets don't speak in the whole
film, but that's the one time they get to

00:29:46.059 --> 00:29:47.059
speak

00:29:47.059 --> 00:29:48.059
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:49.059
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and it's just, there's so
many terrific moments like that.

00:29:49.059 --> 00:29:50.340
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.890
Seeing it several times actually.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:55.970
You mentioned, I've heard you say a few times
that story is hell.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.010
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yep.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:00.360
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Why is story so hard.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.490
&gt;&gt;Mark: It's the 666th layer of the abyss.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.130
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [laughs]

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.910
&gt;&gt;Mark: Because you can't pin it down.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:12.250
Because there's so many possibilities.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.120
And what's the right possibility?

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:22.050
And we kind of go into it intellectually,
of what we need it to be about these characters.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.050
And their purpose.

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.490
And how do we get the information to the audience?

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.490
You know.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.830
In an economic and clear kinda way so that
they get all these ideas and the themes and

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.900
they have an experience.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.670
That's a tall order.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.039
And it's trial and error.

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:39.350
I mean the, I teach, too.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.000
I teach visual story telling and storyboarding.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.640
And my students are always asking me for the
silver bullet.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.640
"What's the silver bullet?

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.640
What's the silver bullet?

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.640
What's the secret?"

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.140
I'm all, "The secret is just a lot of hard
work.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.120
It's banging your head against the concrete
until you make a hole in the wall and you

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120
can go through."

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.590
Is basically what it is.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:03.830
You just have to try stuff on for size and
see that it doesn't work and try it again

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.620
and try it again and try it again.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:13.950
Michelangelo talked about looking at the big
thing, square of marble and seeing the inside.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.620
We don't know what it is.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.650
We don't know what it is on the inside.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:25.380
We start chippin' at marble and then we ruin
that entire piece of marble going "I don't

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.380
want David.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:27.380
I want.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.380
Oh, now I know what I want!"

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.560
And we'd start on another piece of marble.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:32.799
I like to refer to it as alchemy.

00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.799
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:31:33.799 --> 00:31:35.130
&gt;&gt;Mark: We're changing lead to gold.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.559
And as soon as we have gold, we go "Haha!

00:31:38.559 --> 00:31:39.559
Yes!

00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:40.559
How did we do that?

00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.559
I don't remember.

00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:43.320
" I have no idea what the formula was.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.470
And we can't replicate that formula so every
time we go into another movie it's a new set

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:49.470
of problems.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.679
It's a new set of variables.

00:31:50.679 --> 00:31:52.240
And it's different every time.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.980
I mean, there are.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.360
You have all these experiences from making
the movies.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.380
I have my executive producers John Lasseter,
Andrew Stanton and Pete Docter.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.659
And they're walkin' around with their Academy
Awards.

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:07.020
They bring 'em into the office and say "Knk.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.260
OK, you're gonna do it this way buddy."

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.950
They don't do that.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:11.950
[laughter]

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:16.170
But they have all this experience so they
kind of know where the pitfalls are, before

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.780
you get there.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.179
But they also don't have all the answers either.

00:32:21.179 --> 00:32:25.540
[snapping] Or else these films would not take
the time that it takes to do them and we'd

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.630
be out the door.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:30.049
With five films a year.

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:31.299
No problem.

00:32:31.299 --> 00:32:34.290
But everything it's difficult.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:35.429
It's really, really, really difficult.

00:32:35.429 --> 00:32:38.230
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do you ever worry that the
seams are gonna show?

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.821
I mean is that a fear for you that a movie
is gonna come out and people are gonna, you

00:32:41.821 --> 00:32:42.821
know.

00:32:42.821 --> 00:32:43.821
&gt;&gt;Mark: Oh yeah.

00:32:43.821 --> 00:32:45.870
There's tons of stuff in here that the seams
are showing.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.940
And I'm just goin' [chomps teeth] You know?

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:52.500
Is anybody in the audience gonna notice?

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.289
Because again, we're our own harshest critics.

00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:56.860
We know what's half-baked.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:57.860
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Sure

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.380
&gt;&gt;Mark: And what's not fully cooked.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:06.340
There's that scene in "Tucker", the movie
"Tucker" where they present the car.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.350
To show it off.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.929
But it doesn't have an engine on it and it
can't even move?

00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:13.220
That's kinda how we feel sometimes.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.870
Because it's not, you can still work on it.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.610
Or is that the best solution I have for that
moment?

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.990
Or to tell that story or that part of the
story?

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.320
'Cause there could have been something just
around the corner.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Right.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.360
&gt;&gt;Mark: and that's the other thing.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.940
I like working in the parameters.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:30.940
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Sure.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.669
&gt;&gt;Mark: And that's what I learned from TV,
is that, if you don't have time, you kinda

00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:38.110
get more creative and what really happens
is you get more objective.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.110
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: yeah.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.030
&gt;&gt;Mark: So you're willing to kill your babies
faster.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:45.470
'Cause you make a baby and then you kill it,
'cause that's not, you didn't want that one.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:49.100
I know, it's a violent process.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.920
Stories are a violent process.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.570
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We've done that at Google
doodle where you have the letters and we "kill

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.570
babies" all the time.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.570
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.570
Oh yeah.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.570
You're going "No.

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:58.570
No."

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:02.380
I mean, when I used to work on paper, I wouldn't
even bother when I did a drawing, I wouldn't

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.169
even bother putting it in the trashcan.

00:34:04.169 --> 00:34:06.630
I'd be working so fast, it'd be "No.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.630
No.

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.630
No.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.630
Oooo that's interesting.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:10.630
Save.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:11.630
No.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.630
No."

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:14.159
And you come into my room and it's wall to
wall drawings.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:19.929
The animators would come in and pick through
the drawings of these rough half-baked ideas

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.690
and steal them and go away.

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.319
Every once in a while, every three months,
I could literally roll up my floor.

00:34:26.319 --> 00:34:30.239
I start at one corner, because they're all
interlaced, all these pieces of paper.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:31.789
And I just start rollin' it up.

00:34:31.789 --> 00:34:37.739
And I walk out with this six foot roll of
storyboards and dump it in the trash.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:38.739
But it's that.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.339
It's being objective.

00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:41.599
It's finding the thing.

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:44.929
The kernel of an idea that I get excited about
as an audience.

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.379
I have to be the audience.

00:34:46.379 --> 00:34:47.379
And go "Oo!

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:48.379
Oo!

00:34:48.379 --> 00:34:49.379
I love that!

00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:50.379
What does this mean?

00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:51.379
I don't know yet, but it's something."

00:34:51.379 --> 00:34:53.100
And then I'll figure out how to put it in.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.790
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And then so years of effort,
many six foot tubes of drawings

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:57.790
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.249
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: A film comes out.

00:34:59.249 --> 00:35:00.819
What does success mean to you?

00:35:00.819 --> 00:35:03.269
How do you feel like, a job well done?

00:35:03.269 --> 00:35:05.740
I mean, you've been part of so many incredible
films.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.740
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:11.960
I think, when we have our wrap party.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.609
And the crew is seeing it finished.

00:35:14.609 --> 00:35:15.839
Totally completed.

00:35:15.839 --> 00:35:19.470
And they're laughing and crying and on the
edges of their seats.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.559
Because they're the harshest critics, you
know?

00:35:21.559 --> 00:35:25.489
And they come up to me and say "I love the
movie, Oh my gosh, that was so great!"

00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:27.890
They could be lyin' in my face.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.749
But I hope they're not.

00:35:29.749 --> 00:35:33.270
And so when they said "I love the movie, oh
my gosh it was so good."

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.750
When I have Brad Bird goin', "Mark.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.750
No.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:37.750
Really."

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:40.609
You know, then I've done my job.

00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:45.440
When John's sittin' there going "Ah-ahahahahahah!"
and tears are in his eyes

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.210
[laughter]

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.529
A multi Academy award winner.

00:35:49.529 --> 00:35:51.430
I'm done.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:54.670
I've done my job and I'm ready to get on to
the next one.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.200
If it comes out and it doesn't make a dime,
I don’t care.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.240
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.759
I cried on, I'm gonna admit to you I cried.

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:04.180
But I hedged my bets because my girlfriend
was sitting next to me.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.180
&gt;&gt;Mark: [laughs]

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:09.200
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And I sort of tilted my
head so the tear, it was more of like a single

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.200
tear running down the side.

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200
And she was on the, she

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.279
&gt;&gt;Mark: She didn't see it?

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:13.890
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: She heard me sniffling.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.440
She's like "Oh, are you crying."

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.950
And I'm like.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:19.059
And I could do this sort of like, you know.

00:36:19.059 --> 00:36:20.059
[laughter]

00:36:20.059 --> 00:36:21.059
&gt;&gt;Mark: Like, right.

00:36:21.059 --> 00:36:22.059
Right.

00:36:22.059 --> 00:36:23.059
With your drink.

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:24.059
[slurps]

00:36:24.059 --> 00:36:25.059
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Right.

00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:27.880
Use like a straw, like [slurps] Suck it up.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.690
But I think the movie is gonna be a big success
because it's terrific.

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:31.690
&gt;&gt;Mark: right.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:32.690
Thank you.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.039
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Again, thanks so much.

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:36.880
I think now we can open up for questions.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:42.270
I've satisfied my immediate curiosities and
anybody in the audience might also have some?

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.569
There's some questions online that we can
ask as well.

00:36:45.569 --> 00:36:46.569
&gt;&gt;Mark: Well.

00:36:46.569 --> 00:36:47.569
Sure.

00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:48.569
Sure.

00:36:48.569 --> 00:36:49.569
&gt;&gt;male #1: Alright, my name's Tyler.

00:36:49.569 --> 00:36:53.239
So coming from the perspective of a storyteller,
animator and storyboarder, how do you adjust

00:36:53.239 --> 00:36:54.289
that when it comes to 3D.

00:36:54.289 --> 00:36:55.460
Now that 3D is an aspect.

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:58.070
Does that have an effect on the story at all?

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.390
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah, and that's a great question.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.780
3D is just another visual tool right?

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:11.249
When I saw, I don't like 3D particularly because
I think there's weird things happening with

00:37:11.249 --> 00:37:17.170
my eyeballs, 'cause I'm already seeing depth,
and then you're putting this kinda fake depth

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.099
on there.

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:25.029
But when I saw Avatar, 'cause James Cameron,
love James Cameron and he loves 3D.

00:37:25.029 --> 00:37:26.670
And I'm going "Why does he love 3D?"

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:32.089
When I see Avatar, what he was doing with
the 3D, I'm pullin' off my glasses goin' "There's

00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:33.789
no 3D in this scene.

00:37:33.789 --> 00:37:34.789
Oh, there's 3D.

00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:36.220
Oh, there's no 3D here."

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.930
He's using it as a tool to help tell the story.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.359
He's using it to impact the experience.

00:37:43.359 --> 00:37:44.640
The emotional ride.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.390
The, you know, when there's a lot of depth
because the character is going through some

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.400
intensive moment, he cranks up the 3D.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.029
And when it's just talking heads he doesn't.

00:37:54.029 --> 00:37:59.809
Or when there's lots of things crossing, to
enhance that visual space.

00:37:59.809 --> 00:38:06.549
He's using it as a tool like I use color or
the camera move or editing or design.

00:38:06.549 --> 00:38:10.010
These are all visual tools to help tell a
story.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:16.250
So that when we were doing 3D on this, with
Bob Whitehill, our stereo-, stereog-, [garbles]

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.250
guy.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:18.789
See, the no school.

00:38:18.789 --> 00:38:19.789
[laughter]

00:38:19.789 --> 00:38:20.839
Art school.

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:23.569
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: same here.

00:38:23.569 --> 00:38:28.289
&gt;&gt;Mark: Our stereographer.

00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:31.220
I would always, we'd look at the pieces like
"OK, OK.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.099
Here I want almost zero depth.

00:38:34.099 --> 00:38:37.410
Because it's not dynamic.

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:40.890
Here she is riding through the forest, we're
totally dyna-, I want all the depth you can

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.029
give me."

00:38:42.029 --> 00:38:43.829
And dialing in and out of that.

00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:44.829
So it blooms.

00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:49.099
'Cause if it's 3D all the time, and depth
all the time.

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:51.349
Then what is that statement to the viewer?

00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:55.819
That would be like listening to something
on absolute loud all the time.

00:38:55.819 --> 00:39:00.329
And there has to be variation and rhythms
just like there's variation and rhythms in

00:39:00.329 --> 00:39:01.480
the storytelling.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.710
So the visuals have to support the story.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.359
So 3D is just another tool to help do that.

00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:09.900
That's how I'm usin' it, anyway.

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.880
You're not gonna catch the same thing on "Clash
of Titans" or anything like that.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.880
Yes!

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.289
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi, I have a couple questions
that were submitted over the internet.

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:21.099
And they're similar so I'll read em together.

00:39:21.099 --> 00:39:26.099
Pablo from Vancouver says "Hi, as a screenwriting
student I would like to know how the writing

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:27.849
process of 'Brave' was.

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:30.010
I see four people have screenwriting credits.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:35.700
Did it change when you joined as director?"
and also Connor from Sicklerville, New Jersey

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.670
wants to know how much did the story change
since its original conception in 2008.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.509
&gt;&gt;Mark: Great.

00:39:42.509 --> 00:39:44.339
Good questions.

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:45.339
Uhhhhh.

00:39:45.339 --> 00:39:46.339
How did the story change?

00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:49.579
The bones has always been the same of the
story.

00:39:49.579 --> 00:39:55.160
Brenda Chapman, my fellow director, who started
the project, it was her original idea and

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.930
concept.

00:39:56.930 --> 00:40:01.190
That was based off of her experience as a
parent with her six year old daughter who's

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:07.719
this very feisty, spirited, willful, talkback
child at six.

00:40:07.719 --> 00:40:12.109
So she kind of projected ahead to when her
daughter was going to be a teenager.

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:15.079
And kinda went "Oh my God, what is this gonna
be like?"

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:21.660
So it was that kind of core relationship of
that parent and child during these very transitional

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:25.969
time period as a teenager, was always at the
heart of the story.

00:40:25.969 --> 00:40:29.730
Setting in Scotland was always at the heart
of the story.

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:34.220
And this magic that was going to happen in
the story.

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.480
I don't wanna ruin it for anybody as you'll
see in the movie.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.280
We're keepin' the secrets.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.880
Was always part of the story.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.680
And like I was talking about before.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.009
How exactly do you tell that story?

00:40:47.009 --> 00:40:49.269
You go in and out and you try different things.

00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:55.039
There was this, there was competing characters
at one time.

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:59.989
Merida, mom and dad were kind of competing
for Merida in a sense.

00:40:59.989 --> 00:41:05.039
Is Merida gonna be more like her dad Fergus,
or is Merida gonna be more like her mother?

00:41:05.039 --> 00:41:09.450
And they were kinda pulling her attentions
And those types of things.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:18.910
So when I came on, what I did was there was
this kind of like 18 month deadline.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:19.910
And

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.910
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Wow.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.219
&gt;&gt;Mark: The story wasn't going.

00:41:22.219 --> 00:41:26.579
It wasn't where it needed to be at 18 months
before we released.

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:29.489
So and this had happened before on "Ratatouille"
on "Toy Story II".

00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:31.640
We've had director changes at Pixar before.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.630
And Pixar will do whatever is necessary to
tell that great story.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.940
Whether it's push back the release date, or
unfortunately, have a director change.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:48.440
So Pixar asked me to jump on board, to take
over directing on "Brave" and so what I did

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.849
is, I looked at it as an adaptation.

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:55.210
I'd just come off of adapting "John Carter
of Mars" And writing that with Andrew.

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:59.259
So I looked at it as an adaption where there's
thing that definitely worked in the story

00:41:59.259 --> 00:42:00.440
and things that didn't.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.890
So clearing those out kind of left spaces.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.329
And I can do that coming in and being objective.

00:42:06.329 --> 00:42:08.180
Because it wasn't mine.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.099
I didn't create it.

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:12.630
So that left holes.

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.930
You know, to go to the comment about the script
writing.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:22.859
There were still elements of the script that
were kept and then I wrote the script with

00:42:22.859 --> 00:42:27.710
Steve Purcell who was the original co-director
with Brenda.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:28.950
So there was a continuity there.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.039
But we would rewrite the script.

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:32.829
On lots of scenes.

00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:35.680
Mordu, that whole element came up.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.740
What exactly the magic was and how it worked
changed.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.680
And the main thing I did was made it just
Merida's story.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.709
Just made it about the teenager so I could
have that straight through line.

00:42:48.709 --> 00:42:52.930
And kinda clean up the balance of the story.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:58.800
Because there was a lot of characters drawing
the balance away from the main conflict.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:02.640
So the screenwriting process is again, it's
trial and error.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.339
I write, I pass it out to the storyboard guys.

00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:06.799
They visualize it.

00:43:06.799 --> 00:43:07.979
So they story board it and put it up.

00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:10.650
And then we look at the scene and I go "No,
no, no, no.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:11.650
This doesn't work.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:12.999
Let's try this that and the other thing.

00:43:12.999 --> 00:43:16.309
" They do the notes, I put it in editorial.

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:18.609
We watch it as it's timed and edited.

00:43:18.609 --> 00:43:21.440
I'm going "You know that line doesn't work
and da, da, da."

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.150
And you constantly are in this state of evolution
and changing it.

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:29.200
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Those are, the creation,
but those are big changes.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.519
Top down.

00:43:30.519 --> 00:43:31.519
Director changes.

00:43:31.519 --> 00:43:36.450
What about the kinda bottom up changes, like
you know, gags that come in from the story

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.450
artists.

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.450
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right, Right.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.789
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Does that ever turn into
like a dramatic shift in the story?

00:43:40.789 --> 00:43:42.039
Or like a tone in the scene?

00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:43.039
Or?

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:44.039
How does that go down.

00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:45.039
&gt;&gt;Mark: Sure.

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:46.039
Yeah.

00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:47.039
Absolutely.

00:43:47.039 --> 00:43:48.039
'Cause we're constantly looking for what the
entertainment is.

00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:49.039
Of this scene.

00:43:49.039 --> 00:43:50.039
So is there a chance to make it funny?

00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:52.489
Or, or, or, it's not really working.

00:43:52.489 --> 00:43:57.729
Well, because the action of the situation
isn't entertaining.

00:43:57.729 --> 00:43:59.700
So let's change the action of the situation.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.559
Oh my gosh!

00:44:01.559 --> 00:44:04.269
It's totally entertaining.

00:44:04.269 --> 00:44:05.269
I can't use this one.

00:44:05.269 --> 00:44:06.269
Oh, yes I can.

00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:12.299
So there's this one idea that we had where
Mom is griping to Fergus about her daughter.

00:44:12.299 --> 00:44:13.299
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Sure.

00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:14.299
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right.

00:44:14.299 --> 00:44:16.200
'Cause the parents always talk about the kids
right, when the kids are away or in bed.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.200
We always talk about

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.200
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I know where you're going
with this.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.200
This is a cool thing.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.200
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yeah.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:25.640
And Merida had her own scene where she's griping
and worried about her future of this getting

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.740
married and being pushed into this.

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.609
And they were two separate scenes.

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:31.819
And we knew we had to have this information.

00:44:31.819 --> 00:44:36.630
'Cause we need to get behind the Mom and we
need to understand what Merida's fears were

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.999
and her concerns about losing herself.

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:42.640
But they were two separate scenes and they
had been for a while.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:45.209
And it was this huge road bump.

00:44:45.209 --> 00:44:47.670
Like how do we get, they're not working.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.140
But the information is right.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.380
We have to have this information.

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.900
So we're arguing about it in the story room.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.859
Me and the story guys.

00:44:57.859 --> 00:44:59.670
Just hammering on it and hammering on it and
hammering on it.

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:03.479
I'm going "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a
minute."

00:45:03.479 --> 00:45:08.430
'Cause somebody goes "Well, if they just talk
to each other, the movie would be over.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.680
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [chuckles] That's true.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.119
&gt;&gt;Mark: And I'm all "Why don't we have em
talk to each other?

00:45:13.119 --> 00:45:14.119
" And they're all "What?"

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:15.430
I'm all "Let's have 'em talk to each other."

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:16.890
They're like "What are you talkin' about?"

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.390
And I'm all "Listen."

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:26.400
And then I pitched them the scene in the movie
where Eleanor, the queen, is talking to Fergus,

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:33.809
as if Fergus was Merida and Merida is talking
to her horse, as if the horse was Eleanor.

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:37.770
But I intercut that conversation so they're
talking to each other.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:42.019
And it instantly made it super entertaining.

00:45:42.019 --> 00:45:45.869
And we got all the information out in this
very economical way.

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:48.640
Those things happen all the time.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.640
Right?

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.170
And that's that gold when you find it.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:52.170
You're all "Bingo!

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.170
Voom!

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:55.359
Done!' and when everybody saw it they're all
"Whoo-hoo!"

00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:56.950
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: yeah.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:57.950
Awesome.

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:02.369
&gt;&gt;Mark: I hope that answers your questions
internet guys.

00:46:02.369 --> 00:46:03.369
[laughter]

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:06.249
&gt;&gt;male #2: Hi.

00:46:06.249 --> 00:46:12.880
Every few years there seems to be either a
trend or a breakthrough in effects that centers

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.099
around a certain technology.

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:18.160
Like 10, 15 years ago, it was cloth and hair.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.559
And then crowd simulations.

00:46:20.559 --> 00:46:24.210
What a digital and compositing and particle
systems.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.210
VOX.

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:26.270
And all these kinda things.

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:30.920
And it sounds like you rewrote everything
for Brave.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.130
What would you say the next challenge or trend
is?

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:38.459
In, or, big challenge for animators?

00:46:38.459 --> 00:46:39.779
Especially around effects.

00:46:39.779 --> 00:46:40.779
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right.

00:46:40.779 --> 00:46:41.779
Right.

00:46:41.779 --> 00:46:46.269
&gt;&gt;male#2: What's the most difficult thing
that people are trying to attack right now?

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:47.269
&gt;&gt;Mark: Right.

00:46:47.269 --> 00:46:48.680
Well that's a great question.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.349
I know that we're working on lighting right
now.

00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:55.059
Real interactive high speed lighting.

00:46:55.059 --> 00:47:00.319
So that, 'cause in animation I can't just
put, we turn on these lights, they hit me

00:47:00.319 --> 00:47:01.529
they're hittin' you.

00:47:01.529 --> 00:47:02.839
They're bouncin' across the floor.

00:47:02.839 --> 00:47:05.640
The bounce light from the floor is hittin'
the chairs.

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.640
It's lighting the chairs.

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.989
We've got the sunlight comin' in from there.

00:47:07.989 --> 00:47:12.059
I mean everything's splashing around and doing
stuff for free.

00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:15.029
We don't need to do anything in real life.

00:47:15.029 --> 00:47:17.219
In animation, that's its own light.

00:47:17.219 --> 00:47:23.959
And what it's doing to me, I have to have
another light and what it's doing to the wall,

00:47:23.959 --> 00:47:29.299
I have to assign a quality to that wall so
that it operates the way that this paint should

00:47:29.299 --> 00:47:30.299
versus the carpet.

00:47:30.299 --> 00:47:31.539
You know all that stuff.

00:47:31.539 --> 00:47:38.279
So what they're tryin' to do right now is
develop, like real light source reacting.

00:47:38.279 --> 00:47:43.200
So that everybody already has assigned things
so when the computer turns on the light in

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.380
the virtual world, it's go, "Oh, plastic.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.380
Chair.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.380
Carpet.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.380
Skin.

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380
Levi's.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.380
Watch.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.380
Reflective surface.”

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.380
All that kinda stuff.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.380
And you kinda get it for free.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.579
So we don't have to manipulate and put all
these little lights.

00:47:57.579 --> 00:48:00.059
These invisible lights all over the place.

00:48:00.059 --> 00:48:01.719
So I know they're working on that.

00:48:01.719 --> 00:48:07.380
But that is just a small step to get towards
the bigger step which is context.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.589
Right?

00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:11.039
Animation is movie making in slow motion.

00:48:11.039 --> 00:48:13.989
Because we're constantly building the context.

00:48:13.989 --> 00:48:15.829
We get nothing for free.

00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:23.309
So what they're trying to do is, when the
animators get it, it looks like done.

00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:25.289
And can animate done.

00:48:25.289 --> 00:48:27.319
With the lights done.

00:48:27.319 --> 00:48:28.769
And the set done.

00:48:28.769 --> 00:48:33.039
So we could look at it, constantly in context.

00:48:33.039 --> 00:48:36.509
So I think that is the next big step.

00:48:36.509 --> 00:48:39.799
&gt;&gt;male #2: So you mean like animating in a
real time render.

00:48:39.799 --> 00:48:41.549
&gt;&gt;Mark: animating in a real time render.

00:48:41.549 --> 00:48:45.859
And there's some gaming companies that are
kind of doing this already with their game

00:48:45.859 --> 00:48:46.980
engines.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:52.869
They're makin movies or cinematics in the
game that they built.

00:48:52.869 --> 00:48:56.950
I saw "Half Life II", I'm all "Whoooooooooaaaa".

00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:00.890
I mean, the things and my guns shooting and
it's moving stuff on the walls and it's interactive

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:01.890
and it's real.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:02.890
It's real time.

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:05.569
I'm all "We can make a movie in this!"

00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:07.009
People are actually doing that.

00:49:07.009 --> 00:49:11.479
They'll play the zombie game and they'll have
one guy out there zipping zombies with their

00:49:11.479 --> 00:49:18.809
cheated bazooka gun while the crew is inside
actually shooting on the set.

00:49:18.809 --> 00:49:20.369
It's crazy.

00:49:20.369 --> 00:49:25.229
They're using the game engines so they can
bring in the animation and have the guys stand

00:49:25.229 --> 00:49:26.229
around and that.

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:29.510
And they have to go back and touch, for lip
synch and things like that.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:33.219
But they can more the camera around and they
shoot coverage and things and they're on the

00:49:33.219 --> 00:49:35.069
walkie talkies "OK, I'm comin' in now.

00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:36.069
Get ready.

00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:38.059
And, action!" and they do all the stuff just
like you do.

00:49:38.059 --> 00:49:41.039
So that's fantastic.

00:49:41.039 --> 00:49:43.579
And that's the kinda stuff that I wanna do.

00:49:43.579 --> 00:49:47.199
You know, using motion capture to get to those
answers quicker.

00:49:47.199 --> 00:49:48.199
Right?

00:49:48.199 --> 00:49:50.979
Because we can go down so many paths.

00:49:50.979 --> 00:49:57.190
When I was shooting live action on "John Carter"
we had spontaneity like this [snaps] all the

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.190
time.

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.640
I could tell Taylor Kitch or Earlan Collins.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640
"No no, no, no.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:02.699
Come in different.

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:06.579
Even more frazzled and harried.

00:50:06.579 --> 00:50:10.170
This is, life is on the line.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:11.170
Come in you're totally defeated.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:12.170
Now, lone kid.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:13.170
That, that's' good.

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:14.319
I got that one, come in totally defeated."

00:50:14.319 --> 00:50:17.289
And you're finding the scene in the context.

00:50:17.289 --> 00:50:23.180
In animation we have to [chuckles] build the
context and then find the scene as we're goin'

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.180
along.

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.279
We have to put in the serendipity.

00:50:26.279 --> 00:50:32.029
So any camera shake or out of focus things
that you see in an animated film isn't a mistake.

00:50:32.029 --> 00:50:34.859
I wanted it in there to give it that organic
feel.

00:50:34.859 --> 00:50:40.420
So I think the next big technological feat
is we're gonna be making animated films in

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:41.420
context.

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:44.440
&gt;&gt;male #2: Do you think that's gonna shorten
the amount of time it takes to make an animated

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.491
film, or just give you more

00:50:45.491 --> 00:50:47.609
&gt;&gt;Mark: You would think that it would.

00:50:47.609 --> 00:50:49.079
But it's probably not.

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.079
[laughter]

00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:51.079
Thank you.

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:52.079
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Thank you.

00:50:52.079 --> 00:50:53.769
It, follow up on that.

00:50:53.769 --> 00:50:56.249
If story is really the most important thing.

00:50:56.249 --> 00:50:57.249
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:50:57.249 --> 00:50:58.469
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and you can tell a story
with stick figures.

00:50:58.469 --> 00:50:59.469
&gt;&gt;Mark: Yes.

00:50:59.469 --> 00:51:03.990
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Why spend ungodly some of
money and years to get the type of realism

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:05.839
and the type of wall you need?

00:51:05.839 --> 00:51:10.819
&gt;&gt;Mark: Because the stick figures, it would
have to be a really, really, really, really,

00:51:10.819 --> 00:51:13.539
really fantastic story to get carried away
with stick figures.

00:51:13.539 --> 00:51:14.549
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: sure.

00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:19.900
&gt;&gt;Mark: I don't think a story exists that
can get you carried away with stick figures.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.079
We're compelled by what we're watching.

00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:24.869
And we wanna be transported.

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:29.289
So, which is why, I mean, they have motion
pictures.

00:51:29.289 --> 00:51:30.739
You know and they get a camera out there.

00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:36.390
And we could emote with these real life people
on experiences we don't normally have.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:37.950
I mean there are things that work.

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:40.979
I mean you watch the old Peanuts things and
old cartoon things.

00:51:40.979 --> 00:51:44.479
And you're feeling of these things that are
very simple.

00:51:44.479 --> 00:51:46.930
But that can only go so far.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:48.489
So when we're makin' movies.

00:51:48.489 --> 00:51:49.769
When we're sketching.

00:51:49.769 --> 00:51:53.779
That's just a rough idea to, because I'm projecting
ahead.

00:51:53.779 --> 00:51:56.509
With what it's going to look like.

00:51:56.509 --> 00:52:01.910
And that, once the audience finally sees it
all done and lit and everything like that,

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.640
they're transported to that place.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.019
To that world.

00:52:06.019 --> 00:52:07.170
With these characters.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:09.140
You know, and they're really living it.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.140
Yes,sir.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:14.140
&gt;&gt;female #1: we just have time for one more
question and that will be Justin.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:18.729
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So I saw the Japanese trailer for
"Brave" on YouTube.

00:52:18.729 --> 00:52:23.709
And the impression one gets of the movie is
a lot darker and more mystical and consequently

00:52:23.709 --> 00:52:27.520
more interesting than the American trailer
gives.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:33.170
And so, it's just seems unfortunate with all
of Pixar's success in making animated features

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.709
that appeal to adults they still have to be
marketed to kids.

00:52:36.709 --> 00:52:40.969
Do you see any indication that that's changing
over time or will change?

00:52:40.969 --> 00:52:41.969
Down the road?

00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:42.969
&gt;&gt;Mark: Oh yeah.

00:52:42.969 --> 00:52:43.969
I think so.

00:52:43.969 --> 00:52:48.099
I mean the Japanese audience is a very different
audience than the American audience.

00:52:48.099 --> 00:52:50.059
Just like the Russians are very different.

00:52:50.059 --> 00:52:55.449
And the French, you see the French things,
it's crazy.

00:52:55.449 --> 00:53:00.220
You know, the Norwegians are very different.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:08.020
So the marketing people have a challenge to
how do I take this one movie and give it these

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:12.170
different guises to appeal to all those different
markets.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:14.219
To get their butts in the chairs.

00:53:14.219 --> 00:53:15.839
'Cause that's what they need to do.

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:16.900
We need the awareness.

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.750
We need to get the butts in the chairs so
they can see it.

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:21.430
Spend their moolah.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:22.809
Gonna love it.

00:53:22.809 --> 00:53:23.900
Hopefully see it again.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.259
Spend more moolah.

00:53:25.259 --> 00:53:29.130
So we can keep making movies.

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:36.069
I think, so the reason that our trailers are
done here the way they are is pretty much,

00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:37.949
is what the audience wants.

00:53:37.949 --> 00:53:41.680
And it's what they react to.

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:50.509
And it's again, it's this weird alchemy of
predicting what the audience needs.

00:53:50.509 --> 00:53:54.920
I've been doing a lot of PR during my, I'm
here with you guys today.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.400
But to talk more about the movie.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:03.519
But one thing that I keep getting from journalists
is they're very impressed with how much, after

00:54:03.519 --> 00:54:08.309
they've seen the movie, how much of the movie
is not in any trailer.

00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:12.990
How much we're keeping stuff, we're withholding
things and keeping it a secret.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:20.339
And I really have to give our Disney marketing
teams and Pixar for wanting to do that a lot

00:54:20.339 --> 00:54:22.040
of props.

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:28.479
Because I wanna give the audience a ride.

00:54:28.479 --> 00:54:30.400
I wanna give them an experience.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.900
And be like telling your kid on Christmas
"Here, I gotcha that thing that you wanted.

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.539
The Lego Death Star.

00:54:37.539 --> 00:54:38.539
Go ahead and unwrap it."

00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:44.019
They'd be like [pause] "Yeah, it's a Lego
Death Star.

00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:45.019
Thanks.

00:54:45.019 --> 00:54:48.289
I wanted to unwrap it and find it and discover
it."

00:54:48.289 --> 00:54:49.549
And that's what a movie is.

00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:54.329
When you go in, you should know just enough
to have gotten you in the seat.

00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:56.921
And then not know what to expect beyond that.

00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:57.921
That it could go anywhere.

00:54:57.921 --> 00:55:02.500
And I think a lot of trailers today, all over
the world, for all kinds audiences.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.209
Especially for American audiences.

00:55:04.209 --> 00:55:06.420
They say everything about the movie.

00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.420
You know?

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.819
You get the beginning middle and end.

00:55:09.819 --> 00:55:11.160
You're just goin' [slaps knees].

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.631
You know, and if it's a comedy, forget it.

00:55:13.631 --> 00:55:16.130
Because you saw all the most funny parts.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:20.430
So when you go and see the movie you're all
"Well, I saw all the funny parts in the trailer.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:21.430
What's left?

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:22.430
This?

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:23.430
Pfff.

00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:24.430
Why'd I come see this?

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:25.430
I thought there was gonna be more."

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:31.589
So by withholding that information in a trailer,
especially in the "Brave" trailer, you know,

00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:32.881
it's giving the audience that.

00:55:32.881 --> 00:55:37.699
I think that is the first step, to go to your
question, that's the first step in kind of

00:55:37.699 --> 00:55:47.150
pushing that boundary of trusting the filmmakers
and the film that they're gonna put out there.

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:50.160
That an audience doesn't need much.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:55.380
I mean, I was ready to see "Prometheus", I
didn't need to see any, hear any talking at

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:56.460
all.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:58.900
Just those images, I was captivated.

00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:01.150
You know?

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:02.809
And that's the kinda thing that gets me.

00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:09.689
And I think the more audiences respond to
that, then the feedback and the pie charts

00:56:09.689 --> 00:56:15.109
will come back to the marketing folks and
they'll go, "Oh yeah, these things were hits.

00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:21.400
It got them into the theaters to see this
movie with less."

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:23.529
So I'm a big believer of less is more.

00:56:23.529 --> 00:56:27.209
So that you the audience have the more when
you see the movie.

00:56:27.209 --> 00:56:29.769
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So without adding any more.

00:56:29.769 --> 00:56:30.769
&gt;&gt;Mark: Without adding anymore.

00:56:30.769 --> 00:56:34.499
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Do yourselves a favor and
go unwrap the gift that is "Brave", it's an

00:56:34.499 --> 00:56:35.499
awesome movie.

00:56:35.499 --> 00:56:36.719
And thank you so much for joining us.

00:56:36.719 --> 00:56:37.719
&gt;&gt;Mark: My pleasure.

00:56:37.719 --> 00:56:41.529
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: and hope to have you back
next time you make one of your movies.

00:56:41.529 --> 00:56:42.529
&gt;&gt;Mark: Absolutely.

00:56:42.529 --> 00:56:43.529
Absolutely.

00:56:43.529 --> 00:56:44.529
See ya online guys!!

00:56:44.529 --> 00:56:45.529
[applause]

00:56:45.529 --> 00:56:46.529
&gt;&gt;Mark: thank you very much.

00:56:46.529 --> 00:56:47.979
Thank you very much.

00:56:47.979 --> 00:56:49.499
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: My pleasure.
