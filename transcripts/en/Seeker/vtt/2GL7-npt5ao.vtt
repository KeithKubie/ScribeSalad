00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.250
Once, when I was in college, I saw a cockroach
crawl out of the sink drain in my dorm.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.480
Like, out of the depths of the sewer, and
into my dorm room.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.280
I have never been the same.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
Ever.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.269
But it turns out, roaches could do some good
in the world because their genetic code, which

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.620
was recently fully sequenced, provides surprising
insight into their seemingly eternal survival.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.520
Now we have a better idea of just why cockroaches
are so freaking hard to kill: THEY’RE EVOLVING.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.550
Not only can cockroaches multiply seemingly
infinitely, regenerate from traumatizing wounds,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.999
fit into any crevice, survive incredibly forceful
physical extermination, evolve to evade chemical

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:37.600
apocalypse...but despite their inherent gross
factor, they may also hold an important key

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.910
to help us understand how to improve our own
biology.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.859
Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences
have sequenced the entire genome of the American

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.609
cockroach for the first time ever, and their
genome is surprisingly huge.

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.719
The research team found genes indicating that
when under stress, female cockroaches can

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:59.329
lay unfertilized eggs that will still hatch
due to parthenogenesis--which is quite literally

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:00.449
virgin birth.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.639
(This gives a whole new meaning to, “Jesus,
cockroaches!”)

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:07.630
This is observed in other insects too, like
certain kinds of wasps, bees and ants, as

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.730
well as some reptiles, and only requires one
parent’s genetic code.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.010
No sex required.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.720
Just crazy science coolness.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.280
This reproductive method means that when mom
detects an environment she suspects may not

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.110
allow her to live much longer, she’ll just
plop down some ready-made eggs to make sure

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.710
her genes survive.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.550
You may think you’ve killed one cockroach,
but unbeknownst to you, there are more spawning

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.550
elsewhere….

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.690
Additionally, the research team uncovered
the genes and genetic regulation pathways

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.310
responsible for the cockroach’s ability
to regenerate limbs.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.910
Offshoots of this research have lead to the
development of a drug in China that’s based

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.440
on an ethanol found in cockroaches, and is
being touted as potentially useful in human

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.170
medicine for wound healing and tissue repair.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.430
They also identified the genes responsible
for in-body anti-microbial production, which

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
keeps cockroaches safe while they’re rooting
around in the sewage and trash.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.090
This could be part of the reason that cockroaches
have a tendency to become resistant to our

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.320
extermination methods.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.010
While the genome that was recently sequenced
is that of the American cockroach, other research

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.690
has indicated that its cousin the German cockroach
has evolved to dislike the taste of the poison

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.090
bait we’ve been putting out to kill it--instead
of tasting irresistibly sweet, it now tastes

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.240
bitter to them, and they avoid it, so we’re
having a hard time finding something that

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.300
could kill it.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.170
Now that we have a better understand the cockroach
genome, we might be able to kill them more

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.590
effectively which is something we’d like
to do because they’re gross and they spread

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.590
plague.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.950
No seriously, they carry hella disease.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.110
But, another point in the cockroach’s favor,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.130
they can help us improve our robotics.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.440
These tiny bugs can withstand over 900 times
their body weight in crushing force, and are

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.560
able to squeeze into so many places (LIKE
DORM ROOMS) by compressing themselves to almost

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.280
a third of their full size.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.000
Both of these superpowers are due to their
exoskeleton, which is hard but also “jointed”

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and flexible.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.960
Experts say that if we could make bots with
these features, we could revolutionize fields

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.780
like search and rescue, with the bots able
to access areas of disaster zones that humans

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.530
and other traditional search animals could
never penetrate.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.940
There’s still a long way to go in this area
of research, but it’s going to be interesting

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.790
to see what we can learn from animals like
this, and what we can take from their genetic

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.540
mechanisms to use for our own benefit.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.050

friends, make sure you subscribe, and check

out this video on the bugs that may be in
your food.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.990
Turns out, people who seem allergic to chocolate
or coffee may just be reacting to the pieces

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.130
of cockroach that find their way in there
during the manufacturing process.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.060
Yup, I just ruined everything.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.250
Thank for watching!
