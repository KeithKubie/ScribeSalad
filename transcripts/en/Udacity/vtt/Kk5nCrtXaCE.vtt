[D. Evans] There are lots of different ways you could have solved this.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You need to use the print command to print out the result,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then we want an expression that calculates the number of minutes in 7 weeks.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.076
There's 7 weeks. Each week has 7 days.

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:17.000
So you can have 7 * 7 for the number of days.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then to get the number of minutes we need to multiply that by 24

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to get the number of hours, and then multiply again by 60.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That should give us the number of minutes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's see that in the Python interpreter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now we hit Run, and we see that we have 70,560 minutes.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It seems like a lot of time. It's going to go pretty quick.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We hope by the end of the 7 weeks all of you will be accomplished Python programmers.
