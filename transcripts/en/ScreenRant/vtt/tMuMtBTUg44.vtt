00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.960
Have you ever thought what it would be like
if some of your favourite superheroes really

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.620
existed? Sure they may be fun to root for
on the page or entertaining to watch on the

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.240
big screen, but if you saw them on the street
would you introduce yourself or cross to the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.580
other side?&nbsp;
It’s been said that heroes demonstrate many

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.410
of the same qualities as sociopaths. For many
masked vigilantes, these traits go far beyond

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.570
antisocial behaviour and acting without fear.&nbsp;
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Super Heroes Who

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.470
Would Be Real-Life Psychopaths
1. Deadpool

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.570
What makes some of the best crime fighters
so appealing is how they walk that line between

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.860
hero and antihero. It’s on an extreme side
of that line that we find Deadpool, the ultimate

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.289
antihero. Wade Wilson would probably be the
first to admit that he has psychotic tendencies

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.670
and it’s his gleeful embrace of them that
makes Deadpool a different kind of superhero.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.469
Quick to fillet a henchman or even dismember
himself, Deadpool is one superhero who truly

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.719
does not give a&nbsp;-
2. HULK&nbsp;

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.340
How do you reason with an indestructible rage
monster? Well, you can’t. Anytime Bruce

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.130
Banner loses himself as the Hulk everyone
just has to get out of his way and hope he

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.030
doesn’t do too much damage before calming
down. Hulk is the Hyde to Bruce Banner’s

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.190
Dr. Jekyll, and is only a hero when circumstances
allow him to be. It’s really a miracle that

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.760
he doesn’t leave more innocent people in
his wake, or perhaps the comics and movies

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.000
just kinda gloss over that aspect of the green
goliath.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.320
3. Batman
Superheroes are often divided into two camps:

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.600
those who kill their enemies and those who
don’t. While Batman may fall in the latter,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.930
he still demonstrates some psychopathic qualities.
Traumatized by witnessing the death of his

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.670
parents, there’s an anger in Bruce Wayne
that it seems can only be released by beating

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:51.900
up baddies. The more broken bones, the better.
He might not go all Deadpool on them, but

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.330
they need to believe he could.&nbsp;
4. Wolverine&nbsp;

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.570
As the only superhero with a body count rivalling
Deadpool’s and rage rivalling the Hulk’s,

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.930
Wolverine fits firmly within the ‘kill ‘em’
camp. If you grew up watching the animated

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.420
X Men series, Wolverine was usually limited
to using his claws to rip up robots and other

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.920
objects to keep it appropriate for the&nbsp;Saturday&nbsp;morning
cartoon audience, so it was both refreshing

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.250
and shocking to see him kill so many members
of Stryker’s team in X2. With mutants like

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.209
Wovlerine, it’s no wonder the government
would prefer to keep them in check.&nbsp;

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.989
5. Judge Dredd&nbsp;
Most legal systems are set up on a series

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.700
of checks and balances, so that the people
arresting criminals aren’t the same people

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.200
prosecuting them. The prospect of someone
like Judge Dredd actually existing is terrifying.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.379
With the authority to be judge, jury and executioner,
Dredd was biologically bred without empathy

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.620
so he could carry out his duties in a cold,
calculated manner. Not exactly your friendly

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.469
neighborhood cop.
6. Neo

00:02:55.469 --> 00:03:01.090
Once Neo truly grasps the nature of The Matrix,
everyone living in it becomes expendable.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.680
Since they’re all just slaves and the world
is an elaborate virtual reality constructed

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.889
to keep their brains occupied, killing innocent
people becomes a non issue. It might as well

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:16.750
be a video game to Neo. After a mind trip
like that, anyone’s concept of what’s

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.859
real or fake, or right or wrong, would be
seriously warped.&nbsp;

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:27.200
7. The Punisher&nbsp;
The Punisher exists for one reason: revenge.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.280
A trained marine whose family was killed by
the mob, The Punisher does not care about

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.590
morality, just what he sees as poetic justice
when he straight-up murders thugs. The only

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.489
reason The Punisher isn’t a villain is the
fact that he happened to be crossed by criminals

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.670
and not The Avengers.&nbsp;
8. Hit Girl&nbsp;

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.580
The mafia also should really be more careful
about whose family they kill. They created

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.651
a Kick Ass assassin when they killed the mother
of the kid who would become Hit Girl. Trained

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:56.719
into a deadly weapon by her father, Hit Girl
does not discriminate between blades and bullets

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:01.049
when slaying bad guys. Perhaps it’s her
young age, but of all the entries on our list,

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.280
Hit Girl seems to take the most pleasure from
her masked vigilante duties, but for some

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.099
reason when the film came out audiences were
much more offended by her naughty language.&nbsp;

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:19.660
9. The Mask
People familiar with Jim Carrey’s 1994 version

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.890
of the The Mask probably don’t realize that
the comic its based on is an ultra violent

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.600
blood fest. When the ancient Mask gives Stanley
Ipkiss limitless power, what begins as killing

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:36.020
his tormentors in amusing ways, ends in a
shootout killing 11 cops. The film kept the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.950
character’s mischievous Tex Avery aspects,
but opted to leave out the Terminator tendencies

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.710
Ipkiss adopts once The Mask throws all his
inhibitions out the window.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.120
10. ALL the Watchmen
If you want an epic explanation of why anyone

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.320
who puts on a costume to fight crime is likely
a psychopath, look no further than The Watchmen.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.590
These characters occupy a world much closer
to our own than we’re used to seeing in

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.970
comic book panels, there are no Clark Kents
or Peter Parkers here, just dark characters

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.130
like Rorschach and The Comedian. Adrian Veidt
takes ultimate action by killing millions

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.290
of people to save the world from itself. So
is he a hero, or a psychopath?&nbsp;

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.940
As it turns out, most superheroes really aren’t
boy scouts who always take the moral high

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.620
ground. We hope you enjoyed our list of superheroes
with unnerving dark sides. Did we miss any?

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:29.140
Which heroes do you think could use some professional
therapy?
