00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.439
that it ended in a way that seemed like
it needed a sequel to explain a lot of

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449
it needed a sequel to explain a lot of
 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.360
it needed a sequel to explain a lot of
the things that happened in that movie

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370
the things that happened in that movie
 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.800
the things that happened in that movie
and a lot of people didn't like that I

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810
and a lot of people didn't like that I
 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.659
and a lot of people didn't like that I
understand that and this movie has a

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669
understand that and this movie has a
 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.850
understand that and this movie has a
similar problem because the way the film

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860
similar problem because the way the film
 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.029
similar problem because the way the film
ended was very satisfying to me but I

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039
ended was very satisfying to me but I
 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:23.769
ended was very satisfying to me but I
felt like some of the plot points

00:06:23.769 --> 00:06:23.779
felt like some of the plot points
 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:25.240
felt like some of the plot points
weren't entirely finished yet and I

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250
weren't entirely finished yet and I
 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.230
weren't entirely finished yet and I
would have liked to have seen more

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240
would have liked to have seen more
 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.029
would have liked to have seen more
resolution with certain things and a few

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039
resolution with certain things and a few
 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:29.170
resolution with certain things and a few
more explanations

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180
more explanations
 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.640
more explanations
I feel like perhaps I may have missed

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650
I feel like perhaps I may have missed
 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.920
I feel like perhaps I may have missed
something due to the fact that this film

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930
something due to the fact that this film
 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.230
something due to the fact that this film
is so carefully crafted I can tell it's

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240
is so carefully crafted I can tell it's
 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.150
is so carefully crafted I can tell it's
written and directed by the

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160
written and directed by the
 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.100
written and directed by the
named guy and he had a lot of love for

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110
named guy and he had a lot of love for
 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.450
named guy and he had a lot of love for
this film and so perhaps I missed

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460
this film and so perhaps I missed
 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.830
this film and so perhaps I missed
something but I feel like there are

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840
something but I feel like there are
 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.870
something but I feel like there are
definitely sequels that can be spawned

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880
definitely sequels that can be spawned
 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.520
definitely sequels that can be spawned
from this movie particularly because of

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530
from this movie particularly because of
 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.930
from this movie particularly because of
how many books there are in the series

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940
how many books there are in the series
 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.000
how many books there are in the series
