00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.130
- Hey, it's me Destin.

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.340
Welcome back to "Smarter Every Day."

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.960
As long as I've understood the physics,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.880
I've wanted to visualize the Shock Wave

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.790
on the front of a super sonic bullet.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.060
But the problem with doing this,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.130
is you have to have access

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.380
to some pretty expensive optical hardware.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.520
Which is why I'm pretty excited

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.770
about this giant 16" parabolic mirror.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.520
Which is going to let us play around

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.970
with the speed of sound.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.470
Let's go get "Smarter Every Day".

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.500
Okay, We're going to use a Schlieren Setup

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.550
to get these bullet images.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.383
Here's how it works.

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:27.450
So we have the camera right here, right.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.850
So this is a Phantom v2511.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.300
We have a mirror way over there
and the way we're doing that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870
is that we have a point source here.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.450
So we're shining that light
and it's spreading out;

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.080
and as it spreads out it hits this mirror,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.260
and it bounces back
and as it bounces back,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.590
it comes down to a point.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.423
One point right there

00:00:47.423 --> 00:00:49.300
and we're cutting off half of that light.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.130
Long story short it comes right here

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.240
flips back over goes into the lens.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.330
If the air is less
dense then light travels

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.163
through it faster.

00:00:58.163 --> 00:01:01.290
If air is more dense light
travels through it slower,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.700
that causes the light to move or bend,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.440
as it goes through different types of air;

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.850
and then we can detect those shadows

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.310
using this Schlieren Setup.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.310
This is my buddy Coop.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.870
He's gonna shoot through his own shop.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.305
We're not gonna do this, you know

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:15.138
(cow mooing)

00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:16.660
- I'm not shooting at his shop.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.660
I think we're ready.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:19.823
- On target.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.657
- Three, Two, One.

00:01:23.657 --> 00:01:25.470
Fire.
(gunshot)

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.893
Whoo huhu

00:01:26.893 --> 00:01:28.200
(gun clicks)
- Weapon Clear.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.033
- That's a big boom.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:29.973
So let's see if we got it.

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:30.971
(laughing)

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:31.804
- [Male] Come here Coop

00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:33.213
- [Destin] Oh Coop, come look at this.

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:35.820
(sound wave)

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.820
- [Male] Oh Cool

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.800
- [Destin] That's unbelievable.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.857
Okay, so I'm gonna save that.

00:01:39.857 --> 00:01:42.430
I like to guess where the
shock waves come from.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.980
The initial one looks like its
coming off the bullet itself.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.830
But then later there
seems to be this weak one

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.060
that I'm guessing that
reflected from the plywood table

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.370
that the mirror is sitting on.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.360
Not really sure about that.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.610
But then there's this stronger
one that comes after that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.443
and my guess for that one

00:01:54.443 --> 00:01:56.390
is that it's coming
off the concrete floor,

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.600
because it's more of a pure reflection.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.610
Then later if you fast forward the video

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.240
you can see there's a very
week shock wave coming across,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.980
and my guess is that's coming
from the muzzle itself.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.220
I'm not sure on all these.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.890
I canna have to extrapolate,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.150
but that's kinda part of the fun.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.192
Three, Two, One.

00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:14.906
Fire.
(gunshot)

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.946
(laughing)

00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:19.446
(sound waves)

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.000
That's legit man.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.550
Okay so we've dropped it to
28 thousand frames per second.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.470
We're trying to get a
really good single image.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.223
Fire.
(gunshot)

00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:35.220
(coughing)

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.233
I actually put air in my lungs.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:41.150
(sound waves)

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.740
This footage looks amazing.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.450
But to understand exactly
what we're looking at

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.990
why don't we build a little bitty model

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.980
with a bullet and a stick
and talk about it here.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.300
So lets imagine that we've
got this bullet sitting here

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.760
and we've got circles
emitting from the front.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.990
As we move this thing watch what happens.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.440
Those circles will stack up in the front

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.600
and they kind of relax in the
back and they expand, right.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.250
So that's a normal flight.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.270
What happens if the velocity
at which we move thing,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.610
out runs those circles moving away?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.630
Check this out.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.130
As we start to out run it,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.240
you'll notice that we this
expansion in the back here

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.490
and it tapers down and we get this angle.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.690
We get this, I don't know what
you'd want to call it, right.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.850
We've got a cone here.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.900
What happens if we move
forward even faster?

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.410
(whooshu)

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.530
That angle that we made there
is even shallower or pointier.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.400
That's called the Mach Angle

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.280
and people use that to
measure the exact velocity

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.120
of a bullet traveling through air.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.990
There's a simple equation.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.790
The Mach number is equal to
one over sine of that angle

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.940
and you can figure out
how fast it's moving.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.270
I use the circle illustration

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.670
because that's the way I was
taught in my Aerodynamic book.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.080
But if you look at the high speed imagery,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.930
you can actually see circles

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.860
being formed at regular intervals.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.450
I don't understand what they
are, but they clearly there.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.900
What we're about to do
is what I've wanted to do

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.460
from the day I understood
what Schlieren Imagery was.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.620
We're going to shoot a Subsonic
and a Supersonic round,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.660
and we're going to compare the
difference in the shock wave.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.493
Coop, whatta we have?

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:06.610
- [Coop] So this is a 300 blackout.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.690
- [Destin] If I understand correctly.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.030
The whole point of this particular round

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.590
is to keep it Subsonic.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.423
- Correct.

00:04:11.423 --> 00:04:12.256
[Destin] This is a heavier bullet.

00:04:12.256 --> 00:04:14.010
- This is a by 100 grains.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.177
Almost twice the weight
of this bullet here,

00:04:17.177 --> 00:04:18.810
and so this bullet right here

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.160
you'll get somewhere
around 1080 feet per second

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.190
at the muzzle.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.270
Whereas this bullet right here

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.067
will give you somewhere in
the neighborhood of 1500.

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:26.773
[Destin] Do you know what
the sound of speed is?

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:28.110
- Yeah, it's like 12 something.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.120
[Destin] I don't know.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.150
We'll put it on the screen, right here.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.040
That's the speed of sound.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.040
So this one above the
sound, that one's below.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.950
All this is on purpose because that weapon

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.320
and that cartridge design
was made specifically

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.690
because of these physics.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.846
- So lets do Supersonic first.

00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:42.679
- [Coop] Sure.

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:43.512
- Okay.

00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:45.230
Three, Two, One.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.516
Fire.
(gunshot)

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:50.016
(sound waves)

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.670
This shock wave looks
very similar to the 50 cal

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.770
with one major difference.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.850
The angle is more Obtuse which
indicates that the bullet

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.360
is traveling much slower.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.770
So he's chambering a Subsonic round now

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.910
and so on the Schlieren we should see

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.320
a drastically different image.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.161
Two, One.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.328
(gunshot)

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:15.540
(sound waves)

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.388
It looks like, it looks like(laughing)

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:21.822
- [Coop] (laughing) I can
make it, I can make it.

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:23.270
(sound waves)

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.870
- [Destin] Alright, so
this is a Subsonic bullet.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.140
So why I we seeing these
little flickery things

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.670
on the side of the bullet?

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.050
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.220
So this what I always do
in a situation like this.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.550
I went looking for expert,
which lead me to Dr. Kanistras.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.600
A well respected aerodynamics professor

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.920
at University of Alabama in Huntsville.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.450
One thing we saw on the Subsonic bullet

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.710
is we see, we didn't see that shock wave

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.120
but we saw these weird lines

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.330
out to the side of the bullet, you know.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.510
- [Dr. Kanistras] What is the
speed, when you say Subsonic?

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.330
- [Destin] It's about 10 percent less

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.960
than the speed of sound.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.190
- You have Supersonic flow there.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.590
It's a Normal Shock.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.423
What you see there.

00:05:58.423 --> 00:05:59.650
- [Destin] On a Subsonic bullet?

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.490
- Uh-huh, what is happening
on a commercial aircraft?

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.230
It goes between point
eight to one point two.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.183
Even if you're flying Subsonic,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.570
you have acceleration of the flow.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.770
So you're reaching one point two.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.603
- [Destin] What?

00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:12.999
- Then you going back Subsonic.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.664
- [Destin] So what you're
saying is even though I have,

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:15.497
- [Dr. Kanistras] It's a Normal Shock.

00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:17.160
- [Destin] I have a Subsonic bullet

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.250
but the speed of the air
is Supersonic right there,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.230
half way up the bullet.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.270
So on this Subsonic bullet,
those things I'm seeing,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.752
you're saying that's Supersonic flow.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:27.585
- That's right.

00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:29.117
- [Destin] And it's because the air

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:30.896
has to move out of the
way around the bullet.

00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:31.831
So it has to accelerate.

00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:32.664
- That's right, yeah

00:06:32.664 --> 00:06:33.497
- [Destin] Really.

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:35.945
- So the flow accelerates, and
creates a Normal Shock there.

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:37.640
- [Destin] It's because
this particular bullet

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.267
is so close to the speed of sound.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:40.897
- It reaches a transsonic speed,

00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:42.560
which is point eight to one point two.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.230
So even if it's not
supersonic at this point,

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.040
at some point on the surface
it will become Supersonic.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.873
- [Destin] That's cool.

00:06:49.873 --> 00:06:51.003
Thank you.

00:06:51.003 --> 00:06:51.836
(laughs)

00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:52.669
That's really cool.

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:53.630
Thank you for explaining that.

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.690
After this we decided to
move closer to the mirror,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.995
so we could see what the muzzle blast

00:06:56.995 --> 00:06:57.828
(gunshot)

00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:59.596
from the weapon itself look like.

00:06:59.596 --> 00:07:02.096
(sound waves)

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.580
After that we moved the
muzzle back about a foot

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.382
so we could see that transition period

00:07:07.382 --> 00:07:08.215
(gunshot)

00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:10.100
where that bullet pierces
through the blast itself.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.300
What's even more impressive

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.590
is each one of those
tiny grains of propellant

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.130
had that visible shock wave

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.173
you could see associated with it.

00:07:17.173 --> 00:07:19.673
(sound waves)

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.650
One more thing real quick,
we took video of revolver.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.970
It literally leaks shock
waves out of the side.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.803
But before I show you that

00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:30.490
I want to say thank to the
sponsor which is Audible.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.860
Audible has been a partner for
"Smarter Every Day" forever,

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.750
and I'm very grateful because
I enjoy getting smarter

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.340
by listening to books as I drive.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.900
This is like the perfect
Brand match for me.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.190
It helps me get smarter everyday.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.850
You can get free book by
going to audible.com/smarter

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.870
or text in the word "smarter" to 500 500.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.270
I've a special book to recommend today.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.600
It's called "THEM, Why we hate
each other and how to heal,"

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.780
and it's by Senator Ben Sasse.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.800
I steer really far away
from politics at all times,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.350
but this is not a political book.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.290
It's about the things that are
eroding away at our culture.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.700
Things like loneliness

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.830
and the importance of your
family support structure,

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.870
and how we need a scape goat;

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.140
and sometimes we get
angry at other people.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.460
when the problem is things
that we are doing in own life.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.560
It's a really good book.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.300
So I highly recommend it.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.800
I'm not quite done with
it, but up to this point

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.130
it seems to be apolitical.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:20.963
So check that out.

00:08:20.963 --> 00:08:23.230
"THEM, why we hate each
other and how to heal."

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.120
You ca get that by going
to audible.com/smarter

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.100
or texting the word "smarter" to 500 500.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.780
It's about how we can improve ourselves

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.260
by working on our communities around us.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.190
I really like it,

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.050
and now definitive scientific proof

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.904
of why your hands should never
leave the grip of a revolver.

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:45.104
One.
(gunshot)

00:08:45.974 --> 00:08:48.474
(sound waves)

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.733
One.
(gunshot)

00:08:59.624 --> 00:09:00.457
- Weapons clear.

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.430
- [Destin] That is the best video

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.043
I've probably ever participated in.

00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:10.608
(sound waves)

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.003
Look at that, oh my goodness.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.000
Okay, well I've a feeling we're going

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.900
to be doing something like this again.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.719
Can you see us stopping at this?

00:09:29.719 --> 00:09:30.552
- No.

00:09:30.552 --> 00:09:31.385
- Okay.

00:09:31.385 --> 00:09:32.218
- No way.

00:09:32.218 --> 00:09:33.051
- Yeah , so there you go.

00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:34.190
Feel free to subscribe
to "Smarter Every Day"

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.023
if you're into this kind of thing.

00:09:35.023 --> 00:09:38.057
If you're not, I don't know
what's wrong with you (laughs).

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.550
That's amazing.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.803
Alright, cool, thanks.
