development is not actually development
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.060
development is not actually development
it's a piracy it's just grabbing stuff

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
it's a piracy it's just grabbing stuff
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.150

no grabbing stuff and protecting the
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.580
no grabbing stuff and protecting the
environment are not compatible we can't

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
environment are not compatible we can't
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.700
environment are not compatible we can't
have an economy in which those who get

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
have an economy in which those who get
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.670
have an economy in which those who get
their first and take everything off the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
their first and take everything off the
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.279
their first and take everything off the
table or rewarded that's not compatible

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289
table or rewarded that's not compatible
 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.779
table or rewarded that's not compatible
with what we need to do to survive

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
with what we need to do to survive
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.119
with what we need to do to survive
sustained winds 21st century so we need

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
sustained winds 21st century so we need
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.760
sustained winds 21st century so we need
a new definition of development but if

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
a new definition of development but if
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.049
a new definition of development but if

hundred plants and feed a family of a
 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.600
hundred plants and feed a family of a
smaller garden yeah that's definitely

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
smaller garden yeah that's definitely
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940
smaller garden yeah that's definitely
compatible if it's the development that

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
compatible if it's the development that
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010
compatible if it's the development that
comes from knowledge and wisdom as

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
comes from knowledge and wisdom as
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.390
comes from knowledge and wisdom as
opposed to the development that comes

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
opposed to the development that comes
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.120
opposed to the development that comes
from grabbing and appropriating it's not

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
from grabbing and appropriating it's not
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.780
from grabbing and appropriating it's not
only compatible it's essential
