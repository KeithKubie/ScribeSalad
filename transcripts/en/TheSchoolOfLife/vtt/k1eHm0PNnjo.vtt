00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Whenever something looks interesting,  beautiful

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.020
there's a natural impulse to want to capture

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.360
and preserve it,

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.160
which means in this day and age

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.040
that we will likely to reach for our phones

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.300
and take picture.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.860
Though this might seem like an ideal solution,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.080
there is a big problem associated with it.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040
We're likely to be so busy taking the pictures

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.980
we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.720
prompted us to take a photograph in the first place.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.000
These problems seem to be very much of today

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640
a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.000
But, they would notice right in at beginning of the history of photography

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.220
when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.280
The first person to notice them was the english art critic John Ruskin

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.700
He was very impressed by cameras

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.540
at first,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.180
but gradually he grew very suspicious of them

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.080
believing they blinded us of our surroundings

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.460
To try to correct this blindness

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.680
Ruskin recommended that all of us take up drawing

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.320
not with the view to becoming great artists

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.940
but simply because through the act of trying to recreate on paper

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.420
what we see in the world

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.460
we studied it in a way we never do

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.460
when we simply take a photograph

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.780
Summing up what he attempted to do

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.640
in four years of teaching and writing manuals on drawing

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.020
Ruskin wrote:

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.860
"Let two persons go out for a walk;"

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.960
"the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind."

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.400
"Let them go down a green lane."

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.740
"There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals."

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.520
"The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green,"

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.400
"though he will think nothing about it;"

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.080
"he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect,"

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.760
"and that's all."

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.720
"But what will the sketcher see?"

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.480
"His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty,"

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.840
"and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness."

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.160
"He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine"

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.620
"comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead,"

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.300
"till the air is filled with an emerald light,"

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.740
"he would see here and there a bough is seen emerging from the veil of leaves,"

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.920
"he would see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss,"

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.760
"and the variegated and fantastic lichens, "

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.260
"white and blue, purple and red, "

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.840
"all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty."

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.080
"Then come the cavernous trunks, and the twisted roots"

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.940
"that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, "

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.460
"whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes."

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.360
"Is not this worth seeing?"

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.360
"Yet if you are not a sketcher you will pass along the green lane,"

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.120
"and when you come home again, have nothing to say or to think about it,"

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.360
"but that you went down such and such a lane."
