00:00:00.714 --> 00:00:03.464
(mouse clicking)

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.710
- It's my distinct pleasure to introduce

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.113
our first speaker of the morning.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.030
And we have to pay rapt attention

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.340
and if she allows time for questions

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.910
at the conclusion of her talk,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.540
we have to be very concise

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.500
because she is headed off at 9, what time?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.250
9:15 for her uber to the airport

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.250
to be en route to Taiwan
for an invited lectureship.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.080
And we are honored to have
this morning Dr. Yvonne Wu,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.750
who first spoke at the
conference 16 years ago

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.830
and her, I think she was
pregnant with her daughter Clara,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.280
who is 16 now and is
here at this conference.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.390
It really is a pleasure to
see Yvonne and Clara today.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.430
Yvonne is Professor of Neurology
and Pediatrics at UCSF,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.100
an expert on newborn brain injury

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.890
and risk factors for cerebral palsy,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.320
which constitutes much
of today's presentations

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.660
before we segue into all autism.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.300
And Yvonne is currently
running a large trial,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.480
testing a new therapy that could

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.663
help prevent cerebral palsy.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.573
Welcome.

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:43.682
(audience applauding)

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.340
- Thank you so much,
it's really a pleasure

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.110
and an honor to be here, especially

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.410
with all the other distinguished speakers.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.450
I'm unfortunately running
off, as you heard,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.450
so I won't be able to stay for
the question answer session

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.440
but I would be happy
to take a few questions

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.290
at the end if there's time.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.090
So I'll be talking today about
some of the work we're doing

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.650
and also a lot of other people are doing

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.310
to find ways to prevent CP,
specifically in newborns

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.110
with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.600
And I have nothing to disclose.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.240
So we're gonna start by just reviewing

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.910
what we know generally about causes of CP

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.160
and why I wanna focus today

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.160
on hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.283
which is another term for birth asphyxia.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.830
Then we're gonna talk about
the standard of care right now

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.580
for treating babies with this condition

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.210
and that is to cool them, that's
actually a cooling blanket

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.310
that you see that baby is sleeping on.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.190
And then we'll talk about the work

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.870
that we and others have done to look at

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.510
whether adding another
therapy, erythropoietin,

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.670
might provide it
additional neuroprotection.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.810
And then finally in the final few minutes,

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.360
I'll rush through few other
experimental treatments

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.593
that are being studied.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.690
So all of you in this room have treated

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.220
and taken care of patients
with cerebral palsy

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.050
and you know that the list of
potential causes is very long.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.760
But I think it's helpful to
think in broad categories

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.490
and it's pretty well established

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.010
that half of all children
with cerebral palsy

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.450
are born preterm and they
are susceptible specifically

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.840
to brain injury of prematurity.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.260
And so we're not gonna talk
about this group today,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.270
we're gonna talk instead
about term infants.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.710
And they make up half of the kids with CP

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.560
and you'll see in the
green slice of the pie

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.210
that about 15% of those will be found

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.350
to have abnormal formation of the brain.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.380
So a brain dysgenesis.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.550
And then there's a small sliver of the pie

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.180
that constitutes postnatal injury

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.030
in the first month of life.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.370
But the majority of infants
who are born at term

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.410
who have cerebral palsy
are thought to have

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.410
a relatively normally
developing brain in utero,

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.710
but then something happens in

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.380
the prenatal, perinatal
period to injure the brain.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.360
And what do those injuries look like?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.670
Well so, if you see, really
the only way to know clinically

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.350
is to do a brain MRI to see

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.290
what kind of brain injury occurred.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.230
And so, you know, if a child has severe

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.510
quadriplegic cerebral palsy,

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.290
one of the more common
findings is this one up here.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.470
If you look here, the
basal ganglia and thalami

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.880
are these deep gray
structures of the brain.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.500
All that white signal indicates injury

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.030
to those deep gray structures,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.240
and that will typically give you

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.093
severe spastic quadriplegia.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.870
Alternatively you might do an
MRI and see abnormal signal

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.460
in what we call the
parasaggital areas of the brain,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.590
just parallel to the midline.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.740
That involves more of the white
matter and overlying cortex,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.940
so that's called watershed injury.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.880
And these kids might have less
severe motor abnormalities

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.750
but have more cognitive
issues and seizures.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.230
If a child has a hemiplegic cerebral palsy

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.010
and you do an MRI, often what
you'll see is this stroke,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.450
an area that, in this case,
is an arterial stroke,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.030
where there's a clot that
formed in one of the arteries.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.270
You can also get a clot
in the venous structures

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.450
here in the superior sagittal sinus

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.650
and that can cause injury to the brain.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.640
You might see a child that
had a hemorrhage early on.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.270
And so these are all potential causes

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.210
of the motor disability that we see.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.120
So we're gonna focus today on HIE,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.820
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.590
And that specifically gives
you these typical pictures,

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.523
the basal ganglia injury
and the watershed injury.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.100
And why are we focusing
on this particular issue?

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.240
I think that, first of all,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.570
although it doesn't
account for the majority

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.120
of that pie of the
causes of cerebral palsy,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.170
it is an important condition

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.530
that accounts for a
significant proportion.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.960
But most importantly it's
well studied in animal models,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.350
it's well studied in cell culture,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.510
and so we have a basic understanding

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.110
on a molecular and cellular
level of what happens

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.240
when the brain has an insult,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.450
where there's decreased
oxygen and blood flow.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.220
And because of that understanding

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.040
and because of the animal
models that are out there,

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.840
you can devise and test
neuroprotective strategies

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.030
to try to help the brain recover better.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.260
And so I sort of think of
it as low hanging fruit

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.010
in that way because of all the great work

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.180
that's been done by basic researchers

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.053
and is certainly ripe for clinical trials.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.750
So okay, so what is HIE?

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.750
So as the term implies,
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,

00:06:36.072 --> 00:06:38.320
it implies that there's reduced oxygen

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.453
and blood flow to the brain.

00:06:41.345 --> 00:06:43.950
This is just a schematic showing that,

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.130
you know, the blood that
should be red is blue,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.280
suggesting there's hypoxia.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.220
And because of the decreased blood flow,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.300
you often get the deep gray nuclei

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.730
that are specifically
susceptible to this insult.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.150
That is where you see the injury,

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.820
as we saw in the MIR scans.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.210
And then you can also get injury

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.950
specifically in the white matter,

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.810
just lateral to the midline.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.473
So this is the condition
that we're talking about.

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.213
So HIE, as I said, is a
very important condition.

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:16.660
You know, it's not just an
important condition here

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.210
but especially around the world.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.480
It occurs in one to three
per 1,000 live births

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.080
but in low and middle income countries

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.580
can be as high as 26 per 1,000.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.840
In the US there are about 12,000 infants

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.880
who suffer from this every year.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.680
And worldwide, it accounts for almost 1/4

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.353
of all neonatal deaths.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.080
And if it's untreated, this
is from the day and age

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.450
when I trained, in the 1990s,
I mean basically, you know,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.130
there wasn't much treatment available

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.040
and untreated, about 1/3 of
severely affected infants

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.860
will die in the newborn period.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.303
Another 1/3 will develop
longterm motor disabilities.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.180
And you know, this is
another whole talk in itself

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.870
but what is causing the HIE?

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.040
You know, occasionally five to 15%,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.700
depending on the study you look at,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.410
you can put your finger on what caused it.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.460
You can say oh, there was abruption,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.980
so major maternal blood loss
or there was a uterine rupture.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.120
And in those cases you
know something happened

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.570
to decrease the oxygenation

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.730
and blood flow to the baby's brain.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.870
But the majority of the time,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.440
we really don't understand what caused it,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.820
which means we also really don't know

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.150
how to prevent it very well.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.500
And that's again, a whole
other talk in itself.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.690
But as I mentioned, you know,

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.690
things have changed since
I first trained in the 90s,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.660
because we, I shouldn't say we,

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.640
the basic scientists realized

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.800
that after this initial period of insult,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.250
the decreased oxygen and
blood flow to the brain,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.170
there's, you know,
definitely an initial period

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.050
of primary cell death, where
some of the neurons will die.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.560
But then there's this evolution of injury

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.590
that occurs over hours and days

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.550
and a lot of these
intracellular mechanisms

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.860
that lead to secondary energy failure,

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.570
leads to a secondary delayed
phase of neuronal death are,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.650
you know, pretty well
studied in animal studies.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:12.258
So there's apoptosis, this
like programmed cell death.

00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:15.860
You know, there's a lot
of glutamate toxicity,

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.040
excitotoxic injury, there's inflammation,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.550
all of these things take time

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.650
and that gives us a window to intervene.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.260
And so the first, the
next part of this talk

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.223
is really to focus a
little bit on hypothermia.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.700
And so, you know, the nice
thing is that hypothermia

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.940
is started within a few hours after birth

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:38.950
and is kept on for several days

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.740
and counteracts all these things that

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.560
are happening to cause
further brain injury.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.690
And this is just a schematic
that shows that hypothermia

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.430
is a potent neuroprotective
therapy in these babies.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.440
It protects the brain and the reason is

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.780
that it has all these properties,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.240
it has anti-excitotoxic properties.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.350
So here's a glutamate NMDA receptor

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.730
and you actually have
decreased excitotixicity.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.300
There's decreased reactive oxygen species

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.210
and antioxidant effects, there's
anti-inflammatory effects.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.600
This is the cell nucleus

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.850
and there's decreased
apoptotic cell deaths.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.333
So it has multiple
effects on this process.

00:10:22.278 --> 00:10:25.430
And so you would think that
it would be very very potent.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.430
And in fact it has been shown now,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.930
definitively in multiple clinical trials,

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.110
that this treatment reduces death

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.130
or moderate to severe disability.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.420
And therefore has become standard of care.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.770
And so, there are two ways of
doing this cooling therapy,

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.140
you can either cool
the whole body at birth

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.070
or you can put on a cool
cap and just cool the head,

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.060
both have been found to work,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.360
as far as we know, equally well.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.480
Most places do body
cooling, it's easier to do,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.610
you use a cooling blanket and
you can still do a full EEG

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.650
because you don't have a cap on your head.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.940
It has to be begun by six hours of age.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.130
That's, you know, typically
the way it's used.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.180
And we cool the core body temperature

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.650
down to 33.5 degrees for 72 hours

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:15.710
and then rewarm them
gradually over six hours.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.403
So this is now standard of care.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.950
What does this have to
do with cerebral palsy?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.700
So as I mentioned, it's
been shown to reduce death

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.130
and moderate to severe disability.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.870
This group did a meta analysis looking at,

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.720
I think six or seven large
multicenter clinical trials,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.760
testing the use of hypothermia

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.270
and you can see there's reduced
death, reduced disability.

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.000
And if you look specifically
at cerebral palsy,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.090
there's a relative risk of 0.62.

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.820
So the risk of cerebral palsy
in these babies with HIE,

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:53.820
if they get cooled, is 38%
lower, if they get cooled.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.830
And you can take these
numbers and calculate

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.670
what we call a number needed to treat

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.088
and it comes out to eight.

00:12:00.088 --> 00:12:04.860
So for every eight babies
with HIE who get cooled,

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.000
you can actually prevent one case of CP.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.240
So this was a game changer for us.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.400
I mean I trained and we spent, you know,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.940
I guess from the 90s until 2007,

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.880
when we saw babies with
HIE, we would support them,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.080
treat them if they had seizures

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.440
but there was no other specific therapy.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.937
Starting in 2007, we
started cooling at UCSF

00:12:24.937 --> 00:12:28.423
and the standard of care
in most larger facilities.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.160
And so, yeah, these are
just additional data

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.900
from the three largest cooling studies.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.900
The NICHD study in the US multicenter,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.300
TOBY was a European study,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.320
and then there's a large CoolCap study.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.770
And if you put the results
from those together,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:49.410
if you get cooled, these babies have a,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.980
you know, significantly lower rate

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.950
of death or moderate severe disability.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:55.160
And their risk of CP,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.930
untreated is about 1/3,
but if they get cooled,

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.370
the risk comes down to more
like 1/4 of the babies.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.560
So clearly this has been
an effective therapy.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.140
But I show this slide to remind us

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.860
that we still have room for improvement,

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.640
I mean, that's still not acceptable,

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.080
we want to get that down
to zero if possible.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.260
So that's how I came into the picture.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.180
So, after this came about,
now the big question is

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.650
what can we add to cooling?

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.610
Now that cooling is
standard of care in the US,

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.700
what can we add to cooling to further help

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.070
the brain recover and have less injury

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.537
and less longterm implications after HIE.

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.680
And I'm gonna talk first
about erythropoietin

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.360
and then talk about
some of the other things

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.060
that are coming down the pipeline.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.250
So, erythropoietin, everyone
always asks me, epo?

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.840
Like what does that have
to do with the brain?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.180
Everyone's heard of epo if you have

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:53.440
any sort of medical background,

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.640
it's also just one of the most, you know,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.290
widely prescribed drugs
in medicare records

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.670
for treatment of anemia.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.810
So erythropoietin is
essentially a hormone,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.300
it's produced by the liver in the fetus

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.420
and then eventually in the kidney.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.797
And so it regulates hematopoiesis.

00:14:12.797 --> 00:14:17.070
And it wasn't until the early 90s

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.630
that people started noticing that there

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:24.630
were epo receptors in neurons in mice.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.280
And then a few years later it was reported

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.350
also in human neurons
in all different ages

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.470
and so that started raising
people's, you know, eyebrows.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.023
Why are there are epo
receptors in the brain?

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.010
This is just a schematic showing

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.450
that epo is actually quite abundant

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.250
and the receptor is quite abundant.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.200
And so epo is made both in
astrocytes an in neurons.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.070
In this diagram, epo is
represented by little yellow dots.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.680
And then the receptor is
these little red ovals

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.080
and the receptor is
ubiquitous in the brain,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.230
so not only on neurons and astrocytes

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.850
but also on microglial
cells and endothelial cells.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.950
And so what has been worked out

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.910
is that when the brain
is exposed to hypoxia,

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.050
this turns on a whole, you know,

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:17.160
array of intracellular pathways.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.674
It turns on the HIF-1 gene,

00:15:19.674 --> 00:15:22.168
which then turns on
the erythropoietin gene

00:15:22.168 --> 00:15:24.130
and then that leads to increased epo,

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.540
endogenous epo production,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.020
there's also increased
epo receptor production.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.420
And it's thought that this is sort of

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.420
an endogenous mechanism to
protect the brain from hypoxia.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.440
And the question that
people are asking now,

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.590
is if that's the case, that
when you have this insult,

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:42.360
that the body starts turning on epo,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.630
what if you gave even more epo?

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.850
Could you actually help the
brain recover even more?

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:51.020
And so what exactly is
epo doing in the brain?

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.810
And this is a slide that my collaborator

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.940
Sandra Juul put together, I
just think it's beautiful,

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.390
I love showing this slide.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.670
But it summarizes so much information.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:01.610
So the first thing to know from this slide

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:05.310
is that there are both acute
effects and longterm effects.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.190
The acute effects are sort
of similar to hypothermia.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.900
I showed earlier all
those different things

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.760
that hypothermia does,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.920
well epo does a lot of the same things.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.990
It has anti-inflammatory properties,

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:17.790
you know, it decreases excitotixicity,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.860
oxidative stress, all of these things.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:24.033
And all that is thought to
lead to improved survival.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.533
So sort of similar to hypothermia.

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.320
But one of the great benefits
of epo we think is that

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.010
in addition to all of these
neuroprotective mechanisms,

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.910
there are also longterm effects.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.510
And so as you mentioned earlier,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.410
it's an erythropoietic agent

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.623
and so this may lead to
helping repair the brain.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.690
It also has angiogenic properties,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:55.340
so you have more, you
know, repair of vessels.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.240
This one is really intriguing

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.570
and it's been studied a lot
by my colleagues at UCSF,

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.520
Fernando Gonzalez, who's a
neonatologist and Donna Ferriero.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.450
What they found is that if you give

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:07.280
multiple high doses of epo,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.280
you can actually have stem
cells in the brain after injury

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.150
preferentially become
neurons and oligodendrocytes.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:16.873
And they've actually shown that

00:17:16.873 --> 00:17:18.490
those migrate to the are of injury.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:21.150
And so it seems to not just reduce injury

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.110
but actually enhance repair.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.190
I don't show a lot of their data

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.520
because we don't have too much time

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.563
but it's really fascinating.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.730
I mentioned that, you know,

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:36.250
there's a lot of preclinical
studies done of HIE

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.800
and specifically of the
effect of erythropoietin.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.720
And so you know by now,
there are actually probably,

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.960
you know, even more than 70 animal studies

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.050
and specifically in
neonatal animal studies

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.140
that show that when you
give multiple doses of epo,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.700
that the brain has both
histologic signs of improvement,

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.970
you know, when looking
under the microscope,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.900
but also that the animals do better,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.820
they have functional improvements.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.769
And in general when you
look at these studies,

00:18:04.769 --> 00:18:08.550
there is a 40 to 75% decrease in the size

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:13.320
of the brain lesion in animals
that are treated with epo

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.810
and I'll show you an example of that.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.720
So these are data from my collaborator,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.133
Fernando Gonzalez at UCSF.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.780
So he has a rat model
of stroke essentially.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.400
So what they do is they
do a carotid artery

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.250
ligation on one side of the neck

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.930
and that decreases blood flow
to that side of the brain

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.700
and you get a hole in the
brain, so you get a stroke.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.135
But what they found is that,

00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:43.800
here is an animal, a typical
animal with no treatment.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.490
If there are three doses of epo given,

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.650
there is a remarkable
recovery of that brain.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.140
I mean it's really dramatic.

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.570
But you know, this is just one example.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.140
So then they put all
their animals together

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.630
and let me just go through
this graph for you.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.330
This is, on the Y axis,
it's plotting the ratio

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:03.430
of the volume of brain on the injured side

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.660
versus the uninjured side,
and so it should be one,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.170
it should be equal on the two sides.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.690
And so the black bar are the
animals that have the injury,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.820
sorry, the black bar is the
animals that have no injury

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.020
and so the ratio is one to one.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.270
The blue bar are the animals

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.050
who have the injury but no treatment.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.460
And you can see that, you know,

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.820
the volume of brain on this
side is, you know, like a 1/3,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.830
I guess maybe 40% of what
it is on the other side.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.020
The yellow bar represents
animals who have injury

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.560
who got one dose of epo only and that dose

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.740
was given right away after
the brain was injured

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.493
and there's no difference.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.060
The red bar refers to
animals that got three doses

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.470
of epo right away after the injury,

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.320
24 hours later, and then seven days later.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.790
And what it shows is that there is

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.953
a remarkable recovery of brain.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.730
And then they actually
did this functional study,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.090
so the Morris water maze, you know,

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:05.350
it tests the rat's like
memory and ability to swim.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:08.350
And they found that the epo three rats,

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.210
the ones that got three doses,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.010
did just as well as the normal rats.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.520
So it's not just that it looked better,

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.723
these rats actually performed better.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:21.530
And he actually has a lot of
other really interesting data,

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.030
I didn't have time to show but

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.453
it's quite intriguing in the animal data.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.470
So then, you know, whenever
you think about studying

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:35.490
a new therapy on newborns,
you wanna make sure it's safe.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.090
One of the initial issues
that came up was that

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.180
around the time when I started
coming into the picture

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.690
and being interested
in testing this therapy

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.300
in the babies that we were treating,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.570
the FDA put a black box
warning on erythropoietin.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.109
This is in, I think 2009 maybe?

00:20:52.109 --> 00:20:55.210
And the reason is adults get epo a lot

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.140
for a variety of reasons
and it's been shown

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.223
to cause hypertension, clotting problems.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.970
You know, if you're getting
treated because you have cancer

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.810
and you're going through chemotherapy,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.330
there's actually increased tumor growth,

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.633
it is a growth factor.

00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:15.010
Oh and those being tested
for adults with stroke,

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.350
adults could recover brain like this

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:19.610
and turned out that that
was very disappointing,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.290
the very large trials showed
that there was increased death.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:27.143
And so this black box warning came about.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.930
Fortunately, we also use
epo already in babies.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.423
We use it really to treat
anemia of prematurity.

00:21:38.118 --> 00:21:41.020
I actually went through and searched

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.320
and found 33 clinical trials of epo

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.540
being used to treat anemia of prematurity

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.830
and the doses were all over the place

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.130
but as high as 7500
units per kilo per week.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:53.950
And you know, if you add up all the babies

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.730
in those trails that got epo,

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:00.730
it was up to 2700 babies,
no concerns for safety.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:05.040
And then, you know, it's
been studied in preterms,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.630
we're not gonna talk too
much about preterms today

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.680
but as you know, half of CP is

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.350
from brain injury of prematurity

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.070
and it's being studied in that population.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:16.990
And again, there've been
over 1000 babies studied

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.310
and really have not seen a lot of concern.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.390
So with that in mind,
we decide to start off

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.490
with a very small simple
phase one clinical trial.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.010
So typically a phase one trial

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.980
is one where you're looking to figure out

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.446
when the small number
of patients, is it safe?

00:22:33.446 --> 00:22:35.400
You know, what's the best dose?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.822
And so what we did was we enrolled,

00:22:39.822 --> 00:22:42.515
I think I say that, yeah,
we enrolled 24 babies.

00:22:42.515 --> 00:22:47.010
And the first three got
just 250 unites per kilo,

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.000
then six babies got this dose,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.230
seven babies got 1000 unites per kilo.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.500
And then assuming, you know,
every time we saw no safety,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.840
we were allowed to go up in the dose.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.630
The question here is what is the best dose

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.285
to use to treat babies?

00:23:01.285 --> 00:23:02.520
And the way we tried to get at that answer

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.690
and of course there's
no way to know for sure

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.120
but the best way to guide that question

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.900
is to look at what's been
studied in animal models.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.790
And animal models suggest that if you

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.860
can get a plasma level to this range,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.630
that that's most neuroprotective.

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.146
If it's higher, it was
not working that well

00:23:20.146 --> 00:23:22.750
and if it was lower, it
was not working very well.

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.690
And what we found was these seven babies

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.700
that got 1000 units all
fell within that range,

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.210
got, you know, blood levels in that range.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.620
And also it was the first time

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.230
that epo had been given with hypothermia

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.870
and so the question was,
you know, can that be done?

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:38.970
And there were no safety concerns.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.923
So following this phase one trial,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.840
we were funded by the
Thrasher Research Fund

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.590
to do a phase two study.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.600
And so this is actually a true, you know,

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.570
randomized placebo controlled
double masked clinical trial

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.950
where we enrolled 50 babies.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.700
And what we did was all
the babies were cooled,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.870
again that's become standard of care,

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.700
this is just, you know, days
of age on this axis here.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.920
And then on days one, two,
three, five, and seven,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.160
we gave a dose of epo,
the 1000 unites per kilo

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.240
that we had found in the phase one study.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.050
And then all the babies, as
part of clinical practice,

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.850
get a brain MRI after they're rewarmed.

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.960
And then we followed
them by phone initially

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.480
and then at one year we brought them in

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.200
to do a neurodevelopmental evaluation

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.183
and I'll talk a little
bit more about that.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.437
So this slide just shows
you who was in our study.

00:24:34.437 --> 00:24:36.660
It turns out when we're all done,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.050
we found out that 24
babies had been randomized

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.610
in getting the therapy, the epo doses

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.070
and 26 had gotten hypothermia
alone with placebo.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:49.280
And this just shows that the
two groups are quite similar

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:52.020
in terms of, you know, basic demographics,

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.910
in terms of how sick they were

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.720
with regards to their low Apgar scores,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.750
how they were delivered,
you know, cesarean section,

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:04.040
an emergency section was actually
required in a fair number,

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:07.680
71% in one group and 58% in the other.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.680
And severe HIE was equally
distributed between the two.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:17.500
So the first question we asked was how did

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.373
these two groups differ in
terms of their brain MRIs?

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.410
So as I mentioned, after
babies are rewarmed,

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.980
typically they get an
MRI shortly thereafter.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.150
And our group, our collaborators
at Washington University

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.520
had created and published a scoring system

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.290
that specifically looks at
how badly the basal ganglia

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.420
and then this parasagittal injury looks

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.190
in these babies with HIE.

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.080
And so they didn't know which
group the babies were in

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.430
and they scored both the location

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.363
and the severity of the injury.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.890
And what we found was that
the babies that got epo

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.290
overall had a lower
MRI global injury score

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.580
than the group with placebo.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.542
And this was actually
quite surprising to us

00:26:01.542 --> 00:26:02.893
because it was a small study.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.110
And again, like these
are the different parts

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:07.840
of the brain that were being scored

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:10.110
but when you put the injury all together,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.460
there was less injury in
the epo treated group.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.310
This slide shows that it's
actually quite striking

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.770
in that if you break down
the severity of injury

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:25.160
in the brain into these
categories, mild, moderate, severe,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.700
that moderate to severe
injury was only present

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.000
in one of the epo treated babies

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
and 11 of the placebo treated
babies, so pretty striking.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.410
The MRI is just a biomarker,

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.090
what we really care about is function

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:43.470
and so in this small phase two trial,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.630
we were only funded to follow
them until 12 months of age.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.670
So we did the best we could at 12 months.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.530
We first administered WIDEA,

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.730
which is a parental questionnaire.

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.000
And this questionnaire,
you ask parents about

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.720
all these different, you know,

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.970
self care, mobility, communication,

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:03.200
and social cognition milestones.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.820
So that was a questionnaire
we administered.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.110
We also use the Alberto
Infant Motor Scale,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:12.790
which is a standardized motor evaluation,

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.470
it's basically just seeing
how well the baby does

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:19.293
in prone, supine, sitting,
and standing positions.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.650
And what we found was at 12 months,

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.230
when we looked at the questionnaire,

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.530
overall there was no significant

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.030
difference between the groups

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:31.140
but if you look at the sub scales,

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.160
the mobility scale actually was,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.300
the scores were definitely lower

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.090
in the epo group than the placebo group

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.490
and that was just barely
significant difference.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.370
And this was corroborated by
the Alberto Infant Motor Scale,

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:48.650
which again, the scores were higher,

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.540
meaning there was better motor development

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.220
in the epo treated group
than placebo group.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.430
And again, this was by evaluators

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.540
who were masked to the treatment group

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.090
that the child was assigned to.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.080
So these were exciting results.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.164
We thought that this study concluded

00:28:06.164 --> 00:28:09.800
that this combination treatment
of epo plus hypothermia

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.590
may reduce the severity of injury on MRI

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.870
and may improve short term outcomes.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.890
But I definitely wanted
to spend a little time

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.280
reminding us that this is a small study

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.420
and it has major limitations

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.290
because of its small sample size

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.640
and because we didn't
have longterm outcomes.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.754
And to really illustrate that point,

00:28:28.754 --> 00:28:31.620
I wanted to show these data to you.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.220
So as I mentioned, this
Alberta Infant Motor Score,

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.760
the scores were higher, meaning
there was better development

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.293
in the epo treated group
than the placebo group.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.260
Well it turns out that
in this small study,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.670
we found that there were two patients

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.980
who had post hoc diagnoses of exclusion,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.523
meaning that, you know, when
you first enroll these babies,

00:28:51.523 --> 00:28:53.930
they have to be enrolled
by 24 hours of age.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:55.390
You don't actually know everything

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.320
going on with this baby yet.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.290
Two of them were found out during the rest

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.420
of their neonatal stay in the hospital,

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.060
that they had other conditions

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.470
that were gonna make them
have really bad outcomes.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.240
One had myotonic dystrophy,
significant muscle disorder.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.170
Another one had a very bad
brainstem malformation,

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.640
who actually died at one year of age,

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.697
a little bit past one year of age.

00:29:16.697 --> 00:29:18.690
And it just turns out,
because it's a small study,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:20.570
both of those were in the placebo group

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.990
and so they were going to
do poorly no matter what.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.710
If you take them out,
then the difference is

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:29.390
really less striking and
definitely no longer significant.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:32.430
So just a good reminder
of why this is interesting

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.720
in that this study we were able to show

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.700
why it's really important
with small studies

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.300
to be careful what you conclude.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.610
And therefore I think
we have equipoise still.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.380
There really is not enough evidence

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.030
to justify using this therapy.

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.040
And I will say part of the reason is,

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.670
so there are three large
ongoing phase three trials,

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:54.680
we're now doing a large phase three trial

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.050
we're calling HEAL.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.960
The Australian group, led by Helen Liley

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.400
is doing a large study with 300 babies,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.930
these are all epo plus hypothermia trials.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.520
This group, Juliana Patkai in Paris

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.970
had to stop their study early,

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.560
they were gonna enroll
300 but the reason was

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.990
with this small number, they
actually found increased deaths

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.070
in the epo treated group.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.090
So that gives us pause,

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.809
gives all of you pause as I just heard.

00:30:22.809 --> 00:30:27.340
So I think, you know, the jury's still out

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:31.840
as to what we're gonna
find but fingers crossed.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.370
So we actually, we were funded by NIH

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.740
to perform this large phase three trial

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.060
and Sandra Juul is a neonatologist

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.320
up at University of Washington

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.490
who has spent her entire career studying

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.420
how epo provides
neuroprotection to infants.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.630
And so just to give you an
idea of what we're doing,

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:56.970
this is sort of a similar
slide as you saw earlier.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.010
So again, these babies
are all getting cooled

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:03.050
for the first three days, which
is standard clinical care.

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:05.530
We're actually front
loading the doses this time,

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.730
we're giving four doses
on days one through four

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.640
and then a final dose on day seven.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.493
Donna Ferriero feels very
strongly and Fernando Gonzalez,

00:31:12.493 --> 00:31:14.810
that this late dose is the most important

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.530
for helping the brain repair

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.810
and they have some data to suggest that.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.200
And then we're collecting
blood and urine samples.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.510
This time we're following them by phone

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.520
at four, eight, 12, and 18 months

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.320
and then seeing them
for a full evaluation,

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.554
including a Bayley Three
standardized neuro exam.

00:31:33.554 --> 00:31:36.500
And you know, some other additional

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.523
evaluations at 24 months.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.610
This is just a slide showing that we have

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.240
17 hospitals enrolling
babies around the country.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.650
And our goal is we have to enroll 500

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.390
to show that there's benefit to this.

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:52.970
And so we're up to 180,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.330
actually this morning we just enrolled 181

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.930
and so we'll be done with
enrollment in a year and a half

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.920
and then we have to follow the
babies for another two years.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.624
And so it'll be 2022
before we know the answer.

00:32:05.624 --> 00:32:08.550
One of the exciting things
is that Australian study

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:13.190
is using a very similar,
almost identical protocol

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.570
and so it may be that we can combine

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.313
our data as well with them,

00:32:17.313 --> 00:32:20.870
if we don't have enough power
even with this study of 500

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:25.193
to get a better handle on
whether the therapy works.

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:28.810
Okay, so I think we're
doing pretty well for time,

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:30.650
so I have a little bit of time to tell you

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.580
about some of the other
things that are being studied

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.980
and I kind of cut this section down

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:37.840
for fear of not having enough time

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.260
but I think it's really interesting

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.242
to think about what
else is being looked at.

00:32:43.242 --> 00:32:47.750
So xenon, xenon is a
noble gas, which you know,

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.510
from high school chemistry
you might remember

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.740
what that means, I barely remember.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.490
But I guess it's present in trace amounts

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.320
in the atmosphere and it
was the first noble gas

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.290
to actually be synthesized in a lab

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:05.550
and it has incredibly potent
neuroprotective effects.

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:08.030
And you know, through this pathway,

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.650
it up-regulates all
these survival proteins,

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.090
including HIF-1 I had mentioned earlier.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.760
So if you give xenon gas,
you're also gonna increase epo,

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.523
as well as a lot of other
upstream survival proteins.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.670
And you know, a lot of anesthetic agents,

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.220
you've probably followed
this a little bit,

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.760
that they've been found
in a lot of animal studies

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.630
to cause injury to developing brain.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.530
And so we are very reluctant now

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:38.310
to sedate babies for
MRI and things like that

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.510
because of that potential risk

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.800
of it being harmful to the brain.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.900
But unlike the other anesthetics,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.100
xenon is an anesthetic agent that

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.250
does not cause any sort of injury

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:50.740
to the brain in animal studies.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.880
The problem is that
xenon is very expensive

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.672
and therefore you have to use
this closed circuit device

00:33:57.672 --> 00:34:00.600
that will recycle the xenon

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.000
and it's also not FDA approved in the US.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.270
It's been approved in
Europe and Russia for

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.430
at least five, 10 years to be
used as an anesthetic agent

00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:11.930
but it's not available in the US.

00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.190
So just to give you some ideas,

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:15.180
in England they're the
ones that have taken

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.587
the lead in studying this for HIE.

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.440
Marianne Thoresen did this
study, so she's actually,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:27.180
she created this very complex,
I think, recycling system.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.910
And what she did was she gave 50% xenon

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:32.900
for 18 hours plus hypothermia

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.360
and what she found in these 14 babies

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.403
was that it seemed safe.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.830
Again, this is one of
those phase one studies,

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.460
you're looking at safety and feasibility.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.410
And interestingly they found that whenever

00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:47.060
they stopped the xenon, not whenever,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.700
but often when they stopped the xenon,

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.090
the baby would start seizing.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.866
And then they would start it again

00:34:52.866 --> 00:34:53.699
and the baby would stop seizing.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.580
So they got the sense that it seemed

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:56.763
to have anti-epileptic properties.

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.180
Then there's another
group, Denis Azzopardi,

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.560
he's another neonatologist in the UK

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.190
and they've done a larger study,

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:09.210
where they enrolled 130 babies.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:11.320
They called this the TOBY Xenon trial

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.220
and they gave a slightly
smaller dose, 30% xenon,

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.720
started by 12 hours and
inhale for 24 hours.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.720
This is again, with hypothermia.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.890
And they looked at the
short term outcomes,

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.870
which is MRI findings, which
they used as a biomarker

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.910
to see if this treatment might

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.290
actually lead to less brain injury.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.170
And it was quite
disappointing that there were

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:35.420
actually no differences in the two groups

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.663
in terms of these early
neuroimaging biomarkers.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.270
But they also saw a reduction in seizures,

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.320
so that probably is gonna be interesting.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:48.520
But I asked him last year actually

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.590
and it sounds like they're not
gonna have longterm follow up

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.080
which is just so disappointing.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.560
I think it's a funding issue

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.220
and I think he's somewhat retired,

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.260
so I'm not sure we're gonna

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.830
actually learn too much more about that.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.270
So that's one thing, that's
one story I've been following.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.170
This is another one, which
also was a surprise to me

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.950
because I have this bottle by my bed

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:10.240
and I had no idea that it would

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.483
have neuroprotective properties.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.230
So you know, similar
to what we talked about

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:17.620
with epo and with hypothermia,

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:21.050
it has multiple properties
in animal studies

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:24.410
and that could be
potentially neuroprotective.

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:27.000
And there are a number of
human studies going on,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.510
they're two phased, two studies,
one that's been published

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.860
and one that's ongoing
looking at different doses.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.820
And so stay tuned, you know,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.040
the idea is that this
is, you know, very safe

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.610
and it's being studied with
hypothermia in this study.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.840
But also as a monotherapy,
perhaps in places

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.480
where cooling is not available.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.330
So that's another story that'll
be interesting to follow.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.430
I took this picture of an
article in Consumer Reports,

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.650
it came out in I think January,
it was a great article.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.140
And you know, some of the
other speakers and I talked

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:03.620
about stem cell therapy, it
comes up a lot in my clinic,

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.670
people ask about all
sorts of clinics out there

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.690
that are coming around that offer,

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.200
you know, everything under the sun.

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.850
And this article actually
in Consumer Reports,

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.461
if you wanna go see it, they
actually talk a lot about

00:37:15.461 --> 00:37:17.690
what the FDA has and has not done

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:18.920
to try to regulate those clinics,

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.810
it's a really interesting article.

00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:23.280
In Consumer Reports of all places.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.580
So stem cells, is there a role?

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.510
I think really the main therapy

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:34.270
that's being tested right
now is autologous cord blood.

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.260
And so, you know, this is relatively safe,

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.000
you know, it's noninvasive
and people talk about

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.110
having minimal ethical issues.

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.960
The umbilical cord is actually
considered medical waste

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.010
and so taking the cord blood

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.773
and then administering
it back to the baby,

00:37:49.773 --> 00:37:52.840
animal studies show
promise, although no one

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.100
really understand a mechanism
by which it might work.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.610
I know of two studies that are going on,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.800
one is Michael Cotten's study at Duke

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.520
and they're cooling babies with HIE

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.093
and then also giving stem
cells from cord blood.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.760
From clinicaltrials.gov, it looked like

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.330
they would be done in 2019.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.790
I actually don't know
how far along they are.

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.870
There's also a smaller phase one study

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.100
at New York Medical Center.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.520
This was interesting
because they're not only

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.590
giving cord blood in these three aliquots

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.600
on day zero, three, and seven

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.510
but they're also taking the placenta

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.630
and extracting placental derived
stem cells and giving that.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.310
So they're actually giving
five aliquots of stem cells,

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.510
so that'll be really interesting

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.410
to see what happens with that as well.

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.448
I like this slide because I
think it really summarizes

00:38:43.448 --> 00:38:46.630
all the things that are unknown,

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.550
there's just so many
more unanswered questions

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.950
in terms of how to use stem cells and why.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.950
So you know, certainly human
umbilical cord blood cells,

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:04.070
you know, provide mesenchymal stem cells

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:07.250
that do eventually become
neurons and glial cells

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.700
but there's just so much we don't know.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.943
We don't know what kind of
cell is working, how it works.

00:39:11.943 --> 00:39:14.500
We don't know how many cells to give,

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.620
how often to give it, what's
the best way to give it.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.860
You know, Frank Frambell
in the Netherlands

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.533
has studied giving it intranasally.

00:39:23.637 --> 00:39:25.700
A group down in southern California,

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.500
you know, they give it
directly intracranially,

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.380
this is in animal studies of course.

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.690
You know, a lot of other animal studies

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:33.193
give it intraperitoneally.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.040
You know, when should you give it

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.110
and which patients would benefit

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.280
and exactly how it works,

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.410
you know, what are the
actual humeral factors

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.000
that are being released that are actually

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.270
probably the most beneficial?

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.810
We just don't know answers
to all of these questions,

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.763
so I think it's still
really early in this field.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.060
And I wanted to mention that, you know,

00:39:58.060 --> 00:39:59.560
we just focused on erythropoietin

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.100
because that's what I'm studying

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.690
and it's the most well studied

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.440
of all the cooling plus therapies

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:07.780
that are being, you know,
brought down the pipeline

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.020
but there are many others.

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.610
So there are actually clinical trials

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.270
looking at magnesium sulfate.

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.840
So we know that that is a, you know,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.680
potent neuroprotective
agent in preterm infants

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.410
and can prevent CP in preterms.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.610
It's also being studied in terms.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:24.572
Allopurinol is being
studied in Europe right now.

00:40:24.572 --> 00:40:27.600
N-Acetyl Cysteine is
specifically anti-inflammatory.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.300
Cannabinoids, there's actually a company

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.130
that wants to study this in addition

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.890
to hyperthermia for HIE.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:37.697
And so the thought is perhaps
one day down the line,

00:40:37.697 --> 00:40:39.910
we can actually tailor a cocktail

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.780
of neuroprotective therapies
for individual patients

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.400
and continue to cool them.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.320
This is from my mentor Donna Ferriero

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.920
but I thought it was kinda cute.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.610
So that's it, I hope
you got a sense as to,

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.100
you know, why we're interested in HIE,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.750
some of the current therapies

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:00.140
and therapies that are
coming down the line.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.700
I wanted to thank my collaborators

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.300
and specifically my three main mentors,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.940
who've been Donna Ferriero
and Roberta Ballard

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.500
and Sandra Juul, who I talked about

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.650
up at University of Washington.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.160
And Thrasher Research
Fund for funding our work

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.060
and then finally, yeah,
this is a little girl

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.130
that was in our phase two study of epo

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:21.790
and she's done so well and we want

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:25.590
all our patients to
end up like this, yeah.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.713
Thank you very much.

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:31.034
(audience applauding)
