00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.310
So as bones grow, the cells that are

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.020
growing inside the bone are FGFR3-positive cells. What this

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.560
means? If we zoomed in really close is that

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.950
the cells in red, if we look very close

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.280
up, here is the cell membrane. This red protein

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.280
here is the FGFR3 protein. We have two proteins

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.510
right here, and they're embedded in the membrane. As

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.930
you can imagine, proteins in the membrane are important,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.140
because they're what communicate from the outside

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.310
world to the inside world. Now if there

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.320
are actually two FGFR3 proteins like this, they're

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.460
considered inactive. Nothing is happening Because the only

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.440
way the FGFR3 protein can do anything is if it's bound to it's favorite

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.700
partner protein FGF3. The R in FGFR3

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.580
stands for Receptor, because it receives the signal from FGF3. It's

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.730
like it's serving as a docking platform. So

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.360
these two FGFR3 proteins can get close together. And

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.400
once they're close together, then there's a signal that's

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.700
sent to slow down bone growth. So normally these

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.920
cells in red, that are FGRF3 positive are growing

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.700
and dividing and contributing to the cells in the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.424
long bone, helping it to grow longer. But there

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:17.310
is a signal that comes from the environment that

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.570
is transmitted through the FGRF3 protein. So

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.050
that whenever the FGF3 protein is around, it's

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.990
a signal that says, whoa, slow down, guys.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.480
Slow down your bone growth. Now, what happens

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.390
in the case of the G1138A mutation? The misense mutation is that right here in

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.200
this region with printing spans across the cell

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.000
membrane that's where the amino acid changes happen.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.550
And now this FGFR3 protein doesn't have to wait for FGF3. It can form this pair

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.730
what we call a dimerization. Dimer di meaning two here. Even when there's no

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.580
protein partner to facilitate the interaction. Right?

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.030
We don't see that yellow protein here connecting

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.270
the two FGFR3s. So this means we're going

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.220
to slow down bone growth like we normally

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.010
would, but now its going to happen even when the FGF3 isn't around. So the net

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.120
effect are bones that grow shorter than they

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.100
normally would. Because the FGF3 protein is going to be

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.170
slowing bone growth down, even when the FGF3

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.260
isn't around. It means that this protein is

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.070
sort of always on now. Overall, this results

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.120
in a form of short limb dwarfism called achondroplasia.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.230
If you want to know where the name comes

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.360
from, a chondrocyte is what we call a bone cell

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.590
a chondrocyte. So the chondro part is what we're

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.590
referring to a bone here. Plasia means growth, so chondroplasia

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.980
means bone growth and achondroplasia means the absence or

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.820
the loss of so The loss of bone growth. And

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.210
that's what dwarfism is, in this sense. A person with

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.470
achondroplasia will have shorter limbs. And overall, be a shorter

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.490
person with a distinctive facial structure also due to

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.250
altered bone development of the skull. So would you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.345
categorize this allele here, the G1138A allele. As a

00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:14.410
loss-of-function, a gain-of-function, or no change in function allele.
