1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.130
Okay.
So what did they tell you about waves?
I said,

2
00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:07.790
let's take a concrete example.
Instead of talking in generalities,

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.260
you say wave is the disturbance of some medium.
The medium I chose to study.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.180
What's a string under some tension clamped at both ends.

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.080
Then you pull it and you release it.
It's going to be doing something

6
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.660
this height
from the normal position.

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.850
At the point x is the actual variable,
CFX and t.

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.090
So at every point x along the string,

9
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.230
that is a displacement of the string in the transfers direction.

10
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.090
That's my FX and T.

11
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.310
I showed you that this psi obeys the following equation.

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.720
The square psi over d x squared equals one over v squared,

13
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.390
B squared,
psi over Dt Square.

14
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:06.130
Where we square is tension divided by mass per unit length.

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.340
I'm going to chain meditation into force because tea is also used for time

16
00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:15.040
periods.
So it's gotta be,
it's gotta get me in trouble very soon.

17
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.970
So let's just end the formula to watch.
Use the books.

18
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.030
Vesquez fo reveal f is the tension on the string.

19
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.630
So what does,
how did we get this?
Let me remind you how I got this.
Okay,

20
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.820
let's Undo The v square as a tea over meal.

21
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.660
What we're saying is t v squared,

22
00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:41.190
PSI over dx squared is equal to mu.

23
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.740
These squares psi over Dt Square.

24
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.860
This is very easy to understand.

25
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.510
Meaning of the equation I clean is just f equals m.

26
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.180
A you realize that this is the a of the string.

27
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.520
Moving up in all this,
the acceleration and this is the mass but unit length,

28
00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:03.600
so imagine a tiny segment of with Dx,

29
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.710
if you multiply both sides by Dx,
that is a massive,

30
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:12.400
a little segment.
New Times the is the mass.

31
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:15.820
This is mass times acceleration.
The left side is the force on it.

32
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.300
Why is this the force?

33
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:22.240
I tried to explain to you that if we took a piece of that string,

34
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.250
then the tension is pulling like that there and like this here and the two don't

35
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.140
cancel because if you resolve this force into vertical,

36
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:36.280
horizontal part that at the vertical horizontal part you can see this is going

37
00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.330
to be bigger than that.

38
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.370
So it the slope itself is changing and this is the rate of change of the slow.

39
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.230
Well another way to think about it is if you remember your calculus,

40
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.960
the second derivative of a function is the curvature of the function.

41
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.330
So then if you draw a graph like this,
that's the function of negative curvature.

42
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.300
That's the comm function.
This positive curvature,
it stays.

43
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.530
If the string has negative curvature,

44
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.250
the force is down string as positive curvature.

45
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.610
That's probably means you are below your normal position.

46
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.830
Then it's getting a force upwards so it's the curvature of the string that leads

47
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:19.690
to a net force.
One of you asked me very good question and after class,

48
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.750
which is the question was you took care of the vertical forces as d sine theta

49
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.090
plus Delta data here and t signed data here and you did all the cancellation.

50
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.800
How about the horizontal part?

51
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.930
That's also not quite balanced being the angles that aren't equal but the point

52
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:42.931
was cited or was approximated by Taito for small angles but cost sine theta.

53
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:47.971
You guys remember beacons is one minus data squared over two and so on,

54
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.120
but we are not keeping track of things more than the first part of data and the

55
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:52.954
calculation.

56
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.480
So of course saint data is just one in this approximation and tempted,

57
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.660
I am scientist are both equal.
The data,
that's a small angle approximation.

58
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:05.350
That's why the horizontal forces,
the fact that they don't quite match,

59
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.190
it's an error to next audit and data,
but the vertical forces are proportional.

60
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.040
The first part of data and that's what we can,

61
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.080
that's the origin of the wave equation.

62
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.430
Then you know you did the cancellation of x and so on and you went back that
far.

63
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.710
Then I said,
how about solution to this equation?
Well,
if you

64
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.020
have a little more time,
I can tell you how to get the solution does equation,

65
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.850
I don't have that much time.

66
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.410
So what we would do is going to do is to be content with writing down a solution

67
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.980
then convincing you it's a solution analyzing his properties.

68
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.020
So solution I wrote down look like a ghost sign,

69
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.130
k x minus Omega t and I said,

70
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:53.650
well is that a solution of this farm?
We'll take it,

71
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.540
put it into the equation and take all the data vendors.
First of all,

72
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.430
you guys should be able to see that the will cancel on both sites.
You see that?

73
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.690
So if you put this here to deliver,
this will pull out a case square today.

74
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.940
Riveters here we'll put out an Omega squared.
Therefore,

75
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.400
if you want the two sites to match,

76
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.140
you will want the Omega squared side divided by the square to equal the case

77
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:25.141
where that means Omega equal to k times v.

78
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.780
That's the only condition.
If that is satisfied,
this,

79
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.950
if this Omega escape times to you have a solution.

80
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.020
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

81
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.340
<v 0>no,
and a
stand for anything</v>

82
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.260
you're going to have any amplitude you want.
Of course,

83
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:48.610
that's a little bit of a fake.

84
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.480
Why is that not really literally true?
What's,
Yep.

85
00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.150
Positive.
Real.
No,
I tell you it's real and positive and two miles long.

86
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.043
Yes.

87
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.643
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.100
<v 0>Not only that,
the whole calculation assumed it was a small displacement problem,</v>

89
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.680
right?
That's why Saint [inaudible],

90
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.140
Raleigh qualitate and cost data as roughly one.

91
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.120
So once you make an approximation and you get an answer,

92
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.350
you should not blindly or play the answer to circumstances that are not valid.

93
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.790
So even though the answer says you can have any aid that you like in practice,

94
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:28.990
you shouldn't use it for today,

95
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:34.350
which is so large that a the small angle approximation fieldstone all right,

96
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:38.590
so hey is anything,
so let's put in the lesson I've learned,

97
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.190
namely that Omega is equal to kv and write it as Cape Times x minus v.

98
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:50.740
T.
And here's where we were at the end of the class.

99
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.920
What this tells you is that this guy is some function of x minus v.

100
00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:01.921
T it happens to be a cost side but it turns out any function of x minus VT

101
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.270
actually satisfies the wave equation.

102
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.490
That's a really interesting exercise for you.
Calculus buff,
stick ef,

103
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.920
unknown function,
whatever you like,

104
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.900
but it's not an arbitrary function in with x and t up here any way they like,

105
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.570
they appear only in this combination,
so makeup,

106
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.070
any function like hyperbolic cosh of x minus Vt,
that's a solution.

107
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:28.840
The wave equation.
Why?
Because if you start taking derivatives,

108
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.620
if you call this variable w you will find that partial,

109
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.110
a little bit of an x and partial,

110
00:07:35.111 --> 00:07:39.310
a little bit too with the aspect of t are all connected to the liberties of w

111
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.240
and then if you do the chain rule you will find the satisfies the wave equation.

112
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.790
Then I tried to convince you that because of that the is actually the velocity

113
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:49.624
of the wave.

114
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.350
Let me tell you why I take any function you like at a given time.

115
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.000
T equal to zero.
It has a certain shape.
Our coastline has a certain shape,

116
00:08:00.001 --> 00:08:04.620
but take any shape you like at t equal to zero.
Let us say it just peaked here.

117
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:06.960
You see,
wait a little bit.

118
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.920
If you'd like to be picked at x equals six for example,

119
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.810
if you wait a little bit this term minus VT es,
subtracting it from it,

120
00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:20.580
you've got to add to this the same amount so that the peak now will be there.

121
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.250
The Amman baby,
his mood is in fact exactly equal the bt other words,

122
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.880
VT becomes a nonzero extra become non zero by the same amount.

123
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:32.190
If he wanted to ride the crest of that wave,

124
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.710
that means the signal is moving to the right,

125
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.800
so it turns out you can have x minus v t rx plus bt.
They're both solution.

126
00:08:40.801 --> 00:08:42.780
The wave equation with a minus sign,

127
00:08:42.781 --> 00:08:46.380
the signal is moving to the right with a plus sign is moving to the left.

128
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.020
That's a summary of what I did last time.
So last time we did have,

129
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:54.850
the way we question we

130
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:01.320
took this particular solution.
All right.

131
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:06.060
The next thing I want to do
is ask the following question.

132
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.000
What is k and what does Omega,

133
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.570
so let's take this function side off.

134
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:17.010
X and t which is a course sign,

135
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.640
k x minus Omega t

136
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.140
c a function or two variables is hard for us to visualize.

137
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.110
You're all good at explaining,
visualizing the function of one variable,

138
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.970
but this is a function of two variables.

139
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.750
Understand why it's to every point on the string has available site at that

140
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:39.240
point and that variable can vary with time.

141
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:44.190
That why sigh of x and t is needed to describe the vibration off an extended

142
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:46.210
body like a string.
For a [inaudible],

143
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.950
you just need one or two or three coordinates.
All right,

144
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.010
now I look at this function and I say,

145
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:56.080
let me at least understand this function or t equal to zero

146
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.680
t equal to zero.
Drop that term.
In other words,

147
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:05.010
this is a snapshot of the function.
What does it look like?

148
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.880
If I take a picture of t equals zero then I bury space.
Well that's cool.

149
00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:12.700
Sign x and you can all plot [inaudible].

150
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.780
KX versus x is going to start out at a then it's going to oscillate because

151
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:24.240
that's what the coastline does.
No,

152
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.410
this distance from one peak for the next peak we call the wavelength.

153
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.960
It's halted the distance from one truck to another truck foot from one point to

154
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:38.430
an identical point.
That distance where you repeat yourself is called lambda.

155
00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.890
What is the relation of care to lambda?

156
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.180
Now you got ask yourself when x was zero,
this angle was zero.

157
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.890
I got increased x two let's come back to what's essentially zero portico sign.

158
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:58.170
You are back to essentially zero if this angle is two Pi can answer before by

159
00:10:58.191 --> 00:11:02.290
our six by,
but the first time you're back to zero is when it's too pie.

160
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.120
That for the length lambda I have,

161
00:11:05.121 --> 00:11:09.860
there has a property that k times lambda is two Pi because if I move to the

162
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:13.580
right by Nmr Lambda,
the angel and the cost center change by two points,

163
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:14.600
so there's number call.

164
00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:19.601
Kay is related to the number we all understand more intuitively by this formula

165
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.420
is the inverse of the wavelength up to this factor two Pi.

166
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.280
Now you can say,
well you picked time t equals zero.

167
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.280
Maybe if you pick time Tiqualu one second,

168
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.470
you would have gotten a different picture.

169
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.720
Think about it if a party called one second,

170
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.140
as long as it's the fixed number that's on fixed angle Phi,

171
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.750
that's just going to shift the whole pattern by some amount.

172
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.710
It won't change the fact that the peak to peak distance is still lambda

173
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.490
because what's happening as a function of time,

174
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:55.120
we have seen very generally is that this whole pattern is going to slide to the

175
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:55.954
right.

176
00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.520
So I want to combine this picture with a dynamic picture of is saying,

177
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.670
if you know very time,
imagine this sliding by.

178
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.570
If you were sitting somewhere and here are some point,

179
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.320
that'd be the height for you and as time goes by,

180
00:12:12.321 --> 00:12:14.550
that'll be the height and that'll be the of that.
It'd be the heightened.

181
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:17.360
That'll be the,
hey,
all these things will go past where you are.

182
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:20.060
So let us know.
Ask,

183
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.980
what does it look like to a person sitting at a certain location as a function

184
00:12:24.981 --> 00:12:28.790
of time?
In other words,
the waves are being manufactured in the ocean.

185
00:12:28.791 --> 00:12:32.210
Let's say they're being sent towards the shore.
You stand in one place,

186
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.750
the wave's going to go past you,
so you will Bob up and down.

187
00:12:35.751 --> 00:12:38.810
And that's what I want to understand.
So I picked some location.

188
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:44.170
I pick x equals zero for convenience than sy at x equals zero as a function of

189
00:12:45.081 --> 00:12:45.914
time.

190
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.100
Looks like Eiko Sine Omega t I didn't miss the minus sign put of course sign.

191
00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:55.370
It doesn't matter if you change the angle,
the minus the angle.

192
00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.290
So block the same graph.
Now this time as a function of time

193
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.590
and ask what happens?
Well,

194
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.270
you start with a maximum and you Bob up and down.

195
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.430
This is a picture of at one point where the water or the string goes up and

196
00:13:13.431 --> 00:13:14.264
down.

197
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.400
So we like to call this from one maximum to the next maximum.

198
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.180
The pain period.
That's the time.
What would it be?
Is the way repeats itself.

199
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.400
<v 1>Okay.</v>

200
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.390
<v 0>Well it follows then that Omega Times,</v>

201
00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:33.170
the time period is two Pi because when I put little tickle the time period,

202
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.350
I've gone from this maximum.
Does that make sense?

203
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.030
Therefore ah,

204
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:45.110
Omega is two Pi over t in other words,

205
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.590
Kay and Omega,

206
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.480
which we put into the wave unrelated to the time period and the wavelength to

207
00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:52.680
this reciprocity formula.

208
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.210
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

209
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.080
<v 0>so if you'd like,</v>

210
00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.260
you can ride the wave as a course sign to buy x over lambda minus two pipe t

211
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.900
over capital t they're strictly equivalent.
You write it any way you like.

212
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.680
This makes it clear that have been exchanges by lambda.

213
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.870
Nothing happens to the coastline because my next changes by land or you're

214
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.570
adding a two part of the coastline yet it's clear that if you add the little t

215
00:14:23.571 --> 00:14:28.540
and amount of time,
big t nothing happens because two pis don't matter.
So this,

216
00:14:28.541 --> 00:14:31.220
this makes it very clear the periodicity in space and time,

217
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.540
but this is more compact because we don't want to caddy two pies and lambdas in

218
00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:36.410
this complicated form.

219
00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:39.620
Me Give a new name to two pie over lambda and two Pi over t.

220
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:43.363
Okay.

221
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
What about the velocity of the way you remember it satisfies this condition is

222
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.360
Omega over k
but no.

223
00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:55.190
Let's rate this in terms of this new guys.

224
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.670
Two Pi over t divided by two Pi over lambda is lambda over tea.

225
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:03.563
<v 1>Okay,</v>

226
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.920
<v 0>so the velocity of this,
this wave is called a sign wave,</v>

227
00:15:11.921 --> 00:15:13.640
but of course sign way about a plane wave.

228
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.430
You got to understand waves and water than waves and string always have a

229
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:21.830
velocity.
If you pluck the string and let it go,

230
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.080
a little blip will travel from left to right,

231
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.220
but not every wave has a wavelength all the time.
Period.

232
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.570
This is a special function that has periodicity and t.
In other words,

233
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:35.090
if you go to the lake and drop a rock,

234
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.180
you'll set out some waves and after a while they'll spread out.

235
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.550
It's not going to happen over and over and over again,

236
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:45.890
but if you want the wave to be present for all time,
for all space,

237
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.900
you should keep on agitating the water.

238
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.310
That's what be imagine here is the source of this wave is to keep manufacturing

239
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:56.990
these waves from left to right.
So you must remember that in general,

240
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.560
every wave on a string art in the medium has a velocity,

241
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.490
but not every wave has a wavelength all the time period.

242
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.910
Any policies that traveled from left to right with speed V is a possible

243
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.570
displacement of the medium.
That's a particularly simple situation.

244
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:14.810
We study for that simple situation.

245
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.330
The velocity is connected,

246
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.960
the wave length and time period in this fashion or do you may also like to write

247
00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:23.360
it as lambda times frequency.

248
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.180
So that's a very easy thing to remember because you've a trend to get a velocity

249
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.520
is going to be some distance over some time.

250
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.480
The only distance you can think of for those pediatric wave as a wave length,

251
00:16:35.481 --> 00:16:39.320
the only time you can think of is the time it turns out the lambda over to is in

252
00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:43.910
fact simply the velocity.
Here's another way to understand this.

253
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.100
Supposed to have a string that goes on to infinity and I'm catching it at this

254
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:53.810
end and I start wiggling the string.
When I started wiggling this,

255
00:16:53.811 --> 00:16:57.020
these pulses will travel.
Let us sell their,
come up to this point.

256
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.780
Let's wait one more second in one more second.

257
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.650
I would have manufactured a few more of these pulses and the wave will look like

258
00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:11.420
that.
How many posts would I make per second?
F?

259
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:14.690
How long is each one lambda?

260
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.810
So that's how much it the wave as advanced in one second.

261
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.990
That's why it's the velocity you're making lambda sized objects,

262
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.900
f at the time,
F per second,
and pushing them out.

263
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.290
So the front of the wave of advances a distance,
lamb die if in one second.

264
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.330
That is the philosophy.
That's one way to understand why lambda f is equal to v.

265
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.870
Okay,

266
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.870
so now I considered another aspect of these waves and that's the energy in the

267
00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:46.644
wave.

268
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.661
First of all,

269
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:55.530
you've got understand a vibrating string has some energy compared to a string

270
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:58.500
with the not vibrating,
okay?
You have an intuitive feeling.

271
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:01.050
The vibrations that are cost of energy.

272
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.240
I want to calculate now the energy in a string vibrating according to this

273
00:18:06.241 --> 00:18:07.074
formula here,

274
00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:15.060
my was it infinitely long string.
The energy unit is infinite,

275
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.510
so you don't define the energy of an infinitely long string.

276
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.500
You defined the energy off a piece of string.
In fact,

277
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.120
you talk about energy per unit length.

278
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.040
So if you take a string,

279
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.100
it's been vibrating for a long time and the waves have been manufactured on the

280
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:38.010
left,
they've gone out far to the right.
We don't care how far.

281
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.630
Take a portion of the string

282
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.360
off length dx and ask how much energy does it have?
Yeah,

283
00:18:46.361 --> 00:18:48.900
what it is seen that if you sit at one point,

284
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.310
the string just moves up and down it execute simple harmonic motion.

285
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.050
When the string has gone all the way fully,
it's like a spring,

286
00:18:58.051 --> 00:19:01.170
which has been extended maximally.
That's when the string stops,

287
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.920
turns around and comes back.
When the string has come to the horizontal position,

288
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.280
that's the normal equilibrium position for a mass on a spring.

289
00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.940
That's when it's moving the fastest and overshoots and goes to the other side

290
00:19:11.941 --> 00:19:12.930
and goes back and forth.

291
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.920
So every part of the string is just undergoing simple harmonic motion.

292
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:22.050
That's pretty obvious from this.
So we just need to write down the energy.

293
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.570
So how do you write the energy?
The energy

294
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.620
is going to be either candidate or potential are the sum of the two?

295
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.520
No,
you can find the energy when nobody would like,
because it's a constant,

296
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.280
let's find it.
When the velocity is a maximum,

297
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.050
like for harmonic oscillator is like finding the velocity when the mass is just

298
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:45.480
swinging past the normal position x equal to zero.

299
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.230
They had the entire energy is kinetic energy.

300
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.480
It's one half new DX is the mass of the segment.
I'm looking at.

301
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.360
What's the maximum velocity you guys remembered from harmonic oscillators?

302
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.710
What's the maximum velocity that a harmonic oscillator has?

303
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.440
Who's a motion has given by this?

304
00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.513
<v 1>Yep.</v>

305
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.240
<v 0>Yes.
Uh,
Omega,</v>

306
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.000
this is getting a Yale education.

307
00:20:17.001 --> 00:20:22.001
So that's the difference between the $40,000 and $10,000 is that this is not a w

308
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:28.010
but omega.
Okay.
By the way,
I,
I could not get any of my kids to say,

309
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.440
uh,
Omega.
They keep saying,

310
00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:35.441
W I'm trying to have more success with this class then with my own offspring.

311
00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.860
But if you go to the outside world,
if you talk to any physicist,

312
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.070
if you say w they would think you're talking about the width of something.

313
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:48.400
So you have to say Omega is the Greek alphabet is essential to communication.

314
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.350
So this is a Omega is the maximum velocity and I got a square to that.

315
00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.950
No,
this is the energy office segment of a length dx.

316
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.490
So what we normally define as a quantity called literally you and that is the

317
00:21:05.491 --> 00:21:07.980
energy,
but unit length,

318
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.130
that means you just divide by the x and you get one half meal.

319
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.580
A Square Omega Square.

320
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:23.473
<v 1>Okay.</v>

321
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:28.090
<v 0>It is just the kinetic energy offers segment of unit length.</v>

322
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.520
It's the,
it's the total energy.
But I chose to computer winners all Kennedy.

323
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.303
<v 1>Yes,</v>

324
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.630
<v 0>mew is the mass,
but unit length.</v>

325
00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.410
Do you understand your take the string you find mass,

326
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.120
any divide by legs that some somewhat Matt's per centimeter.
Per meter.
That's me.

327
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.290
That's what,
if you go back to the derivation of the wave equation,

328
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.670
we were thinking in terms of mute.

329
00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.833
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

330
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.370
<v 0>Okay.
Now we can ask another question.</v>

331
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.970
What does the power center into this wave by the person exciting the media.

332
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:13.100
See the string,
uh,
is tied to a point appointed infinity.

333
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:17.630
But let's say they started oscillating a while ago and this is the part of the

334
00:22:17.631 --> 00:22:22.010
string that has started moving and I'm still shaking it here.

335
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.120
Let me wait one second if it,
wait one second.

336
00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:29.330
This part of the spring is now activated.

337
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.260
And what's the energy contained in the extra segment?

338
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.870
There's the energy per unit length one half mew is where Omega square times the

339
00:22:39.621 --> 00:22:40.454
velocity.

340
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:43.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

341
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.620
<v 0>That is the power I have to give in to produce this wave continuously.</v>

342
00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.620
You guys follow that?
If I wait one second,

343
00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.910
a segment of lengthy has now started moving in the front end.

344
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.720
I got the wave is being produced by me and sent out into the medium.

345
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:05.350
The distance it travels in one second is v and all of that extra segment is no

346
00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:07.490
vibrating with this energy per unit length.

347
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:11.210
So this is the extra energy per second I have to give and that's the power.

348
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.600
That power is provided by the person shaking the string.

349
00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:20.880
A special property of life in one dimension is that this way of goes on

350
00:23:20.881 --> 00:23:25.340
diminished and amplitude.
You can go 10 miles,
100 miles from me.

351
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:27.770
Amplitude is still the a that I produced here.

352
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.970
That's because all the energy goes along this line.

353
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:37.190
The sort of atypical,
what typically happens is when you live in,

354
00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.690
when you take into account vibrations of the sound in two or three dimensions,

355
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:46.430
if you have a power on top of it,
you put a that's making noise.

356
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.300
The energy radiates out in concentric circles

357
00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:56.660
and the power of the source is now spread over bigger and bigger spheres.

358
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.000
So in three dimensions we have the notion of intensity,

359
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.690
which is the power,
but unit area.

360
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.310
What I'm saying is if you've got a speaker,
they are sending out sound waves.

361
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:15.200
I take a one meter by one meter window in hold in front of me and ask how much

362
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.970
power across this in one second.
That intensity.

363
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.880
You don't have the notion in one dimension because you cannot hold a window in

364
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:27.200
one dimension.
Okay?
Three dimensions.
You take a little squared,
one by one meter,

365
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.430
and you'd define intensity to be powered between the data.
Of course,

366
00:24:31.431 --> 00:24:32.840
it doesn't have to be one meter big.

367
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:36.410
You can take a tiny square provided divided with the area of the tiniest square.

368
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:37.723
That is this.

369
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.220
So what do you think will happen if there's a speaker motor on top of a platform

370
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:47.270
that's radiating power at the Red p?
The intensity you get value are,

371
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.740
I hope you understand will be simply for PR square,

372
00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:52.640
but artists,

373
00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.200
the radius of the sphere and you are a distance art from the center and the

374
00:24:57.201 --> 00:25:02.201
power is going or do uniformly now are all directions and your share for the

375
00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.040
whole sphere with Spi,

376
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.570
the share for a unit area on the sphere is p divided by four Pi r squared

377
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.540
and that's measured in watts per meters squared.

378
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:23.280
<v 2>Yes.
People's health.
Anyways,
Omega squared,</v>

379
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.740
<v 0>this one,
uh,
what else do you think it should have?</v>

380
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.490
T four time period.
Why?

381
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.480
<v 2>That's energy for lane</v>

382
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.070
<v 0>is energy per length.
But if I wait one second,</v>

383
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.430
the way of has gone a distance v Times one second.

384
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.440
And so the extra energy I given every second has to pay for be more meters.

385
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.620
That's the interview for a second.
Yeah.
This is the energy per second.

386
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.990
That's the power.
That's correct.
So if you take your unit,
you will find it.

387
00:26:02.991 --> 00:26:05.600
It's got a energy per second.

388
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.930
Okay,
so this is called the intensity.
And for sound,

389
00:26:11.931 --> 00:26:16.550
we have another way to measure the intensity.
We defined something called Beta,

390
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.540
which is 10 times the logarithm of the intensity divided by a standard

391
00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:23.744
intensity.

392
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.790
The standard intensity has a value 10 to the minus 12 watts per meters squared.

393
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.190
And this is called the desert number of decibels.

394
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.700
So you mentioned the loudness of the sound in decibels.

395
00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.640
You must have heard that everywhere you look at your,
or even your amplified,

396
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:50.370
it'll have so many dbs in it.
So what's the DB talking about?

397
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.650
The dbs says your speakers making some,
uh,

398
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:58.200
sending out some energy.
Stay about ever.

399
00:26:58.201 --> 00:27:00.030
You want at a certain distance from the speaker.

400
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.080
See how much poverty is passing pastor unit area.

401
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.890
That's the numerator divided by the standard number.

402
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.140
People all agreed on dividing by the standard.

403
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.770
Then take the logarithm of that to the base 10 and multiply by 10

404
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.720
that's called the number of disabilities.
So for example,

405
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.200
if the power coming to me was the 10 to the minus 11 watts put meters square,

406
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.750
then I owe what I not,
what would it be?

407
00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:35.751
10 to the minus 11 divided by 10 to the minus 12 which will be 10 to the one and

408
00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:40.650
log of gender.
The one is just one and Beta will be 10

409
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:42.983
<v 1>DB.</v>

410
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.690
<v 0>So 10 decibels sound is a factor of 10 bigger than the standard song.</v>

411
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.370
But here's the interesting thing.

412
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.440
Suppose the intensity is 10 to the minus eight

413
00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.080
watts per meters squared.

414
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:05.750
That is a thousand times more intense than this one.

415
00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.970
But let's look at Beta.

416
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:13.900
Beta victims 10 log off pen to the fore now because 10 to the minus eight

417
00:28:14.241 --> 00:28:19.241
divided by 10 to the minus 12 is 40 so when the intensity goes from some number

418
00:28:20.991 --> 00:28:25.850
to something thousand times bigger,
the decibel goes from 10 to 40

419
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.460
the decibel grows much more slowly than the actual intensity.
In fact,

420
00:28:32.461 --> 00:28:36.120
the disabilities keeping track of how many Zeros that are in the power,

421
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:40.230
it grows logarithmically.
So every time I add an extra zero to the power,

422
00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.820
you go from 10 to a hundred a hundred to a thousand decibel goes up just by from

423
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:46.410
10 to 20 to 30 to 40

424
00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.880
that's why 80 disability can be incredibly low.

425
00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.300
80 90 a hundred hundreds of very painful number of decibels,

426
00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.590
and I believe people use decibels because the human ear is able to take a whole

427
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:05.400
range of intensity and hear it.
The ability of the ear to listen to intensity.

428
00:29:05.401 --> 00:29:07.110
You might think that's a very narrow band.

429
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:09.360
You can see here we can hit a very wide band,

430
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.560
but the intensity ranges over several powers of 10 in that case,
yes,

431
00:29:14.561 --> 00:29:17.700
of dealing with numbers that go all the way from 10 to the minus five to tender,

432
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.580
the plus something you dealing with the logarithm or the number,

433
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.820
then it's more manager.

434
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:28.350
So you can imagine trivial problems involving finding better given Beta,

435
00:29:28.351 --> 00:29:32.680
finding the intensity and so on.
Okay,

436
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.070
so now,
uh,

437
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.350
I'm finished with this basic properties of waves.

438
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:40.600
That's it both as the property just for sound,

439
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.020
you don't apply that to light and the whole standard intensity I not intensity

440
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:49.570
as well defined for everything.
Even electromagnetic waves of intensity.

441
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:53.590
It's the power coming per unit area.
But when applied to sound,

442
00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.050
if you take the log and multiply by 10 that's the decibel level of that song.

443
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:02.621
Okay.

444
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:07.330
Now for another totally different property of wave propagation,

445
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:12.200
which I'm going to again,
I played the sound is the family adopted ethics.

446
00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:19.960
So the doppler effect as though well known phenomenon that if you have a source

447
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:23.320
of definite frequency,
like a siren,
you know fire truck,

448
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.750
when the fire truck is coming towards you,

449
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.470
you hear a higher frequency and when it's gone past you,

450
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:33.280
you hit a lower frequency.
Again,
we just want to know why and by how much.

451
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.030
So to proceed with this,
I wanted him mind you,

452
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.180
this relation lamb that times f this v.

453
00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.210
So we are going to bear that in mind.

454
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:49.630
So let's take a source that is sitting still and you are standing here listening

455
00:30:52.461 --> 00:30:53.294
to the song.

456
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:58.040
The waves go by you and you see a certain wavelength.

457
00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:01.670
That's the distance from one crest or the next.

458
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:08.080
Now suppose the source is moving to the right at a certain speed.

459
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:11.260
You use the speed of the source.

460
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

461
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:17.350
<v 0>So what does the pattern look like?</v>

462
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.310
It's not too hard to visualize that having limited at one crest,

463
00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.960
it's moved to the right before image,
the second crest.
So the pattern,

464
00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:31.500
we'd get crunched in the forward direction like this.

465
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.750
So the waves will get squashed because the spacing would have been lambda,

466
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.050
but now it's less than lambda because it's moved to the right to emet.

467
00:31:46.051 --> 00:31:48.330
The second crest,
the spacing from crest to crest,

468
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.570
the new lambda we take called lambda prime,

469
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.760
little bit lambda minus the distance.
The source travels in that time.

470
00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.760
The time it takes to him at one more both.
That is the time period.

471
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.920
So let me write it as lambda minus you would f

472
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:10.953
<v 1>yes.
Yeah.</v>

473
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.460
<v 0>T is one over f.</v>

474
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.180
So what does the new frequency that I will hear the new frequency,

475
00:32:18.181 --> 00:32:20.790
I would hear it with the velocity divided by the new wavelength.

476
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:26.731
By the way,

477
00:32:26.731 --> 00:32:29.400
you got to understand that even though the sources moving to the right,

478
00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.190
the velocity of sound is not altered by that process.

479
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.560
A moving truck does not emit sound at an increased speed in the forward

480
00:32:37.561 --> 00:32:38.520
direction or decrease.

481
00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:41.270
The speed of sound is controlled by the medium in which it travels.

482
00:32:41.271 --> 00:32:42.230
The medium is air.

483
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.910
It's going to travel only at that speed so you don't have a new velocity when

484
00:32:46.911 --> 00:32:50.880
the thing begins to move.
But of these,
the same in address,

485
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:52.250
as long as the ad is not moving.

486
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:57.020
So let's write it as v or lambda minus you or what?

487
00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:00.500
F multiplied top and bottom by f.

488
00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.380
So we write it as f time something which is v divided by lambda,

489
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:09.080
f minus U.

490
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:14.750
And we fiddled with that and write it as B divided by B minus you because

491
00:33:14.751 --> 00:33:18.620
lambda,
FSV and white,
top and bottom by B.

492
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:21.830
This is something you will find in every possible textbooks.

493
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.520
I don't want to take too long to go over the details.

494
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.690
The main trick isn't writing this equation.
Once you got this,

495
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.510
the rest of it,
it just uh,
Algebra.

496
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.400
The point is to realize that the waves get crunch because when you emit the

497
00:33:37.401 --> 00:33:41.840
crest and you rush towards that crest and Emmett,
the second crest,

498
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:47.000
you've reduced the spacing by your velocity multiplied by the time between

499
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.270
certain emissions,
which is the time of vibration of the siren.

500
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.360
So this is the formula.

501
00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:58.160
The frequency is the normal frequency divided by one minus something.

502
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.760
So one minus something is less than one.

503
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:06.761
So the frequency will go up if you want to see what happens here behind the

504
00:34:07.701 --> 00:34:08.534
thing,

505
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.990
you have the option of doing the same calculation behind and I think it's very

506
00:34:11.991 --> 00:34:15.680
obvious what will you will find.
You will get one plus something.

507
00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.870
So we'll write both solutions minus or plus.
In one case,

508
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:24.200
the frequency will be increased.
Other cases the frequency will be decreased.

509
00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:28.410
So one way to think about it is if the source is coming towards you,

510
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.930
use the minus sign.
If the source is going away from you,
you use the plus sign,

511
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.200
but you should know intuitively at least what signed to pick.

512
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.020
You got to know if the sources coming towards you,

513
00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:42.260
the frequency will go up and was going away from you.
It'll go down.

514
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.930
So you pick the signed using that common sense.

515
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:48.050
Somebody had a question in the back.
Yes.

516
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.740
Ah,
relativistic speeds.
A lot of things happen.
That's correct.

517
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:56.110
When you are handled light,

518
00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.940
you've got to be very careful the last year of lady with the velocity of light.

519
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.450
But the frequency will change for many reasons.
First of all,

520
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:07.070
the ambulance clock and your clock no longer agree.

521
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.120
So that is something called a transfer as doppler shift to where even if it's

522
00:35:11.121 --> 00:35:14.510
not coming towards you or going away from you,
but it's going in a circle,

523
00:35:14.511 --> 00:35:17.240
you're sitting in the middle,
it's going tangentially,

524
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.160
so it's not coming towards you or away from you.

525
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:20.660
You will still feel a doppler shift.

526
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.780
That's because it's a moving clock and therefore it'll slow down.

527
00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.180
So relativistic problems are more complicated.
Yes.

528
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.820
Okay.
Sonic boom comes in in the following thing.

529
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:36.080
F prime is f divided by one minus you Overbey.

530
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.860
Let me embellish.
Formula Writing,
user base.
But s means source.

531
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.670
Okay.
When the sources moving,
this is the formula in relativity.

532
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.130
It was chocked full of formulas like this,

533
00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.060
but we never worried about what happens.

534
00:35:53.061 --> 00:35:57.040
So the denominator vanishes because you just cannot approach the speed of light.

535
00:35:57.250 --> 00:35:58.780
You can approach it,
but he cannot reach it.

536
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.140
But the speed of sound is not a upper limit at all.

537
00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.830
And you can have an ambulance or a plane that eventually travels faster than

538
00:36:05.831 --> 00:36:10.070
this.
So that's when imagine the waves getting crimes.

539
00:36:10.071 --> 00:36:13.920
Still all the crests that pilot right on top of each other and that's when that

540
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:17.080
is the sonic boom.
And if you go faster than that,

541
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.460
the way the wave led sandwiches from you so that you leave behind a trail,

542
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.570
there's nothing in front of you.

543
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.630
So if a jet plane is coming towards you faster than the speed of sound,

544
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.990
you won't have time to get out of the way because it'll hit you before the sound

545
00:36:30.991 --> 00:36:35.590
waves hit you.
Okay,
so sound is not the absolute limit.

546
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:39.220
So that are possibilities of,
I mean every time you would go into Concord,

547
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.740
well not anymore,
but when you did a,

548
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.580
you would be crossing this thing pretty soon after takeoff because you go

549
00:36:45.581 --> 00:36:50.260
several times faster than the speed of sound.
Okay.

550
00:36:50.261 --> 00:36:55.261
The last doppler thing I want to do is the opposite one where the Seitan is

551
00:36:55.871 --> 00:37:00.220
everything nice spherical waves,
but you are rushing to meet the site.

552
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.690
You are going with the speed,
you've sub observer.

553
00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:10.780
Then what happens?
So let's see what to do.

554
00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:14.470
What's the frequency at which you will see Kress?

555
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.610
If you sat there and did nothing,
you will see them at the normal frequency.

556
00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.690
But now you are
these waves that space,

557
00:37:24.691 --> 00:37:25.990
the distance lambda apart.

558
00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.560
But your velocity villa to the sound is now usually zero plus B.

559
00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.950
Your relative velocity sound is moving to the right.
You are moving to the left.

560
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.770
So let's back with these crests.
You're zipping at a speed,

561
00:37:38.771 --> 00:37:42.880
you're not plus v and the crest of spaced at distance lambda a partner.

562
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.680
There's nothing wrong with the spacing between them.

563
00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.890
They are just like shown here.
You were just rushing to meet them.

564
00:37:47.891 --> 00:37:52.180
Now from your side.
So how many will you intercept in a second is this,

565
00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:54.130
this is the relative speed and that's lambda.

566
00:37:55.450 --> 00:38:00.450
So let's write it as a not plus B.

567
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.870
Lambda is equal to B divided by F's.

568
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:08.890
I'll bring the f upstairs and that you can write us f times one plus you

569
00:38:11.441 --> 00:38:13.450
observer over v.

570
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.020
So when you move towards the source,

571
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.540
the correction factors appears in the numerator.

572
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:27.020
When the source moves towards your correction factor appears the denominator,

573
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:31.010
right?
You got to use common sense disease that blesses it,
minus and so on.

574
00:38:31.011 --> 00:38:33.110
It's pretty obvious if you're rushing to meet the waves,

575
00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:35.740
it's plus if running it from the waves minus,

576
00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:40.750
then you can go on and on and ask what happens if you are moving and the

577
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:43.870
ambulance is also moving,
then you can come by and the formulas.

578
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:45.790
But I don't want to do that.
That's not,

579
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.120
that's not the whole course dedicated to theory of sound.

580
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:53.440
But this is just to tell you how to reason in the two special cases,

581
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.450
source moving and observer moving.

582
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.511
Okay,

583
00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:03.511
so now the rest of the class is going to be uh,

584
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.730
focused on one essential property of wave.

585
00:39:07.731 --> 00:39:11.230
So the whole time I'm going to do this is one important property of waves that

586
00:39:11.231 --> 00:39:13.090
have to do with interference.
A waves.

587
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:20.290
Look at the wave equation I wrote down.
It's a linear equation.
You see that?

588
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:24.730
Don't be fooled by this d two side.
That doesn't make a quadratic.

589
00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:29.380
The first part of Cy on both sides.
Then do the following exercise in your mind.

590
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:34.420
Sight one is the solution,
side two is a solution.
Add the two equations,

591
00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:36.880
you can check the site one plus it was also a solution.

592
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.700
So these waves also have the property that what that really means is the

593
00:39:42.701 --> 00:39:45.550
following.
If you make some sound and you're sending some waves,

594
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.160
they make a certain pattern that travel through space.

595
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.950
Then I turn you off and I turn on another speaker here.
Let's say the speaker,

596
00:39:52.951 --> 00:39:53.784
it makes us sound.

597
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.030
If the you and the speaker are making sound at the same time,

598
00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.010
then the air displacement where I am will be simply the sum of the two.

599
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.350
So if one caused the one effect,

600
00:40:07.351 --> 00:40:10.760
the second cause pretty the second effect then bought that turned on the way of

601
00:40:10.761 --> 00:40:12.200
their produce would simply be the sun.

602
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.730
You can simply add them because that respects the satisfies the wave equation.

603
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.080
So all I'm going to do from now until end is tick,

604
00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.320
but of situations where I'm going to be adding two waves,

605
00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:30.260
the simplest problem is the following up because certain spot

606
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:35.810
you just sit there and listen to two waves so you're not going to look at the

607
00:40:35.811 --> 00:40:38.360
wave as a function of space.
It's function of time.

608
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.060
Somebody is making the waves and sending them to you.

609
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:46.540
The first wave looks like psy one equal to AA because Omega one t that's the

610
00:40:48.981 --> 00:40:53.110
second source of sound which is a cost or may got to tea.

611
00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:58.820
I've chosen the two to have the same amplitude but not necessarily the same

612
00:40:58.821 --> 00:40:59.654
frequency.

613
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.840
You want to add these two and you want to see what you hear

614
00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:12.820
so what you will hear will be site one plus side too which will be a cost Omega

615
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.270
t plus cause Omega to t.

616
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:19.683
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

617
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:23.980
<v 0>no you can do the trigonometry identities and figured out what had happened but</v>

618
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:26.210
you have to think a little bit about what's going to happen.

619
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:32.570
Think about these two waves.
If they have the same frequency,

620
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.100
it's trivial,
right?
If they'll make out,

621
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:40.070
one is equal to Omega to cy is equal to a cause Omega t but omega is a common

622
00:41:40.071 --> 00:41:44.600
frequency that that just means they reinforce each other at every instant.

623
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:49.630
You get double what you got before but if the frequency is not equal then

624
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.460
initially they are in step.

625
00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:56.960
This question is one that goes sign is one at the amplitude as two way as time

626
00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:57.794
goes by.

627
00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:03.190
Omega one t and Omega to t start deferring to the core science or not in step

628
00:42:03.651 --> 00:42:06.320
anymore and what can happen after a wireless.

629
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.890
The two questions are offset behalf of cycle are the angle between them as pie.

630
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.180
Then in fact they will cancel.

631
00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.400
Then if you wait long enough again,
they will be in step.

632
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.350
One way to think about is imagine two runners going around in a track.

633
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.920
If they have slightly different speeds,
they start out together,

634
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.510
they go out on one start,

635
00:42:29.511 --> 00:42:33.230
lagging behind the other and they will be on different parts of the circle and

636
00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:36.950
the time will come and that an opposite parts of the circle when the opposite

637
00:42:36.951 --> 00:42:37.850
parts of the circle,

638
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:41.930
the angular difference between them is pie and that's when we say they cancel.

639
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:43.640
If you wait long enough,

640
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.200
they'll again lineup but with one difference one guy would have done one more

641
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:50.910
evolution than the other.
Then again,
they will be in a,

642
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.950
in a in step and all this stuff.
That's what you expect the formula to give you.

643
00:42:55.340 --> 00:43:00.050
So you got to go back and use the turn on magic formula and the answer it is to

644
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:05.110
a call sign or may go one minus Omega to forward food times.

645
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:11.051
T famous quote is sine Omega one less Omega to for two times thi this is a cost

646
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:19.061
a minus cost be is to cause a plus B over to cause a minus B over two.

647
00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.130
All right,
so we are interested in the case,
but Omega one

648
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:31.590
is very nearly equal to Omega to
so two frequencies,

649
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.180
a very close,
typical situation.
Do you have a piano tuner?

650
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.790
Piano tuner hits their fork.

651
00:43:36.791 --> 00:43:41.791
It vibrates on a frequency maybe for 40 hertz and then a European or slightly

652
00:43:42.771 --> 00:43:47.510
off.
Maybe it's four 39 what sound do you hear when you put them together?

653
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.230
Well,
let's look at this if we'll make that one.

654
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:53.270
Minus Omega too is a very small number.

655
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.110
This course sign here is changing very,
very slowly.

656
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.650
This goes scientists oscillating at roughly the,

657
00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.240
it's aspirating the average of the two frequencies.
So one was four oh one

658
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:11.690
and one was three 99 this is Austin eating at 400 but here Omega one lane is

659
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:16.691
Omega to is two divided by two is one so it's oscillating much slower.

660
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:20.960
So what will you get if you plot this?

661
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.880
Think of the whole thing as an amplitude,
the slowly varying with time.

662
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.603
<v 2>Okay,</v>

663
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:33.870
<v 0>so we have done it the other day when I wrote either the minus gamma t over two</v>

664
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:38.040
times some cosine Omega t.
This is an envelope.
The controls the amplitude.

665
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.750
That day it was falling monotonically but he had a little oscillate very slowly.

666
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.800
So let me apply this course sign here.
This is just the amplitude,

667
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.430
but would that amplitude,
this guy's oscillating like crazy.

668
00:44:50.431 --> 00:44:54.930
So what I do mean to convey is that you will have oscillations like this.

669
00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.290
So it'll be loud,
silent,
loud,
silent,
loud silence.

670
00:45:06.291 --> 00:45:09.470
So you will hear another beat.

671
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:13.580
This is called the beat in which you will hear the hum in which together they

672
00:45:13.581 --> 00:45:15.380
add and cancel and cancel.

673
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.920
And we want to calculate the beat frequency.

674
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.480
Now the first guest is to say the frequency of the beat.

675
00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:29.050
There's Omega one minus Omega to over two because that's what seems to be here,

676
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:35.270
but actually the correct answer is the beat frequency is simply omega one minus

677
00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:40.271
one may get to and I will tell you why I take will the zero when the co sign had

678
00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:43.370
a value one you've got an amplitude to a

679
00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.200
wait til omega one minus Omega two over two

680
00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.590
is not equal to two pi but equal to Pi.
I'm in time Steve.

681
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:58.160
This whole combination is equal to Pi.

682
00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.370
This number becomes a negative number of size to a,

683
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.980
that just means it's here.

684
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.620
But if you multiply that huge negative number by the cost side,

685
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:11.300
it is still isolating very wildly here as much as it is here.

686
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:13.363
In other words,

687
00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.420
five course and Omega t and minus five courses and I get you have the same

688
00:46:17.421 --> 00:46:18.254
amplitude.

689
00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.730
The minus doesn't change the fact that it's having large excursions from plus to

690
00:46:22.731 --> 00:46:24.950
minus five so in other words,

691
00:46:24.951 --> 00:46:29.951
I'm telling you to compare some answer like this because 400 t minus five

692
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.230
because 400 t

693
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:39.140
plug this in plug that you'll find your 400 is a very rapid oscillations.

694
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:43.430
This has an amplitude as big as this one and the year is just picking up the

695
00:46:43.431 --> 00:46:46.430
amplitude yet it's not picking up anything else yet.

696
00:46:46.431 --> 00:46:48.110
It's just picking up the loudness of the sound.

697
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.320
So it will seem to be loud now and load there.

698
00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.960
But once you've gone from here to here,

699
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:58.340
you only have to change the argument of this whole thing by Pi and not by two
Pi.

700
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.610
That's why the beat frequency then happens to be simply the difference in

701
00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:05.444
frequencies.

702
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:11.500
All I ask you to do another take.
If you're not happy with this,

703
00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:12.850
go home and do the following thing.

704
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:18.570
Why does vibrating at Omega one the other is vibrating at Omega to t find out

705
00:47:18.701 --> 00:47:22.690
when the difference between the phase angles is equal to Pi.

706
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.370
Cause that's when this guy and that guy will cancel each other.

707
00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:29.080
That's when you come here.

708
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.280
Then you ask yourself when they will come back to where they are.

709
00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:37.720
Two point ask for when the difference in phases two Pi and you will find that

710
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:40.120
that occurs that the frequency,
which is what I told you,

711
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.160
so whether you,
you can,
if you found this factor of too confusing,

712
00:47:46.161 --> 00:47:50.750
you got to understand the argument they gave you that in order for this thing to

713
00:47:50.751 --> 00:47:53.120
sound just as loud as it did or t equals zero,

714
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:57.410
it's not necessary that this number come to to a good enough if it comes to

715
00:47:57.411 --> 00:48:00.920
minus two way because minus two wait times of rapid course sign,

716
00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.850
it's oscillating on top of their mind is to Alonso look like plus two you cannot

717
00:48:04.851 --> 00:48:09.080
tell the difference.
So beat frequencies that used to tune instruments.

718
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:15.010
So what the piano tuner does is to strike the fork and strike the thing on the

719
00:48:15.501 --> 00:48:18.640
piano and listened to the two.
If they are not quite mast,

720
00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:21.680
you'll hear a slow harm that goes up and down in intensity.

721
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:24.260
You keep on fiddling with it until it goes away.

722
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:27.050
That's when you match the two frequencies,

723
00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:33.110
so beat frequencies of a lot of interesting applications in physics.
In fact,

724
00:48:33.111 --> 00:48:36.200
when you go to a radio station,
you know this station is what,

725
00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:39.770
nine 60 megahertz or something?
No Way.
Your ears can hear that.

726
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.240
That's not the frequency of the sound.

727
00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:46.070
That's the frequency of the signal that called the cadion wave.

728
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.060
Then you modulate with that but something and you produce some beaters,

729
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.450
the beads that we are able to hear.

730
00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:52.860
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

731
00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:56.700
<v 0>Anyway,
this is something fairly simple trigonometry problem.</v>

732
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:01.590
Now I will do slightly more complicated problem,

733
00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.970
but I'm going to add two waves and we'll do a lot more of this in the next term,

734
00:49:05.971 --> 00:49:09.630
but right now you're supposed to have first pass at this topic.

735
00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:15.150
This is called the double slit experiment.
You have a source of waves here.

736
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:16.583
So

737
00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:22.050
the source is so far away that you can treat this to be just parallel lines and

738
00:49:22.051 --> 00:49:26.280
you hit the double slit,
namely an impenetrable barrier with two holes in it.

739
00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:31.540
If you want to think of it as water waves and the erector the wall on the arrest

740
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:35.280
state,
but there are two holes.
So you know what happen,
right?

741
00:49:35.281 --> 00:49:38.790
These two holes for themselves start generating their own waves

742
00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:44.430
and you want to stand on the line here,
go up and down with an ask.

743
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.310
What's the water doing where I am?
So first,

744
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:53.311
take a point exactly midway between these two points.

745
00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.013
What are you getting?

746
00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.350
You're getting a signal from here and you're getting a signal from here.

747
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:04.630
Once signal travels that way are the troubles that,

748
00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.870
do you understand that because you're symmetric located,

749
00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:13.260
the two signals will be in step when they come to you

750
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.540
because they were on step when this front hit this double haul and started

751
00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:23.480
making his own way of.
So these waves emitted in step,

752
00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.470
they march along and come to you without at the same delay.

753
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:29.990
So when a crest from this reaches your crest,

754
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:33.530
from that retreat you drafted Rita's draft Rita.
So you just double the answer.

755
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.700
So here you will get a site will become to sy,
are able to become to a,

756
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.370
you've had an amply today from this and a from this you will get to eight here.

757
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:48.530
So the water will be very choppy there.
If you're living on a little board,

758
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:50.960
the board would rock up and down with amplitude to a,

759
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:56.490
if you shut off this whole ambulatory to go back to just that from one hole lady

760
00:50:56.491 --> 00:51:00.950
be a two gives you two way.
That's what makes a lot of common sense.

761
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.200
But pick another point here.

762
00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:09.020
I will tell you how to pick that point so that these two lengths are not equal.

763
00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:14.550
So let's call that length l one and l two suppose l one minus l two is half a

764
00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:20.070
wavelength.
As you know,

765
00:51:20.071 --> 00:51:21.810
between every two crests,

766
00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.060
that is a trough where the function is minus the amplitude at the crest of

767
00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:27.210
secular plus the amplitude.

768
00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:32.250
So if found half a wavelength apart when a crest from here appears at trough

769
00:51:32.251 --> 00:51:33.140
from here will appear,

770
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:36.030
but a Trump for him here appears across from here will appear.

771
00:51:36.031 --> 00:51:40.200
In fact in every instance,
whatever comes here minus of that will come here.

772
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:46.740
Let us understand why the way the way it travels is two pi x over lambda,

773
00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:54.560
but x say measure from here for the other guy it is two pi times x prime over

774
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:56.470
lambda.

775
00:51:56.470 --> 00:52:01.470
Explain experiment that link if that link is longer than this by lambda over

776
00:52:01.591 --> 00:52:02.424
two.

777
00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:03.413
<v 1>Okay,</v>

778
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.880
<v 0>if this is x plus lambda over two,</v>

779
00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:12.540
look what you're getting extra two Pi Times lambda over two divided by lambda is

780
00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:18.151
really costly enough Pi plus what the other person got.

781
00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:24.940
But court Santa Pie added to eat pie added to anything changes the cost center

782
00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:25.803
minus itself.

783
00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:30.210
So the way to think about it as when you're half a wavelength behind coming from

784
00:52:30.211 --> 00:52:32.280
here,
whatever.
This one does this,

785
00:52:32.281 --> 00:52:36.810
this minus of that because shifting by half a wavelength is adding a pie to the

786
00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.490
coastline.

787
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:40.470
I think apply the coastline changes to do minus its value at every instant.

788
00:52:41.310 --> 00:52:44.490
Not only does Crestcom a traffic traffic comes with crest.

789
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.630
Every possible displacement comes to the minus of that from here and you get

790
00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:52.980
nothing here.
So this is called an interference minimum.

791
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:55.500
Odd.

792
00:52:55.500 --> 00:53:00.390
We say here the interference is constructive and here to say the interference of

793
00:53:00.391 --> 00:53:01.224
destructors.

794
00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:02.853
<v 1>Yes.</v>

795
00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.900
<v 0>How will you find the point of destructive interference?</v>

796
00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:11.810
It's a matter of simple geometry.

797
00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:15.260
You measured that length and you mentioned that length.

798
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:18.260
Take the difference instead of equal the lambda over two

799
00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.430
that's the first destructive interference.

800
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:26.190
That's a very interesting point to sit and look water.
It's telling you,

801
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:30.300
it says if you sit here with your board and the board won't move at all,

802
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:35.160
even though that our two holes letting waves and at that point that's the

803
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:37.050
principle behind noise cancellation.

804
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.400
You can actually cancel one sound with another sound if you bring the second

805
00:53:41.401 --> 00:53:43.440
sound off behalf of cycle

806
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:50.660
so that if you had only one hole in the wall that you build between your little

807
00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:54.510
estate and the beach and the way it is from here to rocking the board,

808
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:59.070
miraculously putting a second hole at the right place can actually calm the

809
00:53:59.071 --> 00:54:03.690
waters where you are
and diminish somebody's blocks.

810
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:06.930
One of these halls,
water,
we get choppy again where you are,

811
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.360
it's the property of waves.

812
00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.350
The two waves can lead to nothing but one way of cannot because two waves have a

813
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:15.390
chance of working against each other and canceling.

814
00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:21.090
This is something you got to get very straight.
Now if I go further up here

815
00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.910
to like reach a point where the difference in those two lengths is the full

816
00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:31.290
wavelength,
then I'm back to being instead.

817
00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:37.410
Of course the full wavelength means that these are not doing the same length,

818
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:41.130
but this is different from that by a whole wavelength.

819
00:54:41.131 --> 00:54:44.460
That means when the 13th way from here arrives,

820
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.940
the 14th of the 12th from here will arrive,
but we don't care.

821
00:54:47.941 --> 00:54:52.230
As long as the crest comes to the crest will be happy where we are.

822
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:57.330
So things get start with constructive,
destructive,
constructive,
destructive.

823
00:54:57.331 --> 00:55:01.530
It oscillates both above and below the midpoint.
Yes,

824
00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:03.053
yes.

825
00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.440
<v 2>How is the amplitude of the waves?</v>

826
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:13.670
<v 0>It could be it need not be the same.
It all depends on the aperture and so on.</v>

827
00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:17.870
But what is clear by symmetry is that these two have the same amplitude.

828
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:19.551
In practice,

829
00:55:19.551 --> 00:55:22.730
we believe the amplitude will also be the same because amplitude has to be

830
00:55:22.731 --> 00:55:24.260
continuous.
When you go through a slit,

831
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.220
the water cannot be jumping up to it just before the slit and suddenly on the

832
00:55:28.221 --> 00:55:31.850
other side jump to a different lengths.
Amplitude is always continuous,

833
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:35.750
so in fact,
this amplitude in that amplitude will be equal.

834
00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:42.230
You can also see from the wave equation,
if the site was not continuous,

835
00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:43.760
this IDX will be infinity.

836
00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.500
There's no room for any infinities in equation to Cybil you continuous.
In fact,

837
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:52.040
yes.
Here.

838
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:57.260
You're not able to read this equation because it's very badly written.

839
00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:02.380
Let me tell you what I tried to do cause sine two pi x over lambda,

840
00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.130
let's pick a certain time so that I've done.
We're able to make a tea.

841
00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:08.781
In fact,

842
00:56:08.781 --> 00:56:13.781
let me write it as l one the other one is cause sine two pi l two over lambda.

843
00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:19.520
I'm adding two waves.

844
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:24.400
Suppose l two is equal to l one plus half a wavelength.

845
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.970
Then this one becomes a score sine two pi l one over lambda plus Pi.

846
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.053
<v 1>Yes,</v>

847
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.570
<v 0>right.
L Two is l one plus lambda over two.
This is the l one.</v>

848
00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.900
If you put a lambo over two times to play with lambda,
you get a pie.

849
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:44.650
Then you got to understand that whenever he had applied to of course sign,

850
00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.110
you get minus the cost side without the fine

851
00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:53.410
and you can see this guy is producing a signal which exactly the minus of that

852
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:54.244
guy.

853
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:59.380
I did this at t equals zero but you can put an Omega t the boat,

854
00:56:59.410 --> 00:57:00.340
but nothing changes.

855
00:57:00.341 --> 00:57:04.120
The fact that when you subtract the same Omega t from the two,

856
00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:07.180
it doesn't change anything,
so I didn't worry about the time.

857
00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.030
It's the spatial mismatch.
That's the problem here.

858
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:14.751
Okay?
Now,

859
00:57:14.751 --> 00:57:18.650
sometimes people write this formula for destructive and conscious constructive

860
00:57:18.651 --> 00:57:23.630
interference as follows.
That's an approximate formula.

861
00:57:23.631 --> 00:57:27.080
That's very handy.
The correct way to do this.
Of course,

862
00:57:27.081 --> 00:57:31.160
the simply measure that distance and that distance and take the difference.
Okay?

863
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:37.260
In other words of l one minus l two is equal to m lambda,

864
00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:41.120
but I miss an integer.
One,
two,

865
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:44.030
etc. Plus minus one plus minus two

866
00:57:45.590 --> 00:57:49.320
it is constructive.
If it's a happened with you,

867
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:54.110
which we like to denote as follows and plus half lambda again and make,

868
00:57:54.111 --> 00:57:57.340
we'll lose zero plus minus one.
Is that right?
A destructive

869
00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.680
that we have writing Ms. Usually the standard symbol people use for integers Mnn

870
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.750
are common symbols for integers,
so if the PAP differences,

871
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:11.000
an integer multiple of lambda,
it's harmless.

872
00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:14.540
If it happened to their multiple of lambda,
it's harmful,

873
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:16.670
meaning destructive.

874
00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:21.980
The whole approximation has to do with what does l one minus l two one is to

875
00:58:21.981 --> 00:58:26.050
actually measure these lengths.
Exactly and using Pythagoras Theorem,
uh,

876
00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.830
given the distance between the slits given the distance to the screen,

877
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:36.410
if that business is d one can do the math and calculate it,

878
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:41.120
but here is what people do.
They say imagine this screen is very,
very far away,

879
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:47.060
very far away so that the rays leaving this or actually parallel because they

880
00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:49.100
admitted infinity and that's where your screeners,

881
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:52.940
it's not really an infinity but part enough for this purpose.

882
00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:58.570
Then you can tell very easily that the extra length traveled by this way,

883
00:58:59.151 --> 00:59:03.320
it was just this part here.
You see that cause this part cancels out,

884
00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.250
so drop a perpendicular here.
Those two are equal in length going got infinity.

885
00:59:07.251 --> 00:59:08.300
That's the extra section.

886
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:14.080
How long is the extra section with that is the distance between the slits.

887
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:18.640
If that angle is data here,
then we say these scientists

888
00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:23.180
is equal l one minus l two,

889
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:29.170
and that's what you want to be that an lambda are mplus one half lambda for

890
00:59:29.601 --> 00:59:30.710
constructive and destructive.

891
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:35.510
But that's a way to relate this data here to this direction.

892
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:39.520
They are the same angle.
Oh,

893
00:59:39.521 --> 00:59:43.240
you might want to go look at your book where the graphics are better than mine,

894
00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:47.140
but I'm telling you the same old trick we use from incline planes.

895
00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:51.040
If you've got two lines,
this line and this line,

896
00:59:51.041 --> 00:59:53.710
the angle between them is data than the perpendicular.

897
00:59:53.711 --> 00:59:57.940
The two lions have the same angle between the perpendicular to this line is this

898
00:59:57.941 --> 01:00:02.380
one and the perpendicular to the screen as a horizontal one.

899
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:03.820
So data is also that angle.

900
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:10.300
Therefore the way you will do any of these problems is suppose someone says find

901
01:00:10.301 --> 01:00:12.790
out when I get the first destructive interference,

902
01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:18.850
given that length to the screen and someone says,
how far should I move?

903
01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.190
What do you do is you said d is the distance between the two slits.

904
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:28.520
Scientists equal to say lambda over two for destructive solve for theta because

905
01:00:29.051 --> 01:00:31.690
d is known.
Scientific data is not known.

906
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:34.180
You wanted to be lambed over to lambda will be given to you.

907
01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.430
Once you get the angle,
you're basically telling the person to go at that angle.

908
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.420
And that's where the intensity will be a minimum.

909
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:49.300
But then it's trigonometry to understand the d over l is just Stan data.

910
01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:51.370
So if you knew theater,
you can find the over there.

911
01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.890
So Overdale is Stan data.

912
01:01:04.830 --> 01:01:08.900
So the problems you can get are either lambdas given to you and Ted,

913
01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:11.400
as we found that data is given to lambda has to be fought.

914
01:01:11.460 --> 01:01:14.430
Somebody can say in some experiment with waves,

915
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.670
I find the first minimum at that angle.
What's the wavelength?

916
01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.460
The distance between the slits is so and so.

917
01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.430
But the basic idea is really to find the path.

918
01:01:23.431 --> 01:01:27.680
Links take the difference Saturday equal to either integrate multiple and half

919
01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:30.780
and it did multiple other wavelength.
Okay,

920
01:01:30.781 --> 01:01:35.781
last of the interference problem has to do with all these musical instruments

921
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:40.740
and it goes like this.
Take a string.

922
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:46.850
Now there's a wall here and you start shaking it and ask what happens.

923
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.660
So let's say I shake it just once and a send a pulse like this,

924
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:55.830
moving to the right.
Well this pulse,

925
01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.480
by the time it gets to this place where the string is an is anchored and not

926
01:02:00.481 --> 01:02:05.420
free,
the more it cannot vibrate here,
so how was that going to happen?

927
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:10.930
Well some forces will be exerted on the string by the wall to make sure that the

928
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:13.960
signal the walls sends out along with a signal you send out,

929
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:18.060
add up to zero at the point of contact because nobody operation that is a lot.

930
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.390
The result of that instead of an a signal goes out like this,

931
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.680
it comes out reflected and direction and inverted entered sign.

932
01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.450
For those of you who want a more satisfactory proof of this,

933
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:38.840
let me say the following.
Suppose there was no wall.

934
01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:45.100
I saw you send a signal and I manufacture admitted image of that to the right.

935
01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.240
Traveling towards this point,

936
01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:54.000
the two are coming near each other and when they meet by design I've arranged it

937
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:58.040
so that this one or this one when they overlap are exactly opposite of each

938
01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:01.010
other,
so then they cancel each other at this point.

939
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.730
Then they go through each other and this will come out here.

940
01:03:04.731 --> 01:03:09.140
That'll go to the other side,
but throughout this encounter,
here's the punchline.

941
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:12.470
Throughout the encounter,
this point was not asked to move

942
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.700
because the two waves cancel.
That means even if I put my finger there,

943
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:21.180
it won't Mac make a difference to this problem because that point is not

944
01:03:21.181 --> 01:03:22.380
planning to move anyway.

945
01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.890
It also means that if you put a battery in here that doesn't,

946
01:03:25.891 --> 01:03:28.290
I love the string to move.
It doesn't change the outcome.

947
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:33.710
That's the reason we convince ourselves that incoming pullets this way comes out

948
01:03:33.711 --> 01:03:37.590
that way.
Okay.

949
01:03:37.591 --> 01:03:41.040
Now what I want to study,
it's not a single one shot pulse.

950
01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:44.200
The pulse that looks like this,
a cause.

951
01:03:44.201 --> 01:03:47.010
KX minus Omega t,

952
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:51.660
a continuous signal goes in.
How does it come out?

953
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:55.980
It comes out cause or mega t plus Kx,

954
01:03:56.940 --> 01:04:01.680
so I've reversed the amplitude and I would reverse the direction of motion.

955
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:03.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

956
01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.880
<v 0>This is the result of an incoming with and the one that sent back by the wall</v>

957
01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.540
together.
They coexist.
That goes into,
that comes out and together they form.

958
01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.860
What I will find in this region.

959
01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:19.090
I keep sending stuff to the wall while keeps sending that back to me and both

960
01:04:19.091 --> 01:04:19.924
exist,

961
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.430
but you got to do another trigonometry identity to show you that this is really

962
01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:28.360
to signed k x Sine Omega T.

963
01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.340
I don't want to go through the trigonometry identity,

964
01:04:33.341 --> 01:04:38.230
but what I want you to notice them is that the resulting physics looks like

965
01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:43.210
this.
Here is a wall
at at a given point x,
the amplitude,

966
01:04:43.211 --> 01:04:48.211
the stew is signed k x and it also led to the frequency Omega t and if you draw

967
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:50.380
signed k x,
it's going to look like this.

968
01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:53.973
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

969
01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:58.510
<v 0>so whenever Kx is equal to Pi,
it kicks equals Pi.</v>

970
01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.740
When that distance is lambda over to that is no vibration.

971
01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.000
There's is no vibration.
This is called a node in between us.
An antidote,

972
01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:11.500
this kind of thing will be set up all the way back.

973
01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:16.030
Now you'll see what that means,
so at this point is not going to vibrate.

974
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.680
If put another barrier here,
it won't make any difference

975
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:26.980
because that point is these two waves add up to zero identically.
At that point,

976
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.020
if you put your finger there,
it won't matter.

977
01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.960
So in addition to making a difference,

978
01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:34.690
if you hold the string that it also doesn't matter if you hold it here.

979
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.000
So what that means

980
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:42.640
is that if you turn the problem around and say,
look,

981
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.110
I give you the following problem,

982
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.710
I give you a string which is clamped or these two m's,

983
01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:50.260
what are the possible vibrations of the string?

984
01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:53.260
They have to look like the following.

985
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.400
Your string length has to be equal to that or that or any of these multiples.

986
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:01.330
That means what can happen in your string.

987
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:06.870
It's either that or it can do that or something with more and more lobes in it.

988
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.030
These are the allowed modes of vibration of the string fixed the two ends.

989
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:18.070
What I want to extract from this is what sound while you're here,

990
01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.970
what frequency will you here?
So you have,

991
01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:24.850
this is the family of problems that you guys had expected to do.

992
01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.940
So you have to think as follows.
That is the length.

993
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:32.830
How is the length related to the wavelength is all you got to figure out?

994
01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:36.160
Is it clear to you guys that this is half a wavelength?

995
01:06:37.210 --> 01:06:40.750
If you've got that you're home because you're saying half a wavelength is equal

996
01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:44.760
to l or the wavelength is equal to two l the frequencies,

997
01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:46.840
the velocity of sound divided by the wavelength,

998
01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.940
which is velocity divided by two l.

999
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:55.100
That's the frequency you will hear from this guy.
When it vibrates like this,

1000
01:06:55.101 --> 01:06:58.010
I think it's clear to you that it's gone through one full cycle here.

1001
01:06:58.450 --> 01:07:02.680
This is a lambda equal to l you to the whole thing.
You will find frequencies.

1002
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:07.640
Now v over l which is two times the lowest frequency which we did not buy,

1003
01:07:07.641 --> 01:07:10.250
f not,
which means the fundamental frequency

1004
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.350
to the bottom line is very simple.
A string clamped,

1005
01:07:18.351 --> 01:07:23.200
the two ends and as linked l can only vibrate in either the fundamental

1006
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:27.220
frequency or an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency and when it does

1007
01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:27.790
that,

1008
01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:31.130
the two ends of the string will be nodes and you can have any number of anti

1009
01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:34.250
notes in between provided you start with the node and end with the noise.

1010
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:38.020
Now this is also valid in the following problem.

1011
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:43.500
Take a tube clamp to both ends and that some longitudinal sound waves going back

1012
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:47.290
and forth.
This is a transfers waves on a string.

1013
01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.300
This is sound waves going back and forth.

1014
01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:53.650
You realize the sound waves going back and forth cannot go back and forth at

1015
01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:58.651
this wall or this wall that for the motion of the ad molecules has to have a

1016
01:07:58.841 --> 01:08:00.430
node here and has to have an old here.

1017
01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:05.790
So the possible modes of vibration for sound for also look exactly like this

1018
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:12.640
frequency.
This will be the same for vibrations on a tube close to two hands.

1019
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:17.960
The only certainty which I want you to forget here at the picture really talks

1020
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:20.090
about the string moving perpendicular to the length.

1021
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.660
This is not indicate here that the sound,

1022
01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:25.280
the air molecules are going up and down.

1023
01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:30.230
This is the amplitude for longitudinal vibration.
If this number is three inches,

1024
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:33.350
it made the molecules here,
I'm moving back and forth by three inches,

1025
01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.160
so be just out of habit.
Plot everything in the y axis.

1026
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.660
That doesn't mean the motion is in the y direction for longitudinal wave.

1027
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.970
The motion is side to side.
This is the extent of side to side motion.

1028
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:46.090
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1029
01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:49.300
<v 0>so the only problem where you may get stumped as the following one,</v>

1030
01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.330
I will tell you how to do that and then we're done.
Take it to

1031
01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.200
like this.
It's closed here and an open here.

1032
01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:03.010
Don't take a coke bottle or something and try to blow on it.

1033
01:09:03.011 --> 01:09:06.730
You hit a certain sound.
Why is it picking that one frequency?

1034
01:09:06.731 --> 01:09:10.540
That's what I want to understand now since I'm making the noise here,

1035
01:09:11.010 --> 01:09:14.800
here to spread the amplitude will be the biggest and of course that's not

1036
01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:18.610
nothing doing at this end because that's a wall which cannot go back and forth.

1037
01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.330
So what pattern can I draw?
Take a minute and think about it.

1038
01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:25.090
I want a maximum white British and he had nothing here.

1039
01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.910
The lowest one I can draw it looks like that.

1040
01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:33.960
The next one I can draw is constraint to have a maximum here and then a minimum

1041
01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:35.623
that end.

1042
01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.150
Now what is the relation of the length of that?
You put the wavelength.

1043
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:45.110
I think you can see the length of that.
You know,
quarter of a wavelength.

1044
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:48.890
You start from here to the top coming down as the other quarter.

1045
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:50.330
Then the other half is missing.

1046
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.320
So what's the frequency is equal to v over lambda?

1047
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.450
It's going to be four V over L.

1048
01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:04.180
I'm getting the frequency to be velocity divided by wavelength than I bet you

1049
01:10:04.181 --> 01:10:08.410
will get this or did they get it wrong?
Ah,
yes.
I'm sorry.

1050
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:12.700
Yes.
Be over four m four Ellis lambda.

1051
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.490
Now what's the answer to here?
What is the relation of the lanes to wavelength?

1052
01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:22.330
The length happens to be a half a cycle.

1053
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:25.330
Less than other quarter is three fourth of lambda.

1054
01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:27.530
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1055
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:28.490
<v 0>and the frequency,</v>

1056
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:33.380
if you do this will be three B over four l and this is all I want you to notice

1057
01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:38.480
that in this peculiar problem at one end is open in one end is closed.

1058
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:43.390
The frequency is a odd multiples of the fundamental frequency.
Three times that,

1059
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.200
five times that,
seven times there
and be in exams.

1060
01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.660
You can be asked,
but a depressant,

1061
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.340
either this one or some other exam you take some time later in life,

1062
01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:56.220
you should be able to do the,
let me do one practice thing,

1063
01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:01.440
hit us up tube open at both hands.
Draw me the lowest frequency you can draw.

1064
01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.560
I want an antidote here and Antinori here,

1065
01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:08.430
but between them I got to have a node so I have to look like that.

1066
01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:12.630
Then you can brew more complicated patterns at provided the two ends look like

1067
01:11:12.631 --> 01:11:17.190
this and I think you can see here that this is half a wavelength.

1068
01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:23.350
So Eliquis lambed over two and again you will find here all frequencies are

1069
01:11:23.351 --> 01:11:26.310
interested in multiples of the fundamental.
So the story is this,

1070
01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:30.120
as long as the two ramps are the same,
both open are both closed,

1071
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.600
all frequencies or integer multiples of the fundamental one.

1072
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:36.800
If you've got a funny situation,
one end is open one and disclosed,

1073
01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:40.080
you will get odd multiples of the fundamental why.

1074
01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:43.530
I think you may have to go do some reading in the book.

1075
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:47.640
I don't have a better way to explain this in the somewhat easier part of the

1076
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:51.540
course,
and I think you should try to be on top of this particular topic.
