The process of doing a design study helps the designer explore a space of

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.080
possibilities. Although aesthetics may play a role in the ultimate

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.850
decision process, other more objective factors should be examined as well.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.890
For buildings factors such as the cost of construction, availability of

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.420
building materials, conformance to building codes and zoning regulations and

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.050
effect of traffic on traffic patterns may be taken into account. For this class,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.730
we want to use design studies to evaluate the design of computer programs.
