Rejeev: Hello YouTube, this is my Davos question
and answer.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.309
I’m here to talk about respect.
As a race, our track record of respecting

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.849
 -- well, the human race itself, we don’t
respect much, but our track record of respecting

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.450
anything else that’s not human is pretty
poor, pretty pathetic.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.550
And a lot of the symptoms we see today, extensive
deforestation, all of the species that are

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.289
sort of going into extinction and climate
change are symptoms of this deeper malice

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:40.949
which is basically our inability to respect
the ecosystem that sustains and builds us.

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.089
Take meat eating as an industry for instance.
Everybody knows that for every gram of protein

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:53.570
that you derive for your body, if you do it
through meat, the amount of resources spent

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.050
is ten times the amount of resources you would
spend if you had – if you switched to a

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.329
vegetarian diet to get the same amount of
nutritional protein.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.480
The challenge is, we still continue to not
only persist in eating this, we are expanding

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.640
this.
Because if you look at what is happening in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.600
the emerging world right now, meat eating
as a practice is increasing, causing much

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.690
huge distress.
Ten times the amount of resources get consumed

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.090
for every gram of protein you receive through
meat.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.630
Is it really required?
Do you really need that?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.420
Don’t you want to think about the ecosystem?
I think we have to do something about it.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.570
And oh by the way, if you start to respect
the ecosystem, the probability is that we

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.020
will perhaps get a lot more out of this,
and a lot of the problems that we are confronted

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.840
with, things like climate change, things like
deforestation, things like species extinction,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.680
perhaps might be mitigated
and perhaps might go away and we might actually

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.820
start to learn to live in harmony.
Thank you very much, look forward to your

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.140
response.
