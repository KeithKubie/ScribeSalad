00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:02.921
- [Voiceover] Nightjars
possess a camouflage

00:00:02.921 --> 00:00:05.177
perhaps unparalleled in the bird world.

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:07.001
So I guess nightjars are birds.

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.776
By day they roost hidden in shady woods,

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:13.122
so blank with their
surroundings that they are

00:00:13.122 --> 00:00:15.541
nearly impossible to blank.

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.181
So before I even looked at the choices,

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.321
they're telling us that these
nightjars, which are birds,

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.427
they have a camouflage
unparalleled in the bird world.

00:00:24.427 --> 00:00:26.687
So they're really good mixing
in with their background.

00:00:26.687 --> 00:00:28.402
That's what camouflage means.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:32.245
By day they roost hidden
in shady woods, so--

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:33.751
And so, I would say something like

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.846
so mixed with their surroundings

00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:38.258
or maybe so blended
with their surroundings.

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.442
I'm not even looking at the choices yet.

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:42.137
So mixed or blended
with their surroundings

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:44.337
that they are nearly impossible to maybe

00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:49.337
find or pick out, find or pick out,

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.964
or maybe even impossible to

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:54.344
or they are nearly impossible to see.

00:00:54.344 --> 00:00:55.824
So those are the types of words

00:00:55.824 --> 00:00:58.196
that I would try to look
for for these blanks.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:00.227
And now let's look at the choices.

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:04.187
So this first choice, so
vexed with their surroundings

00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:06.927
that they are nearly
impossible to dislodge.

00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:09.787
So to be vexed with your--

00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:11.691
So that's kind of angry or annoyed

00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.077
or kind of worried or frustrated
with your surroundings.

00:01:15.077 --> 00:01:16.807
Now that doesn't make a lot of sense,

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:18.247
that the birds would be that way

00:01:18.247 --> 00:01:19.096
regarding their surroundings.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.807
So this is already starting to feel weird.

00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:23.867
And so vexed with their surroundings

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.108
that they are nearly
impossible to dislodge.

00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:27.447
Well that means that they're kind of

00:01:27.447 --> 00:01:28.717
so stuck into their surroundings

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:30.548
that you can't even pull
them out, if you wanted to.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.240
So this one is feeling very wrong.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.547
Let's read the next one.

00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:36.508
So blended with their surroundings,

00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:38.645
and that's actually the
actual word that I picked out,

00:01:38.645 --> 00:01:40.748
so blended with their surroundings

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:43.799
that they are nearly
impossible to discern.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.680
Well, discern really means to be able to

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.707
kind of pick something
out of its background,

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:48.890
to see it out of its background.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.491
So it's very similar in meaning

00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:53.059
to the words that I wanted to pick as is.

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:55.863
So this looks like the
choice that I would go.

00:01:55.863 --> 00:01:57.607
This looks already like the best choice,

00:01:57.607 --> 00:01:58.507
and we could read it.

00:01:58.507 --> 00:01:59.905
Nightjars possess a camouflage

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:02.567
perhaps unparalleled in the bird world.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.957
By day they roost hidden in shady woods,

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:08.027
so blended with their surroundings

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:11.236
that they are nearly
impossible to discern.

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.387
So that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:17.448
But let's verify that these
other ones aren't as good.

00:02:17.448 --> 00:02:20.039
So, so harmonized with their surroundings

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:23.307
that they are nearly
impossible to interrupt.

00:02:23.307 --> 00:02:26.427
So harmonize isn't a horrible word here.

00:02:26.427 --> 00:02:28.947
It kind of means in sync with something.

00:02:28.947 --> 00:02:32.054
So maybe they're harmonized
with their surroundings,

00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:34.194
but nearly impossible to interrupt.

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:35.887
What are we interrupting them doing?

00:02:35.887 --> 00:02:39.007
The interrupt especially is
what really makes choice C

00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:41.433
really not appropriate.

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:43.180
So impatient with their surroundings.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.470
So that already doesn't make sense.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.334
I don't even have to read the rest of it.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:47.707
So we could rule that out.

00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:50.734
Distinguish actually isn't a
bad word for the second blank.

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:52.967
That they are nearly
impossible to distinguish.

00:02:52.967 --> 00:02:55.727
That kind of has the same
type of meaning as discern

00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:59.496
or pick out or see,
relative to its background,

00:02:59.496 --> 00:03:02.603
but this impatient was
weird for this first blank.

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:04.034
So impatient with their surroundings?

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:07.727
That doesn't sound like how
we would talk about a bird,

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:09.753
a bird being impatient
with its surroundings.

00:03:09.753 --> 00:03:12.400
So integrated with its surroundings.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.947
So that's not bad.

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:16.514
That's kind of like
being mixed or blended.

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:19.618
Being integrated means kind
of so part of the surroundings

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:23.167
that they are nearly
impossible to classify.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:25.734
So classifying something means
you're really kind of seeing.

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:27.307
You're putting a label on it.

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:28.459
You're trying to see how it's different

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.043
or similar to other things.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:34.581
It's kind of like, it
has some connection to

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:37.947
being able to see something
or discern or find something,

00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:38.747
but it goes further.

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:40.407
You're not only discerning
it or seeing it,

00:03:40.407 --> 00:03:42.085
you're trying to kind
of put it into a bucket.

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:43.877
You're trying to classify it.

00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:47.038
So if I didn't have choice B here,

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:49.847
maybe I could somewhat argue for choice E,

00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:51.067
but the key to realize is

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:52.406
you need to pick the best choice.

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:56.547
So E is kind of a not horrible choice.

00:03:56.547 --> 00:03:57.962
It's still a little bit strange,

00:03:57.962 --> 00:03:59.670
but B is way, way better.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.907
So we could rule out E as well.
