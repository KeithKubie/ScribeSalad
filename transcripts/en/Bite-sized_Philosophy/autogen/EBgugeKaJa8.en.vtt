00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.260
 Student: Hi. Doctor Peterson. Mother . my question is 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.040
 I know you mentioned in a lecture uh last that the importance of setting goals in life 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.540
 Physician Peterson: Architect 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.500
 Student: Um, to kind of goals to work towards, right? 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.160
 So my question was: how do you do it, if you do not know where you want to go? 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.420
 Because, this is kind of where you suspended your authoring program in the future, because ... 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.340
 Doctor: Well, that's a good question, that's a really good question. Mother ... 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.720
 I think it is echoed to some extent, in the structure of biblical stories, in this way. 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.120
 So the idea in the Old Testament is that morality follows a series of taboos. 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.880
 There are a bunch of bad things you do not have to do, and then basically good. 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.140
 I think there is wisdom in it, I think this kind of children start, right? You are- 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.920
 I mean, I love children and all, but they are crazy little creatures, and they must be, united. 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.780
 Well, what you're doing is putting a ban on them. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.480
 Often what you are trying to do, is a prohibited ban on them, 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.940
 For behaviors that if manifest, will make their lives miserable. 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.720
 So, I have another chapter in this book I write, called "Do not let your kids do anything, that would make you hate them." 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.740
 The idea is there, that your job as a parent is ... 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 Help your children become a group of 4-year-olds, so that adults will smile honestly when they enter a room. 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.020
 Because that makes the whole social environment sincere and welcoming. 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.260
 Thus, your job is to make them desirable social objects. Much of that is a ban. 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.320
 Well, there is this moral shift. 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.620
 It happens, to some extent, in the tradition - in the prophetic tradition, 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.000
 Where there is a spirit that looks, in some sense, higher than the law. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 But there is a real shift between the Old and the New Testaments, 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.760
 Because the Old Testament is a prohibition, the New Testament is ... 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.040
 "Well, here are the good things you do, one more than just banning yourself from ..." from the rampant sin, let's say. 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.340
 There are good positives to be, ah, completed. 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.760
 Well, you might say, "Well, I do not know what a positive good is!" 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.160
 Just enough man oh! 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.720
 So ... for this reason, this thing that I said to people, this MIM has become through the Internet crazy, 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.020
 But this to clean your room and ... [public laughter] 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.500
 It is much more useful than people think! It's also much harder, but ... 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800
 The first thing you do, I think, 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.160
 I learned this part of Solzhenitsyn, was trying to settle his soul, when he was in the Gulag, 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.060
 Because he was trying to figure out how he got there. 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.580
 How they contributed, and how they got there. 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.080
 You know, not Stalin and Hitler, although they were blaming, you know, but ... 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.020
 He could not do much about it. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.240
 I think what you need to do, this part of modesty, 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.960
 Do you have to look around you, within your sphere of influence, 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.960
 Such as, direct impact sphere, repair objects that declare themselves as needing reform. 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.040
 These are often small things. 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.460
 You know, and can be, like ... your room. Put it in order! 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.240
 Because the thing is, it is not very important, that your room be arranged, though it is. 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.980
 What is important, is to learn, how to distinguish between chaos and order, 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.980
 And be able to act in a way that produces the system. 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.300
 In most homes, there are 100 things to do, 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.900
 Let us make it less terrible and terrible. 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.360
 Thus, the practice of this is a real beneficial form of meditation. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.720
 It is also - it is also ... I think it is a divine act, because you take chaos! 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.220
 You know, if you notice a room, it is very exciting. 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.960
 And I learned - because I've restored many places now, try to make them beautiful. 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.160
 One of the things I've really learned is that even if you have a structure, 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.740
 Unless you have investigated all corners and corners, cleaned and put your mark on it, 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.080
 And made it your kingdom - it is not your own. 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.340
 Just the fact that physical property does not make it yours! 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.020
 You must create a dynamic relationship with the objects, before they are actually yours. 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.220
 I think you can do something as simple as sitting on your bed and thinking: 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.840
 "Well, maybe there are 5 things I can do today, so ... 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.660
 Tomorrow morning a little better than this morning was, or at least I'm not lagging behind. " 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.340
 Usually it is ... like having to eat a frog in the morning, right? 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.960
 It's like, it will not be something you want to do, there will be things you are trying to avoid. 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.580
 They're snakes, basically. 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.220
 But if you ask yourself, just as you ask someone, I think it is a form of prayer, 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.400
 If you ask yourself instead of telling yourself, as you know, 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.260
 "What can I do, to set things right today, 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.080
 Will I actually do it? " 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.400
 It's usually a small thing, because you're not disciplined, you know. 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.740
 Then you can go to do it! 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.300
 And then, you ... put the world together a bit more, 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.160
 When you do this, this spreads, 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.360
 But you also put you also you adopt yourself in something, 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.720
 This is better able to call the system out of chaos. 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.900
 This makes you more and more powerful! 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.300
 The next day, maybe you can do a little bigger job! And... 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.740
 Like, you get the compound interest benefit, if you do, it's a very powerful technique. 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.580
 I think that if you do, at some point, rather than just fix things, that's not good; 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.200
 You will begin to get a glimmer of positive things you can do, 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.260
 Positive things you can do, which will actually form a vision. 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.220
 This is what I would recommend. 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.020
 Student: Thank you. 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.340
 Dr. Peterson: Well, good night. [clap]
