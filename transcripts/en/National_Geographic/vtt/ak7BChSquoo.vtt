00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.778 line:0%
I went to Tanzania
and I went to an area

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.481 line:0%
<i> in Tanzania near Lake Eyasi,
 where there's Hadza people.</i>

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.384 line:0%
<i> It is the oldest
 diet remaining on Earth.</i>

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:21.754 line:0%
<i> And the Hadza
 are about 1,300-1,500</i>

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:26.726
and out of these 1,500 there's
300 that are living a real...

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:29.495
last full-time
hunter-gatherer,

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:32.498
full-time meaning there's
no back-up option.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:35.235
There's no little bit of
agriculture-planting whatever.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.702
There's no herding
of something.

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:40.472
They live strictly off
hunting and gathering food.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:43.342
<i> Africa is,
 you know, difficult.</i>

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.278
<i> You need to
 coordinate everything.</i>

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.713
<i> I was going really
 deep in the bush</i>

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:49.181
<i> I need to have all the food
with me, all the water with me.</i>

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.084
And then I meet with the Hadza.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.019
And in front of me
these guys show up.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.187
( audience laughter )

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:56.389
<i> Band of brothers,
 you know, they are like "wow"</i>

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.525
<i> So they are 100 percent
 hunter-gatherer</i>

00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.192
<i> and they go
 around every day</i>

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.627
<i>looking for food every morning.</i>

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:05.398
<i> This guy is like this... what
 they like most is honey.</i>

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.300
<i> They gather a lot of it.</i>

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.169
<i> And to get honey they
 make fire first.</i>

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.671
<i> They don't have
 light or matches,</i>

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.072
<i> they don't have
 this stuff.</i>

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.374
<i> They live really
 self-sufficiently</i>

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.042
<i> in the bush, at
 least these guys.</i>

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.677
Some other guys, you know
there's other areas of Hadza

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:20.946
land where there is
more touristy area but

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:22.982
these guys were
really the real deal.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.385
They make fire, then
they smoke the beehive

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.120
<i> and then they get
 the honey in it.</i>

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.355
Some time there is a bird
called the Honeyguide.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.925
that would bring them to
the honey, to the beehive.

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.194
<i> And then they-- everybody
 is really excited.</i>

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.728
<i> They don't store stuff.
 They get too excited.</i>

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:36.829
<i> They get bitten,
 they get stung.</i>

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.031
<i> I got stung too.</i>

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.866
<i> These are killer bees so
 bit scary, you know...</i>

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.934
<i> Honey is incredible.</i>

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.069
<i> It's like the power-bar,
 the ultimate power-bar.</i>

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.571
<i>There's so much energy in this.</i>

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.340
<i> And on top of it
 they often eat it</i>

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.541
<i> like this
 straight with larva.</i>

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.443
<i> You can see the little white
 spot, these are larva.</i>

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.913
So you get this sweet and
sour mixture in your mouth.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.549
It's just-- you feel like
wow, this is so powerful.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.417
There's protein and there
is this incredible

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:00.053
amount of energy
coming into you.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.454
<i> They share it with
 the women there.</i>

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.756
<i> They sometime put
 some on the side</i>

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:04.957
<i> to bring to the
 elderly that's</i>

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:06.259
<i> their camp or their
 real babies.</i>

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.195
<i> But they eat everything on the
 spot more or less otherwise.</i>

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.897
<i> One thing I have to tell you
 right about the Hadza is</i>

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:14.266
<i> they smoke a lot of marijuana.</i>

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.501
( audience laughter )

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:20.473
<i> And so they trade this stuff
 and this is after they smoke.</i>

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.376
( Hadza man coughing )

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:35.721
( Hadza boys coughing )

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.557
( audience laughter )

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.999
This goes on for five minutes,
I had to cut it short.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.466
But then this goes
on like this.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.635
( audience laughter )

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.036
So, they do that,
you know, they

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.304
are really living
in the moment

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.473
it doesn't matter, you
know, it's just "whoo".

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:55.274
It's difficult for me
to coordinate things.

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:56.542
Can we do that in ten minutes?

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.145
"Ah, yeah, it's alright man.
Take it easy, yo!"

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.847
( audience laughter )

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.748
I had to kind of Zen-out.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:05.084
So, now you know in
what state they

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.319
<i> are when I am
 photographing them.</i>

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.520
<i> Just so you know.</i>

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:10.389
<i> That's Mokoa and
 his wife Wande.</i>

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.458
<i> And in the morning
 Mokoa goes hunting</i>

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.660
<i> and Wande goes foraging.</i>

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.395
<i> Often the woman
 looks for tubers.</i>

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.529
<i> There's this vine
 coming out of</i>

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.132
<i> the trees, they
 locate them, dig</i>

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:23.536
<i> they find the root, they cut
 out the root with a knife</i>

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.037
<i> and they keep the
 root, and then</i>

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:26.205
<i> it's a little bit
 like potato.</i>

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.808
When they move around
and they pass something edible

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.276
they will just grab food.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.743
And some time they
are looking straight

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:33.446
but they see food on the
corner of their eye,

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.047
and they just go like this.
It's quite amazing.

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:37.616
They just keep in movement but
eating, feeding themselves.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:41.053
This is "Kongolobe", it's a
special berry that grows there.

00:03:41.053 --> 00:03:43.121
<i> And then they go back
 to the watering hole</i>

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.325
<i> drink up and go back to camp.</i>

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.159
<i> Camp is these
 beautiful houses</i>

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.261
<i> that are like
 upside down nests.</i>

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.696
<i> The women always do them.</i>

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:53.432
<i> Inside, you know, it's
 quite beautiful at night.</i>

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.101
<i> This woman was cooking stork</i> .

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:57.870
<i> And outside the men are
 yapping and yapping</i>

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.338
<i> like they always do
 everywhere, anywhere.</i>

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.439
( audience laughter )

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.141
<i> And they are telling
 hunting stories.</i>

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.743
( speaking in Hadza )

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.769
( bees buzzing )

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:37.443
( speaking in Hadza )

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:54.060
( speaking in Hadza )

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:13.078
( birds chirping )

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:17.150
( speaking in Hadza )

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.556
Matthieu:<i> Mokoa goes in the
 morning hunting</i>

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:25.057
<i> and I follow him around.</i>

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:26.692
<i> They take all different
 kind of arrows.</i>

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.627
<i> There's the arrow for
 the bird, there's</i>

00:05:28.627 --> 00:05:30.429
<i> the poison arrow for
 the big animals,</i>

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.798
<i> there's the other one, you
 know, for medium animals.</i>

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:34.467
<i> And then there is
 the one on the right</i>

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.569
<i> to finish up
 a wounded animal.</i>

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.671
<i> They walk for hours, it's very
 hard, it's very exhausting</i> .

00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:42.040
<i> Some time they only get
 these tiny little birds.</i>

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.576
They don't get many animals.
It's quite rare.

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:45.912
There are animals but, you know

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.546
they are used to being hunted
for thousands and

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:49.715
thousands of years and they
hear you coming from so

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.284
far away and I
was with them.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.852
And you know, so it was
even extra challenging.

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:55.287
<i> The ancestors of the Hadza</i>

00:05:55.287 --> 00:05:57.823
<i> have been living in Hadza
 land for about 40,000 years.</i>

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.659
<i> That's what
 anthropology tells us.</i>

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:02.461
<i>It's incredible, they have left
no impact on their environment.</i>

00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:04.029
<i> So they go around
 with bow and arrows.</i>

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.631
<i> They often miss their target.</i>

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.732
<i> This is Kampala.</i>

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:09.301
<i> He had missed a...
 just a bird there.</i>

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:11.437
<i> And whenever there's a
 higher viewpoint like this</i>

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:14.607
<i> they climb up on top of
 trees to look for wildlife.</i>

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:16.642
They usually get up
early morning and

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:19.244
hunt until noon or
something like that.

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:21.413
<i> Below trees
 they make these blinds</i>

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:23.148
<i> to hunt from blinds.</i>

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:24.783
<i> They some time, they
 get stork, this</i>

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:26.852
<i> migratory bird that
 comes from Europe</i> .

00:06:26.852 --> 00:06:29.788
<i> The hunting process
 is very meditative.</i>

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.056
<i> You know, you're
 getting really into</i>

00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.859
<i> the rhythm because
 nobody talks.</i>

00:06:32.859 --> 00:06:34.694
They talk very quietly and
you walk and you walk.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:35.995
It's very beautiful.

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.629
It's not like
hunting with rifle

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.965
because the bow don't make any
noises when they're hunting.

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:42.534
But then when they see animals
it becomes very hectic

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:43.669
and they start running around.

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.571
They eat everything
they can find

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.373
except snake and elephants.

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:49.475
Elephants, the arrow can't
go through their skins

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.009
and snake, they're
just scared of them.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.746
<i> This is a little baby
 bush that they got that day.</i>

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.814
<i> And then they, you know,
 have a smoke break.</i>

00:06:55.814 --> 00:06:57.850
-<i> Quiet reflection</i> .
- ( audience laughter )

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.950
<i> I couldn't believe it.</i>

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.919
<i>I was like, "oh, unbelievable".</i>

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.288
<i> They roll in newspaper,
 there's no...</i>

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:03.356
<i> You know, they get
 newspaper and</i>

00:07:03.356 --> 00:07:04.423
<i> they roll straight
 in there.</i>

00:07:04.423 --> 00:07:05.524
<i> And then, you know,
 it doesn't matter</i>

00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:07.259
<i> right after that
 they are running around</i>

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.828
<i> they're incredibly flat.</i>

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.129
When they run they
have their upper

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.064
body that is kind
of-- back like this.

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.934
It's quite impressive to
see them running.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.468
<i> And then get dik-dik
 like this</i> .

00:07:16.468 --> 00:07:19.705
<i> This is the smallest gazelle
 can be found in Africa.</i>

00:07:19.705 --> 00:07:22.808
<i>And then Mokoa's like we'll get
 up to a higher point of view.</i>

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:23.942
<i> He will point and see,</i>

00:07:23.942 --> 00:07:26.112
<i> something there and it was
 really intense.</i>

00:07:26.112 --> 00:07:29.348
<i>And we run there, and you know,
 two hours, three hours later,</i>

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:31.984
<i> after much tracking and stuff
 they get this vervet monkey</i>

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.352
<i> that fell off that tree.</i>

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.820
<i> It was very powerful.</i>

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.522
<i> I love my time with the Hadza.</i>

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:37.990
<i> You know, they know how to
 strike a pose too</i>

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.325
-<i> and play dumb</i> .
- ( audience laughter )

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:40.593
<i> This is Mokoa.</i>

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:44.096
<i> And you know, this
 is a left camp.</i>

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.731
<i>This is what they leave behind.</i>

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:48.600
<i> This stack of branches,
 the grass has fallen off,</i>

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.902
<i> this is all that's left.
 Think about that.</i>

00:07:50.902 --> 00:07:52.371
<i> They have lived for
 40,000 years</i>

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:53.873
<i> in that area and
 there's no tracks.</i>

00:07:53.873 --> 00:07:57.042
<i> You know, there's nothing
 left behind from their times</i> .

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.111
The thing with their story
that really strike me is that

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:03.583
wherever you eat local and you
spend energy to get your food

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.685
you are for the better.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:06.919
And this would be
the message that

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:09.688
I want to hope and
give to that...

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.056
through that, you know

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:13.692
through my experience living
with these people in all this.

00:08:13.692 --> 00:08:15.861
If you can do
anything to enforce

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:18.463
yourself to grow something

00:08:18.463 --> 00:08:21.366
or if you eat meat, you know,
learn to kill a chicken.

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.802
I mean, you know, if
you're going to eat meat

00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:25.704
you should learn
once in your life...

00:08:25.704 --> 00:08:27.540
I've killed a goat once
since I've seen that

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.109
because I eat meat every
day, not every day, you know

00:08:30.109 --> 00:08:32.044
but every three days maybe.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.748
And so I think it's important
to understand

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.249
where the food comes from.

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:39.118
And to do everything you can
to eat local.

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:41.787
Well, that's my point
through that experiences.

00:08:43.088 --> 00:08:44.823
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:47.293
