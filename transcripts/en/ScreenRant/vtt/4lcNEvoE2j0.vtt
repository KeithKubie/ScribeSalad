00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.330
Story and characters play the largest part
of how much a viewer enjoys a movie, but Easter

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.520
Eggs only add to the fun. Giving viewers something
else to watch out for while watching a movie,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.789
the best nods or trivia can even warrant mediocre
films a second viewing to catch them all.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.000
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Great Easter Eggs
in Movies.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.560
On Her Majesty�s Secret Service

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.000
The Bond franchise isn�t known for its continuity,
passing from one star actor to the next, but

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.190
On Her Majesty�s Secret Service is one of
the few exceptions. In George Lazenby�s

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.660
first and only appearance as 007, Bond rescues
a femme fatale from evil henchmen in the movie�s

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.620
opening sequence. When the woman then flees
instead of staying with Bond, Lazenby quips

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.760
that �This never happened to the other fellow,�
making reference to Sean Connery, star of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.450
the first five films that Lazenby replaced.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.570
The Departed

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.329
Based on its title, you�d expect plenty
of bloodshed in Martin Scorsese�s Boston

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.890
crime drama. But eagle eyed viewers could
actually predict who was going to make it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.610
out alive. Throughout the film, the letter
�X� is used to foreshadow an upcoming

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.640
death. The characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio,
Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson are all hit

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.310
with �the X� by the end of the film, but
Mark Wahlberg�s character never is � leaving

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.050
him alive to bring the film�s story to a
close.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.050
Pulp Fiction

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.420
In Quentin Tarantino�s tale of connected
short stories, Vincent Vega and Mia Wallace

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.920
share a memorable chat about Mia�s acting
career. Specifically, a TV pilot titled Fox

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.790
Force Five, starring a team of five badass
ladies specializing in different fields. Fast

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.320
forward to Kill Bill, and Mia�s descriptions
fit the film�s Deadly Viper Assassination

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.971
Squad surprisingly well. Since Kill Bill takes
place in Tarantino�s shared universe, it

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:57.580
could be Mia Wallace � not actress Uma Thurman
- playing The Bride. How�s that for a mind-bender?

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.829
Fight Club

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.759
In this famous twist ending, Ed Norton�s
Narrator escapes his mundane existence by

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.189
creating an alternate personality named Tyler
Durden, who�s everything he�s not. But

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.230
the film might also reveal how he came up
with Durden�s look to begin with. The movie

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.700
includes a brief shot of a movie theater marquee
advertising Seven Years in Tibet, which also

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.459
starred actor Brad Pitt. While nobody says
it outright, the implication is that the Narrator

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.819
may have modeled Durden after the actor. Every
modern movie fan wishes to live a life like

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.290
the movie star � he just made it happen.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.870
The Social Network

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.569
Directors are often known to make references
to their earlier films, and David Fincher

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.010
did just that with his tale of Facebook founder
Mark Zuckerberg. During the film, Mark �cheats�

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.090
on his art exam by building a fake Facebook
profile to get students� opinions on various

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.269
pieces of art. What name does Mark use? None
other than Tyler Durden. Apparently, Tyler�s

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.849
imaginary life is so luxurious that even soon-to-be
billionaires wish to be him. Either that,

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.299
or Zuckerberg is a fan of Fincher�s thriller.

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.849
Predator 2

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.090
Shared movie universe are all the rage in
Hollywood these days, but Fox beat Marvel

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.730
and DC to the punch with this cool reference
to Alien in Predator 2. On the Predator�s

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.660
ship, a trophy room decorated with the skulls
of the killer�s past game is shown. One

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.439
of the most prominent is that of a xenomorph
� the title villains of the Alien franchise.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.859
This nod confirmed that both franchises took
place in the same cinematic world, teasing

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:27.230
fans with the possibility of a crossover film
one day. This Easter egg may be more memorable

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.859
than some of the Alien/Predator crossovers
to come, but it�s still a fun one to watch

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:30.859
out for.

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:31.859
Toy Story

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:41.769
Pixar is known for its at-times adult humor
or references, but throughout the Toy Story

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.510
trilogy, there are numerous references made
to one of cinema�s most terrifying films:

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.069
Stanley Kubrick�s The Shining. The carpet
in infamous bully Sid�s house is identical

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.409
to that of the Overlook Hotel, and everything
from license plates to online chat user names

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:01.430
in Toy Story 3 feature the number �237,�
a nod to the horrifying contents of Room 237

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.859
in the same hotel. The toys have been put
through some terrible situations, so these

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.590
Easter eggs are either fun nods to Kubrick
or subtle foreshadowing for older moviegoers.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.739
The Phantom Menace

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.970
One of the funniest moments in Steven Spielberg�s
classic ET: The Extra-terrestrial is when

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.490
the loveable alien recognizes a young trick-or-treater
in a Yoda costume as a sign from �home.�

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.419
Director George Lucas returned the favor in
Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, placing creatures

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.590
that strongly resemble ET in one of the Republic�s
Senate sequences. Only visible for a brief

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.350
moment, it�s a sign that ET really IS from
the galaxy far, far away. We can only imagine

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.680
what went through his mind watching Elliot
show off his Star Wars toy collection, having

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.100
seen the galactic conflict firsthand.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.900
Close Encounters of the Third Kind

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.849
The alien visitors of Close Encounters wish
to make peaceful communication with human

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.580
beings, and that apparently extends to consuming
our pop culture. As the two species communicate

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.259
via light and sound in the film�s finale,
part of the musical medley the alien ship

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:04.819
plays is taken from the theme of Jaws, which
was also a Steven Spielberg/John Williams

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:09.150
collaboration. The movie and score were so
popular, it must have extended beyond the

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.500
stars, which might explain why the aliens
were so interested in taking Roy Neary along

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.569
with them, given his resemblance to Jaws star
Richard Dreyfus�

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:16.940
Fight Club

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.120
A running theme in Fight Club is its satire
on consumerism and how mankind has become

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.590
overrun by corporations, constantly buying
things that they don�t need. As a way of

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.590
hammering this home, David Fincher decided
to include a Starbucks coffee cup in nearly

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.590
every scene of the finished film, a little
in-joke he included for showcasing too much

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.030
of a good thing. It was commentary on how
we as a society purchase the same things without

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.610
thinking twice and illustrated the monotony
of everyday life. Starbucks was even aware

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.740
of this and read the script, meaning the coffee
giant is able to poke some fun at themselves.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.740
Sometimes.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.280
Those are our favorite movie Easter eggs.
