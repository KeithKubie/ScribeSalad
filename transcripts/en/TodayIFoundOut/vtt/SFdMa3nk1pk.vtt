00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.310
On January 14, 2009, LaserDisc officially
died. Of course, the shiny, 12-inch optical

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.090
disc that once competed with VHS and Betamax
in the home video market spun into oblivion

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.320
long before. However, it was that Wednesday
in January seven years ago that Pioneer – the

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.370
last remaining company to make the devices
– declared they were ceasing production

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.290
after making a final run of 3,000 LaserDisc
players, bringing the total made to just under

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.950
17 million units. “Under the market environment
in which new media such as DVD and Blu-ray

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.900
Discs now dominate, it has become difficult
for Pioneer to procure the parts required

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.250
to produce LD players,” read Pioneer’s
press release. “Consequently Pioneer has

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.340
been forced to terminate production of its
LD products.”

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.420
For the three decades LaserDisc was on the
market, it earned a reputation for providing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.360
a much higher picture quality, better audio,
and laughably superior navigation than its

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.250
competitors. From all this, the fact that
VHS won the showdown is counterintuitive at

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.119
first glance. But as with so many things,
LaserDisc initially lost the home entertainment

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.270
format wars not because of an inferior product,
but primarily because of cost.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.829
Somewhat bizarrely, LaserDisc can very loosely
trace its origins to Bing Crosby. Post-WWII,

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.930
the crooner was the regular host of certain
radio shows. However, he didn’t like to

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.039
do them live, partially because it sometimes
required him to do the shows multiple times

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.490
for different time zones. The alternative
he had to pre-record for later broadcast was

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.439
shellac disks, but they were brittle and the
playback quality left something to be desired,

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.149
resulting in studios generally putting the
kibosh on using such recordings for their

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.610
prime-time shows. But Army Corps engineer
Jack Mullin offered him a solution – high

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.369
quality magnetic tape recording.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.510
While magnetic tape recording had been around
before this, the quality of the recordings

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.990
wasn’t great. This all changed in 1942 when
Dr. Walter Weber and Hans Joachim von Braunmühl

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.020
made a breakthrough within Nazi Germany. The
result of their work was later heard by an

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.590
American stationed in England during WWII,
the aforementioned Lt. Jack Mullin.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.720
During his time working on improving radar
and other such technologies, Mullin sometimes

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.330
worked through the night in his lab at the
Royal Air Force facility in Farnborough, England.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.850
Unfortunately for him, the BBC stopped broadcasting
at midnight, leading him to search for something

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.970
else to listen to. What he found was a German
broadcast of classical music that continued

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.030
throughout the night.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.380
The remarkable thing about this broadcast
was that, unlike other recorded programs of

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.850
the day which generally used some form of
disc recording that had various pops and ticks

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.470
throughout when played back, the audio quality
of the German classical music broadcast was

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.220
such that it sounded like a live broadcast.
A curiosity, Mullin mused about whether Hitler

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.550
was forcing full orchestras of musicians to
play around the clock or whether the Germans

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.060
had come up with a superior recording technology.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.480
After the war, he set about finding out, ultimately
discovering that the Germans were using nothing

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.240
more than a magnetophone, which was a device
invented in Germany in the mid-1930s. Unlike

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.220
the 1930s version that the Allies had known
about, however, this upgraded unit used superior

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.010
tape and, critically, ac biasing, rather than
dc. In a nutshell, the latter improvement

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.030
essentially smoothed out the unused portions
of the audio band on the tape much better

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.340
than dc biasing, making for very clean sounding
audio.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.032
Not the first to try this (the first known
patent for ac biasing went all the way back

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:44.032
to 1921, invented by W. L. Carlson and Glenn
L. Carpenter, though their invention was almost

00:03:44.032 --> 00:03:45.032
completely forgotten), combined with a magnetophone,
ac biasing shined.

00:03:45.032 --> 00:03:47.460
Realizing the potential commercial uses for
the product, in 1948, Mullins went to Hollywood

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.780
and demoed his own version of the device.
This ultimately came to the attention of Bing

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.370
Crosby’s agent who brought the equipment
to the superstar. One listen and Crosby was

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.900
sold. He invested in Mullin’s company and
started using the device to record his radio

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.570
shows. While this type of pre-recording is
commonplace now, at the time doing this rather

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.260
than broadcasting live in front of a studio
audience was something of a mini-revolution

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.260
within the industry.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.961
Eventually, 3M (if you’re curious, see:
What the Company Name 3M Stands For) purchased

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:18.459
the technology and spun it off to a new sub-company
called Mincom. While 3M’s Mincom appreciated

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.120
audio recordings, what they were really looking
for was to take the lead in another medium

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.030
– video recording.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.180
David Paul Gregg claims he first envisioned
the idea for a video recording optical disc

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.600
in 1958 while working as an engineer for Westrex,
a rival of Mincom. Taking the principles of

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.740
audio recording to a shellac disk, encoding
FM signals through a series of pits and ridges,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.740
he added a concentrated light source – a
laser- for reading the information off the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.740
disc.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.540
Fired from Westrex in 1960 purportedly for
being unwilling to fully share his ideas with

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.380
the company, Gregg and his optical disc idea
found a home at Mincom. In 1961, Gregg patented

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.590
his “Electron beam recording and reproducing
system,” but still ran into a dispute with

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.639
his new employer reportedly for the same reason
as his old- his unwillingness to give up control

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.760
of his invention. Unfortunately for Gregg,
other Mincom engineers began to take components

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.490
of what he was working on, creating their
own prototype. By 1969, Mincom owned 19 patents

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.600
for such a device (only 3 named Gregg as co-author)
and was essentially out-innovating the inventor.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.840
Gregg subsequently left the company to start
his own, later selling his laser-disc patents

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.610
to MCA.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.090
Flash forward six years. With television firmly
entrenched, the next step for the entertainment

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.800
business was bringing Hollywood movies from
a dark theater to American homes. (Previous

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.770
to this, something only the world’s elite
could enjoy, see: That Time Howard Hughes

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.080
Purchased a TV Station So He Could Have Netflix
in the 1960s.) Towards this end, in 1975,

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.370
Sony debuted Betamax. A year later, JVC launched
VHS. Betamax had better picture quality, but

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.290
VHS was lighter, cheaper (though not inherently
so, mostly just because only Sony made Betamax

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:53.290
devices, unlike VHS where many companies were
licensed to make them) and could hold significantly

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.490
more information than Betamax (at least in
early models). While Betamax and VHS battled

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.680
in what became known as the “videotape format
wars,” with VHS winning largely owing to

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.020
major missteps by Sony, rather than VHS being
the superior format, Magnavox was working

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:13.280
on their own in-home entertainment based on
the previous work done by Gregg at Mincom-

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.550
“DiscoVision.” (Yes, they really called
it that.)

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.790
DiscoVision essentially just encoded analog
data onto a disc, which was read off via a

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.790
laser. (For a genuinely interesting and easy
to understand explanation of how this system

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.330
worked under the hood, see this 1980 Mr. Wizard
video.) Notably, this new technology had drastically

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.480
better picture and audio quality than both
VHS and Betamax. It was also capable of storing

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.340
multiple audio tracks, unlike the tape formats,
allowing for things like director’s commentary

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.800
and the like to be added. The discs for it
were also much easier and, in theory, cheaper

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.800
to manufacture.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:44.180
DiscoVision was first released in December
1978 in only one market- Atlanta, Georgia.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.040
The player cost $700 (about $2300 today).
The first movie to be released on “DiscoVision”

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.430
was Jaws. Initially a success with the player
selling out across Atlanta, “DiscoVision”

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.730
moved on to other markets.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:04.270
In association with MCA, in 1980 Pioneer launched
their own version of the player, but dropped

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.199
the original name for the technology. Initially
re-branded “LaserVision,” it ultimately

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.419
became known as “LaserDisc”. Investing
in making a player that was cheaper to manufacture

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:20.430
than Magnavox’s, Pioneer managed to get
the price for theirs down to about $500 (about

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:26.580
$1500 today). Getting celebrities like Ray
Charles and Mr. Wizard to pitch their product,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.170
LaserDisc was on the upswing.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:33.840
So if LaserDisc was such a superior format,
why did VHS become so popular? In many respects,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.169
for some of the same reasons Betamax ultimately
lost to VHS.

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:43.850
To begin with, as previously mentioned, cost.
The LaserDisc player was technologically complex

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:48.630
and quite bulky, resulting in it being comparatively
expensive to make and ship, even if they had

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.900
sold as many units per year as VHS players.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.760
Demonstrating how things might have been different
had the player been cheaper to manufacture,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.010
in Japan where the LaserDisc players were
heavily discounted for a time to more or less

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:05.900
match the price of VHS players, during that
period LaserDisc outsold VHS, peaking at 1

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.570
in 10 households in Japan owning a LaserDisc
player.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:14.320
Another big issue was storage. A standard
VHS tape could hold most movies without issue.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.070
The LaserDisc, however, could not. Unlike
DVDs and Blu-rays, the LaserDisc stored the

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:24.070
video and audio in analog form (though later
the audio could be stored digitally as well).

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.380
The lack of compression in the stored video
combined with the relatively large frame rate

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.810
resulted in initial discs only being able
to store 30 minutes of video (later 60 minutes)

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:38.360
per side of the disc. This meant the movie
had to be interrupted frequently to turn the

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.940
disc over or swap it out for another. After
such a flip or swap, it also took about 20-30

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:48.830
seconds for the half pound (1/4 kg) disc to
spin back up to full speed before it would

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.889
start playing again.

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:53.940
Later models could automatically switch the
laser to the other side of the disc. Pioneer

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:58.350
also eventually sold multi-disc systems, in
some designs, such as the “LaserStack”

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:03.860
system, swapping out discs not unlike a record
playing jukebox. But this all just added more

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.790
cost to the already expensive system and was
completely unnecessary in a relatively cheap

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.610
VHS, where one tape could hold most movies
with no interruption on playback.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.000
This brings us back to cost and the discs
themselves. While technically the LaserDiscs

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.630
could have been drastically cheaper to make
vs. videocassettes (being just two single-sided

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.460
aluminum discs layered in plastic), as the
format war continued to rage and VHS became

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.770
increasingly popular, the sheer volume of
tapes being sold saw the price to manufacture

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:40.770
a VHS tape drop to about $1 (about $2 today)
at the end of the 1980s, while one LaserDisc

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.160
cost about $5 to make at this time. Because
of this, by the end of the 1980s, consumers

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:52.100
were paying about $35-$40 (about $70-$80 today)
for new release LaserDiscs, whereas new releases

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.330
on VHS were selling for about $15-$20 ($30-$40
today).

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.400
Another factor the VHS had going for it over
the LaserDisc was how much easier it was to

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.130
damage the discs than videocassettes. Now,
in theory a LaserDisc is actually significantly

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.430
less prone to failing over time than a videocassette
(even potentially outlasting a human’s lifespan,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.520
regardless of how many times it was viewed).
In contrast, early VHS tapes were prone to

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:20.260
relatively rapid degradation in playback quality
owing to the fact that the head had to be

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.810
in direct contact with the delicate tape.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.870
All that said, in actual practice the video
cassettes tended to be significantly more

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.690
durable than LaserDiscs- accidentally drop
a video cassette and it would probably be

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:35.800
fine. Do the same to a LaserDisc and it might
result in a scratch. Unlike digital DVDs and

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.810
Blu-rays, the analog LaserDisc initially had
no real graceful way to deal with such defects.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.350
Further, largely due to poor manufacturing
quality of early discs, LaserDiscs were also

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.260
susceptible to failing due to “disc rot”.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.149
All that said, in places where a particular
VHS tape might be watched countless times,

00:10:52.149 --> 00:10:57.510
like at schools, with relatively careful handling
the LaserDisc was a far superior format, which

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:01.960
is why it was so popular at schools. But for
the much larger home-use market, where the

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.430
tapes were infrequently watched, tape degradation
really wasn’t much of an issue, especially

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.420
with later VHS players that could read the
tape without the head needing to physically

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.420
contact it.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.709
Yet another significant advantage of VHS was
the ability to record shows. While it was

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:21.370
technically possible to put such a recording
feature into a LaserDisc player, no manufacturer

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.480
ever chose to offer such a thing, and the
discs themselves would have been quite expensive

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.529
to buy anyway compared to the price videocassettes
ultimately dropped to thanks to their huge

00:11:28.529 --> 00:11:29.529
market share.

00:11:29.529 --> 00:11:33.680
In the end, as VHS continued its rise in market
share, LaserDisc rapidly fell off, becoming

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.190
more of a niche item for “videophiles”
who wanted the best possible picture and audio

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.670
quality technology could provide, never mind
the cost.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:49.480
But we said in the title that LaserDisc ultimately
won the video format wars. How? Via its children-

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.220
DVDs and Blu-rays (that’s not to mention
CD’s over audio cassettes), which were all

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.240
heavily based on the technology pioneered
by LaserDisc, albeit in a digital, rather

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240
than analog, form.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.240
Laserdisc vs dvd
LaserDisc vs DVD

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.140
When DVDs entered the picture in the mid-1990s,
they spelled the final nail in the coffin

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.360
of the essentially already dead LaserDisc.
For starters, the DVD’s video and sound

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.520
quality rivaled the LaserDisc (though some
videophiles would argue otherwise, preferring

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:14.950
the analog format, which is why the LaserDisc
players continued to be made all the way up

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:20.390
to 2009 despite new release movies having
long abandoned the LaserDisc). Further, thanks

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.680
to the compressed, digital format, among other
improvements, a full movie could easily be

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.290
stored on a single side of a much smaller
disc. It wasn’t just the discs that got

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.519
smaller either; technological advances combined
with the diminished discs allowed for more

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.649
compact, relatively cheap players as well.

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:41.410
In the end, VHS won the battle, killing the
LaserDisc off, but its offspring soon avenged

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.600
its parent by killing VHS and, in so doing,
winning the war against the videocassette

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.899
format.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:53.080
Just as surprising as the fact that you could
still buy a new LaserDisc player in 2009,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.120
Sony didn’t stop selling Betamax players
until 2002. Moreover, you could still buy

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:17.450
brand new Betamax tapes up until March 

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:48.209
of 2016.
