This is the first film where I worked with
professional actors

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.439
so that was really different and
interesting, and I think, for example...

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.170
There's a scene where she is kind of
trying to seduce

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.170
this former, personal trainer. She has some
difficulty and there's this moment

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.020
where she kind of goes 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.020
nuts on him.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.450
It's a difficult scene 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.500
to play, and if you have a whole cast
and crew around you, and it's late at night

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.910
and with the lights are on and the
camera's rolling

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.440
..it's a lot of pressure and I think takes a
particular kind of person to step up at

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.440
that moment and 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.250
you know, she was great.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.220
 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.189
If you're writing a film project for a non-actor

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.859
either you're gonna need like a lot of time to be able to work with the person to get them to that point

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:14.329
 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.210
or you need a lot of film, but it's certainly

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.740
not something that seems easy to me.
