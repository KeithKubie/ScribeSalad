00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And the answer is yes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You might guess this just from the number of observations, but let's go through the math.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we have the difference of 0.01% or 0.0001, divide that by the total variance which is--

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And this is equal to 2.24. This is significant.
