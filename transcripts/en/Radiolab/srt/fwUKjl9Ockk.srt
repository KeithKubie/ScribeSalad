this is radio lamb. I'm Jad
Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich.

9
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,110
And in this hour we've been
talking about, uh, aging mostly,

10
00:00:33,111 --> 00:00:37,820
but now we're going to turn our attention
to the end of that aging process.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,280
Well, you're talking about dying. Yes.

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,210
Maybe we've avoided that topic because
that's generally how people deal with

13
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,130
death, which is to avoid
it, to deny it. Yeah.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,310
So this next piece is about actually
a different way of dealing with death,

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,050
I should say, before we begin it,

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,190
that it does contain some
graphic descriptions of the
normal bodily process of

17
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:55,551
aging.

18
00:00:55,551 --> 00:00:58,550
But if you have someone in the room who
is squeamish or you don't think she'd

19
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:01,490
hear these things and it's nothing,
you know, terrible. It's just,

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,710
it's actually quite
nasty, nasty, nasty. Uh,

21
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,510
then maybe this is the time
to shoot them out of the room.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,050
This piece was produced by Lou
old Koski. It's about one family,

23
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,700
three generations in introduce myself.
This is Jeremiah the youngest. Um,

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,480
Jeremiah Hagar. He's a filmmaker,
so I don't know if Isaiah is,

25
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,480
they are his dad. Isaiah is
a muralist. His grandfather,

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,610
I'm think Fran son of Asher's. They
go, I'm sure Zayic art is a health nut.

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,690
G Like, oh my shit.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,010
This is a video of him that Jeremiah
shot of Astra doing his daily exercise

29
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:39,330
routine. He's in his nineties.

30
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,920
He's jumping on a trampoline
and counting each jump.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,320
How old are you now? I'm 90 90.

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,410
You're in healthy man for 90 yeah.

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,360
[inaudible] 91 90. [inaudible] a great,

34
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,270
great grandfather named Dave [inaudible].

35
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,920
So you're going to live to 102,
I don't know. But the, maybe

36
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,450
at the age of 93, Asher began to decline

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,550
quickly. How do you deal with
a man dying in your house?

38
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,530
How do you deal with that? Well, you know,

39
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,240
my father starts taking photos of him.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,480
One of my modes of understanding
was either drawing or photographing.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,170
He was always taking pictures
of my grandfather. Just
see how dozens of slides.

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,063
Thousands.

43
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,620
That's how it went for awhile. Isaiah,

44
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,670
the dad would take care of his
dad and take some photos. Wow.

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,750
Grandson Jeremiah basically
looked the other way. Well,

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,300
I never really knew my grandfather, but
then Isaiah got an idea. I thought to

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,620
self challenge this young boy to this
duel who can take the most objective

48
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:59,000
photographs of a dying man. It wasn't,

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,340
we threw down and like I pulled my camera
out of my holster and he pulled his

50
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,590
camera out of his holster.
You know, it wasn't like that.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,960
He was involved in my grandfather's
death and I wasn't. And so he said,

52
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,610
this is how I get involved. It's
my senior year in high school. Um,

53
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,270
and I was a bus boy in this restaurant
down the street and I loved it.

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,910
And I would bust tables till two or
three in the morning and then I would get

55
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:25,470
drunk with people after work and then I
would come back and I would take care of

56
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,304
my grandpa.

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,660
So I would lift him up and change his
sheets because otherwise his bedsore would

58
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:34,230
burn more when he had this horrible
bedsore you can see it in the photographs

59
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,850
and he would hit me while I lifted him
up and then I would photograph them cause

60
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,840
I would want to sit with him.

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,390
Cause when you want to calm him
down and the way you sit with them,

62
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:46,920
I mean my father was right. You have
the camera. I mean that's how you cope.

63
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,730
Otherwise you're sitting with
him and he's just looking at you.

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,320
During the contest,

65
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:56,760
Dad and son shared duties of taking care
of Grandpa and at night they'd sit at

66
00:03:56,761 --> 00:04:00,580
the kitchen table and compare photos.
As soon as I took the first picture,

67
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,860
you knew I'm a better than my fathers
because my fathers were from far away and

68
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,250
there were snapshots and
mine were like specific.

69
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,870
Like I was fascinated with him dying.
I wanted to know what it looked like.

70
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,170
And this went on for about a
month. One during which time,

71
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:19,530
even Jeremiah's friends, all
of his friends got involved.

72
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,870
I had the wee hours of the night.

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I would wake up and I would see that
they're surrounding my father or four or

74
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,210
five young people. Sure.

75
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:34,350
They were drinking beer and they were
joking around, but they were there.

76
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,240
They were there while he was there.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,360
What I remember most was, uh,

78
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,690
you and your friends
changing his sheets and, uh,

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,370
lifting him and moving him around. So
like every island that it would be more.

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,130
Who else did it with you? John Lincoln.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,760
He all became initiated into the
most problematic event in our lives.

82
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,730
It was an amazingly rare scene to see
these teenagers attending to death.

83
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,650
Well, this is a book of
photographs. So, uh, my father,

84
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:19,651
your grandfather's last week
of life in this very room.

85
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,830
So the contest was a month
long. Smart Guy. I am.

86
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,290
You're good.

87
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,590
You know how to even contest they
kept it con for one month kitchen.

88
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,520
Well, the feet look like they're, um,

89
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,610
they were out in the desert that
they'd been baked and cracked and dry,

90
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:51,640
dry, dry doubt. I mean, look at
them. They look like, I mean,

91
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:55,660
look at the nail. The nail is wild,
but I mean everything. It's like what?

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,450
I have these same legs.
Stop touching on photos.

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,050
Well, I can almost feel him like
feeling them. I feel you instead there.

94
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,410
That's bed sore. That's what happens.

95
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,960
Hello. It's awful, awful,
awful, awful, awful,

96
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:24,700
awful man who prided himself on
his health. Look what happened.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,290
I just one describe that
it looks like riding me.

98
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,660
I mean they just opened wounds and
you're moving them around, moving around,

99
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,840
but still it was impossible. It's
crazy to look at the colors too.

100
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,520
Pink and then white, green and then
ground where it's, well the widest,

101
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:46,490
the muscle isn't, I took these photos
in color because I'm black and white.

102
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,390
You'd never get it. You know, you'd never
get how painful this must have been.

103
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,270
His anus was all red.

104
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,610
I mean like really red and you can see
the parts of it have broken and there's

105
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,320
just blood gushing out and it's dried.

106
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,510
I mean the blood is dried and
this is the last photo. Yeah,

107
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,060
you can see like the cognition
is gone on the mouth as a cape.

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,490
He's buried in his pillow.
He knew it was over.

109
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,640
It was just a matter of time. Now that's
it. That's the closest I got in dying.

110
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,380
He wanted to live forever.

111
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:29,250
Whoa.

112
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,150
The fix was in from the beginning.

113
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,450
The fix is that I was
supposed to add. Sure, sure.

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,780
How could it be any other way? I
don't know. I could have taken that.

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,310
I couldn't give it up.
You wanted me to win.

116
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,990
It was a subterfuge to get you to be with
your grandfather as much as possible.

117
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,390
I thought it was a fair Fairfax
and wasn't, ah, can you can.

118
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,030
They're asking you all already
couldn't take a good picture.

119
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,770
When a person is dying, it's very
important that they're surrounded.

120
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,280
Ooh.

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,280
They're surrounded by the light of life
and you don't go in to the place of

122
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:11,720
oblivion alone. You want me to be there?

123
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:13,670
I don't know.

124
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,710
At this point. I don't know. I'm
not, I'm not at that place yet. Well,

125
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:23,360
what does that mean with the camera?
I mean, just be with me. Yeah.

126
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,890
Demon with me. Be close to
me. Be Soft with me. Yeah,

127
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:30,450
I guess that's what it's
about. Really. Be Solid.

128
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,680
Whoa.

129
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:50,940
