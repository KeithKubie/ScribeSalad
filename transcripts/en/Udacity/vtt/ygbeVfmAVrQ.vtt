00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.540
We've gone over some examples for
monetizing using ads on both the web and

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.650
on native devices.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.150
Now implementation for the other methods
are actually pretty similar, right?

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:11.160
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.830
For all other methods, one-time charge,
in-app payment, subscriptions, and

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.860
others, you really just need
to set up your payment system.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.993
Whether you choose Braintree,
Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay or Apple,

00:00:22.993 --> 00:00:24.086
doesn't matter.

00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:27.870
It's best follow the instructions
on each of their sites.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.084
&gt;&gt; We've included links to each of
these in the instructor notes below.

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:34.069
After you've set up your payment method,
it's time to set prices and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:35.090
monitor performance.
