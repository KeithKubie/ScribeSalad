the Android toolkit team and today we're

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
the Android toolkit team and today we're
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.060
the Android toolkit team and today we're
going to talk about live data live data

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
going to talk about live data live data
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.550
going to talk about live data live data
is one of the first architecture

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
is one of the first architecture
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.070
is one of the first architecture
components that we released last year

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
components that we released last year
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.950
components that we released last year
and in this talk we're going to explain

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
and in this talk we're going to explain
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660
and in this talk we're going to explain
what it is we're going to talk about

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
what it is we're going to talk about
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.429
what it is we're going to talk about
some of the transformations that you can

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439
some of the transformations that you can
 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.250
some of the transformations that you can
do how to combine live data and then

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
do how to combine live data and then
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900
do how to combine live data and then
we're going to talk about some patterns

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
we're going to talk about some patterns
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639
we're going to talk about some patterns
and anti patterns that you might want to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
and anti patterns that you might want to
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.020
and anti patterns that you might want to
avoid so like data is a simple life

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
avoid so like data is a simple life
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.049
avoid so like data is a simple life
cycle where observable data folder we're

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
cycle where observable data folder we're
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.979
cycle where observable data folder we're
going to explain all these

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
going to explain all these
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.060
going to explain all these
characteristics but first we're going to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
characteristics but first we're going to
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.740
characteristics but first we're going to
start with observable what's an

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
start with observable what's an
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.220
start with observable what's an
observable so in our object-oriented

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230
observable so in our object-oriented
 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.939
observable so in our object-oriented
world probably the easiest way of

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949
world probably the easiest way of
 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.740
world probably the easiest way of
communicating one component and another

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
communicating one component and another
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.500
communicating one component and another
is by having a reference from one object

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510
is by having a reference from one object
 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.530
is by having a reference from one object
to another and just call it directly

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540
to another and just call it directly
 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.310
to another and just call it directly
however in Android this might have some

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320
however in Android this might have some
 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.370
however in Android this might have some
problems as we all know components in

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
problems as we all know components in
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.200
problems as we all know components in
Android have different life cycles and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
Android have different life cycles and
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.499
Android have different life cycles and
different life spans you might be

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
different life spans you might be
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.910
different life spans you might be
familiar with this diagram it's the view

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920
familiar with this diagram it's the view
 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.359
familiar with this diagram it's the view
model scope diagram a simple thing like

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
model scope diagram a simple thing like
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.380
model scope diagram a simple thing like
a device rotation can actually recreate

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
a device rotation can actually recreate
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.710
a device rotation can actually recreate
the activity so you probably know that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
the activity so you probably know that
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719
the activity so you probably know that
having an reference to activity in this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
having an reference to activity in this
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370
having an reference to activity in this
view model would be a bad idea because

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
view model would be a bad idea because
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.399
view model would be a bad idea because
it leads to memory leaks even crashes

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
it leads to memory leaks even crashes
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.789
it leads to memory leaks even crashes
with no pointer exceptions so instead of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
with no pointer exceptions so instead of
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.590
with no pointer exceptions so instead of
having a reference to the activity in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
having a reference to the activity in
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240
having a reference to the activity in
the view model we're gonna try to have a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
the view model we're gonna try to have a
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.920
the view model we're gonna try to have a
reference to the view model in the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
reference to the view model in the
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200
reference to the view model in the
activity so how do we communicate how do

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
activity so how do we communicate how do
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719
activity so how do we communicate how do
we send data from the view model to the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
we send data from the view model to the
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.490
we send data from the view model to the
activity one instead of doing that we're

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
activity one instead of doing that we're
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.249
activity one instead of doing that we're
going to let the activity observe the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
going to let the activity observe the
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679
going to let the activity observe the
view the view model and for that we're

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689
view the view model and for that we're
 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.069
view the view model and for that we're
going to use observables like data let's

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
going to use observables like data let's
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.469
going to use observables like data let's
see how this looks with a little bit of

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
see how this looks with a little bit of
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.260
see how this looks with a little bit of
code in the view model we expose our

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
code in the view model we expose our
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300
code in the view model we expose our
live data where you're going you're

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
live data where you're going you're
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.940
live data where you're going you're
going to see a lot of examples of how to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
going to see a lot of examples of how to
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.699
going to see a lot of examples of how to
expose live data from a view model

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
expose live data from a view model
 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.860
expose live data from a view model
and then in our activity we make the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
and then in our activity we make the
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.229
and then in our activity we make the
actual subscription and we do that by

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239
actual subscription and we do that by
 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.330
actual subscription and we do that by
calling the observe method on the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
calling the observe method on the
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.339
calling the observe method on the
observable the first parameter is

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349
observable the first parameter is
 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.500
observable the first parameter is
something called a lifecycle owner it is

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
something called a lifecycle owner it is
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.740
something called a lifecycle owner it is
going to talk about this in a second and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
going to talk about this in a second and
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.559
going to talk about this in a second and
the second parameter is an observer this

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569
the second parameter is an observer this
 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.500
the second parameter is an observer this
is what's called whenever the observable

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
is what's called whenever the observable
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.170
is what's called whenever the observable
the live data the live data is value is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
the live data the live data is value is
 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.099
the live data the live data is value is
changed so hoes I mentioned that you

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109
changed so hoes I mentioned that you
 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.360
changed so hoes I mentioned that you
want to reference an object in the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
want to reference an object in the
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.039
want to reference an object in the
larger scope like a V model from an

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049
larger scope like a V model from an
 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.140
larger scope like a V model from an
object in a smaller scope like an

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
object in a smaller scope like an
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.440
object in a smaller scope like an
activity but of course when you observe

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
activity but of course when you observe
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.179
activity but of course when you observe
something it has to keep a reference

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189
something it has to keep a reference
 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.250
something it has to keep a reference
back to you to be able to call it so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
back to you to be able to call it so
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.759
back to you to be able to call it so
there is a reference but why is this not

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769
there is a reference but why is this not
 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.099
there is a reference but why is this not
a problem it like that well light it is

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109
a problem it like that well light it is
 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.649
a problem it like that well light it is
and life cycle every component what do

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659
and life cycle every component what do
 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.289
and life cycle every component what do
you mean by this to able to observe a

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299
you mean by this to able to observe a
 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.629
you mean by this to able to observe a
live data you have to provide a life

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639
live data you have to provide a life
 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.550
live data you have to provide a life
cycle and when you provide this life

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560
cycle and when you provide this life
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.300
cycle and when you provide this life
cycle

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310
cycle
 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.030
cycle
it basically maintains your subscription

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040
it basically maintains your subscription
 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.059
it basically maintains your subscription
for you for free so if your observers

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069
for you for free so if your observers
 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.219
for you for free so if your observers
life cycle is not in a good state like a

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229
life cycle is not in a good state like a
 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.349
life cycle is not in a good state like a
stopped activity it's not going to call

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359
stopped activity it's not going to call
 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.599
stopped activity it's not going to call
you back or when your activity or

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609
you back or when your activity or
 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.179
you back or when your activity or
fragment is destroyed is going to remove

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189
fragment is destroyed is going to remove
 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.099
fragment is destroyed is going to remove
this subscription automatically for you

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109
this subscription automatically for you
 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.869
this subscription automatically for you
so you don't have the burden of

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879
so you don't have the burden of
 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.240
so you don't have the burden of
maintaining this subscription so if you

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250
maintaining this subscription so if you
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.149
maintaining this subscription so if you
go back to the previous graph your light

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159
go back to the previous graph your light
 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.670
go back to the previous graph your light
weight of the world will only be cold if

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
weight of the world will only be cold if
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.640
weight of the world will only be cold if
it is between started and before it is

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
it is between started and before it is
 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.640
it is between started and before it is
stopped this make sure you don't need to

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650
stopped this make sure you don't need to
 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.199
stopped this make sure you don't need to
care about things like fragment

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
care about things like fragment
 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.530
care about things like fragment
transactions once you receive observable

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540
transactions once you receive observable
 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.509
transactions once you receive observable
value you know you're in a good state

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519
value you know you're in a good state
 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.729
value you know you're in a good state
probably the most like distinctive

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739
probably the most like distinctive
 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.069
probably the most like distinctive
property of life data is that is that

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079
property of life data is that is that
 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.979
property of life data is that is that
data holder so it's not a stream we keep

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989
data holder so it's not a stream we keep
 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.319
data holder so it's not a stream we keep
saying this but what I mean by that like

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329
saying this but what I mean by that like
 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.319
saying this but what I mean by that like
is not a stream pass the value holder if

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329
is not a stream pass the value holder if
 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.210
is not a stream pass the value holder if
you go back to our previous graphs on

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220
you go back to our previous graphs on
 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.249
you go back to our previous graphs on
the right we have a live data in our

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259
the right we have a live data in our
 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.530
the right we have a live data in our
view model and on the Left we have our

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540
view model and on the Left we have our
 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.689
view model and on the Left we have our
activity or fragment that's observing

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699
activity or fragment that's observing
 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.810
activity or fragment that's observing
this live data once you set a value on

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820
this live data once you set a value on
 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.480
this live data once you set a value on
the live data just values pass to the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
the live data just values pass to the
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.850
the live data just values pass to the
activity similarly if the value changes

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860
activity similarly if the value changes
 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.440
activity similarly if the value changes
the activity receive

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450
the activity receive
 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.960
the activity receive
the new updated value but the difference

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
the new updated value but the difference
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.630
the new updated value but the difference
happens when you change the value when

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640
happens when you change the value when
 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.250
happens when you change the value when
the observer is not in an active state

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260
the observer is not in an active state
 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.100
the observer is not in an active state
it means it has no idea that value C is

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
it means it has no idea that value C is
 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.040
it means it has no idea that value C is
never dispatch to the activity and let's

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050
never dispatch to the activity and let's
 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.450
never dispatch to the activity and let's
say while your activities still have a

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460
say while your activities still have a
 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.370
say while your activities still have a
background thread oh sorry in the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380

you said the new value and your activity

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990
you said the new value and your activity
 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.030
you said the new value and your activity
still doesn't see this now the data

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040
still doesn't see this now the data
 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.100
still doesn't see this now the data
older property comes in now when your

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110
older property comes in now when your
 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.950
older property comes in now when your
activity comes back but user Singh is in

the foreground

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710
the foreground
 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.400
the foreground
it receives the latest value from the

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410
it receives the latest value from the
 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.120
it receives the latest value from the
wheel model as you can see the value C

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130
wheel model as you can see the value C
 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.190

has never a right to the activity

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200
has never a right to the activity
 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.110
has never a right to the activity
because light it only cares about

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120
because light it only cares about
 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.330
because light it only cares about
holding a single value and it's the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340
holding a single value and it's the
 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.790
holding a single value and it's the
latest value this works perfect for UI

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800
latest value this works perfect for UI
 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.100

because you only want to show what it is
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.860
because you only want to show what it is
right now but if you are trying to

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870
right now but if you are trying to
 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.780
right now but if you are trying to
process a stream of events this is not

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790
process a stream of events this is not

what you're looking for similarly if you

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920
what you're looking for similarly if you
 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.470
what you're looking for similarly if you
change the value after activities

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480
change the value after activities
 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.970
change the value after activities
destroyed nothing happens okay let's

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980
destroyed nothing happens okay let's
 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.280
destroyed nothing happens okay let's
talk about how to combine live data and

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290
talk about how to combine live data and
 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.070
talk about how to combine live data and
talk about transformations the library

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080
talk about transformations the library
 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.320
talk about transformations the library
provides to map and switch map but you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330
provides to map and switch map but you
 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.600
provides to map and switch map but you
can create your own using mediator live

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610
can create your own using mediator live
 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.960
can create your own using mediator live
data we already said that live data is

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970
data we already said that live data is
 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.910
data we already said that live data is
great to communicate view and a view

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920
great to communicate view and a view
 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.190
great to communicate view and a view
model but what if we have a third

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200
model but what if we have a third
 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.470
model but what if we have a third
component maybe a repository that is

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480
component maybe a repository that is
 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.700
component maybe a repository that is
also exposing a live data how do we make

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710
also exposing a live data how do we make
 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.790
also exposing a live data how do we make
this subscription from the view model we

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800
this subscription from the view model we
 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.710
this subscription from the view model we
don't have a life cycle there what if

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720
don't have a life cycle there what if
 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.390
don't have a life cycle there what if
the app is even more complicated and the

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
the app is even more complicated and the
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.580
the app is even more complicated and the
repository is also observing data

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590
repository is also observing data
 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.680

sources in this case well eat one said

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690
sources in this case well eat one said
 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.960
sources in this case well eat one said
to me that if you need a life cycle in

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970
to me that if you need a life cycle in
 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.090
to me that if you need a life cycle in
your view model what do you really want

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100
your view model what do you really want
 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.830
your view model what do you really want
you probably need a transformation but

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840
you probably need a transformation but
 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.899
you probably need a transformation but
it's actually wrong

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909
it's actually wrong
 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:20.649
it's actually wrong
sorry eight so you know what I say is

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659
sorry eight so you know what I say is
 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.289
sorry eight so you know what I say is
that you definitely need a

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:23.299
that you definitely need a
 

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.879
that you definitely need a
transformation don't ever use a

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889
transformation don't ever use a
 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.469
transformation don't ever use a
lifecycle in your view model so

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479
lifecycle in your view model so
 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:32.229
lifecycle in your view model so
different flower so okay how do we make

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:32.239
different flower so okay how do we make
 

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.689
different flower so okay how do we make
the first sample is a bridge between the

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699
the first sample is a bridge between the
 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.819
the first sample is a bridge between the
view and the repository how do we get to

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:36.829
view and the repository how do we get to
 

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:39.759
view and the repository how do we get to
that live data we use of transformations

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:39.769
that live data we use of transformations
 

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:41.979
that live data we use of transformations
map which is what I call a one-to-one

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:41.989
map which is what I call a one-to-one
 

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:44.439
map which is what I call a one-to-one
static transformation in the view model

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449
static transformation in the view model
 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.289
static transformation in the view model
we expose a view a live data in this

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:47.299
we expose a view a live data in this
 

00:06:47.299 --> 00:06:49.379
we expose a view a live data in this
case it's called view model result and

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389
case it's called view model result and
 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.299
case it's called view model result and
it's a result of a transformations map

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:52.309
it's a result of a transformations map
 

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:55.359
it's a result of a transformations map
the first parameter is the source the

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:55.369
the first parameter is the source the
 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.279
the first parameter is the source the
live data source which is a live data

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:57.289
live data source which is a live data
 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.249
live data source which is a live data
exposed by the repository and the second

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259
exposed by the repository and the second
 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.809
exposed by the repository and the second
parameter is a transformation function

00:07:01.809 --> 00:07:01.819
parameter is a transformation function
 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.869
parameter is a transformation function
in this case it's simply converting from

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:04.879
in this case it's simply converting from
 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.509
in this case it's simply converting from
the data layer model to the UI model and

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:07.519
the data layer model to the UI model and
 

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.819
the data layer model to the UI model and
this is how the signature would look

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:09.829
this is how the signature would look
 

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:14.109
this is how the signature would look
like in Kotlin it has source which is a

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:14.119
like in Kotlin it has source which is a
 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:16.839
like in Kotlin it has source which is a
live data of X and it returns a live

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849
live data of X and it returns a live
 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.379
live data of X and it returns a live
data Y so it's a breach of like datas

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:20.389
data Y so it's a breach of like datas
 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.809
data Y so it's a breach of like datas
and then in the in the middle we have a

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:22.819
and then in the in the middle we have a
 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:24.909
and then in the in the middle we have a
transformation function that transforms

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919
transformation function that transforms
 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:27.459
transformation function that transforms
from X to Y it doesn't know anything

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469
from X to Y it doesn't know anything
 

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:32.979
from X to Y it doesn't know anything
about live data so when you establish

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:32.989
about live data so when you establish
 

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:35.019
about live data so when you establish
that transformation the key here is that

00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:35.029
that transformation the key here is that
 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:37.959
that transformation the key here is that
the lifecycle is automatically carried

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:37.969
the lifecycle is automatically carried
 

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:39.159
the lifecycle is automatically carried
over for you

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:39.169
over for you
 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:41.589
over for you
so say you run a transformation of a

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599
so say you run a transformation of a
 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:43.359
so say you run a transformation of a
couple of live data's and at the end it

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:43.369
couple of live data's and at the end it
 

00:07:43.369 --> 00:07:46.299
couple of live data's and at the end it
is a live data that you hold on to when

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:46.309
is a live data that you hold on to when
 

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:48.849
is a live data that you hold on to when
someone subscribes to it that lifecycle

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:48.859
someone subscribes to it that lifecycle
 

00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:51.579
someone subscribes to it that lifecycle
is automatically propagated to the inner

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:51.589
is automatically propagated to the inner
 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.919
is automatically propagated to the inner
live data elements without you doing

00:07:53.919 --> 00:07:53.929
live data elements without you doing
 

00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:55.929
live data elements without you doing
anything and it's completely managed by

00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:55.939
anything and it's completely managed by
 

00:07:55.939 --> 00:07:59.409
anything and it's completely managed by
us so it's completely safe another

00:07:59.409 --> 00:07:59.419
us so it's completely safe another
 

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:02.079
us so it's completely safe another
transformation we provide is switch map

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:02.089
transformation we provide is switch map
 

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:04.719
transformation we provide is switch map
so when do we need this imagine you have

00:08:04.719 --> 00:08:04.729
so when do we need this imagine you have
 

00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:06.099
so when do we need this imagine you have
an application where you have a user

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:06.109
an application where you have a user
 

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:08.499
an application where you have a user
measure that keeps a log the user ID is

00:08:08.499 --> 00:08:08.509
measure that keeps a log the user ID is
 

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:11.409
measure that keeps a log the user ID is
somewhere like a disc and whenever that

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:11.419
somewhere like a disc and whenever that
 

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:13.989
somewhere like a disc and whenever that
block the user ID when you grab it you

00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:13.999
block the user ID when you grab it you
 

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:16.329
block the user ID when you grab it you
need to talk to your user repository to

00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:16.339
need to talk to your user repository to
 

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:18.579
need to talk to your user repository to
get the actual user object and that

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:18.589
get the actual user object and that
 

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:21.069
get the actual user object and that
probably goes to the database and also

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:21.079
probably goes to the database and also
 

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:22.659
probably goes to the database and also
the server to return you this user

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:22.669
the server to return you this user
 

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.939
the server to return you this user
object but that repository turns your

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:24.949
object but that repository turns your
 

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:27.790
object but that repository turns your
live data as well because user object

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800
live data as well because user object
 

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.200
live data as well because user object
might change right it may return

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:29.210
might change right it may return
 

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.210
might change right it may return
the cash fun violate updates from the

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.220
the cash fun violate updates from the
 

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.730
the cash fun violate updates from the
server so your initiation where you have

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:33.740
server so your initiation where you have
 

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:36.550
server so your initiation where you have
a light off a log the user ID and I like

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560
a light off a log the user ID and I like
 

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.320
a light off a log the user ID and I like
that of a user and you need to chain

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:38.330
that of a user and you need to chain
 

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.529
that of a user and you need to chain
these things so networks if you are

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:41.539
these things so networks if you are
 

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:44.320
these things so networks if you are
changing from an idea to a user but how

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:44.330
changing from an idea to a user but how
 

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.420
changing from an idea to a user but how
do we change from an idea to a live date

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:46.430
do we change from an idea to a live date
 

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:49.990
do we change from an idea to a live date
of a user that's switch map so if you

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000
of a user that's switch map so if you
 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.930
of a user that's switch map so if you
look at the that example basically we

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:52.940
look at the that example basically we
 

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.180
look at the that example basically we
call switch memory provided this user ID

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.190
call switch memory provided this user ID
 

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.970
call switch memory provided this user ID
live data that's a live data and then

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:57.980
live data that's a live data and then
 

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.639
live data that's a live data and then
our function this time returns a live

00:09:00.639 --> 00:09:00.649
our function this time returns a live
 

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:03.430
our function this time returns a live
data so the signature looks like this

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440
data so the signature looks like this
 

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.860
data so the signature looks like this
you have a source and at the end you

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:05.870
you have a source and at the end you
 

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.389
you have a source and at the end you
have a live data and you provide a

00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:07.399
have a live data and you provide a
 

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:11.949
have a live data and you provide a
function that converse converts the well

00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959
function that converse converts the well
 

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.680
function that converse converts the well
your ex to a live data what this

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:14.690
your ex to a live data what this
 

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.810
your ex to a live data what this
technically does is every time that user

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:16.820
technically does is every time that user
 

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.269
technically does is every time that user
ID changes it calls your function you

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279
ID changes it calls your function you
 

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.639
ID changes it calls your function you
give it a live live data it R subscribes

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:21.649
give it a live live data it R subscribes
 

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:23.050
give it a live live data it R subscribes
from the previous live data your

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:23.060
from the previous live data your
 

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.360
from the previous live data your

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:25.370
research and that subscribes to the name
 

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.070
research and that subscribes to the name
it's like switching tracks or I think

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:27.080
it's like switching tracks or I think
 

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.460
it's like switching tracks or I think
it's comes from like switchboards but

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:30.470
it's comes from like switchboards but
 

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.620
it's comes from like switchboards but
it's completely managed for you and it's

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:32.630
it's completely managed for you and it's
 

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.510
it's completely managed for you and it's
still life cycle ever you get all the

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:34.520
still life cycle ever you get all the
 

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.350
still life cycle ever you get all the
benefits of using live data now we only

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360
benefits of using live data now we only
 

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.420
benefits of using live data now we only
provide map a switch map we don't have

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:40.430
provide map a switch map we don't have
 

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.610
provide map a switch map we don't have
like a million transformations like some

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:42.620
like a million transformations like some
 

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.560
like a million transformations like some
some other libraries the but this is

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:47.570
some other libraries the but this is
 

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.449
some other libraries the but this is
very limiting and sometimes you may want

00:09:49.449 --> 00:09:49.459
very limiting and sometimes you may want
 

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:51.699
very limiting and sometimes you may want
to write your own and we actually don't

00:09:51.699 --> 00:09:51.709
to write your own and we actually don't
 

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:53.530
to write your own and we actually don't
want to provide many but if you want to

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:53.540
want to provide many but if you want to
 

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.560
want to provide many but if you want to
write your own it's very easy if I show

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:56.570
write your own it's very easy if I show
 

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.050
write your own it's very easy if I show
you our like little the code we have for

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.060
you our like little the code we have for
 

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.210
you our like little the code we have for
the map implementation that was a total

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.220
the map implementation that was a total
 

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.790
the map implementation that was a total
what it does the see resource and it

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800
what it does the see resource and it
 

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.519
what it does the see resource and it
does return the live data and you give

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:06.529
does return the live data and you give
 

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:08.860
does return the live data and you give
it a function right all it does is

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:08.870
it a function right all it does is
 

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.900
it a function right all it does is
creates this mediator live data class

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:10.910
creates this mediator live data class
 

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:14.139
creates this mediator live data class
and adds the given source as a source

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:14.149
and adds the given source as a source
 

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:16.060
and adds the given source as a source
for this mediator live data what in

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.070
for this mediator live data what in
 

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.670
for this mediator live data what in
which it kind of tells us that the value

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680
which it kind of tells us that the value
 

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.650
which it kind of tells us that the value
of this mediator live data is derived

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:20.660
of this mediator live data is derived
 

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.710
of this mediator live data is derived
from this other live data so whenever

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:23.720
from this other live data so whenever
 

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.740
from this other live data so whenever
that other line data changes call my

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:26.750
that other line data changes call my
 

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.269
that other line data changes call my
callback and in the callback we

00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279
callback and in the callback we
 

00:10:28.279 --> 00:10:30.310
callback and in the callback we
basically apply the function to the

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320
basically apply the function to the
 

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.400
basically apply the function to the
value and set as a value on the mediator

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:33.410
value and set as a value on the mediator
 

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.350
value and set as a value on the mediator
live data this is like super simple to

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360
live data this is like super simple to
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.740
live data this is like super simple to
write and there is no life cycle here

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:38.750
write and there is no life cycle here
 

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.900
write and there is no life cycle here
but all of this code is life cycle area

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:42.910
but all of this code is life cycle area
 

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.389
but all of this code is life cycle area
so if it's so easy let's create a new

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399
so if it's so easy let's create a new
 

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:47.370
so if it's so easy let's create a new
one let's say we want to create

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:47.380
one let's say we want to create
 

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.960
one let's say we want to create
something about users filling your form

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:48.970
something about users filling your form
 

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.550
something about users filling your form
you have a bunch of strings and you want

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560
you have a bunch of strings and you want
 

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.620
you have a bunch of strings and you want
to have the total card showing somewhere

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:52.630
to have the total card showing somewhere
 

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.810
to have the total card showing somewhere
so you have a live data and a lender lie

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:54.820
so you have a live data and a lender lie
 

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.840
so you have a live data and a lender lie
data and you basically have a lie date

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.850
data and you basically have a lie date
 

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.060
data and you basically have a lie date
of integer that has the total number of

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.070
of integer that has the total number of
 

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.160
of integer that has the total number of
characters in those li'dat elements and

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.170
characters in those li'dat elements and
 

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.440
characters in those li'dat elements and
this integer updates if any of those

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.450
this integer updates if any of those
 

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.100
this integer updates if any of those
values updates so we called our faction

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.110
values updates so we called our faction
 

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.829
values updates so we called our faction
total line we receive a list of life

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839
total line we receive a list of life
 

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:14.009
total line we receive a list of life
datas and we returned a line data what

00:11:14.009 --> 00:11:14.019
datas and we returned a line data what
 

00:11:14.019 --> 00:11:16.170
datas and we returned a line data what
we do here is we have a sum function

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.180
we do here is we have a sum function
 

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.090
we do here is we have a sum function
it's actually very simple it goes

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:18.100
it's actually very simple it goes
 

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.009
it's actually very simple it goes
through all of the live data and sums

00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:20.019
through all of the live data and sums
 

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:22.500
through all of the live data and sums
their length we need to account for

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:22.510
their length we need to account for
 

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.470
their length we need to account for
nulls here because why data allows now

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480
nulls here because why data allows now
 

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.870
nulls here because why data allows now
so you need to be aware of it but this

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880
so you need to be aware of it but this
 

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.400
so you need to be aware of it but this
is very simple it's basically look at

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:29.410
is very simple it's basically look at
 

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.190
is very simple it's basically look at
all the live data values and sum total

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200
all the live data values and sum total
 

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.030
all the live data values and sum total
length once we did that we add each

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040
length once we did that we add each
 

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.980
length once we did that we add each
given live data as a source store

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:37.990
given live data as a source store
 

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.220
given live data as a source store
mediator which basically says the value

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:41.230
mediator which basically says the value
 

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:43.319
mediator which basically says the value
of this mediator depends on these other

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:43.329
of this mediator depends on these other
 

00:11:43.329 --> 00:11:45.840
of this mediator depends on these other
live data so anytime any of them changes

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:45.850
live data so anytime any of them changes
 

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.389
live data so anytime any of them changes
the frame rate calls back I will do some

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399
the frame rate calls back I will do some
 

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:50.880
the frame rate calls back I will do some
function which calculates the new value

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:50.890
function which calculates the new value
 

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.400
function which calculates the new value
for the mediator live data and this is

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.410
for the mediator live data and this is
 

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.829
for the mediator live data and this is
it it's like four lines of code and you

00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839
it it's like four lines of code and you
 

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:58.800
it it's like four lines of code and you
have a operation a transformation or

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:58.810
have a operation a transformation or
 

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.630
have a operation a transformation or
your light data's now there are some

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:03.640
your light data's now there are some
 

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.490
your light data's now there are some
common mistakes you can make while using

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:05.500
common mistakes you can make while using
 

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.920
common mistakes you can make while using
live data and want to touch base on

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:07.930
live data and want to touch base on
 

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.220
live data and want to touch base on
these things what one thing we see a lot

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.230
these things what one thing we see a lot
 

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.590
these things what one thing we see a lot
is let's say you have you make a web

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600
is let's say you have you make a web
 

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.630
is let's say you have you make a web
request it returns a giant jason and

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:15.640
request it returns a giant jason and
 

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.519
request it returns a giant jason and
then you're converted to your objects

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:17.529
then you're converted to your objects
 

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:20.040
then you're converted to your objects
using a live data transformation for

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:20.050
using a live data transformation for
 

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.290
using a live data transformation for
doing that is not a good idea because

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:22.300
doing that is not a good idea because
 

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.350
doing that is not a good idea because
light it is a value holders so the

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360
light it is a value holders so the
 

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.030
light it is a value holders so the
launch string your fish from your server

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040
launch string your fish from your server
 

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.579
launch string your fish from your server
is going to stay in memory it's going to

00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:29.589
is going to stay in memory it's going to
 

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:31.470
is going to stay in memory it's going to
hold on to that so you probably don't

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:31.480
hold on to that so you probably don't
 

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.750
hold on to that so you probably don't
want to use live data for something like

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760
want to use live data for something like
 

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.400
want to use live data for something like
that it's not just we there's a one-shot

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:35.410
that it's not just we there's a one-shot
 

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.480
that it's not just we there's a one-shot
operation okay the second item is about

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.490
operation okay the second item is about
 

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:43.380
operation okay the second item is about
sharing instances of live data at one

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:43.390
sharing instances of live data at one
 

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.060
sharing instances of live data at one
point I was trying to make an app with

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.070
point I was trying to make an app with
 

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:49.860
point I was trying to make an app with
live data and I had a repository that

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:49.870
live data and I had a repository that
 

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.050
live data and I had a repository that
was a singleton and it was only one

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:52.060
was a singleton and it was only one
 

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.340
was a singleton and it was only one
observer in the activity

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.350
observer in the activity
 

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.829
observer in the activity
so I said okay I can just save some like

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839
so I said okay I can just save some like
 

00:12:55.839 --> 00:12:56.510
so I said okay I can just save some like
data's

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:56.520
data's
 

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.120
data's
and share a single life data I had

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.130
and share a single life data I had
 

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.340
and share a single life data I had
something like this repository it takes

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.350
something like this repository it takes
 

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.090
something like this repository it takes
a data source and then the mutable life

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100
a data source and then the mutable life
 

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.010
a data source and then the mutable life
data that we are returning in load item

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.020
data that we are returning in load item
 

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.100
data that we are returning in load item
is shared by everyone that calls load

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:10.110
is shared by everyone that calls load
 

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.630
is shared by everyone that calls load
item now this is fine it works but

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:14.640
item now this is fine it works but
 

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.630
item now this is fine it works but
there's a very interesting edge case and

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:16.640
there's a very interesting edge case and
 

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.120
there's a very interesting edge case and
this this anti-pattern is about you

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:20.130
this this anti-pattern is about you
 

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.080
this this anti-pattern is about you
thinking which observers are going to be

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:23.090
thinking which observers are going to be
 

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.050
thinking which observers are going to be
active and the edge case is activity

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060
active and the edge case is activity
 

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.560
active and the edge case is activity
transitions there is this case in

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:30.570
transitions there is this case in
 

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.390
transitions there is this case in
Android where two activities are going

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:32.400
Android where two activities are going
 

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.210
Android where two activities are going
to be active at the same time so imagine

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:35.220
to be active at the same time so imagine
 

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.970
to be active at the same time so imagine
activity one observes item number one an

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980
activity one observes item number one an
 

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:40.160
activity one observes item number one an
activity to observes item number two

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.170
activity to observes item number two
 

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.890
activity to observes item number two
when we load activity two is going to

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:44.900
when we load activity two is going to
 

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.750
when we load activity two is going to
load data for item two but because they

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760
load data for item two but because they
 

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.120
load data for item two but because they
are sharing the same life data activity

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.130
are sharing the same life data activity
 

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.740
are sharing the same life data activity
one is also going to receive that data

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:51.750
one is also going to receive that data
 

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.080
one is also going to receive that data
and because it's in the middle of an

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.090
and because it's in the middle of an
 

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.640
and because it's in the middle of an
animation you're gonna see a flash you

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:55.650
animation you're gonna see a flash you
 

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.400
animation you're gonna see a flash you
can see a glitch and obviously that's a

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.410
can see a glitch and obviously that's a
 

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.380
can see a glitch and obviously that's a
very bad user experience

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:00.390
very bad user experience
 

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.050
very bad user experience
yeah basic like class like a poster and

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060
yeah basic like class like a poster and
 

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.420
yeah basic like class like a poster and
you created a field that's an instance

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:05.430
you created a field that's an instance
 

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.520
you created a field that's an instance
of life data you're probably doing it

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:07.530
of life data you're probably doing it
 

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.800
of life data you're probably doing it
wrong yeah the solution obviously is to

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:09.810
wrong yeah the solution obviously is to
 

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.740
wrong yeah the solution obviously is to
create a life data every time it's very

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:12.750
create a life data every time it's very
 

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.210
create a life data every time it's very
lightweight you're not going to save

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.220
lightweight you're not going to save
 

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.780
lightweight you're not going to save
much by avoiding this the third item is

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:17.790
much by avoiding this the third item is
 

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:21.410
much by avoiding this the third item is
about where and when to create your

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420
about where and when to create your
 

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.240
about where and when to create your
transformations and this is all about

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:23.250
transformations and this is all about
 

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.140
transformations and this is all about
wiring it's similar to when you create a

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.150
wiring it's similar to when you create a
 

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:29.000
wiring it's similar to when you create a
circuit you lay down your components and

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:29.010
circuit you lay down your components and
 

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:32.180
circuit you lay down your components and
you wire everything up and for a known

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:32.190
you wire everything up and for a known
 

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:33.980
you wire everything up and for a known
set of inputs you're going to have an

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:33.990
set of inputs you're going to have an
 

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:36.590
set of inputs you're going to have an
own set of outputs but you don't unplug

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600
own set of outputs but you don't unplug
 

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.660
own set of outputs but you don't unplug
a wire while it's in operation and plug

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:38.670
a wire while it's in operation and plug
 

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.270
a wire while it's in operation and plug
it somewhere else right this is exactly

what this view model is doing lots of

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.010
what this view model is doing lots of
 

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.280
what this view model is doing lots of
horrible things happening in this view

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.290
horrible things happening in this view
 

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:51.770
horrible things happening in this view
model by wait for it for starters don't

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:51.780
model by wait for it for starters don't
 

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:57.460
model by wait for it for starters don't
do this in this slide it's literally

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:57.470
 

00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.170
someone will copy past it and then blame

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.180
someone will copy past it and then blame
 

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.600
someone will copy past it and then blame
us for recommending it that's the

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:02.610
us for recommending it that's the
 

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.880
us for recommending it that's the
standard way of doing it so first it's

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:04.890
standard way of doing it so first it's
 

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.000
standard way of doing it so first it's
exposing item data which is a variable

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.010
exposing item data which is a variable
 

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.720
exposing item data which is a variable
it's not a vowel it's a vow

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:09.730
it's not a vowel it's a vow
 

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.869
it's not a vowel it's a vow
and also it's exposing immutable life

00:15:12.869 --> 00:15:12.879
and also it's exposing immutable life
 

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:16.409
and also it's exposing immutable life
data almost you should almost never do

00:15:16.409 --> 00:15:16.419
data almost you should almost never do
 

00:15:16.419 --> 00:15:19.079
data almost you should almost never do
this two-way data-binding is the

00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:19.089
this two-way data-binding is the
 

00:15:19.089 --> 00:15:21.210
this two-way data-binding is the
exception to this maybe you should

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:21.220
exception to this maybe you should
 

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.650
exception to this maybe you should
always expose something that is

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:22.660
always expose something that is
 

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.989
always expose something that is
immutable so that our your observers

00:15:24.989 --> 00:15:24.999
immutable so that our your observers
 

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:26.269
immutable so that our your observers
can't change it

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279
can't change it
 

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:29.849
can't change it
so after subscription we call load data

00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:29.859
so after subscription we call load data
 

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:32.639
so after subscription we call load data
from our activity to set the ID of the

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:32.649
from our activity to set the ID of the
 

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:34.829
from our activity to set the ID of the
thing that we want to load and then we

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839
thing that we want to load and then we
 

00:15:34.839 --> 00:15:36.869
thing that we want to load and then we
are reassigning item data to something

00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:36.879
are reassigning item data to something
 

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:39.479
are reassigning item data to something
new but the subscription already

00:15:39.479 --> 00:15:39.489
new but the subscription already
 

00:15:39.489 --> 00:15:41.999
new but the subscription already
happened so the observer is not going to

00:15:41.999 --> 00:15:42.009
happened so the observer is not going to
 

00:15:42.009 --> 00:15:45.539
happened so the observer is not going to
know that you made this reassignment the

00:15:45.539 --> 00:15:45.549
know that you made this reassignment the
 

00:15:45.549 --> 00:15:47.939
know that you made this reassignment the
solution like actually even if you're

00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:47.949
solution like actually even if you're
 

00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:50.729
solution like actually even if you're
returning the light data' there and your

00:15:50.729 --> 00:15:50.739
returning the light data' there and your
 

00:15:50.739 --> 00:15:54.269
returning the light data' there and your
observers subscribe like that' now it is

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279
observers subscribe like that' now it is
 

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.069
observers subscribe like that' now it is
subscribed to the previous one and the

00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079
subscribed to the previous one and the
 

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.869
subscribed to the previous one and the
new one because you never remove the

00:15:57.869 --> 00:15:57.879
new one because you never remove the
 

00:15:57.879 --> 00:16:00.479
new one because you never remove the
subscription so the solution to this

00:16:00.479 --> 00:16:00.489
subscription so the solution to this
 

00:16:00.489 --> 00:16:04.349
subscription so the solution to this
requires a little bit of plumbing we

00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:04.359
requires a little bit of plumbing we
 

00:16:04.359 --> 00:16:06.659
requires a little bit of plumbing we
have to like datas one is mutable and

00:16:06.659 --> 00:16:06.669
have to like datas one is mutable and
 

00:16:06.669 --> 00:16:09.090
have to like datas one is mutable and
