00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.440
In the last video, I hinted that
things were about to get wacky.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.810
And they are.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.570
So if we start where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.090
we started right over here,
looking at the distance

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.320
to the nearest star.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.600
And just as a reminder,
in this drawing

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.480
right here, this
depiction right here,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.910
this circle right here,
this solar system circle,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.520
it's not the size of the Sun.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.590
It's not the size of the
orbits of the Earth, or Pluto,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.220
or the Kuiper Belt.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.120
This is close to the
size of the Oort Cloud.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.280
And the actual orbit of
Earth is about-- well,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.530
the diameter of the orbit
of Earth is about 1/50,000

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.160
of this.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.660
So you wouldn't
even see it on this.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.170
It would not even make
up a pixel on this screen

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.760
right here, much
less the actual size

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.470
of the Sun or
something much smaller.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.820
And just remember that
orbit of the Earth,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.660
that was at a huge distance.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.220
It takes eight minutes for
light to get from the Sun

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.850
to the Earth, this
super long distance.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.020
If you shot a bullet
at the Sun from Earth,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.974
it would take you that 17 years
to actually get to the Sun.

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:06.890
So one thing, this huge
distance wouldn't even

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.180
show up on this picture.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.790
Now, what we saw
in the last video

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.510
is that if you travel at
unimaginably fast speeds,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.950
if you travel at 60,000
kilometers per hour--

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.790
and I picked that
speed because that's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.800
how fast Voyager 1
actually is traveling.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.660
That's I think
the fastest object

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.810
we have out there
in space right here.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.940
And it's actually kind of
leaving the solar system

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.400
as we speak.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.270
But even if you were
able to get that fast,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.600
it would still take 80,000
years, 75,000 or 80,000 years,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.480
to travel the 4.2 light
years to the Alpha Centauri

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.510
cluster of stars.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.805
To the nearest star, it
would take 80,000 years.

00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:55.930
And that scale of time is
already an amount of time

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.990
that I have trouble
comprehending.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.080
As you can imagine, all
of modern civilization

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.580
has occurred, well, definitely
in the last 10,000 years.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.850
But most of recorded history
is in the last 4,000 or 5,000

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.350
years.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.231
So this is 80,000 years to
travel to the nearest star.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.230
So it's a huge distance.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.830
Another way to think about
it is if the Sun were

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.270
the size of a basketball and you
put that basketball in London,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.700
if you wanted to do it in scale,
the next closest star, which

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.100
is actually a
smaller basketball,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.290
right over here, Proxima
Centauri, that smaller

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.090
basketball you would have
to put in Kiev, Ukraine

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.900
in order to have
a similar scale.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.020
So these are basketballs
sitting in these cities.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.150
And you would have to
travel about 1,200 miles

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.010
to place the next basketball.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.830
And these basketballs
are representing

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.610
these super huge things that
we saw in the first video.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.000
The Sun, if you actually
made the Earth relative

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660
to these basketballs, these
would be little grains of sand.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.670
So there are any little
small planets over here,

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.310
they would have to
be grains of sand

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.900
in Kiev, Ukraine versus the
grain of sand in London.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.970
So this is a massive,
massive distance,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.869
already, at least in
my mind, unimaginable.

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.410
And when it gets
really wacky is when

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.784
you start really
looking at this.

00:03:12.784 --> 00:03:16.010
Even this is a super,
super small distance

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.590
relative to the galactic scale.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.180
So this whole depiction of kind
of our neighborhood of stars,

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:30.267
this thing over here is
about, give or take--

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:32.100
and we're doing rough
estimates right here--

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.030
it's about 30 light years.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.050
I'll just do LY for short.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.420
So that's about 30 light years,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.972
And once again, you can
take pictures of our galaxy

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:45.930
from our point of view.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.960
But you actually can't take
a picture of the whole galaxy

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.710
from above it.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.760
So these are going to
be artists' depictions.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.280
But if this is 30 light years,
this drawing right here of kind

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.560
of our local neighborhood
of the galaxy,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.460
this right here is roughly-- and
these are all approximations.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.520
Let me do this in
a darker color.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.780
This is about 1,000 light years.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.240
And this is the
1,000 light years

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.990
of our Sun's neighborhood,
if you can even

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.190
call it a neighborhood anymore.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.220
Even this isn't really a
neighborhood if it takes you

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.209
80,000 years to get to
your nearest neighbor.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.990
But this whole
drawing over here--

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.540
now, it would take forever
to get anywhere over here--

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.260
it would be 1/30 of this.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.952
So it would be about that
big, this whole drawing.

00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:35.660
And what's really
going to blow your mind

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.880
is this would be roughly
a little bit more

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.890
than a pixel on this
drawing right here, that

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.615
spans a 1,000 light years.

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:42.990
But then when you
start to really

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.330
put it into
perspective-- so now,

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.500
let's zoom out a little bit--
so this drawing right here,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.300
this 1,000 light years is
now this 1,000 light years

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.440
over here.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.925
So this is the local
vicinity of the Sun.

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:56.610
And once again,
the word "local" is

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.290
used in a very liberal
way at this point.

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.836
So this right here
is 1,000 light years.

00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:07.210
If you're sitting
here and you're

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.160
looking at an object
that's sitting--

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.000
let me do this in
a darker color--

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.690
if we're sitting here on Earth
and we're looking at an object

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.170
out here that's 500
light years away,

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.730
we're looking at it as it was
500 years ago because the light

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.690
that is reaching our
eyeballs right now,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.160
or our telescopes
right now, left

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.739
this guy over here
500 years ago.

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:32.780
In fact, he's not going
to even be there anymore.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.730
He probably has moved
around a little bit.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.700
So just even on
this scale, we're

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.000
talking about these
unimaginably huge distances.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.680
And then when we
zoom out, this is

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.500
kind of our local part of
the galaxy right over here.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.110
This piece right here, this
is called the Orion Spur.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:50.750
And people are still
trying to work out

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.480
exactly the details
of the actual shape

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.800
the Milky Way Galaxy,
the galaxy that we're in.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.470
But we're pretty
sure-- actually,

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.541
we're very sure-- we
have these spiral arms

00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.040
and we have these
spurs off of them.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.380
But it's actually very hard to
come up with the actual shape,

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.620
especially because you can't
see a lot of the galaxy,

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.244
because it's kind of
on the other side,

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:11.769
on the other side of the center.

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:13.560
But really just to get
a sense of something

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.860
that at least-- I mean it blows
my mind if you really think

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.400
about what it's saying--
these unbelievable distances

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.700
show up as a little dot here.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.410
This whole drawing
shows up as a dot here.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.640
Now when we zoom out,
over here that dot

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.050
would no longer even show up.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.090
It wouldn't even
register a pixel

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.630
on this drawing right over here.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.670
And then this whole drawing,
this whole thing right

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:42.425
over here, this whole picture
is this grid right over here.

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:46.850
It is this right over here.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.250
So hopefully, that gives you
a sense of how small even

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.851
our local neighborhood
is relative to the galaxy

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:55.350
as a whole.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.220
And the galaxy as a whole,
just to give you a sense,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:07.050
has 200 to 400 billion stars.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.240
Or maybe I should say
solar systems just

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.490
to give you a sense that
when we saw the solar system,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.500
it's not just the Sun.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.590
There's all this
neat, dynamic stuff.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.950
And there are planets, and
asteroids, and solar winds.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.950
And so there's 200
to 400 billion stars

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.310
and for the most part, 200
and 400 billion solar systems.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:34.650
So it's an unimaginably, I
guess, complex or huge place.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.010
And just to make
it clear, even when

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.970
we zoom in to this
picture right here,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.510
and I think it was obvious
based on telling you about this,

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.030
that these little white
pockets right here,

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.864
this isn't one star.

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:46.738
This isn't two stars.

00:07:46.738 --> 00:07:48.290
These are thousands
of stars here.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.040
So when you go over here,
each little blotch of white

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.220
that you see, that's not a star,
that's not a thousand stars.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.320
We're starting to talk
in the millions of stars

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.579
when you look at certain
blotches here and there.

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.870
I mean, maybe it might be
one star that's closer to you

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.810
or might be a million
stars that are far apart

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:04.910
and that are just
relatively close together.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:09.052
And everything has to be used
in kind of loose terms here.

00:08:09.052 --> 00:08:10.760
And we'll talk more
about other galaxies.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.542
But even this isn't the
upper bound of galaxies.

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:15.000
People believe the
Andromeda Galaxy

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.930
has a trillion stars in it,
a trillion solar systems.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.120
We're talking about these
huge, huge, immense distances.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.250
And so just to give you a sense
of where we fit in the picture,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.940
this is a rough
location of our Sun.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.140
And remember, that little
dot I drew just now

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.799
is including millions of stars,
millions of solar systems,

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.950
already unimaginable
the distances.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.700
But if you really want
to get at the sense

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.750
relative to the whole galaxy,
this is an artist's depiction.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.620
Once again, we could
never obviously get

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.075
this perspective on the galaxy.

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:45.700
It would take us
forever to travel this

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.590
far so that you could see
the galaxy from above.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.110
But this is our
best guess looking

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.020
at things from
our vantage point.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.692
And we actually can't even
see this whole area over here

00:08:55.692 --> 00:08:58.150
because it's on the other side
of the center of the galaxy,

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.030
which is super, super
dense and super bright.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.280
And so it's very hard to see
things on the other side.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.300
We think-- or actually there's
a super massive black hole

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.630
at the center of the galaxy.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.010
And we think that they're at the
center of all or most galaxies.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.350
But you know the whole point
of this video, actually

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.760
this whole series of videos,
this is just kind of-- I

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.311
don't know-- to put you in awe
a little bit of just how huge

00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:21.810
this is.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.940
Because when you really
think about the scale--

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.040
I don't know-- no words
can really describe it.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.950
But just to give
you a sense, we're

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:39.870
about 25,000 light years from
the center of the galaxy.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.330
So even when we look at things
in the center of the galaxy,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.120
that's as they were
25,000 years ago.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.580
It took 25,000 years for
that light to get to us.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.030
I mean when that light left
the center of the galaxy,

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:56.390
I won't even guess to
think what humanity

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.170
was like at that point in time.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.120
So it's these huge distances
in the whole galaxy over here.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.106
And once again,
like solar systems,

00:10:04.106 --> 00:10:06.730
it's hard to say the edge of the
galaxy, because there's always

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.584
going to be a few more stars
and other things orbiting

00:10:09.584 --> 00:10:11.750
around the galaxy as you
go further and further out,

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.460
but it gets less
dense with stars.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.650
But the main density,
the main disk,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.756
is about 100,000 light years.

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:24.560
100,000 light years is
the diameter roughly

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.490
of the main part of the galaxy.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.460
And it's about 1,000
light years thick.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.290
So you can kind of
imagine it as this disk,

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.540
this thing that's fairly flat.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.790
But it's 1,000
light years thick.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.340
It's 1,000 light years thick.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.010
You would have to do this
distance 250 times just

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.450
to go from the top part of
the galaxy to the bottom part,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.320
much less going
across the galaxy.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.560
So it might seem
relatively flat.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.050
But it's still immensely,
immensely thick.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.360
And just as another
way to visualize it,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.270
if this thing right over here
that includes the Oort Cloud,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:05.800
roughly a light year in
diameter, is a grain of sand,

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.610
a millimeter in
diameter grain of sand,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.170
then the universe
as a whole is going

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.580
to be the diameter
of a football field.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.240
And that might tell you, OK,
those are two tractable things.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.770
I can imagine a grain of sand,
a millimeter wide grain of sand

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.750
in a football field.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:29.580
But remember, that
grain of sand is still

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.380
50,000 or 60,000 times the
diameter of Earth's orbit.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.450
And Earth's orbit,
it would still

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.900
take a bullet or something
traveling as fast as a jet

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.630
plane 15 hours to just go
half of that-- or sorry,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:46.540
not-- 15 years or 17 years,
I forgot the exact number.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.500
But it was 15, 16, 17
years to even cover

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.660
half of that distance.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.960
So 30 years just to cover the
diameter of Earth's orbit.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.450
That's 1/60,000 of our little
grain of sand in the football

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.160
field.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.950
And just to kind
of really, I don't

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:11.430
know, have an appreciation
for how mind-blowing

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.210
this really is, this is actually
a picture of the Milky Way

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.360
Galaxy, our galaxy,
from our vantage point.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.330
As you can see,
we're in the galaxy

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.690
and this is looking
towards the center.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.830
And even this picture, you start
to appreciate the complexity

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.760
of what 100 billion stars are.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.341
But what I really
want to point out

00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:30.840
is even in this
picture, when you're

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.715
looking at these things,
some of these things

00:12:32.715 --> 00:12:35.340
that look like stars,
those aren't stars.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.660
those are thousands of
stars or millions of stars.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.630
Maybe it could be
one star closer up.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.630
But when we're
starting to approach

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.088
the center of the
galaxy, these are

00:12:43.088 --> 00:12:44.680
thousands and
thousands and millions

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.580
of stars or solar systems that
we're actually looking at.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.810
So really, it starts
to boggle the mind

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.930
to imagine what might actually
be going on over there.
