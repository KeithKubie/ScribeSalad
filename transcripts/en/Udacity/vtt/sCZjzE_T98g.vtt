00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.558
And we're live.

00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; Hey, everybody.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.500
Today, Jordan and
I will be going, hello, Jordan.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.460
We're going to be going over how to
go from a mockup to a full website.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.530
Full website here being HTML and CSS.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.160
So basically how to take
to start from an idea and

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.090
a design, and put it into actual code so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.730
that it can be visible to
the web just in HTML and CSS.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.990
Obviously, you could probably
also just make an image of it and

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.380
put it on a some interesting
website error, but

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.540
that's not really what
we're looking to do here.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.110
So to start with,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.940
I suppose we can go into, mockups are
generally used because it's easier to

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.250
design a mockup than it is to just
start coding and try to make a website.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.750
So you generally have
either a group of people or

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.670
a person whose job it is to
actually make mockups there.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.990
That is after all more art
than technical skills.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.289
And then from there you give it
to a front-end web designer and

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.515
they would start actually making
it into an actual website.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.570
&gt;&gt; And
yeah if you want to do this yourself,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.827
there's a bunch of different
tools you can use to do mockups.

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:30.430
You can make them in Photoshop,
it's pretty common.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.530
You can make them,
there is a software called Balsamiq,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.100
you can also make mockups there.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.400
What are some, do you have any other
ideas of what to use to make mockups?

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.354
&gt;&gt; Some people actually
use literal paper.

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:47.329
&gt;&gt; Yeah, paper's a good one too.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.868
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.830
&gt;&gt; Forgot about that.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.500
&gt;&gt; But, and they might actually cut
things out and sort of make it human.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.338
Think of it as arts and crafts, that's
sort of like what they actually do.

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.753
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then-

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:04.380
&gt;&gt; But for their redesign they actually

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.220
cut out little pieces of paper and
use that as their design mockups.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.370
So it's, you know, everybody uses it.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.210
&gt;&gt; So
that that's what we'll be doing today.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.854
We'll actually be using the same mockup
that you might have seen in class.

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:24.823
So just to show that here,
Miguel screen share.

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:34.823
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:41.457 --> 00:02:46.330
So this is actually what
I was doing right now.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.020
This is the mockup that we'll be using.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.000
So Udacity symbol up top, name, but this
is basically supposed to be a resume

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.079
type of thing unless you're showing off
some featured work with some images.

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.720
The mockup is actually just the portion
to the right of this white space.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.130
This is just designating which
colors are going to be used.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.440
These are how the colors look.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.020
These are the actual color hex.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.630
What's the actual word for
that I don't know, I'm forgetting.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.990
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; The word for the hex, the hex colors.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.350
Is it hex colors?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.110
&gt;&gt; Hex decimal codes?

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.424
&gt;&gt; Yeah, It's just a code for
the colors.

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:32.830
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.508
&gt;&gt; So that's what we will be trying
to do here, and we'll do it more or

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:37.636
less from scratch.

00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:44.208
So let's open up Sublime and go.

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:47.964
So the two main things we'll be using
here are Sublime and the browser,

00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:50.980
since we'll be opening it up
in our browser quite often.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.307
So let's screen share Sublime.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:05.667
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:12.008
So what we'll be doing here, hopefully
everyone can see that very blank screen.

00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:13.726
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, I can see it.

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:15.823
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:15.823 --> 00:04:19.380
So what we'll be doing here is first
we'll just make an HTML file since

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.019
that's what will be using with it.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.120
Sorry, I'm resizing everything,
making the font a little bit bigger.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.010
So, first we'll save this.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.440
We'll do it, and I think this
is my blank thing right here,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.600
or some other blank thing right here.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.616
And we'll just call it
a webpage Because I'm

00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:47.516
really talented when
coming up with names.

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:52.770
So just webpage.html,

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.430
so I should be able to just type in
HTML and it sort of fills in the very,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.030
very basics with me for Sublime
because I installed the HTML autofill.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.510
&gt;&gt; I've never seen that before.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.210
So what, you just type HTML and
press Enter?

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.330
&gt;&gt; Tab, but yeah.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.769
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; You can, if you want to look into how

00:05:12.769 --> 00:05:18.624
to make Sublime work like that for
you, then it's just Install Package.

00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:23.354
Google it,
it's not that complicated, but

00:05:23.354 --> 00:05:26.595
it's not that simple either.

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:33.315
So from there,
let's just add some really basic stuff,

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:37.236
like let's add a character set,

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:42.291
our title,
what should we call our title.

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:45.008
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:05:45.008 --> 00:05:46.448
&gt;&gt; My web page.

00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:48.793
Looks [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:48.793 --> 00:05:55.394
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:05:55.394 --> 00:06:00.346
&gt;&gt; This webpage for mock up,
and then of course an important

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:05.000
thing is we're going to have
to link it to some CSS, so.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.760
I'll link to, I'll call it style.css.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.517
And that means I also have
to make some actual CSS.

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.804
So let's open a new tab here.

00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:31.307
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:32.399
I don't want a new window.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:33.600
How do I just make a new tab?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.190
&gt;&gt; You can make make a new
tab by just make new file.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.640
&gt;&gt; Probably, that makes sense.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:52.095
Okay, so we'll just save this really
quick as, I think I said style.css.

00:06:52.095 --> 00:06:54.393
That's there.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.880
So hopefully that looks like it works.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.750
Okay so
you can see both of those things.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.170
Now for mockups.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.440
So do you want to screen
share the mockup I sent you.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.917
&gt;&gt; In that second half [CROSSTALK].

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:22.602
Now, lets see.

00:07:22.602 --> 00:07:32.602
[NOISE].

00:07:33.694 --> 00:07:38.524
&gt;&gt; Hello, Mr. Pasco,
feel free to ask your questions.

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:47.400
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.745
Cool, question.

00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:55.373
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I'll just keep on going
on about what we'll be doing next.

00:07:55.373 --> 00:08:00.767
[CROSSTALK] From the mockup, we'll be
dividing, generally we'll divide it into

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:06.398
a grid of 12, that grid of 12 will allow
us to actually make four side-by-side,

00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:11.190
three side-by-side,
two side-by-side, just one.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:16.190
So that's how we're going to divide up
the page into a bunch of different boxes

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.780
that boxes inside boxes.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.730
And on an actual mockup you
might actually draw those in.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.350
And you might literally just
drop boxes around what you want

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:29.540
to put as your different DIV.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.085
And then, we'll be using basically so
that we can get the mockup.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.178
The mockup has at most three
side by side pictures like

00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:46.150
dividing the screen into thirds.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.550
Generally we'll divide
it into a grid of 12,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:57.041
that grid of 12 will allow us to
actually make four side-by-side,

00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:02.450
three side-by-side,
two side-by-side, just one.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.310
It's divisible by all those things.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:10.400
It's sort of the standard for
what you'd use for something like this.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.268
Anyway.

00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:17.087
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:09:17.087 --> 00:09:20.992
Let's move on then.

00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:22.770
&gt;&gt; Mac, all right, yeah,

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.620
the screen wasn't-
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.390
&gt;&gt; Log out, back in, but, we good now?

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.170
&gt;&gt; I'll actually copy and
paste this from the actual,

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.620
something you could have
downloaded from the course.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.120
It's basically just,
we're going to make some CSS for

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.790
every single possible column between
one and twelve, and every row.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:50.450
And we're going to be
doing that by putting

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:58.247
this to this end, so each column has a
specified width, and if you would find.

00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:02.750
&gt;&gt; Can you increase your
text size a little bit?

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.806
&gt;&gt; Sure, can you see?

00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:05.997
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:12.490
&gt;&gt; Okay
&gt;&gt; Fair, so hopefully this works.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.380
The column width, this is just what you
get when you have 100 divided by 12.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.270
And then you just double it or
not double it, but

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.760
you increase by 8.3 every time.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.370
And so we have one through 12.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.360
And then we have a row for
something that takes up the entire

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.230
entirety of the screen
with just the 100% here.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:41.270
This margin bottom,
I suppose I could delete for the moment,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.930
it's just specifying that we're
not have a margin here and

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.850
that we're going to be
able to flex the screen.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:53.500
So if you move things in and out, it'll
be it'll keep images from overlapping.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:01.220
&gt;From not resizing basically
our text from doing the same.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.340
So, that's where we'll start.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.670
So, now let's start adding in
some stuff with our bodies.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.391
So, let's I believe we may
have to make a class grid.

00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:17.327
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:11:17.327 --> 00:11:21.051
I forgot to do this.

00:11:21.051 --> 00:11:24.200
So again, opening closing tags there.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.252
I think I actually
forgot that in the CSS,

00:11:27.252 --> 00:11:32.450
it will also need the grid that
sort of pulls everything together.

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.220
With an x width and all that stuff.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:35.800
So back to CSS.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:45.239
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:11:45.239 --> 00:11:49.639
Okay, so now that we have the grid,

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:53.459
let's put that in right away.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:57.987
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:11:57.987 --> 00:11:59.554
And then that's just what our,

00:11:59.554 --> 00:12:03.130
this is basically our whole body
is going to be inside that grid.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:08.120
So this is, I'm not actually sure
how necessary that technically was

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.290
because we could've just had said for
what we have for grid here is body.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.260
If we're going to have
the entire body inside the grid,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.770
but probably better practice.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:25.360
Anyway, let's make a class for
the top, and I keep on forgetting.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:33.380
Autofill can get a little annoying,
because sometimes it wants to fill in

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.430
more than you actually want.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.701
Let's have, lets see, actually,

00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:44.040
first let's draw some
lines around the mock up.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:50.374
I'll stop screen-sharing and share

00:12:50.374 --> 00:12:59.511
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:12:59.511 --> 00:13:01.031
I already stopped screen sharing, sorry.

00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.853
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:13:03.853 --> 00:13:11.294
I'll share the image I want to share
there, which will be, where are you?

00:13:11.294 --> 00:13:16.098
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:13:16.098 --> 00:13:17.957
So in the course you'll have noticed,

00:13:17.957 --> 00:13:23.697
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:13:23.697 --> 00:13:27.190
this image, at some point,
where they draw some boxes.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.910
So you have a big box
on the outside over

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:37.470
here, around basically
like a type of header.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.490
It has the Udacity logo inside
of it on the far right, and

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.290
it has a smaller box designating the,

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.500
designating the person and
sort of just a title right over here.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.930
Then you're going to have, I don't
really know if you necessarily need

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:59.330
a box because that's sort of
picked up the whole row anyway.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.950
But you kind of can have a box here and
then you'd have

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.020
another box, probably right here,

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.170
and then around all of this,
where this is this is a box,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:20.355
and then each one of these would be,
also another box.

00:14:20.355 --> 00:14:25.353
So, right here,

00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:30.090
right here and right here.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:40.110
That's sort of what we'll try to match
up here by making a grid like that.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.810
&gt;&gt; So for each big horizontal block,
so it'd be one row, right?

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:53.290
And then for
each smaller box it'd be one column.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.297
&gt;&gt; That is the idea.

00:14:55.297 --> 00:14:58.837
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:00.417
So let's screen share again.

00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:10.807
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:15:10.807 --> 00:15:13.094
Hopefully you can still see.

00:15:13.094 --> 00:15:14.253
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:15:14.253 --> 00:15:19.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, so first I believe,
sorry you can see the

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.810
&gt;&gt; The mockup?

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can't see
the mockup at the same time.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.440
Maybe you could share that at the same
time so that they have a small tiny

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.180
little thing in the corner fto
stare at or what I'm trying to do.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.800
Is that possible?

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.580
Can two people share something
at the same time and

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.560
have it just zoomed in on that one?

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.920
&gt;&gt; I think it shows mine as
a little thing in the corner.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.877
&gt;&gt; Okay, well let's do that.

00:15:52.877 --> 00:15:59.096
So we don't know really need so
first let's just make the boxes.

00:15:59.096 --> 00:16:04.374
So first we'll have a row inside of

00:16:04.374 --> 00:16:09.840
that will have the Udacity symbol.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.533
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:17.520
Let's say that that's
about the second column.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.751
And we'll get to about the second column

00:16:18.751 --> 00:16:28.751
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.270
I don't know, I keep on hoping for
it auto fill in, and it's not going to.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.120
So we'll have one there.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.380
We're just making these boxes with
nothing in them at the moment.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.730
So let's make another.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.370
This one can probably
go wherever we want it.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.520
Somewhere between six and ten.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.834
It's going to be right shifted,
so let's just say ten.

00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:59.080
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.562
But this is the title.

00:17:00.562 --> 00:17:08.700
[BLANK AUDIO] Whereas this
is the Udacity symbol.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:17.983
Completely spell, that's

00:17:17.983 --> 00:17:23.308
a different skill I have, sorry.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:27.790
Command\ or wait /.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.507
Command/ is the thing that, well on
a Mac at least that's what automatically

00:17:31.507 --> 00:17:33.235
makes it a comment, which is nice.

00:17:33.235 --> 00:17:37.400
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; So this is the top and

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.350
now we need another for the image.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.520
Our big image in the middle there and

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.668
we'll just say that's another cross row.

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:55.495
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:17:55.495 --> 00:18:00.279
It's not turning colors for that reason.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:03.749
That's our image,

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:08.244
now we get to another box.

00:18:08.244 --> 00:18:13.862
Which will hold, where that

00:18:13.862 --> 00:18:18.785
featured work sign was?

00:18:18.785 --> 00:18:20.039
&gt;&gt; It should work.

00:18:20.039 --> 00:18:20.945
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:28.538
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:18:28.538 --> 00:18:30.721
But we always need the class row.

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:31.510
I don't really know if,

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.530
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.179
This one doesn't really have a

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:45.001
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:47.485
And then, next we'll have our actual,

00:18:47.485 --> 00:18:51.280
there's a problem with me
calling that one featured work.

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.238
because the top one was the featured
work, literally like the text,

00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:56.857
that says featured work.

00:18:56.857 --> 00:19:00.496
The next one will be what
actually is the featured work, so

00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:03.850
we'll have to come up with
a different name for that.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.560
&gt;&gt; Featured work images and-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds good,

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:10.088
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:12.045
We're going to need a row here,

00:19:12.045 --> 00:19:15.030
because it needs to go all
the way across for this.

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:20.090
&gt;&gt; So is that going to put
the images and a text or?

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.055
&gt;&gt; We could do it either way.

00:19:22.055 --> 00:19:27.440
We'd probably need a separate,
I think it's probably easier

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.050
to include the text with them, because
then they'll be in the same columns.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.580
It will just be an image with text.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.070
&gt;&gt; Got it.
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.500
Just add that in the end.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:46.505
So, the images and texts need their own
thing in the middle, so that will be

00:19:46.505 --> 00:19:54.934
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:19:54.934 --> 00:20:00.280
[INAUDIBLE] So these are every four.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:07.415
So we'll just say, column four for

00:20:07.415 --> 00:20:11.670
each of them.

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.038
So the four specifies
the total width here.

00:20:14.038 --> 00:20:19.031
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:20:19.031 --> 00:20:23.443
And then we'll probably just cut and
paste this, copy paste this.

00:20:23.443 --> 00:20:29.573
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:20:29.573 --> 00:20:31.940
And I think that's actually it.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.610
Right?

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.260
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:33.800
Let's see.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.880
Yeah, because you don't want
to include those colored.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.170
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.110
So one problem right now is that I

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.000
don't have any way to tell what
the boxes actually look like.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.220
So let's just make a star thing here for
that purpose.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.050
Let's see, maybe some sort of order box.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.090
&gt;&gt; Are you trying to do it?

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:12.950
&gt;&gt; I'll just make a border and make it
solid to see what everything looks like.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.260
Okay, so now I want to actually
open this in a browser.

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:18.050
See what it looks like.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.320
&gt;&gt; So that does not look
like much at the moment.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.122
&gt;&gt; Can you share that?

00:21:24.122 --> 00:21:26.142
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so.

00:21:26.142 --> 00:21:34.222
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:21:34.222 --> 00:21:38.675
Maybe I should have this as a separate
thing so hangouts will actually share.

00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:40.495
Here we are.

00:21:40.495 --> 00:21:49.319
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:52.024
Okay, so this is what that
looks like at the moment,

00:21:52.024 --> 00:21:55.050
which is probably not what
we want it to look like.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:00.511
There's nothing in
these boxes right now,

00:22:00.511 --> 00:22:03.906
so let's give our margin,

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:08.490
to be like 20 pixels and update it.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:12.120
Okay, so that's a little bit better.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.239
Let's instead of just
having margin bottom,

00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:18.305
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:22:18.305 --> 00:22:20.710
Let's just give the margin everything.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.100
40 pixels.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:28.960
Okay, that's a little bit better.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:34.650
We're still having the problem that
it's kind of hard to see what in what.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:39.611
It would probably be helpful if we
actually added some text to all these

00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:44.920
things so let's, you know just.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.345
I don't really know if screen
share works on dual screen.

00:22:48.345 --> 00:22:51.532
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It think does,

00:22:51.532 --> 00:22:53.981
you just have to present
the whole screen.

00:22:53.981 --> 00:23:01.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.
[BLANK_AUDIO].

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.240
Thank you.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.199
Cool.

00:23:04.199 --> 00:23:05.012
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:23:05.012 --> 00:23:09.099
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:23:09.099 --> 00:23:10.196
&gt;&gt; So.

00:23:10.196 --> 00:23:12.730
&gt;&gt; Let's see here.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:17.500
&gt;&gt; What else can I do here.so he here.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.620
&gt;&gt; What else can I do them well
yeah just put some text in.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.033
So, let's just say

00:23:25.033 --> 00:23:29.460
Udacity and Title.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.950
Actually, what was the name of?

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.960
It was Joe, it was like-
&gt;&gt; Doette.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.500
&gt;&gt; Doette, yeah.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.710
Instead of making it, wait,
was it Joe Doette or Jane?

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.940
&gt;&gt; Jane, Jane Doette.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
they feminized the last name too.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.300
Okay, Jane Doette.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.532
And then image we'll just say,

00:23:48.532 --> 00:23:51.667
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:56.185
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Image.

00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:58.295
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:58.295 --> 00:24:00.706
&gt;&gt; Featured work.

00:24:00.706 --> 00:24:01.894
White space anyway.

00:24:01.894 --> 00:24:10.661
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:24:10.661 --> 00:24:12.142
Now I can see what actually happens.

00:24:12.142 --> 00:24:13.737
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:24:13.737 --> 00:24:19.517
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:24:19.517 --> 00:24:24.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, so now we see the boxes and how
they sort of are actually taking shape.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.990
So we have and
it looks like one too many.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.850
Well okay, so I'm guessing this is
probably the grid the whole outer one.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.890
No the whole outer one
might be the body and

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.100
this one will be grid and
then these would be the rows.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.638
So the rows of course they're
supposed to thing one thing two,

00:24:42.638 --> 00:24:45.394
and thing three look
like they're supposed to.

00:24:45.394 --> 00:24:49.462
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:24:49.462 --> 00:24:51.440
So that's good sort of.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, on some of it.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.210
&gt;&gt; What?

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:01.390
&gt;&gt; Is it just weird because Jane Dewit
goes all the rest of the way across?

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:05.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's probably, I think for
that one we'll need to right shift it.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.815
But it's probably easiest to
make it go all the way across.

00:25:11.815 --> 00:25:13.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
because otherwise it might just cut off.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.360
Actually let's experiment with that.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.120
So right now we have it at ten.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.137
Let's see what happens
if I have it with six.

00:25:23.137 --> 00:25:27.121
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:25:27.121 --> 00:25:29.900
Yeah, it doesn't reach the end.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I think we need this to add

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.870
up to 12 so it reaches the end.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:33.585
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:25:33.585 --> 00:25:39.440
&gt;&gt; So we're ten that will
actually reach the end.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.646
And so we can right shift it later on.

00:25:42.646 --> 00:25:44.268
Cool.

00:25:44.268 --> 00:25:50.960
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
those are our basic steps right there.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:57.770
Let's see what else do we know,
now we can actually

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:02.290
start putting in some images and
stuff like that which is always good.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:11.300
You know actually I probably should
just keep sharing the screen.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.561
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:26:13.561 --> 00:26:15.095
So it's very useful.
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:26:15.095 --> 00:26:25.095
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:26:27.177 --> 00:26:32.959
Okay, so I know I have
the images actually I already

00:26:32.959 --> 00:26:39.020
hosted them on Imgur, so
that should probably help.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.750
So for instance,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.020
here is the the Udacity image that we
can replace that word Udacity with.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.920
So it will just be an image
with the image link.

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.500
I could have also probably
just did a hard file path but

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:04.057
I like posting it online better.

00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:09.480
&gt;From there let's get our main image for

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.489
the code and put that where
the code is supposed to be.

00:27:14.489 --> 00:27:16.952
It should be right here.

00:27:16.952 --> 00:27:21.965
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:27:21.965 --> 00:27:23.882
But I also have images for

00:27:23.882 --> 00:27:29.048
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:27:29.048 --> 00:27:33.490
Instead of thing one
we have this app RXI.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.996
Instead of thing two,

00:27:35.996 --> 00:27:38.654
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:27:38.654 --> 00:27:42.153
We have, what were they flowers?

00:27:42.153 --> 00:27:45.413
And then for thing three

00:27:46.555 --> 00:27:48.261
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:27:48.261 --> 00:27:48.934
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:27:48.934 --> 00:27:54.215
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:27:54.215 --> 00:27:56.390
&gt;&gt; Let's save it and then refresh.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.680
So we're making some progress here.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.180
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.020
&gt;&gt; So now it says Gendut up top.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.835
You have our Udacity symbol
inside a lot of boxes.

00:28:10.835 --> 00:28:17.730
[LAUGH] So it's evidently giving a
border to every image and every bit of.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.830
It diddn't look like every bit of text.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:21.471
But every image and then every div,

00:28:21.471 --> 00:28:25.260
because you can see that this
one is inside this as well.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.020
You can work it the same,
that amplified sunflower and

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.420
and I'm not really sure what
you call this on the right.

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.770
&gt;&gt; Okay,
&gt;&gt; It's the label.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:37.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:44.780
So, I know the label was,
I think staring at this right here.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.530
We can also add the text right here.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:54.655
So, let's call that header three,

00:28:54.655 --> 00:28:58.593
or for the BOKEH?

00:28:58.593 --> 00:29:01.855
&gt;&gt; BOKEH, B-O-K-E-H.

00:29:01.855 --> 00:29:04.526
&gt;&gt; Okay,
looks like it's all capitalized, too.

00:29:04.526 --> 00:29:06.840
So we'll put that in.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.080
And then the text underneath that,
I believe is.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.935
It's like just a link to GitHub.

00:29:11.935 --> 00:29:14.287
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:14.287 --> 00:29:21.407
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:29:21.407 --> 00:29:23.219
No idea if that link works or not, but

00:29:23.219 --> 00:29:26.270
let's just see if what we did
there had any effect over there.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:28.540
How nice.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.029
It looks like we have another,

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:36.040
starting to fill some stuff in and
add in the text.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.658
I'll quickly add in the text for

00:29:39.658 --> 00:29:44.216
a bunch of these different things then.

00:29:44.216 --> 00:29:45.367
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:52.241
The same exact thing for the sunflower,
just copy and pasting that.

00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:56.078
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:29:56.078 --> 00:30:01.559
Should probably actually also
properly indent the stuff.

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:08.673
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:30:08.673 --> 00:30:09.451
Just to make it look good.

00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:13.572
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:30:13.572 --> 00:30:15.709
And then the last one
I think is amplify.

00:30:15.709 --> 00:30:18.333
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:25.705
So, once again,

00:30:25.705 --> 00:30:34.239
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:30:34.239 --> 00:30:35.760
See what our effect was there.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.760
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.180
&gt;&gt; Okay, adding up.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.040
And I think Jane Doette was
different than it was originally.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.670
It also had something else, right?

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.090
&gt;&gt; Front End Ninja.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and
I think everything was capitalized too.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was like a subtitle.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.320
Actually let's make that a header.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:01.080
Looks really big, so we'll call it H1.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:06.270
There's nothing

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:11.170
else that we'll call H1 so
it will help restylize it, too.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:19.730
And then, I think the headers
automatically make the All caps.

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.380
&gt;&gt; Headers will already
make sort of a break, so

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.840
we don't have to add div or
a break statement there.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.560
So, let's add that,
see what it looks like, cool.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.142
We're a lot of the ways there.

00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:36.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We have a sort of HTML structure now.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:41.484
So now we need to start adding CSS,
which probably means

00:31:41.484 --> 00:31:48.666
starting to add some actual classes that
we can actually use with everything.

00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:53.776
I know that there was the box sizing,
and

00:31:53.776 --> 00:31:59.035
I'm pretty sure the font family, also,

00:31:59.035 --> 00:32:05.195
I wrote this down ahead of time so
Back in our CSS,

00:32:05.195 --> 00:32:10.480
so I suppose we can
take this margin away.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.650
Hopefully that's
unnecessary right now and

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:17.420
we don't really need the, actually
let's keep the borders for now, but

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.880
I have box sizing the border box and
then the family is lotto.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.780
I think.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:27.670
At least that's what I was
told on of our website.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.030
So, hopefully it's right.

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.360
Okay.
So, now it's

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.230
looking more like it was
probably supposed to.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.170
I would say we're three quarters of
the way there, but we're really not.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.280
We're really not at all.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.180
We're three quarters of the way to the
point where you can start playing with

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.790
it on your own and
sort of making things, but for

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:54.150
actually truly perfectly matching it,
we're really not even that close.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:33:00.080
Because a lot of the work is going to
get things to be exactly how you want it

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.590
with the exact amount of padding that
you wanted with the exact fonts you

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:11.060
want, the same colors that you want and
all that fun stuff.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.268
So, let's see.

00:33:13.268 --> 00:33:15.776
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:16.950
Let's add some classes.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.368
So our first class will be class row and

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:26.710
it will also be our header.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.910
So what's a good class name for
a header?

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.750
I don't want to, I hope,
is header already taken?

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:36.912
I feel like headers is
a little close to that.

00:33:36.912 --> 00:33:41.648
&gt;&gt; Do like top line?

00:33:41.648 --> 00:33:44.198
&gt;&gt; Top line.

00:33:44.198 --> 00:33:45.667
Sure.

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:49.450
So, well have top line there and

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.600
then maybe, maybe we want this one.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.940
The Udacity symbol is
going to be pretty simple.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.050
It's just going to be on
an image right there.

00:33:59.050 --> 00:34:05.840
But maybe this one we want
to stylize something in it.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.274
So we'll call this

00:34:07.274 --> 00:34:09.547
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:34:09.547 --> 00:34:11.400
Title's definitely taken, okay.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.568
Name is also taken, okay.

00:34:15.568 --> 00:34:19.013
[LAUGH] Let's see,
what should we call it?

00:34:19.013 --> 00:34:24.409
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] That's also taken.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:26.000
Signature.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:26.639
&gt;&gt; Signature.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.550
&gt;&gt; Probably misspelled.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.800
&gt;&gt; As long as it's consistent.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's all that really matters,
I suppose.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.969
That's going to bug me.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:36.469
That's okay.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.737
Actually let's clean this up as well.

00:34:41.737 --> 00:34:45.967
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:47.741
Make everything a little
bit more readable.

00:34:47.741 --> 00:34:57.741
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:07.514
These should work we should
probably give it to,

00:35:07.514 --> 00:35:13.590
all right,
it looks pretty readable there.

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:18.800
So next we need our image, our center.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.436
So maybe we'll just
call it center image.

00:35:21.436 --> 00:35:28.857
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:35:28.857 --> 00:35:34.950
Featured work we could just
literally call featured work.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.526
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:35:38.526 --> 00:35:43.010
Actually not sure what the standard
is for words like this.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.580
Like I kind of want to use cap.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:46.520
Like, snake case, or.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.650
&gt;&gt; Underscore
&gt;&gt; Underscore.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.353
Underscores don't screw anything up,
or dash.

00:35:52.353 --> 00:35:58.337
[COUGH] You know, I don't work
with CSF enough compared to.

00:35:58.337 --> 00:36:02.827
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.676
But I would call real
programming [CROSSTALK]

00:36:05.676 --> 00:36:09.000
&gt;&gt; All the grid stuff use dashes.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.186
&gt;&gt; Okay,
yeah dashes are clearly safe there.

00:36:11.186 --> 00:36:16.959
So, I wanted to thing there too,
and then this one,

00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:23.590
and this was is featured work and
maybe we can call this.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.364
This should all be the same, so
all these should be identical.

00:36:26.364 --> 00:36:28.592
So,

00:36:28.592 --> 00:36:34.647
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:36:34.647 --> 00:36:37.046
here we are, featured-work-data, and

00:36:37.046 --> 00:36:40.050
that should be all the classes
that we probably need.

00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.810
So let's just copy and
paste them all in.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:53.040
Actually it might just be easier
to separate it for a second.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:59.508
So upline

00:36:59.508 --> 00:37:02.021
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:37:02.021 --> 00:37:03.460
next one was signature.

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:09.300
Copy and pasting, so if I have
done take one price it propagates.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.110
&gt;&gt; You think so?

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:11.489
&gt;&gt; Better than it not propagating..

00:37:11.489 --> 00:37:21.489
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:37:32.318 --> 00:37:35.683
Probably breaking multiple standards
here but that's all right.

00:37:35.683 --> 00:37:38.695
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:40.070
You can clean that up at the end.

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.800
This isn't a very large project.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:47.750
So that should be it for
what we need right here.

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.560
Now it's time to actually
put some stuff in.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.680
So our top line, I'm pretty
sure that we're going to want,

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:06.780
we are going to want
a border bottom here.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:07.690
I'm looking at the thing.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:14.610
So border bottom,
we're going to want it to be solid,

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:19.868
and I think it gives us the color,
right?

00:38:19.868 --> 00:38:24.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, it's EC Wait, hold on.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.280
It's a different one.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.346
&gt;&gt; I think it says b-b-b-b.

00:38:27.346 --> 00:38:28.170
&gt;&gt; B-b-b-b, yeah.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.198
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's just try it and
see what happens.

00:38:30.198 --> 00:38:32.250
&gt;&gt; You see b-b-b-b.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.760
&gt;&gt; It looks sort of.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.130
Actually, let's take away these orders.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.353
We might want to take away

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:45.492
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:38:45.492 --> 00:38:52.580
Yeah okay, let's try this again,
no, that only look a lot better.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.949
So taking away the borders
we have our grey line there,

00:38:54.949 --> 00:39:00.354
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:39:00.354 --> 00:39:05.840
Okay, so let's see what we all need.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:12.225
Our signature is going to
have to be right aligned.

00:39:12.225 --> 00:39:16.520
So let's make sure that happens.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.600
So by the line, that's good.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.680
&gt;From our center image,
how do you align an image?

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:32.680
&gt;&gt; [BLANK_AUDIO]

00:39:33.896 --> 00:39:41.037
If you see just see this [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:41.037 --> 00:39:48.520
this is what the Internet is for.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:56.246
Do any students have questions
on what we've done so far?

00:39:56.246 --> 00:40:01.092
Since we're now to the point where
we're actually going to start sort of

00:40:01.092 --> 00:40:03.561
experimenting to try to get things.

00:40:03.561 --> 00:40:08.152
Basically we're far enough along that we
can actually really start to experiment

00:40:08.152 --> 00:40:10.745
to get how we want to look,
as opposed to just,

00:40:10.745 --> 00:40:13.240
I wouldn't say blindly following along.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.310
But we have the structure here, so
now we're really going to be playing

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.550
with the CSS to get things to
look exactly like we want them.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.260
&gt;&gt; I think you want to use,
yeah, text-align.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.730
&gt;&gt; It is still text-align?

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:26.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.992
&gt;&gt; Okay, so just center.

00:40:28.992 --> 00:40:31.918
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:40:31.918 --> 00:40:34.333
See if that changes anything.

00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:38.368
[LAUGH] Let's just inspect element and

00:40:38.368 --> 00:40:43.040
see if undoing that
makes something there.

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:53.040
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:40:58.534 --> 00:41:00.700
text-align-center seems
to be doing something.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:07.077
So what happens if I say right?

00:41:07.077 --> 00:41:13.533
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:41:13.533 --> 00:41:15.242
That didn't seem to have any effect.

00:41:15.242 --> 00:41:18.534
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:41:18.534 --> 00:41:27.985
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.929
If you, if you use margin auto,

00:41:29.929 --> 00:41:33.923
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:41:33.923 --> 00:41:34.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try that.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:37.824
&gt;&gt; Actually, let's just try that here.

00:41:37.824 --> 00:41:43.373
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:41:43.373 --> 00:41:46.285
&gt;&gt; And to answer your question, Dewey,

00:41:46.285 --> 00:41:52.580
is there a limit to the number of
classes you can combine in any one div?

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.690
To my knowledge I don't think there is,

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.946
you just need to keep putting
a space and then add another class.

00:41:58.946 --> 00:42:04.069
There's a practical limit.

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:05.796
&gt;&gt; I mean, you have to keep
them all straight in your head.

00:42:05.796 --> 00:42:10.490
Yeah, so I, yeah,

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.090
I don't know.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.050
I would try to use less
than five just to not

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.380
go crazy trying to keep
track of all the classes.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:23.164
And if you are using that many,
that often,

00:42:23.164 --> 00:42:29.109
you might consider just putting them
all together in a single class.

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:32.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it's mostly a mental thing there.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:36.650
You want things to be as easy to
understand as possible for both.

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:39.847
It's not just for your sake, it's, if
you ever share your code with anyone and

00:42:39.847 --> 00:42:40.379
want to help.

00:42:40.379 --> 00:42:44.630
Or actually, you can kind of look at
code readability doesn't just affect

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:48.273
other people trying to help you,
it affects you trying to pick up

00:42:48.273 --> 00:42:51.860
your work anytime after you've
forgotten what you've done.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.770
Which is, if you ever pick up your
work a month after you left it,

00:42:55.770 --> 00:43:00.580
you will notice a very large
difference in where you commented well,

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.290
and sort of did classes
in a logical manner.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:07.146
&gt;From where you just sort of
packed something together and

00:43:07.146 --> 00:43:10.934
have no idea what you're doing
when you come back to it.

00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:14.150
because you didn't really have
a good sense of what was going on.

00:43:16.584 --> 00:43:21.170
&gt;&gt; Okay, also you need to set
the width of that image, I think.

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.969
You want it to extend it
all the way across, right?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:26.950
&gt;&gt; I've probably, yeah.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.977
&gt;&gt; So it would be width 100%, I think.

00:43:29.977 --> 00:43:34.319
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:43:34.319 --> 00:43:35.805
Let's see if that does anything.

00:43:35.805 --> 00:43:40.436
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:43:40.436 --> 00:43:42.270
Does that image have that class on it?

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:44.664
Because it doesn't seem
to be changing anything.

00:43:44.664 --> 00:43:50.097
&gt;&gt; I could have swore center-image.

00:43:50.097 --> 00:43:54.154
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
is it?

00:43:54.154 --> 00:43:58.994
Maybe that image itself
needs to have that class

00:43:58.994 --> 00:44:01.500
rather than-
&gt;&gt; The row.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.698
&gt;&gt; The row, yeah.

00:44:03.698 --> 00:44:05.230
&gt;&gt; Let's give it a shot.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:15.230
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:44:19.735 --> 00:44:24.018
Icon habits are carrying on over so
I guess that's okay.

00:44:24.018 --> 00:44:26.500
Let's see if that does anything.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:28.680
Yes it does.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.736
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe too much.

00:44:30.736 --> 00:44:33.709
&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].

00:44:33.709 --> 00:44:37.498
That's a big thing though, because now
we can actually play with these like

00:44:37.498 --> 00:44:41.366
we're supposed to instead of just
blindly and hoping something works.

00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:44.988
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:44:44.988 --> 00:44:47.240
Width auto.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.921
&gt;&gt; So it looks like it's-
&gt;&gt; Let's just keep it try to be centered

00:44:51.921 --> 00:44:54.880
instead of, there,
now it stays centered.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:45:00.768
And not trying,
I think the problem is that what we'd

00:45:00.768 --> 00:45:05.834
want it it to do is then,
if we had width equals 100%.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.800
&gt;&gt; Would it be better to
put the image inside a div?

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.110
Will that change anything?

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:15.240
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it is
technically inside of a div.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.315
&gt;&gt; Right but we have a center
image be part of it, some div.

00:45:19.315 --> 00:45:22.473
&gt;&gt; That did not affect anything at all.

00:45:22.473 --> 00:45:27.604
because that was what we
were just trying to do.

00:45:27.604 --> 00:45:34.013
&gt;&gt; I guess-
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to have a max height?

00:45:34.013 --> 00:45:36.730
Height, yes, there is.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:44.601
Maybe we can give it an actual
max height, like 500px.

00:45:44.601 --> 00:45:47.770
Let's just make it small so
we know what the thing is.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.210
That will probably stretch it out,
right?

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.613
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

00:45:52.613 --> 00:45:53.797
Nope, you're right.

00:45:53.797 --> 00:45:57.120
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's how we can do that.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.750
That might be what we want.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:03.855
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it is what I want.

00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:09.474
&gt;&gt; Okay, so [CROSSTALK] let's
make that slightly larger.

00:46:09.474 --> 00:46:14.513
Let's have that be 300 pixels.

00:46:14.513 --> 00:46:17.555
Okay, that seems more like
what we're trying to get at.

00:46:17.555 --> 00:46:19.552
&gt;&gt; What happens when
you re-size the window?

00:46:20.584 --> 00:46:22.140
Nice.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:22.920
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like it.

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:23.830
Seems to work.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.210
We got that down.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.208
Featured work, I think we wanted that
a specific color and font, right?

00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:36.460
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.085
What was the font again?

00:46:38.085 --> 00:46:39.757
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:46:39.757 --> 00:46:42.400
Or not the font, but color.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.961
&gt;&gt; I think it's bb, no, bc, isn't that
the same color gray as the bcbbb?

00:46:47.961 --> 00:46:51.699
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try that out.

00:46:51.699 --> 00:46:54.880
&gt;&gt; It's gotta be [CROSSTALK],
well, the share.

00:46:56.134 --> 00:46:57.100
&gt;&gt; Was that what it wanted?

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:03.670
&gt;&gt; I should probably go find-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.880
&gt;&gt; Yep, okay.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.560
&gt;&gt; The text, the different font though.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.800
&gt;&gt; Okay, any idea with the font?

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.596
Here's where we're getting into,

00:47:13.596 --> 00:47:16.197
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:47:16.197 --> 00:47:22.470
More complicated thing is we're trying
to actually figure out what font it is.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:25.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't thin kit-
&gt;&gt; Which could take serious time.

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:27.170
&gt;&gt; Did you already put in?

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:28.230
&gt;&gt; I put in, I thought I did.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.301
I thought I did that for
literally everything, but.

00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:36.441
&gt;&gt; Sans serif, yeah, it's all right.

00:47:36.441 --> 00:47:37.486
Let's keep moving.

00:47:37.486 --> 00:47:41.471
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:42.622
&gt;&gt; So Julie asks,

00:47:42.622 --> 00:47:47.497
why did that image bleed over to
the other divs when it was too big?

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:52.453
&gt;&gt; Well, it was scaling itself without
a max, it didn't have max height and so

00:47:52.453 --> 00:47:57.023
since we specified 100% width and
tried to keep proportionality I

00:47:57.023 --> 00:48:00.509
don't know why it decided
to keep versionality, but

00:48:00.509 --> 00:48:04.240
I think that's just how
this browser's written.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.160
It's probably how most
browser's are written and

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.170
we didn't have anything that...

00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.690
Yeah, I don't think,
I think that's just it.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:17.620
It's as though the real question is
why it didn't just push everything

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.720
else down.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:19.220
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.510
I'm not sure.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:31.834
Do you know?

00:48:31.834 --> 00:48:33.687
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If you think that it should,

00:48:33.687 --> 00:48:38.281
that would be the expected behavior
is to push all the other Div's down.

00:48:38.281 --> 00:48:43.598
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:48:43.598 --> 00:48:47.384
because the div should expand
to fit whatever is inside it.

00:48:47.384 --> 00:48:49.822
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:48:49.822 --> 00:48:52.659
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:48:52.659 --> 00:48:55.795
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:55.795 --> 00:49:00.635
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:49:00.635 --> 00:49:06.682
So maybe,
you want to play around a little but

00:49:06.682 --> 00:49:12.089
this, or you keep going weak,
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:49:12.089 --> 00:49:18.179
we are actually overturn by now, but
let's just center all the text here,

00:49:18.179 --> 00:49:21.039
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:49:21.039 --> 00:49:26.397
Make it look a little
bit better Probably

00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:32.710
if we ever do anything with our H1,
H2 stuff.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.370
This looks about to be the right size,
but

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:38.500
Apple five should probably be bigger.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.060
So I think that was H3, right?

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:46.350
So since we only have that,
we could make another class for

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.420
each of these individual things.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.040
But right now since they're the only
h2s, and that's looks like that's it,

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.490
I'll be lazy and do this.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:00.313
So font size

00:50:00.313 --> 00:50:02.891
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:06.917
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:06.917 --> 00:50:10.481
&gt;&gt; A little bit bigger.

00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:13.465
Color, I think this was
one of the other colors.

00:50:13.465 --> 00:50:17.912
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:50:17.912 --> 00:50:25.780
So I'm guessing that the 747704.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:31.039
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:50:31.039 --> 00:50:34.220
Looks like it never did anything with
these featured work fonts either.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:43.426
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:50:43.426 --> 00:50:44.506
704.

00:50:44.506 --> 00:50:51.078
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:50:51.078 --> 00:50:54.190
&gt;&gt; I think I figured it out, Luke.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; because if you take the margin

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:59.200
auto out
&gt;&gt; Nope, nope, just kidding.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.330
Wait, yeah.

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:07.830
If you take the margin auto out, then
it will cause the image to bleed over.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:08.530
It actually,

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:13.576
it will adjust the margin of the divs
to push over into the other div.

00:51:13.576 --> 00:51:15.141
&gt;&gt; Gotcha.

00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:17.750
&gt;&gt; I think, yeah.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:24.240
&gt;&gt; So-
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:32.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean can share the screen
if you guys want to see an example

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:38.800
of that in a second
&gt;&gt; So

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:45.619
here, and share my whole screen.

00:51:45.619 --> 00:51:48.243
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:51:48.243 --> 00:51:50.460
Cool, so this is what we have.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.600
What we were running into before.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.200
We had margin auto.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:59.972
Now it's causing

00:51:59.972 --> 00:52:05.361
a yeah.

00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:06.859
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:52:06.859 --> 00:52:09.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So do you see that still?

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:09.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:17.130
&gt;&gt; So, that's how the most tab in,
but then if you take margin auto out

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.917
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:52:19.917 --> 00:52:22.216
And then, we'll just adjust.

00:52:22.216 --> 00:52:24.770
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:25.815
&gt;&gt; Looks good.

00:52:25.815 --> 00:52:29.001
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

00:52:29.001 --> 00:52:32.850
&gt;&gt; Actually we're quite a bit
over time so I'm just going to,

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:36.350
like this is the gist of what you do.

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.640
&gt;From here you play around with things.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.090
You get things to look how you want.

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:45.380
You constantly experiment,
refresh, see what it looks like,

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.080
go back to back to your CSS,
experiment some more.

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:58.640
Basically it's a constant cycle in of,
you test, you make some changes,

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.230
you test some more, and
then you look a lot of stuff up online.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:07.089
Because by this point,
no one really knows exactly what you

00:53:07.089 --> 00:53:12.045
might be going to Google fonts
to try to find exactly what font

00:53:12.045 --> 00:53:16.440
you want of if you can't find
it just from knowing it.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.003
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:53:20.003 --> 00:53:24.163
You're probably going to be playing
around with the margins, the padding,

00:53:24.163 --> 00:53:27.235
all that stuff to get everything
exactly the right size,

00:53:27.235 --> 00:53:31.620
probably the font sizes you're
going to be playing around with.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.810
You're probably going to be
trying to get the spacing.

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:38.420
Like right now,
this h1 is quite a bit separated from,

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:42.540
the Jane Doette is quite a bit
separated from Front End Ninja.

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:45.250
And it looks like I don't really
want any space there at all.

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:48.470
So I would have to look
up probably putting in,

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:50.830
I think that would
probably be an h1 thing.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:53.740
For padding or margin,

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:58.520
bring it down to zero or
something really small, stuff like that.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:02.635
So did anyone have any final
questions before we go off there?

00:54:02.635 --> 00:54:10.589
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:12.650
Guess not.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:16.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, well I hope I hope
this was educational for

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.430
everybody and
maybe you guys even enjoyed yourselves.

00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:24.287
But goodnight everybody.

00:54:24.287 --> 00:54:30.810
&gt;&gt; Bye.
