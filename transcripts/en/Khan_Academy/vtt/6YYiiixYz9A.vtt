00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.960
Find the reciprocal
of 2 and 4/5.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.840
So if we want to invert this
fraction, we have to write it

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.780
as a pure fraction first, or
as an improper fraction.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.610
Right now, it's just
a mixed number.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.530
So let's just write it as
an improper fraction.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.710
So 2 and 4/5, if we write it as
an improper fraction, it's

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.410
still going to be over 5, but
the numerator is now going to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.840
be 5 times 2 plus 4, and that's
because 2 is 10/5, or 2

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.619
times 5 fifths.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.750
So let's write it like that.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.605
So it's going to be
2 times 5 plus 4.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.330
2 times 5 is 10.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.590
10/5 is the same thing as 2, and
then the 4/5 is this 4/5

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.440
right there.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.790
So this is going to be equal
to 2 times 5 is 10

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.670
plus 4 is 14: 14/5.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.930
So these are equivalent
fractions.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.480
This is written as
a mixed number.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.459
This is written as an
improper fraction.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.590
It's improper because the
numerator is bigger than the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.310
denominator.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.630
Now we want to find
the reciprocal.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.780
When you find the reciprocal,
you just switch the numerator

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.280
and the denominator.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.270
You just flip the fraction.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.940
So if you want to take the
reciprocal-- let me do this in

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.230
a new color.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:29.850
If we want to take the
reciprocal of this, we just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.160
swap the 5 and the 14.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.600
So this is going to be--
instead of 14/5,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.080
it's going to be 5/14.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.630
And we're done!
