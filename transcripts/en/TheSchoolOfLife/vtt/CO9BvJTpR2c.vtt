00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.900
One of the odder phenomena of relationships

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.620
is the immediate certainty that whenever things go wrong in our lives

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.440
it is first and foremost, and quite obviously, our partner's fault.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.740
We get furious with our partners because we assign them such a deep role in our lives.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.760
We have faith that a person who understands obscure parts of us,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.740
whose presence solves so many of our problems,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.100
couldn't realistically also be someone who wouldn't be able to fix our whole lives.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.920
We exaggerate our partners' powers,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:40.040
an exaggeration that's an echo – heard in adult life down the decades – of a child’s awe at their parents.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:49.180
The partner inherits a little of that beautiful, romantic, dangerous, unfair, trust we as children once had in our parents.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.740
At one level, the lover has learnt how to reassure the anxious child in us – that’s why we love them.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.580
But that source of strength also brings with it some very serious problems,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.540
for the primitive part of us insists on trusting them a little too much,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.100
believing that they actually control far more of existence than they possibly could.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.220
It's also to do with the permission that the partner's love gives us...

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.220
to moan in a way we cannot otherwise.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.660
The world is constantly mean to us.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.920
It rejects our creative endeavours, it overlooks us in promotions, it rewards idiots.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.580
But usually we can't complain.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.920
We can't get angry with the people who are really to blame for hurting us.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.280
So, we get angry with those whom we can be sure will tolerate us for blaming them.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.260
We get angry with the very nicest, most sympathetic, most loyal people in our vicinity,

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.880
the ones least likely to have harmed us,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.700
but most likely to stick around while we blame them furiously for having done so.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.200
The mean words and mad accusations we mutter to our lovers undoubtedly often sound horrible.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.360
But let’s at least remember that they are a curious proof of intimacy,

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.160
a symptom of love itself – and in their own way, oddly romantic

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.380
(a detail indirectly acknowledged by their frequently sexual conclusions).

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.180
We can tell any stranger something reasonable and polite,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.880
but only in the presence of someone we really trust can we dare to be properly irrational and truly unkind.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.700
If we think of love as being in perfect agreement all the time,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.740
we will feel that getting into fights must mean that a relationship is winding down or starting to fall apart.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:44.240
But crazy blame games are at heart just a symptom of an intensity of investment in another person.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.660
We aren't simply nice with our partners, because we are so very close to them.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.360
They draw us into very private zones of turbulence and distress...

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.880
from which absolutely everyone else is excluded.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:06.620
That's one of the stranger, more unfortunate and yet (from a calm angle) almost flattering gifts of love.
