this is just a brief summary of the the

this is just a brief summary of the the
data in the database these are the

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:41.689
data in the database these are the
 

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:44.739

years you see we have here the forum the
 

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.039

International the domestic and then the

00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:51.049
International the domestic and then the
 

00:16:51.049 --> 00:16:53.579
International the domestic and then the
total and then here is a cumulative

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:53.589
total and then here is a cumulative
 

00:16:53.589 --> 00:16:56.679

prosecution years by types and I think

00:16:56.679 --> 00:16:56.689
prosecution years by types and I think
 

00:16:56.689 --> 00:16:59.410
prosecution years by types and I think
this then makes evident kind of what we

00:16:59.410 --> 00:16:59.420
this then makes evident kind of what we
 

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.629
this then makes evident kind of what we
mean when we say that there's a cascade

00:17:01.629 --> 00:17:01.639
mean when we say that there's a cascade
 

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:04.659
mean when we say that there's a cascade
of sorts here this dramatic increase and

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:04.669
of sorts here this dramatic increase and
 

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:07.870
of sorts here this dramatic increase and
also the dark the dark black is the

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880
also the dark the dark black is the
 

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.149
also the dark the dark black is the
domestic trials so I also think it makes

00:17:10.149 --> 00:17:10.159
domestic trials so I also think it makes
 

00:17:10.159 --> 00:17:12.970
domestic trials so I also think it makes
clear that a lot of the criminal

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:12.980
clear that a lot of the criminal
 

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.519
clear that a lot of the criminal

about the database about domestic

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.390
about the database about domestic
 

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.549
about the database about domestic
prosecution's is that it's very

00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559
prosecution's is that it's very
 

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.100
prosecution's is that it's very
regionally concentrated so even though

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.110
regionally concentrated so even though
 

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.889

this is a global phenomena because there

00:17:32.889 --> 00:17:32.899
this is a global phenomena because there
 

00:17:32.899 --> 00:17:34.870

cascade emerge basically and one of the
 

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.710
cascade emerge basically and one of the
things I found is that this regional

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:28.910
pattern I just showed you is because of
 

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.690
pattern I just showed you is because of
justice cascade emerged in regions where

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:31.700
justice cascade emerged in regions where

especially Europe and the Americas so

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:42.430
especially Europe and the Americas so
 

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.610
especially Europe and the Americas so
this is also these are also the regions

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:45.620
this is also these are also the regions
 

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.090
this is also these are also the regions
that experience the early part of the

adopt prosecutions in some countries

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:23.930
adopt prosecutions in some countries
 

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.900
adopt prosecutions in some countries
that don't and one of the factors it's

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:25.910
that don't and one of the factors it's
 

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.910
that don't and one of the factors it's
very important for early adopters of

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:27.920
very important for early adopters of
 

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.120
very important for early adopters of
such prosecutions is that they had a

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.130
such prosecutions is that they had a
 

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.600
such prosecutions is that they had a
ruptured a transition to democracy and

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:34.610
ruptured a transition to democracy and
 

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:37.060
ruptured a transition to democracy and
that's the term comparative politics

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.070
that's the term comparative politics
 

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.290
that's the term comparative politics
folks use to about talk about

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:38.300
folks use to about talk about
 

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.390
folks use to about talk about
transitions to democracy usually it

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400
transitions to democracy usually it
 

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.000
transitions to democracy usually it
means that there was a war and and the

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.010
means that there was a war and and the
 

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.250
means that there was a war and and the
previous regime lost the war like the

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.260

the case of Greece there was the

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:49.460
the case of Greece there was the
 

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.830
the case of Greece there was the
military debacle in Cyprus and in doing

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840
military debacle in Cyprus and in doing
 

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.030
military debacle in Cyprus and in doing
so they weaken

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:55.040
so they weaken
 

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.180
so they weaken
and their own power and we're not able

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:58.190
and their own power and we're not able
 

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.600
and their own power and we're not able
to dictate the terms of the transition

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:01.610
to dictate the terms of the transition
 

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.130
to dictate the terms of the transition
they were not able to dictate terms that

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140
they were not able to dictate terms that
 

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.360
they were not able to dictate terms that
basically protect themselves from

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:04.370
basically protect themselves from
 

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.300
basically protect themselves from
prosecution in the new regime and

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:07.310
prosecution in the new regime and
 

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.970
prosecution in the new regime and
countries that had packed 'add

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:08.980
countries that had packed 'add
 

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.640
countries that had packed 'add
transitions the power holders were able

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:12.650
transitions the power holders were able
 

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.530
transitions the power holders were able
to set the terms and were able to rule

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:14.540
to set the terms and were able to rule
 

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.960
to set the terms and were able to rule
out prosecutions and so that factor

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:16.970
out prosecutions and so that factor
 

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.730
out prosecutions and so that factor
turns to be an important factor predict

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:18.740
turns to be an important factor predict
 

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.340
turns to be an important factor predict
early adopters of trials so for example

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:21.350
early adopters of trials so for example
 

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.920
early adopters of trials so for example
this is why we get the earliest trials

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:23.930
this is why we get the earliest trials
 

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.500
this is why we get the earliest trials
in greece and in portugal both had

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:26.510
in greece and in portugal both had
 

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.140
in greece and in portugal both had
ruptured transitions not in spain that

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:29.150
ruptured transitions not in spain that
 

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:30.970
ruptured transitions not in spain that
had a transition in the same region

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:30.980
had a transition in the same region
 

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.400
had a transition in the same region
around the same time but did not have

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:33.410
around the same time but did not have
 

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.860
around the same time but did not have
any prosecutions it helps explain why we

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:35.870
any prosecutions it helps explain why we
 

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.480
any prosecutions it helps explain why we
get prosecutions in Argentina and

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.490
get prosecutions in Argentina and
 

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.880
get prosecutions in Argentina and
Bolivia both with ruptured transitions

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:39.890
Bolivia both with ruptured transitions
 

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.310
Bolivia both with ruptured transitions
but not in countries like Uruguay or

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320
but not in countries like Uruguay or
 

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.410
but not in countries like Uruguay or
Brazil that had transitions around the

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:44.420
Brazil that had transitions around the
 

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.770
Brazil that had transitions around the
same time but did not initially use

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:47.780
same time but did not initially use
 

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.330
same time but did not initially use
prosecutions and then the other factor

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:52.340
prosecutions and then the other factor
 

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.010
prosecutions and then the other factor
that's very interesting I think about

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:54.020
that's very interesting I think about
 

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.200
that's very interesting I think about
the conditions is once it became

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:56.210
the conditions is once it became
 

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.820
the conditions is once it became
possible to imagine accountability and

00:20:59.820 --> 00:20:59.830
possible to imagine accountability and
 

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.720
possible to imagine accountability and
what's hard to go back and remember

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:01.730
what's hard to go back and remember
 

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.520
what's hard to go back and remember
because we just take for granted now day

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.530
because we just take for granted now day
 

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.870
because we just take for granted now day
of course of course people will think

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880
of course of course people will think
 

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.700
of course of course people will think
about individual criminal accountability

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:06.710
about individual criminal accountability
 

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:08.860
about individual criminal accountability

demand had happened and so we sometimes

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.050
demand had happened and so we sometimes
 

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:59.050
demand had happened and so we sometimes
forget that it was perceived as

00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.060
forget that it was perceived as
 

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:03.540
forget that it was perceived as
dangerous risky demand it was almost

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:03.550
dangerous risky demand it was almost
 

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:06.430
dangerous risky demand it was almost
unimaginable for many even for the

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440
unimaginable for many even for the
 

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.440
unimaginable for many even for the
victims even for the activists

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:08.450
victims even for the activists
 

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:11.230
victims even for the activists
it was unimaginable that actually state

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240
it was unimaginable that actually state
 

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.180
it was unimaginable that actually state
officials could be held individually

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:13.190
officials could be held individually
 

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:15.100
officials could be held individually
criminally accountable for human rights

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:15.110
criminally accountable for human rights
 

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.680
criminally accountable for human rights
violations and so what transformed was

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:17.690
violations and so what transformed was
 

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:20.050
violations and so what transformed was
not just that these trials happen but a

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.060
not just that these trials happen but a
 

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.090
not just that these trials happen but a
whole transformation of the very

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.100
whole transformation of the very
 

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:27.490
whole transformation of the very
imagination of what was possible and so

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:27.500
imagination of what was possible and so
 

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.500
imagination of what was possible and so
when people began to think it might be

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:29.510
when people began to think it might be
 

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.770
when people began to think it might be
possible to prosecute they turn to a

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:32.780
possible to prosecute they turn to a
 

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.860
possible to prosecute they turn to a
familiar domestic analogy they turn to

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:35.870
familiar domestic analogy they turn to
 

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.530
familiar domestic analogy they turn to
criminal law from their domestic legal

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:38.540
criminal law from their domestic legal
 

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.370
criminal law from their domestic legal
system and and norms theories has said

that before they said that domestic
norms are very often used to think about

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:49.820
norms are very often used to think about
 

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.990
norms are very often used to think about
norms in the international system I

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000
norms in the international system I
 

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.290

think in this case that the four lawyers

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:56.300
think in this case that the four lawyers
 

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.010
think in this case that the four lawyers
for judges at fort for victims it was

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:00.020
for judges at fort for victims it was
 

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.260
for judges at fort for victims it was
once they thought it was possible to

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:02.270
once they thought it was possible to
 

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.120
once they thought it was possible to
have accountability the obvious solution

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:04.130
have accountability the obvious solution
 

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:06.100
have accountability the obvious solution
seemed to be the criminal accountability

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.110
seemed to be the criminal accountability
 

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.170
seemed to be the criminal accountability
system that they were already using in

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:08.180
system that they were already using in
 

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.670
system that they were already using in
their domestic judicial system in

their domestic judicial system in
 

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.070

rigor hasn't seen this one yet so I want

his reaction to it I don't think

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720
his reaction to it I don't think
 

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.150
his reaction to it I don't think
obviously it either this is my attempt

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:25.160
obviously it either this is my attempt
 

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.280
obviously it either this is my attempt
to do a better visual for chapter 4 for

to do a better visual for chapter 4 for
 

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.500
to do a better visual for chapter 4 for

those of you who've read that book and
 

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:32.050
those of you who've read that book and
it's also my attempt because um chapter

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:32.060
it's also my attempt because um chapter
 

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.120
it's also my attempt because um chapter
4 is about the Cascade itself if you

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:34.130
4 is about the Cascade itself if you
 

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.920
4 is about the Cascade itself if you
wish how this idea takes off and spreads

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:35.930
wish how this idea takes off and spreads
 

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:42.040
wish how this idea takes off and spreads
around the world and and norton wanted

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.050
around the world and and norton wanted
 

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:43.090
around the world and and norton wanted
me to take out the part about

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.100
me to take out the part about
 

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.390
me to take out the part about
international law too much about

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400
international law too much about
 

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.730
international law too much about
drafting those boring treaties and no

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:48.740
drafting those boring treaties and no
 

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.880
drafting those boring treaties and no
one will want to read this book and so I

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:51.890
one will want to read this book and so I
 

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.960
one will want to read this book and so I
took the argument that um that I

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:55.970
took the argument that um that I
 

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:58.180
took the argument that um that I
discovered as I was looking at the

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:58.190
discovered as I was looking at the
 

00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:59.800
discovered as I was looking at the
spread of these ideas is there was not

00:23:59.800 --> 00:23:59.810
spread of these ideas is there was not
 

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.530
spread of these ideas is there was not
one justice cascade there were various

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:02.540
one justice cascade there were various
 

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.800
one justice cascade there were various
to keep the water metaphor streams that

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:05.810
to keep the water metaphor streams that
 

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.190
to keep the water metaphor streams that
flowed into the justice cascade and in

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200
flowed into the justice cascade and in
 

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.080
flowed into the justice cascade and in
particular there were these two streams

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:11.090
particular there were these two streams
 

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:13.720
particular there were these two streams
one that came the international tribunal

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:13.730
one that came the international tribunal
 

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.090
one that came the international tribunal
a stream that's coming along the top

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:16.100
a stream that's coming along the top
 

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.000
a stream that's coming along the top
there and there was a separate stream

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.010
there and there was a separate stream
 

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.310
there and there was a separate stream
that were these domestic and foreign

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320
that were these domestic and foreign
 

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.030
that were these domestic and foreign
prosecution

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:22.040
prosecution
 

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.980
prosecution
I've been talking about and initially

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:23.990
I've been talking about and initially
 

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.530
I've been talking about and initially
those two streams didn't interact and so

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:26.540
those two streams didn't interact and so
 

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.420
those two streams didn't interact and so
if you ask international lawyer or you

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:28.430
if you ask international lawyer or you
 

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.120
if you ask international lawyer or you
ask someone who's worked at the icty or

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.130
ask someone who's worked at the icty or
 

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:34.360
ask someone who's worked at the icty or
help set up the icty and you say what's

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:34.370
help set up the icty and you say what's
 

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.520
help set up the icty and you say what's
the origin the icty and they say

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:36.530
the origin the icty and they say
 

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.860
the origin the icty and they say
nuremberg and that's all they say never

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:38.870
nuremberg and that's all they say never
 

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.190
nuremberg and that's all they say never
maybe Tokyo maybe Eichmann okay but they

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200
maybe Tokyo maybe Eichmann okay but they
 

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.020
maybe Tokyo maybe Eichmann okay but they
don't mention ever the domestic trials

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:44.030
don't mention ever the domestic trials
 

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.990
don't mention ever the domestic trials
so they tell just this international

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000
so they tell just this international
 

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.500
so they tell just this international
story actually Richard dicker will I

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:50.510
story actually Richard dicker will I
 

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.300
story actually Richard dicker will I
hope will tell a story later on but

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:52.310
hope will tell a story later on but
 

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.120
hope will tell a story later on but
initially after Nuremberg it wasn't that

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:55.130
initially after Nuremberg it wasn't that
 

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.190
initially after Nuremberg it wasn't that
the first possible case wasn't going to

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200
the first possible case wasn't going to
 

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.960
the first possible case wasn't going to
be the former Yugoslavia the first

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:58.970
be the former Yugoslavia the first
 

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.000
be the former Yugoslavia the first
possible case might have been Iraq and

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:01.010
possible case might have been Iraq and
 

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.920
possible case might have been Iraq and
there was interest in seeing whether

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:02.930
there was interest in seeing whether
 

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:04.630
there was interest in seeing whether
there could be a case brought against

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640
there could be a case brought against
 

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.020
there could be a case brought against
Iraq for the genocide of the Kurds that

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.030
Iraq for the genocide of the Kurds that
 

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.970
Iraq for the genocide of the Kurds that
have failed so the next internet

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:09.980
have failed so the next internet
 

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.730
have failed so the next internet
revealing becomes the icty the ictr and

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:12.740
revealing becomes the icty the ictr and
 

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.210
revealing becomes the icty the ictr and
then eventually moves towards the ICC

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:15.220
then eventually moves towards the ICC
 

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.600
then eventually moves towards the ICC
meanwhile at the same time we have these

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:19.610
meanwhile at the same time we have these
 

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.450
meanwhile at the same time we have these
domestic prosecution's moving ahead on

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:22.460
domestic prosecution's moving ahead on
 

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.630
domestic prosecution's moving ahead on
this totally separate stream and but

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:25.640
this totally separate stream and but
 

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.670
this totally separate stream and but
these two streams begin to converge and

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:27.680
these two streams begin to converge and
 

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.320
these two streams begin to converge and
they begin to converge at the rome

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.330
they begin to converge at the rome
 

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.600
they begin to converge at the rome
meeting to draft the statute of the

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:31.610
meeting to draft the statute of the
 

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:33.400
meeting to draft the statute of the
international criminal court and they

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:33.410
international criminal court and they
 

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.890
international criminal court and they
converge because countries come to rome

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:35.900
converge because countries come to rome
 

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.670
converge because countries come to rome
by about 30 countries by the time

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:38.680
by about 30 countries by the time
 

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.590
by about 30 countries by the time
actually maybe slightly more than that

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600
actually maybe slightly more than that
 

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.750
actually maybe slightly more than that
come who have already practiced domestic

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760
come who have already practiced domestic
 

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.730
come who have already practiced domestic
prosecutions in their country and they

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:45.740
prosecutions in their country and they
 

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.220
prosecutions in their country and they
are present at rome and that experience

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:48.230
are present at rome and that experience
 

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.280
are present at rome and that experience
with domestic prosecutions informs their

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:51.290
with domestic prosecutions informs their
 

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.750
with domestic prosecutions informs their
participation in rome so the streams

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:55.760
participation in rome so the streams
 

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.700
participation in rome so the streams
begin to come together but then finally

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:57.710
begin to come together but then finally
 

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.520
begin to come together but then finally
at the bottom you see this part that

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:00.530
at the bottom you see this part that
 

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:01.840
at the bottom you see this part that
norton wants me to take out that i'm

norton wants me to take out that i'm
 

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.120
norton wants me to take out that i'm
trying to justify and the point is this

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:04.130
trying to justify and the point is this
 

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:08.250
trying to justify and the point is this
the point is that these the critique of

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:08.260
the point is that these the critique of
 

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.510
the point is that these the critique of
Nuremberg was at Nuremberg was Victor's

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.760
Nuremberg was at Nuremberg was Victor's
justice that Nuremberg was retroactive

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:12.770
justice that Nuremberg was retroactive

justice and so in order to make the
 

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.740
justice and so in order to make the
Justice cascade stick in order to make

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:17.750
Justice cascade stick in order to make
 

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:19.390

system you had to build hard law as its

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:23.300
system you had to build hard law as its
 

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.350
system you had to build hard law as its
underpinning and so again i use probably

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360
underpinning and so again i use probably
 

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.900

worn metaphor by this point you had to

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:28.910

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.960
worn metaphor by this point you had to
build the streambed this hard law stream

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:31.970
build the streambed this hard law stream
 

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.320

we might think of that when we debate

we might think of that when we debate

that the a greater likelihood of

very interesting time to ask about the

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:43.420

order to address this we use the
database and particularly we compared

it's with trial experience and so

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:46.180
it's with trial experience and so
 

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.060
it's with trial experience and so
basically what this is showing is that

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:48.070
basically what this is showing is that
 

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.670

the average repression score countries
 

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.440

states with multiple trial years it's a
 

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.220
states with multiple trial years it's a
little bit harder to see but again we

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:17.230
little bit harder to see but again we
 

00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:21.240

have the global mean line here and then

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:21.250
have the global mean line here and then
 

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.100
have the global mean line here and then
we have states with one trial year which

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.110
we have states with one trial year which
 

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.170
we have states with one trial year which
is this kind of zigzaggy dotted line and

with their use of prosecutions seem to

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:44.500
with their use of prosecutions seem to
 

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.190
with their use of prosecutions seem to
see a bit a bigger improvement in their

the three main conclusions that come

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:52.180
the three main conclusions that come
 

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.670
the three main conclusions that come
from the statistical analysis

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680
from the statistical analysis
 

00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.359
from the statistical analysis
our first that our first that countries

00:40:00.359 --> 00:40:00.369
our first that our first that countries

that have used human rights prosecutions

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440
that have used human rights prosecutions
 

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.190
that have used human rights prosecutions
it appears to be associated with

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200
it appears to be associated with
 

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.890
it appears to be associated with
improvements in human rights what we

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:07.900
improvements in human rights what we
 

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.390
improvements in human rights what we
don't know yet exactly are the

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400
don't know yet exactly are the
 

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.670
don't know yet exactly are the
mechanisms through which these

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680
mechanisms through which these
 

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.530
mechanisms through which these
prosecutions translate into improved

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:13.540
prosecutions translate into improved
 

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.720
prosecutions translate into improved
human rights so we don't actually know

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:15.730
human rights so we don't actually know
 

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.400
human rights so we don't actually know
whether it's deterrence whether it's

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:17.410
whether it's deterrence whether it's
 

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.640
whether it's deterrence whether it's
punishment or whether it's what Laura

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:20.650
punishment or whether it's what Laura
 

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:23.280

and others have been referred to as the
 

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.460
and others have been referred to as the
expressive nature of law okay trials of

expressive nature of law okay trials of
 

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.200
expressive nature of law okay trials of
course are not just punishment trials

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.210
course are not just punishment trials
 

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.780
course are not just punishment trials
are high-profile symbolic events that

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:30.790
are high-profile symbolic events that
 

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:35.849
are high-profile symbolic events that
communicate and dramatize norms and so

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:35.859
communicate and dramatize norms and so
 

00:40:35.859 --> 00:40:37.410
communicate and dramatize norms and so
we don't know what's doing the work

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:37.420
we don't know what's doing the work
 

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.380
we don't know what's doing the work
probably both the this increase in the

probably both the this increase in the
 

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:43.200
probably both the this increase in the
likelihood of punishment or this this

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.210

expressing the norm communicating

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000
expressing the norm communicating
 

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.960
expressing the norm communicating
performing these norms second we found

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:51.970
performing these norms second we found
 

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:54.359
performing these norms second we found
that this holds even in situations of

00:40:54.359 --> 00:40:54.369
that this holds even in situations of
 

00:40:54.369 --> 00:40:56.910
that this holds even in situations of
civil war now mind you civil war makes

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920
civil war now mind you civil war makes
 

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.620
civil war now mind you civil war makes
human rights worse we're not saying it

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:58.630
human rights worse we're not saying it
 

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.960
human rights worse we're not saying it
doesn't civil wars is consistently the

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:00.970
doesn't civil wars is consistently the
 

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.609
doesn't civil wars is consistently the
best predictor of bad human rights

00:41:02.609 --> 00:41:02.619
best predictor of bad human rights
 

00:41:02.619 --> 00:41:05.789
best predictor of bad human rights
conditions but when you add actual

00:41:05.789 --> 00:41:05.799
conditions but when you add actual
 

00:41:05.799 --> 00:41:08.370
conditions but when you add actual
prosecutions to a civil war situation it

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:08.380
prosecutions to a civil war situation it
 

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.760
prosecutions to a civil war situation it
doesn't seem to make it even worse and

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:11.770
doesn't seem to make it even worse and
 

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:13.170
doesn't seem to make it even worse and
then the third and maybe the most

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:13.180
then the third and maybe the most
 

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.059
then the third and maybe the most
intriguing finding we have is something

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:15.069
intriguing finding we have is something
 

00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:16.829
intriguing finding we have is something
we call deterrence across borders and

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839
we call deterrence across borders and
 

00:41:16.839 --> 00:41:19.859
we call deterrence across borders and
that is that countries that are in a

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:19.869
that is that countries that are in a
 

00:41:19.869 --> 00:41:22.470
that is that countries that are in a
region where their neighbors have used

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480
region where their neighbors have used
 

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.500
region where their neighbors have used
lots of Human Rights prosecutions see

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:25.510
lots of Human Rights prosecutions see
 

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.270
lots of Human Rights prosecutions see
some kind of improvement in their human

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280
some kind of improvement in their human
 

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.000
some kind of improvement in their human
rights even if they themselves have not

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:30.010
rights even if they themselves have not
 

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.480
rights even if they themselves have not
used prosecutions and so there would

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:33.490
used prosecutions and so there would
 

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.420
used prosecutions and so there would
appear to be that you know when you sit

appear to be that you know when you sit
 

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.730
appear to be that you know when you sit
in Uruguay and you look across the river

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:38.740
in Uruguay and you look across the river

have to I would have talked a little
 

00:41:55.569 --> 00:41:57.990
have to I would have talked a little
about policy implications here in

about policy implications here in
 

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.200
about policy implications here in
theoretical implications you know one

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.210
theoretical implications you know one
 

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:04.459

new norm but I think there's some new
 

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.520

with more rationalist explanations and I

with more rationalist explanations and I

good example of how that works so for

00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:23.569
good example of how that works so for

and what's more important to explain

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:08.390
and what's more important to explain
 

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.990

how many other countries in your region
 

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.039
how many other countries in your region
are using prosecutions so we get an

are using prosecutions so we get an

imitation phenomena that's more
 

00:46:17.059 --> 00:46:20.559
imitation phenomena that's more
important than whether or not you have

you lost your power holders lost at war
and that's what's really interesting

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:24.890
and that's what's really interesting
 

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:29.559
and that's what's really interesting
about these diffusion phenomena secondly

00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:29.569
about these diffusion phenomena secondly

01:17:41.710 --> 01:17:41.720
operational world that Richards talking
 

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.080
operational world that Richards talking
about I think we need to know what the

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:44.090
about I think we need to know what the
 

01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:45.490
about I think we need to know what the
causal mechanism so we can give

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:45.500
causal mechanism so we can give
 

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.340
causal mechanism so we can give
effective recommendations and and for

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:48.350
effective recommendations and and for
 

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.190
effective recommendations and and for
that I wanted to hear more

01:17:51.190 --> 01:17:51.200

disaggregation of some of your

01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:53.090
disaggregation of some of your
 

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:55.510
disaggregation of some of your
categories and then help me think

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520
categories and then help me think
 

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:58.450
categories and then help me think
through what I presume are different

01:17:58.450 --> 01:17:58.460
through what I presume are different
 

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.850
through what I presume are different
causal mechanisms in each case in terms

causal mechanisms in each case in terms
 

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:03.490
causal mechanisms in each case in terms
of effectiveness or even causal ones

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:03.500
of effectiveness or even causal ones
 

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.070
of effectiveness or even causal ones
that is

01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080
that is
 

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:06.410
that is

most important is I because i work on

titles understanding ER and then there's

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:19.290
titles understanding ER and then there's
 

01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:21.530
titles understanding ER and then there's
the post-cold war stuff those are very

01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540
the post-cold war stuff those are very
 

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.320
the post-cold war stuff those are very
different understandings of transitional

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:24.330
different understandings of transitional
 

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:26.780

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:26.790

courts should play and prosecution to
 

01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:32.600
courts should play and prosecution to
play and then I also don't think of

01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:32.610
play and then I also don't think of
 

01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:35.270
play and then I also don't think of
human rights as necessarily a part of

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280
human rights as necessarily a part of
 

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.670
human rights as necessarily a part of
those two so I first wanted to say well

01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:37.680
those two so I first wanted to say well
 

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.690
those two so I first wanted to say well
there's human rights in this

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:38.700
there's human rights in this
 

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.280
there's human rights in this
transitional justice but because I think

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:40.290
transitional justice but because I think
 

01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:42.080
transitional justice but because I think
of transitional justice is at least two

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:42.090
of transitional justice is at least two
 

01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:43.970
of transitional justice is at least two

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.600
separate categories in terms of thinking
about mechanisms I'd like to hear you

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:47.610
about mechanisms I'd like to hear you
 

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:50.900
about mechanisms I'd like to hear you
just help me think through how your data

01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:50.910
just help me think through how your data
 

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:53.270
just help me think through how your data
apply to that differentiation because um

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280
apply to that differentiation because um
 

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:57.460
apply to that differentiation because um
this idea I think it is a false debate

01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:57.470
this idea I think it is a false debate
 

01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:00.470
this idea I think it is a false debate
whether it's individual states or member

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480
whether it's individual states or member
 

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.790
whether it's individual states or member
states on the Security Council whether

01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:01.800
states on the Security Council whether
 

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.360
states on the Security Council whether
people are not between peace and justice

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:04.370
people are not between peace and justice
 

01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:07.640
people are not between peace and justice
it really does depend upon what it is

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:07.650
it really does depend upon what it is
 

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:09.620
it really does depend upon what it is
that we're talking about and what our

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:09.630
that we're talking about and what our
 

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.720
that we're talking about and what our
objective is it might very well be that

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:11.730
objective is it might very well be that
 

01:20:11.730 --> 01:20:14.360
objective is it might very well be that
the mechanisms for transitional justice

01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:14.370
the mechanisms for transitional justice
 

01:20:14.370 --> 01:20:16.420
the mechanisms for transitional justice
in post-conflict are

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:16.430
in post-conflict are
 

01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:18.610
in post-conflict are
better achieve by non tribunal non

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:18.620
better achieve by non tribunal non
 

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.470
better achieve by non tribunal non
individual criminal for example that is

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480
individual criminal for example that is
 

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:22.330
individual criminal for example that is
different from transitions among regimes

01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:22.340
different from transitions among regimes
 

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:24.180
different from transitions among regimes
which is quite different from

01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:24.190
which is quite different from
 

01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:26.110
which is quite different from
enforcement of international human

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120
enforcement of international human
 

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:31.960
enforcement of international human
rights law yeah I think we should gather

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:31.970
rights law yeah I think we should gather
 

01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:36.700
rights law yeah I think we should gather
a few questions baby or comments Thanks

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:36.710
a few questions baby or comments Thanks
 

01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:39.190
a few questions baby or comments Thanks
I have a two-part question actually the

01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:39.200
I have a two-part question actually the
 

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:41.260
I have a two-part question actually the
first one if I understand these graphs

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:41.270
first one if I understand these graphs
 

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.330
first one if I understand these graphs
actually correctly then this is a subset

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:43.340
actually correctly then this is a subset
 

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.100
actually correctly then this is a subset
of countries and then maybe it's

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:45.110
of countries and then maybe it's
 

01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:46.600
of countries and then maybe it's
unconscious going in and out there was

01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:46.610
unconscious going in and out there was
 

01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:48.250
unconscious going in and out there was
entirely clear on that but I was

01:20:48.250 --> 01:20:48.260
entirely clear on that but I was
 

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.990
entirely clear on that but I was
wondering whether you could tell us what

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000
wondering whether you could tell us what
 

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.540
wondering whether you could tell us what
those graphs would look like when we

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:52.550
those graphs would look like when we
 

01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:55.900
those graphs would look like when we
looked at all countries or maybe all non

01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:55.910
looked at all countries or maybe all non
 

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:59.800
looked at all countries or maybe all non
democracies and here's why I'm asking so

01:20:59.800 --> 01:20:59.810
democracies and here's why I'm asking so
 

01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:02.410
democracies and here's why I'm asking so
beyond the immediate effect in states

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:02.420
beyond the immediate effect in states
 

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.600
beyond the immediate effect in states
that actually have trial experience I

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:04.610
that actually have trial experience I
 

01:21:04.610 --> 01:21:07.150
that actually have trial experience I
would think if I'm North Italian ruler

01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:07.160
would think if I'm North Italian ruler
 

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:12.070
would think if I'm North Italian ruler
or part of the ruling repressing elite

01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080
or part of the ruling repressing elite
 

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.460
or part of the ruling repressing elite
and I see these trials in true easily

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:15.470
and I see these trials in true easily
 

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.800
and I see these trials in true easily
going on and I observe some kind of form

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:17.810
going on and I observe some kind of form
 

01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:21.130
going on and I observe some kind of form
of a norm against these forms of

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:21.140
of a norm against these forms of
 

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.680
of a norm against these forms of
repression and I'm seeing that I may

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:23.690
repression and I'm seeing that I may
 

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:25.510
repression and I'm seeing that I may
actually be called to justice at some

01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520
actually be called to justice at some
 

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:28.360
actually be called to justice at some
point later even if I travel either if I

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:28.370
point later even if I travel either if I
 

01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:30.670
point later even if I travel either if I
travel abroad angry without proper care

01:21:30.670 --> 01:21:30.680
travel abroad angry without proper care
 

01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:32.500
travel abroad angry without proper care
or or maybe because it's going to be a

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:32.510
or or maybe because it's going to be a
 

01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:34.540
or or maybe because it's going to be a
regime change within my own country I'm

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:34.550
regime change within my own country I'm
 

01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:37.600
regime change within my own country I'm
going to be more careful and so I would

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:37.610
going to be more careful and so I would
 

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:41.950
going to be more careful and so I would
expect that if these norms actually have

01:21:41.950 --> 01:21:41.960
expect that if these norms actually have
 

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.380
expect that if these norms actually have
a deterrence effect then even these

01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:44.390
a deterrence effect then even these
 

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:47.080
a deterrence effect then even these
average values should show some kind of

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:47.090
average values should show some kind of
 

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:50.590
average values should show some kind of
declining over time at least after the

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:50.600
declining over time at least after the
 

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:52.500
declining over time at least after the
norm becomes effective and I was curious

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:52.510
norm becomes effective and I was curious
 

01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:55.840
norm becomes effective and I was curious
whether whether you have any indication

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:55.850
whether whether you have any indication
 

01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:59.350
whether whether you have any indication
that that's taken place the second and

01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360
that that's taken place the second and
 

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.850
that that's taken place the second and
some words have brought a question that

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:00.860
some words have brought a question that
 

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:03.940
some words have brought a question that
that made me wonder about is do we have

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:03.950
that made me wonder about is do we have
 

01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:07.680
that made me wonder about is do we have
any good theoretical reasons to expect a

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:07.690
any good theoretical reasons to expect a
 

01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:10.960
any good theoretical reasons to expect a
particular time lag there's how much

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:10.970
particular time lag there's how much
 

01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:13.480
particular time lag there's how much
time should pass after the beginning of

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:13.490
time should pass after the beginning of
 

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:16.140
time should pass after the beginning of
these new practices or maybe the

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:16.150
these new practices or maybe the
 

01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:19.180
these new practices or maybe the
intensive diffusion of these practices

01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:19.190
intensive diffusion of these practices
 

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:22.000
intensive diffusion of these practices

a lot of the sort of empirical

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:30.830
a lot of the sort of empirical
 

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:32.740
a lot of the sort of empirical
assessment of that but require actually

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:32.750
assessment of that but require actually
 

01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:34.480
assessment of that but require actually
really to work through that theoretical

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:34.490
really to work through that theoretical
 

01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:40.810
really to work through that theoretical
logic first thank you a couple of

01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:40.820
logic first thank you a couple of
 

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:43.680
logic first thank you a couple of
questions in your previous work you have

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:43.690
questions in your previous work you have
 

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:48.010
questions in your previous work you have
dealt with the issue of gender and and

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:48.020
dealt with the issue of gender and and
 

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:52.060
dealt with the issue of gender and and
but I wonder to what extent your current

01:22:52.060 --> 01:22:52.070
but I wonder to what extent your current
 

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:56.800
but I wonder to what extent your current
concerns deal with that issue in

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:56.810
concerns deal with that issue in
 

01:22:56.810 --> 01:23:00.640
concerns deal with that issue in
particular that many of the gender

01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:00.650
particular that many of the gender
 

01:23:00.650 --> 01:23:06.970
particular that many of the gender
issues or violations of gender issues

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:06.980
issues or violations of gender issues
 

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.770
issues or violations of gender issues
are non governmental and to what extent

01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:11.780
are non governmental and to what extent
 

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:19.870
are non governmental and to what extent
your new framework accounts for for

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880
your new framework accounts for for
 

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:24.430
your new framework accounts for for
explaining the grievances and the

01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:24.440
explaining the grievances and the
 

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:30.640
explaining the grievances and the
violations of gender rights and so

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:30.650
violations of gender rights and so
 

01:23:30.650 --> 01:23:33.430
violations of gender rights and so
that's one question and my second

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440
that's one question and my second
 

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:42.060
that's one question and my second
question deals with the current colonial

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:42.070
question deals with the current colonial
 

01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:48.750
question deals with the current colonial

thank you well
maybe I should there's so many

01:24:28.990 --> 01:24:29.000
maybe I should there's so many

interesting questions and comments that

01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:31.070
interesting questions and comments that
 

01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:33.100
interesting questions and comments that
people are given so what maybe I should

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:33.110
people are given so what maybe I should
 

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:40.300
people are given so what maybe I should
try to just briefly try to address a few

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:40.310
try to just briefly try to address a few
 

01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:45.150
try to just briefly try to address a few
of the point that people have made and

01:24:45.150 --> 01:24:45.160
of the point that people have made and
 

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:49.750
of the point that people have made and
so I'm very sympathetic to Richard's

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760
so I'm very sympathetic to Richard's
 

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:53.380
so I'm very sympathetic to Richard's
points about the the idea that that

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:53.390
points about the the idea that that
 

01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:56.620
points about the the idea that that
justice that this is a fragile process

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:56.630
justice that this is a fragile process
 

01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:59.230
justice that this is a fragile process
and as a power laiden process and in the

01:24:59.230 --> 01:24:59.240
and as a power laiden process and in the
 

01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:01.150
and as a power laiden process and in the
on this particular issue I think that

01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:01.160
on this particular issue I think that
 

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.700
on this particular issue I think that
that bob has said it as I wouldn't met

01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:03.710
that bob has said it as I wouldn't met
 

01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:07.330
that bob has said it as I wouldn't met
as a political scientist never expects

as a political scientist never expects
 

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.690
as a political scientist never expects
power to go away uh and that the kind of

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:10.700
power to go away uh and that the kind of
 

01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:13.890
power to go away uh and that the kind of
analysis I do maybe I can just briefly

01:25:13.890 --> 01:25:13.900
analysis I do maybe I can just briefly
 

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:18.280
analysis I do maybe I can just briefly
briefly do this oops no okay there

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:18.290
briefly do this oops no okay there
 

01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:21.580
briefly do this oops no okay there

something i'll call comparison to the

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:25.850
something i'll call comparison to the
 

01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:28.480
something i'll call comparison to the
ideal they say what's what you know what

kind of Justice do we have compared to

01:25:30.190 --> 01:25:30.200
kind of Justice do we have compared to
 

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.070
kind of Justice do we have compared to
my ideal of justice and if by definition

01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080
my ideal of justice and if by definition
 

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.890
my ideal of justice and if by definition
we always fall short okay so it's always

01:25:35.890 --> 01:25:35.900
we always fall short okay so it's always
 

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.690
we always fall short okay so it's always
a pessimistic receptionist is how far

01:25:37.690 --> 01:25:37.700
a pessimistic receptionist is how far
 

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:40.210
a pessimistic receptionist is how far
short do we do a lot of this is about

01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:40.220
short do we do a lot of this is about
 

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.820
short do we do a lot of this is about
counterfactual reasoning and that is the

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:42.830
counterfactual reasoning and that is the
 

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:44.230
counterfactual reasoning and that is the
whole you know the whole argument of the

01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:44.240
whole you know the whole argument of the
 

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:46.960
whole you know the whole argument of the
ICC in Sudan or in Uganda is all

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:46.970
ICC in Sudan or in Uganda is all
 

01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:48.820
ICC in Sudan or in Uganda is all
counterfactual reasoning you know so if

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:48.830
counterfactual reasoning you know so if
 

01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:52.060
counterfactual reasoning you know so if
someone says the indictment of bar shear

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:52.070
someone says the indictment of bar shear
 

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:54.340
someone says the indictment of bar shear
has been made work has made worse a

has been made work has made worse a
 

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:56.500
has been made work has made worse a
situation in Sudan then it would have

01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:56.510
situation in Sudan then it would have

situation in Sudan then it would have
been the contracts then it would have

make the exact opposite they say no the
 

01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:04.270
make the exact opposite they say no the

would have been without the ICC
involvement we can't resolve that and so

01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:08.240
involvement we can't resolve that and so
 

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:10.960
involvement we can't resolve that and so
I do this empirical comparison and I go

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:10.970
I do this empirical comparison and I go
 

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:13.030
I do this empirical comparison and I go
from where we were where we started to

from where we were where we started to

from where we were where we started to
where we are today and when you do that

things you see what I believe is

theorists but I believe this constitutes
 

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.240
theorists but I believe this constitutes
progress but I would totally agree with

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:28.250
progress but I would totally agree with
 

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.530
progress but I would totally agree with
that we're never we're never getting

that we're never we're never getting

there's certainly less imputing than
 

01:26:50.059 --> 01:26:51.939
there's certainly less imputing than
there was but we will never get to a

situation where there's complete justice
 

01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:56.950
situation where there's complete justice
and certainly not where there's

01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960
and certainly not where there's
 

01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:02.350
and certainly not where there's
even-handed justice I'm going to the

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360
even-handed justice I'm going to the
 

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.810
even-handed justice I'm going to the
question of the many interesting points

01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:04.820
question of the many interesting points
 

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.129
question of the many interesting points
you've made Bob the one that I want to

01:27:06.129 --> 01:27:06.139
you've made Bob the one that I want to

turn to its question about persuasion

01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760
turn to its question about persuasion
 

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:15.370
turn to its question about persuasion
and that's because so the issue is what

01:27:15.370 --> 01:27:15.380
and that's because so the issue is what
 

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:17.529
and that's because so the issue is what
makes some arguments persuasive and some

01:27:17.529 --> 01:27:17.539
makes some arguments persuasive and some
 

01:27:17.539 --> 01:27:19.810
makes some arguments persuasive and some
not persuasive and political scientists

01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:19.820
not persuasive and political scientists

haven't been able to address this and
 

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.919
haven't been able to address this and
it's because I think we won't address

01:27:23.919 --> 01:27:23.929
it's because I think we won't address

the trim in trinsic power of ideas that

the trim in trinsic power of ideas that
 

01:27:27.139 --> 01:27:29.680
the trim in trinsic power of ideas that
particular ideas might have intrinsic

ideas we don't want to do that because
 

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:35.830
ideas we don't want to do that because
it's so hard because once you say that

01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840
it's so hard because once you say that
 

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.430
it's so hard because once you say that
you say what what intrinsic quality has

01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440
you say what what intrinsic quality has
 

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.560

know I made an argument that bodily harm

01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639
know I made an argument that bodily harm
 

01:27:43.639 --> 01:27:45.640
know I made an argument that bodily harm
to vulnerable populations was an

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:45.650
to vulnerable populations was an
 

01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:48.540
to vulnerable populations was an
intrinsic I trinsic Lee powerful idea

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:48.550
intrinsic I trinsic Lee powerful idea
 

01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:53.709
intrinsic I trinsic Lee powerful idea
that was going to be able to be more

01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:53.719
that was going to be able to be more
 

01:27:53.719 --> 01:27:56.319
that was going to be able to be more
persuasive than other ideas and this is

01:27:56.319 --> 01:27:56.329
persuasive than other ideas and this is
 

01:27:56.329 --> 01:27:57.850
persuasive than other ideas and this is
another area where we have we talking

01:27:57.850 --> 01:27:57.860
another area where we have we talking
 

01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.439
another area where we have we talking
about bodily harm but we're talking

01:27:59.439 --> 01:27:59.449
about bodily harm but we're talking
 

01:27:59.449 --> 01:28:02.709
about bodily harm but we're talking
about holding people accountable for

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719
about holding people accountable for
 

01:28:02.719 --> 01:28:05.229
about holding people accountable for
bodily harm to vulnerable populations so

01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:05.239
bodily harm to vulnerable populations so
 

01:28:05.239 --> 01:28:06.339
bodily harm to vulnerable populations so
I think there's two things that make

01:28:06.339 --> 01:28:06.349
I think there's two things that make

I think there's two things that make
this issue persuasive the first is the

this issue persuasive the first is the
 

01:28:09.019 --> 01:28:11.799
this issue persuasive the first is the
domestic analogy that I mentioned it's

01:28:11.799 --> 01:28:11.809
domestic analogy that I mentioned it's
 

01:28:11.809 --> 01:28:13.299
domestic analogy that I mentioned it's
persuasive because as soon as people can

01:28:13.299 --> 01:28:13.309
persuasive because as soon as people can
 

01:28:13.309 --> 01:28:17.410
persuasive because as soon as people can
imagine it that is possible they have a

imagine it that is possible they have a
 

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:19.239
imagine it that is possible they have a
model they hell model in their own

a lot of regional effects and the truth

a lot of regional effects and the truth
is I think we don't know why so I think

you know I've seen this regional effect

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:10.690
you know I've seen this regional effect
 

01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:12.450
you know I've seen this regional effect
in Latin America because virtually all

01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:12.460
in Latin America because virtually all
 

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:14.250
in Latin America because virtually all
the Latin countries participated in the

then you sort of said would I expect the

I have another article where I critique

the scores not because I think they're
 

01:32:39.269 --> 01:32:40.790
the scores not because I think they're
unreliable but kind of gave it a

the audience i'm writing this article
 

01:32:53.249 --> 01:32:55.279
the audience i'm writing this article
with and Clark and I are arguing that

01:32:55.279 --> 01:32:55.289
with and Clark and I are arguing that
 

01:32:55.289 --> 01:32:57.139
with and Clark and I are arguing that
there's a systematic information effect

01:32:57.139 --> 01:32:57.149
there's a systematic information effect
 

01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:59.989
there's a systematic information effect
because what's happened over the last 30

01:32:59.989 --> 01:32:59.999
because what's happened over the last 30
 

01:32:59.999 --> 01:33:02.179
because what's happened over the last 30
years is that we have so much more

01:33:02.179 --> 01:33:02.189
years is that we have so much more
 

01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:03.259
years is that we have so much more
information about human rights

01:33:03.259 --> 01:33:03.269
information about human rights
 

01:33:03.269 --> 01:33:05.810
information about human rights
violations and we used to have and so

01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:05.820
violations and we used to have and so
 

01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.489
violations and we used to have and so
it's possible that some of these

01:33:07.489 --> 01:33:07.499
it's possible that some of these
 

01:33:07.499 --> 01:33:10.339
it's possible that some of these
repression numbers it's not that human

01:33:10.339 --> 01:33:10.349
repression numbers it's not that human
 

01:33:10.349 --> 01:33:11.299
repression numbers it's not that human
rights is getting worse in the world

01:33:11.299 --> 01:33:11.309
rights is getting worse in the world
 

01:33:11.309 --> 01:33:13.459
rights is getting worse in the world
it's that we have know a lot more about

01:33:13.459 --> 01:33:13.469
it's that we have know a lot more about
 

01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:15.619
it's that we have know a lot more about
human rights than we did before now what

01:33:15.619 --> 01:33:15.629
human rights than we did before now what
 

01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:17.029
human rights than we did before now what
that means is that it's even harder to

01:33:17.029 --> 01:33:17.039
that means is that it's even harder to
 

01:33:17.039 --> 01:33:18.649
that means is that it's even harder to
get the statistical result that I got

01:33:18.649 --> 01:33:18.659
get the statistical result that I got
 

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:20.419
get the statistical result that I got
with this data it's even harder to show

01:33:20.419 --> 01:33:20.429
with this data it's even harder to show
 

01:33:20.429 --> 01:33:22.009
with this data it's even harder to show
that anything leads to improvements and

01:33:22.009 --> 01:33:22.019
that anything leads to improvements and
 

01:33:22.019 --> 01:33:23.959
that anything leads to improvements and
so when you show that the things lead to

01:33:23.959 --> 01:33:23.969
so when you show that the things lead to
 

01:33:23.969 --> 01:33:25.849
so when you show that the things lead to
improvements you're fighting against

01:33:25.849 --> 01:33:25.859
improvements you're fighting against
 

01:33:25.859 --> 01:33:28.719
improvements you're fighting against
that information effect in the data okay

01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:28.729
that information effect in the data okay
 

01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:31.699
that information effect in the data okay
but what that was just why it is we

01:33:31.699 --> 01:33:31.709
but what that was just why it is we
 

01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:33.829
but what that was just why it is we
don't see a trend why that global Human

01:33:33.829 --> 01:33:33.839
don't see a trend why that global Human
 

01:33:33.839 --> 01:33:35.629
don't see a trend why that global Human

01:33:35.639 --> 01:33:37.759
Rights repression line isn't trending
downward and probably won't trend

01:33:37.759 --> 01:33:37.769

a question about gender gender enters
into this analysis mainly in the way

01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520
into this analysis mainly in the way

International and ad hoc tribunals they
 

01:33:59.210 --> 01:34:00.520
International and ad hoc tribunals they
have been very important for

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:00.530
have been very important for
 

01:34:00.530 --> 01:34:01.750
have been very important for
incorporating issues like an

01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760
incorporating issues like an
 

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.760
incorporating issues like an
understanding of rape as a war crime and

that the Rome Statute in fact has been I
 

01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:08.770
that the Rome Statute in fact has been I
think made particularly important

the trials of course tend to happen more
 

01:39:46.110 --> 01:39:49.010
the trials of course tend to happen more
in the ruptured situations and the truth

holding countries then you're looking at

01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400
holding countries then you're looking at
 

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:22.610

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:27.810
going through transition well I'm going
 

01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:29.690
going through transition well I'm going
to start with that one just because we

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:29.700
to start with that one just because we
 

01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:31.970
to start with that one just because we
actually have done we actually have look

01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980
actually have done we actually have look
 

01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.370
actually have done we actually have look
at that question and there's another

01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380
at that question and there's another
 

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:36.290
at that question and there's another
research project that my colleague lee

01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300
research project that my colleague lee
 

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.360
research project that my colleague lee
pain is doing and she's also looked at

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:38.370
pain is doing and she's also looked at
 

01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:40.520
pain is doing and she's also looked at
it and we have contrary contradictory

01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:40.530
it and we have contrary contradictory
 

01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:43.070
it and we have contrary contradictory
results on that question so hundred Kim

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080
results on that question so hundred Kim
 

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:45.800
results on that question so hundred Kim
and I looked and we found that truth

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:45.810
and I looked and we found that truth
 

01:40:45.810 --> 01:40:48.380

commissions were also associated with

01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:48.390
commissions were also associated with
 

01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:54.710
commissions were also associated with
some improvements in human rights very

01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:54.720
some improvements in human rights very
 

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:56.780
some improvements in human rights very
often countries do both trials and truth

01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:56.790
often countries do both trials and truth
 

01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:58.850
often countries do both trials and truth
Commission's by the way and so even

01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860
Commission's by the way and so even
 

01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.990
Commission's by the way and so even
though there's this notion that you do

01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000
though there's this notion that you do
 

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:03.350
though there's this notion that you do
one piece that you do justice or truth

01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360
one piece that you do justice or truth
 

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.990
one piece that you do justice or truth
it turns out that most all the countries

01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000
it turns out that most all the countries
 

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.520
it turns out that most all the countries
in Latin America that held prosecutions

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:07.530
in Latin America that held prosecutions
 

01:41:07.530 --> 01:41:09.770
in Latin America that held prosecutions
also had truth commissions for example

01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780
also had truth commissions for example
 

01:41:09.780 --> 01:41:11.810
also had truth commissions for example
so more often truth commissions and

01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:11.820
so more often truth commissions and
 

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:14.360
so more often truth commissions and
trials are used together and then

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:14.370
trials are used together and then
 

01:41:14.370 --> 01:41:15.950
trials are used together and then
there's countries that do little or do

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960
there's countries that do little or do
 

01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.180
there's countries that do little or do
nothing but nevertheless we we were able

01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:19.190
nothing but nevertheless we we were able
 

01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:21.050
nothing but nevertheless we we were able
of truth commissions

01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:21.060
of truth commissions
 

01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.260
of truth commissions
and we found a positive impact Lee pain

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:24.270
and we found a positive impact Lee pain
 

01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:27.320
and we found a positive impact Lee pain
however found a negative impact of truth

01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:27.330
however found a negative impact of truth
 

01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:29.300
however found a negative impact of truth
commissions and we think it's because we

01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:29.310
commissions and we think it's because we
 

01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:30.770
commissions and we think it's because we
code slightly differently we only code

01:41:30.770 --> 01:41:30.780
code slightly differently we only code
 

01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:32.420
code slightly differently we only code
truth Commission's that have reports

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:32.430
truth Commission's that have reports
 

01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:35.420
truth Commission's that have reports
published reports and she'd been coding

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:35.430
published reports and she'd been coding
 

01:41:35.430 --> 01:41:37.730
published reports and she'd been coding
truth Commission's whether or not they

01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:37.740
truth Commission's whether or not they
 

01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:39.140
truth Commission's whether or not they
have published reports and it could be

01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:39.150
have published reports and it could be
 

01:41:39.150 --> 01:41:40.760
have published reports and it could be
that a truth commission with a published

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:40.770
that a truth commission with a published
 

01:41:40.770 --> 01:41:43.160
that a truth commission with a published
report is actually more sincere a truth

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:43.170
report is actually more sincere a truth
 

01:41:43.170 --> 01:41:44.480
report is actually more sincere a truth
commission that you would expect it to

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:44.490
commission that you would expect it to
 

01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:45.890
commission that you would expect it to
have an impact and indeed that's what

01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900
have an impact and indeed that's what
 

01:41:45.900 --> 01:41:49.520
have an impact and indeed that's what
we're seeing but so that but that's

01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:49.530
we're seeing but so that but that's
 

01:41:49.530 --> 01:41:51.800
we're seeing but so that but that's
exactly one that's we're trying to get

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:51.810
exactly one that's we're trying to get
 

01:41:51.810 --> 01:41:53.450
exactly one that's we're trying to get
at this difference between punishment

01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460
at this difference between punishment
 

01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:56.930
at this difference between punishment
and and normative communication because

01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940
and and normative communication because
 

01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:58.640
and and normative communication because
the truth Commission's only are only

01:41:58.640 --> 01:41:58.650
the truth Commission's only are only
 

01:41:58.650 --> 01:41:59.840
the truth Commission's only are only
normative communication there's no

01:41:59.840 --> 01:41:59.850
normative communication there's no
 

01:41:59.850 --> 01:42:02.120
normative communication there's no
punishment involved and so if the

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:02.130
punishment involved and so if the
 

01:42:02.130 --> 01:42:03.740
punishment involved and so if the
mechanisms goes to Susan's point it's a

01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:03.750
mechanisms goes to Susan's point it's a
 

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:07.100
mechanisms goes to Susan's point it's a
mechanism is norm communication then we

01:42:07.100 --> 01:42:07.110
mechanism is norm communication then we
 

01:42:07.110 --> 01:42:08.480
mechanism is norm communication then we
would expect both truth commissions and

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:08.490
would expect both truth commissions and
 

01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:11.030
would expect both truth commissions and
trials to work if it's punishment then

01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040
trials to work if it's punishment then
 

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:12.800
trials to work if it's punishment then
we expect only trials to work and in

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:12.810
we expect only trials to work and in
 

01:42:12.810 --> 01:42:14.390
we expect only trials to work and in
fact only trials with convictions to

01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400
fact only trials with convictions to
 

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:17.240
fact only trials with convictions to
work and we're not seeing that we're

01:42:17.240 --> 01:42:17.250
work and we're not seeing that we're
 

01:42:17.250 --> 01:42:18.470
work and we're not seeing that we're
seeing that the whole process of

01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480
seeing that the whole process of
 

01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:21.080
seeing that the whole process of
prosecution even shorter convictions but

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:21.090
prosecution even shorter convictions but
 

01:42:21.090 --> 01:42:23.360
prosecution even shorter convictions but
for example Milosevic a trial no

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:23.370
for example Milosevic a trial no
 

01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.910
for example Milosevic a trial no
conviction so when people only Codding

01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920
conviction so when people only Codding
 

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:27.770
conviction so when people only Codding
is the only coding virtus convictions

01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780
is the only coding virtus convictions
 

01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:29.660
is the only coding virtus convictions
they've code nothing most which doesn't

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:29.670
they've code nothing most which doesn't
 

01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:31.430
they've code nothing most which doesn't
count it's big zero and we think that'd

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440
count it's big zero and we think that'd
 

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.680
count it's big zero and we think that'd
be a big mistake p no Chet no conviction

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:33.690
be a big mistake p no Chet no conviction
 

01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:35.300
be a big mistake p no Chet no conviction
no verdict we think that'd be a big

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:35.310
no verdict we think that'd be a big
 

01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:36.440
no verdict we think that'd be a big
mistake because there's this

01:42:36.440 --> 01:42:36.450
mistake because there's this
 

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:39.500
mistake because there's this
communicative process as well so

01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:39.510
communicative process as well so
 

01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:42.560
communicative process as well so
basically the we don't have a good

01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:42.570
basically the we don't have a good
 

01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:44.330
basically the we don't have a good
answer for you yet on that one but it's

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340
answer for you yet on that one but it's
 

01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:47.270
answer for you yet on that one but it's
a really important question what we are

01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280
a really important question what we are
 

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.220
a really important question what we are
seeing is that the combination of trials

01:42:49.220 --> 01:42:49.230
seeing is that the combination of trials
 

01:42:49.230 --> 01:42:51.680
seeing is that the combination of trials
and truth Commission's or tends to be

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:51.690
and truth Commission's or tends to be
 

01:42:51.690 --> 01:42:53.180
and truth Commission's or tends to be
particularly effective in tends to be

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:53.190
particularly effective in tends to be
 

01:42:53.190 --> 01:42:57.110
particularly effective in tends to be
very common and it we do think it's that

01:42:57.110 --> 01:42:57.120
very common and it we do think it's that
 

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.480
very common and it we do think it's that
old dichotomy that's not useful truth

01:42:59.480 --> 01:42:59.490
old dichotomy that's not useful truth
 

01:42:59.490 --> 01:43:02.030
old dichotomy that's not useful truth
versus justice it it's usually not the

01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040
versus justice it it's usually not the
 

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.230
versus justice it it's usually not the
case you have to choose one or the other

01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:03.240
case you have to choose one or the other
 

01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:08.840
case you have to choose one or the other
or the countries do um okay my Michaels

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:08.850
or the countries do um okay my Michaels
 

01:43:08.850 --> 01:43:10.640
or the countries do um okay my Michaels
point that's really interesting point

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:10.650
point that's really interesting point
 

01:43:10.650 --> 01:43:15.140
point that's really interesting point
about tongue about short verses long-run

01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:15.150
about tongue about short verses long-run
 

01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:16.970
about tongue about short verses long-run
effects we do look we do lag and we do

01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980
effects we do look we do lag and we do
 

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:19.730
effects we do look we do lag and we do
look effects over a ten-year period we

01:43:19.730 --> 01:43:19.740
look effects over a ten-year period we
 

01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.980
look effects over a ten-year period we
do see that countries that make more

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:21.990
do see that countries that make more
 

01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:24.260
do see that countries that make more
persistent use of trial so one trial

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:24.270
persistent use of trial so one trial
 

01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:26.570
persistent use of trial so one trial
versus more persistent use of trials do

01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580
versus more persistent use of trials do
 

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:28.370
versus more persistent use of trials do
see a bigger effect up to a certain

01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:28.380
see a bigger effect up to a certain
 

01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.140
see a bigger effect up to a certain
point and then there seems to be

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:30.150
point and then there seems to be
 

01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:31.419
point and then there seems to be
diminishing returns

01:43:31.419 --> 01:43:31.429
diminishing returns
 

01:43:31.429 --> 01:43:35.620
diminishing returns
um and so we don't see that they have

01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:35.630
um and so we don't see that they have
 

01:43:35.630 --> 01:43:38.069
um and so we don't see that they have
good short run and then it disappears

01:43:38.069 --> 01:43:38.079
good short run and then it disappears
 

01:43:38.079 --> 01:43:43.989
good short run and then it disappears
and so but this relates to I think the

01:43:43.989 --> 01:43:43.999
and so but this relates to I think the
 

01:43:43.999 --> 01:43:45.669
and so but this relates to I think the
earlier question about how long would we

01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679
earlier question about how long would we
 

01:43:45.679 --> 01:43:49.000
earlier question about how long would we
expect it to take and I've been thinking

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:49.010
expect it to take and I've been thinking
 

01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:50.679
expect it to take and I've been thinking
because of you know my knowledge kind of

01:43:50.679 --> 01:43:50.689
because of you know my knowledge kind of
 

01:43:50.689 --> 01:43:51.759
because of you know my knowledge kind of
Latin American case is more of

01:43:51.759 --> 01:43:51.769
Latin American case is more of
 

01:43:51.769 --> 01:43:54.549
Latin American case is more of
generational effects that in fact the

01:43:54.549 --> 01:43:54.559
generational effects that in fact the
 

01:43:54.559 --> 01:43:57.069
generational effects that in fact the
perpetrators themselves the deterrence

01:43:57.069 --> 01:43:57.079
perpetrators themselves the deterrence
 

01:43:57.079 --> 01:43:58.419
perpetrators themselves the deterrence
Theory actually sometimes refers to it

01:43:58.419 --> 01:43:58.429
Theory actually sometimes refers to it
 

01:43:58.429 --> 01:43:59.709
Theory actually sometimes refers to it
as a not as deterrence but

01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719
as a not as deterrence but
 

01:43:59.719 --> 01:44:02.049
as a not as deterrence but
incapacitation you said you want to in

01:44:02.049 --> 01:44:02.059
incapacitation you said you want to in
 

01:44:02.059 --> 01:44:04.299
incapacitation you said you want to in
pet your goodbyes incapacitate them

01:44:04.299 --> 01:44:04.309
pet your goodbyes incapacitate them
 

01:44:04.309 --> 01:44:06.100
pet your goodbyes incapacitate them
because in fact they are not objects of

01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:06.110
because in fact they are not objects of
 

01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:07.569
because in fact they are not objects of
deterrence someone has already committed

01:44:07.569 --> 01:44:07.579
deterrence someone has already committed
 

01:44:07.579 --> 01:44:10.149
deterrence someone has already committed
a crime is not an object deterrence they

01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159
a crime is not an object deterrence they
 

01:44:10.159 --> 01:44:12.729
a crime is not an object deterrence they
can only be in capacity hind but the

or coming up through the ranks and who
 

01:44:19.670 --> 01:44:21.520
or coming up through the ranks and who
are looking at that and saying maybe

01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:21.530
are looking at that and saying maybe
 

01:44:21.530 --> 01:44:24.459
are looking at that and saying maybe
it's not a good career choice to do that

01:44:24.459 --> 01:44:24.469
it's not a good career choice to do that
 

01:44:24.469 --> 01:44:26.739
it's not a good career choice to do that
and if it's if it's a generational fact

01:44:26.739 --> 01:44:26.749
and if it's if it's a generational fact
 

01:44:26.749 --> 01:44:28.600
and if it's if it's a generational fact
we would expect a lag as that new

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:28.610
we would expect a lag as that new
 

01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:32.350
we would expect a lag as that new
generation comes in and then the harder

01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360
generation comes in and then the harder
 

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.469

question that I didn't know this about

01:44:34.469 --> 01:44:34.479
question that I didn't know this about
 

01:44:34.479 --> 01:44:39.699
question that I didn't know this about
about Harold um okay this is what I

01:44:39.699 --> 01:44:39.709
about Harold um okay this is what I
 

01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:41.410
about Harold um okay this is what I
think one I've already explained that I

01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:41.420
think one I've already explained that I
 

01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:44.199
think one I've already explained that I
think the interpretations of what's

01:44:44.199 --> 01:44:44.209
think the interpretations of what's
 

01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:47.229
think the interpretations of what's
going on in Sudan or Uganda are entirely

01:44:47.229 --> 01:44:47.239
going on in Sudan or Uganda are entirely
 

01:44:47.239 --> 01:44:49.899
going on in Sudan or Uganda are entirely
based on counter factual arguments okay

01:44:49.899 --> 01:44:49.909
based on counter factual arguments okay
 

01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:51.640
based on counter factual arguments okay
it's an entirely counter factual

01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:51.650
it's an entirely counter factual
 

01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:55.390
it's an entirely counter factual
argument that if you lift the indictment

01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:55.400
argument that if you lift the indictment
 

01:44:55.400 --> 01:44:57.910
argument that if you lift the indictment
against Bashir that things are going to

01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920
against Bashir that things are going to
 

01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:00.790
against Bashir that things are going to
get better and Sudan okay some people

01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800
get better and Sudan okay some people
 

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.370
get better and Sudan okay some people
say it some people say the opposite we

01:45:03.370 --> 01:45:03.380
say it some people say the opposite we
 

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:05.399
say it some people say the opposite we
partly only have Bashir's word for it

01:45:05.399 --> 01:45:05.409
partly only have Bashir's word for it
 

01:45:05.409 --> 01:45:08.109
partly only have Bashir's word for it
okay in other words the dilemma with

01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119
okay in other words the dilemma with
 

01:45:08.119 --> 01:45:09.370
okay in other words the dilemma with
hacking Bashir's word for it is that

01:45:09.370 --> 01:45:09.380
hacking Bashir's word for it is that
 

01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:11.949
hacking Bashir's word for it is that
purse I mean I think in the strictly

purse I mean I think in the strictly
 

01:45:11.959 --> 01:45:14.799

technical sense of the blackmailer okay

01:45:14.799 --> 01:45:14.809
technical sense of the blackmailer okay
 

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:17.290
technical sense of the blackmailer okay
that basically Bashir is saying you

01:45:17.290 --> 01:45:17.300
that basically Bashir is saying you
 

01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:20.919
that basically Bashir is saying you
indict me I will you no harm UN troops I

01:45:20.919 --> 01:45:20.929
indict me I will you no harm UN troops I
 

01:45:20.929 --> 01:45:25.029
indict me I will you no harm UN troops I
will unleash war okay so basically how

01:45:25.029 --> 01:45:25.039
will unleash war okay so basically how
 

01:45:25.039 --> 01:45:27.129
will unleash war okay so basically how

really doesn't like which is an

really doesn't like which is an

really doesn't like which is an
indictment and my other people will be

01:45:34.209 --> 01:45:34.219
indictment and my other people will be
 

01:45:34.219 --> 01:45:35.859
indictment and my other people will be
better experts in this but my hunch is

01:45:35.859 --> 01:45:35.869
better experts in this but my hunch is
 

01:45:35.869 --> 01:45:38.620
better experts in this but my hunch is
that giving in but one believing

01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:38.630
that giving in but one believing
 

01:45:38.630 --> 01:45:41.080
that giving in but one believing
Bashir's counterfactual as the one that

Bashir's counterfactual as the one that
 

01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:44.290

people like Harold Koh

01:45:45.220 --> 01:45:45.230
people like Harold Koh
 

01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:47.380
people like Harold Koh
are going to buy hiral are going to buy

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:47.390
are going to buy hiral are going to buy
 

01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:50.710
are going to buy hiral are going to buy
a Bashir's counterfactual that only if

01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:50.720
a Bashir's counterfactual that only if
 

01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:52.030
a Bashir's counterfactual that only if
we lift the indictment well things get

01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:52.040
we lift the indictment well things get
 

01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:54.010
