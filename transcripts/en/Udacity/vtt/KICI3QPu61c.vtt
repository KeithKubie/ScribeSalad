00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.650
Just another way of looking at the same concept.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.170
Here this is the film thing.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.210
Light comes in from down here.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.680
There is protective coating.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.170
The emulsion is where most of the details of the the light silver halides and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.070
everything else is.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.990
The adhesive, and there's the base, and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.930
of course that's covered up to prevent it from getting damaged across the board.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.060
Sounds simple, and basically, it's a very interesting process.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.703
You know, full credit to the people who innovated this whole idea ways

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:28.329
back when.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.418
And some of the earliest cameras, as we talked about before,

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:35.102
were developed in the mid 1800's.

00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:36.722
Purely a chemical process, and

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:40.562
of course, it took them a while to even figure out how to preserve and save and

00:00:40.562 --> 00:00:44.300
then print out, develop and print out, from these chemical processes.
