00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.879
It was a wet, cold, wind overcast day on March
4, 1841.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.410
This didn’t matter to the thousands that
had come out to the nation’s capital to

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.340
see the president-elect William Henry Harrison
be sworn into office as the 9th President

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.700
of the United States.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.840
With people lining the streets all the way
to the Capitol, it was described by John Quincy

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.410
Adams as the largest crowd the city had ever
seen and, by a historian later, as the most

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.220
raucous celebration since George Washington’s
1789 inauguration.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.079
Despite his boring style and advanced age,
Harrison’s military acumen while battling

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.130
Indians in order to open western settlements
earlier in the century had made “Old Tippecanoe”

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.280
a populist candidate very much in line with
the Andrew Jackson.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.400
With temperatures in the mid-40s, Harrison
rode through the streets not in a magnificent

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.990
carriage that was built specifically for him,
but – at his insistence – on a white horse.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.170
He wore no overcoat, gloves or hat because
he felt it made him look undignified.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.090
After being sworn in, he stepped to the podium
and began his inauguration speech as such:

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.340
Called from a retirement which I had supposed
was to continue for the residue of my life

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.969
to fill the chief executive office of this
great and free nation, I appear before you,

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.810
fellow-citizens, to take the oaths which the
Constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.670
for the performance of its duties; and in
obedience to a custom coeval with our Government

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.719
and what I believe to be your expectations
I proceed to present to you a summary of the

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.670
principles which will govern me in the discharge
of the duties which I shall be called upon

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.670
to perform.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.179
Yes, that’s one very long sentence.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.929
His speech would go on to tally 8,445 words
and take nearly two hours.

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.899
To this day, it’s the longest inauguration
speech in American history.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.079
Exactly one month later, William Henry Harrison
died – making him the first President to

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:59.280
die in office and the shortest tenured president
ever.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.649
While it’s often implied (and sometimes
explicitly stated) that he died as a result

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.479
of that lengthy speech in the cold, this doesn’t
appear to be the case.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.560
He did not get sick until three weeks after
his speech and it appears not from anything

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.600
temperature related.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.640
(And if you’re curious, see Why Do People
Seem to Get More Colds in the Winter?)

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.659
His doctors didn’t help, regularly bleeding
him with leeches, among other “treatments,”

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.269
which we’ll get into shortly.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.320
While Old Tippecanoe’s presidency was – unlike
his inaugural address – very, very short,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.629
his life’s story was far from it.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.040
At times during the campaign, Harrison would
refer to himself as a child of the American

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.069
Revolution.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.780
This wasn’t simply a boast, but also true.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.910
William was born as the youngest child to
the wealthy and influential Harrison family

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.000
of Virginia on February 9, 1773.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.189
Counted among family friends were famed names
like Jefferson, Madison and Washington.

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.810
Even more impressively, Benjamin Harrison
(William’s father) was named a delegate

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.420
to the Continental Congress and was an original
signer of the Declaration of Independence

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.510
(which note was not signed until August of
1776, not July 4th as is so often stated).

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.489
Because of his family’s connections, there’s
little doubt that young William met some of

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.909
his Revolutionary heroes.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.040
In fact, with his father convinced that he
was destined for a career in medicine, he

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.390
was sent to Philadelphia to study under Benjamin
Rush – another signer of the Declaration

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.390
of Independence.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.219
However, being a doctor was never the youngest
Harrison’s destiny.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.650
When his father died in 1791, he joined the
military and used his family name to secure

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.829
an officer’s rank.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.220
He made his way to the Northwest Territory
and worked under General “Mad Anthony”

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.769
Wayne (named as such for his daring attack
on the British during the Revolutionary War)

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.579
at Fort Washington – near present-day Cincinnati.

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.180
Harrison’s job there was to help Wayne open
land for settlement, which meant fighting

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.219
natives and forcing them from land that was
deemed under American control.

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.019
This is how Harrison began to make a name
for himself – battling Native Americans.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.969
When Wayne died, Captain Harrison took over
military control of the Northwest Territory.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:08.549
In 1798, after resigning from the Army, he
was named Secretary of the Northwest Territory

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.129
by President Adams and its first delegate
to Congress.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.829
In 1800, the territory split into two – the
Ohio and Indiana Territory – and Harrison

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.220
was named governor of the latter.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.390
As governor, he was able to make himself a
good deal of money through land speculation.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.170
But perhaps his worst offense was his exploitation
of the Native population with a land grab

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.900
that was driven by trickery and force.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.370
According to the Miller Center at the University
of Virginia for the American Presidency, Harrison

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.830
took advantage of the Native Americans inability
to grasp the European idea of land ownership.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.870
He pushed for the signing of treaties that
were written to intentionally confuse them.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.539
In addition, he exploited their inexperience
with European alcohol (contrary to popular

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.220
believe, Native Americans had various forms
of alcohol before the Europeans arrived),

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.870
using it to lower their inhibitions and having
them accept deals that were pennies on the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.870
dollar.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.110
This eventually led to war with the Native
American leader Tecumseh.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.490
On the banks of a small river in today’s
Indiana called Tippecanoe, Harrison was able

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.870
to fight off Tecumseh and his warriors mostly
to due to overwhelming numbers and superior

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.870
arms.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.150
Nonetheless, Harrison became the talk of the
young nation for fighting off the “Indian

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.490
insurrection.”

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.190
As the Miller Center puts it, “The Battle
of Tippecanoe was good for William Henry Harrison

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.720
and no one else.”

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.710
In 1813, Tecumseh and Britain joined forces
in attempts to embarrass Harrison and the

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.949
United States during the western portion of
the War of 1812.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:37.300
Again, Harrison’s outfit triumphed thanks
in large part to simply having more men.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.060
His military reputation followed him over
the next two and half decades which allowed

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.539
him to run and be nominated for various offices,
including Congressmen, Senator and ambassador

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.680
to Columbia.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.419
To many, it seemed Harrison’s ultimate goal
was not public service, but to supplement

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.020
a grandiose lifestyle.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.879
He moved in and out of debt numerous times
in his career, often coming into money only

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.550
to spend it right away.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.220
John Quincy Adams once said that he believed
Harrison had a “rabid thirst for lucrative

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.220
office.”

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.190
Nonetheless, in 1836 he was nominated by the
newly formed Whig party to run for President

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.150
(along with two other Whig candidates all
with the intent to stop Martin Van Buren from

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.150
becoming President).

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.590
In 1840, he was nominated again with the express
purpose of running against Jackson principles

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.810
(which Van Buren represented).

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.729
Despite Harrison’s own love for the finer
things in life, he was presented as a direct

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:32.130
contrast to the previous administration – a
western man who was dull, lived in a log cabin

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.440
and a military hero rather than a bureaucrat.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.599
This worked, despite it being ultimately false,
and Harrison throttled Van Buren in the election,

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:45.650
amassing nearly 80% of the electoral vote.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.360
During the campaign, there were already hints
that Harrison would not make it his full-term.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.601
He had been sick throughout the campaign,
while also enduring the recent loss of a child.

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:58.650
At the time, he was also the oldest person
to be ever elected president.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.349
150 years later, he would be eclipsed by Reagan
(who was just out-olded by the recent election

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:08.449
of Donald Trump).

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:13.310
On inauguration day, his very long speech
detailed several things that are essentially

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.330
his only Presidential record.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.910
He criticized the shift of centralizing power
under the executive branch that had happened

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.330
under Jackson and Van Buren, while claiming
he would not run for a second term.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:28.539
Harrison said he would not interfere in the
financial policies of the states, nor in their

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.400
right to determine their own slaveholding
laws.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.129
(Harrison was slaveholder himself.)

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:39.289
He also pledged to pull the country out of
the economic depression it was in.

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:42.930
It was three weeks after the inauguration
that Harrison first told a doctor that he

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.930
felt ill.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.639
Complaining of fatigue and anxiety, he was
prescribed rest and various “medicines”

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:54.120
that we would never ingest today (like acetate
of ammonia and mercury-tinged liquids).

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.280
Over a course of a week, Harrison gradually
fell iller.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.280
His doctor was convinced that it was pneumonia,
but his notes showed otherwise – with constant

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.300
recordings of bowel movements and intestinal
pain.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.750
On April 3, 1841, President Harrison uttered
these (apparently) last words: “Sir, I wish

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:16.870
you to understand the true principles of government;
I wish them carried out, I ask nothing more.”

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.319
The legend has always been that Harrison had
died from pneumonia contracted from refusing

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:26.919
to wear a coat while spending hours in the
cold and rain during his inauguration.

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:33.010
However, in 2014, two doctors from the University
of Maryland School of Medicine concluded that

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:38.440
he likely died from enteric fever – or typhoid
fever – as a result of drinking contaminated

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.440
drinking water.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.060
During the mid-19th century, DC sewage was
often dumped in a marsh that was located upstream

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.750
of the White House’s water supply.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.410
It’s very possible that the bacteria-infused
water seeped into the drinking water of the

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.170
President, giving him the much-dreaded typhoid
fever.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.670
As noted by the doctors, this poorly-designed
White House architectural feature also may

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.800
have been the cause of death President Taylor
in 1850 and Lincoln’s son William in 1862.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.880
Harrison’s quick death inspired a Constitutional
crisis, as never before had a sitting President

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.000
died while in office.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.580
The Constitution did not state with clarity
what happens.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.770
It does say that the presidency “shall devolve
on the Vice President” (which in this case

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.351
was John Tyler), but it did not say if they
would be simply the “acting” president

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:24.410
until another was elected in a special election
or they would become President until the next

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.720
scheduled election.

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.400
Tyler took the job and proposed these questions
to the Supreme Court, Harrison’s cabinet

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400
and Congress.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.380
But no one would come to a clear, decisive,
consensus-driven decision.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.970
So, Tyler decided that he would be President
until the next election – which was four

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.690
years later in 1844.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.970
He took a public oath of office on April 6th
(three days after Harrison’s death).

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.410
Detractors gave him the nickname “His Accidency.”

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:52.540
It wouldn’t be until 1967 with the 25th
Amendment that clear succession rules were

00:09:52.540 --> 00:10:12.040
put into law.
