00:00:00.587 --> 00:00:02.226
- [Voiceover] Let F be
a function such that

00:00:02.226 --> 00:00:03.842
F of negative one is three.

00:00:03.842 --> 00:00:07.054
And F prime of negative
one is equal to five.

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:08.770
Let G be the function G of X

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.191
is equal to one over X.

00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.831
Let capital F be a function defined as

00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:15.438
the product of those other two functions.

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:19.066
What is capital F prime of negative one?

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:21.030
Well, we can just apply
the product rule here,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.462
let me just rewrite let me just

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:25.154
essentially state the product rule.

00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:27.365
Capital F prime of X

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:29.619
is going to be equal to

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.929
since capital F of X is the product

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:32.834
of these two functions,

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.744
when we apply the product
rule this is gonna be

00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:35.744
F prime of X

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:37.903
times G of X

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:40.130
plus plus

00:00:41.595 --> 00:00:43.166
F of X

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.749
times G prime of X.

00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:47.882
And so if we want to evaluate this

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:49.918
at F of negative one

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:51.727
capital F prime

00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:53.950
at negative one is equal to

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.193
F prime of negative one

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:58.110
times G of negative one

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:02.932
plus function F evaluated at negative one

00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:04.845
times the derivative of G

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.912
evaluated at negative one.

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:09.271
And let's see if we can
figure these things out.

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.531
So do they tell us this anywhere?

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:12.732
Can we figure this out?

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:14.428
F prime of negative one.

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:15.482
Well they tell us right over here

00:01:15.482 --> 00:01:16.667
F prime of negative one

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.330
is equal to five.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.578
So this is equal to five.

00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:22.548
Now, let's actually stick with F.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.332
What is F of negative one?

00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:25.868
Well, they tell that to us

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:26.701
right over here.

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:29.164
F of negative one is equal to three.

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:32.083
So F of negative one is equal to three.

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:33.612
Now G of negative one

00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:35.046
and G prime of negative one

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.759
they don't give it to us explicitly here

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.300
but we can figure it out.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.149
We can, we know that if G of X

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:42.651
is equal to this

00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:45.026
G of negative one is equal

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.696
to one over negative one

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:48.697
which is equal to negative one.

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:51.080
So this is equal to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.559
negative one.

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:55.348
And then last but not least

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:57.910
if we want to find G prime of negative one

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.084
we just have to take
the derivative of this.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:01.417
So G prime of X.

00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:04.860
Actually just let me rewrite G of X.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.693
G of X

00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:08.164
one over X is just the same thing

00:02:08.164 --> 00:02:10.243
as X to the negative one.

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:11.506
So we're gonna use a power rule

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.246
to figure out G prime of X

00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:15.357
is equal to bring that exponent

00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:17.755
out front, negative one times X

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:20.120
to the and then decrement the exponent

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.307
negative two power.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:23.474
So, G prime of

00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:26.670
negative one

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.735
of negative one is equal to

00:02:28.735 --> 00:02:30.235
negative one times

00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:33.437
negative one to the

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:36.220
negative two power.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.375
And that's just the same thing as

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:41.625
negative one over negative one squared.

00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:44.452
This is one.

00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:46.258
So this is just all going to evaluate

00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:47.591
to negative one.

00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:50.804
So this is

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.123
negative one.

00:02:52.123 --> 00:02:53.869
And so we have

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.491
five times negative one

00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:57.267
which is negative five.

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:58.889
Plus three times negative one

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.532
which is negative three.

00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:01.911
Which is equal to

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:03.859
negative eight.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.755
So F prime of negative one

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:08.005
is equal to negative eight.
