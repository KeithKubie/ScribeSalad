00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.890
IF ONLY THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY!

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.519
Whattup shorties, short Jules here for a DNews
short.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.130
I am five-foot-eight, which is below the average
height for an adult American male, roughly

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.360
five-foot-nine-and-a-half.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.860
For our entire lives, we’ve been told that
there is nothing we can really do about being

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.860
short.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.390
For most everything else, there is plastic
surgery, or medication, or some other solution,

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.410
while us shorties are stuck with shoe lifts
and pinstripes.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.980
But what if I told you vertically challenged
friends that there is a way to grow taller,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.670
even as a fully grown adult.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.670
The only catch?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.730
Well, you have to break your legs.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.480
A medical procedure, called “distraction
osteogenesis”, can actually lengthen your

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.969
bones by a few inches, and was originally
developed to treat those with uneven leg lengths,

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:48.100
or dwarfism.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.010
This is essentially done by breaking the bone,
then separating or stretching it for the bone

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.809
to heal in a longer position.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.100
Today it is mostly used to treat disorders
of the face, where the jaw or chin or skull

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.239
may not be the right size, or growing in the
right direction.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.540
But in China, this surgery saw popularity
around the early 2000s, and is still being

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.220
done around the world as a cure for, well,
shortness.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.500
There are three stages to the heightening
procedure.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.000
The first is called the “latency phase”.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.159
The legbone, usually the tibia, is either
fully separated, or just cut into what is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.310
essentially a fracture.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.640
The second, ‘distraction phase’ introduces
a separating device, often a Ilizarov apparatus.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.250
This surrounds the leg and bolts into the
bone, allowing not only stabilization, but

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.250
separation.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.149
Each day, the device separates the two parts
of the tibia by about one millimeter.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.340
While the device separates the bone, a callus
forms at the site of the break.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.200
As the bone is spread farther and farther
apart, the callus is resorbed and replaced

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170
by a collagen structure.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.159
Collagen is a protein that forms the connective
tissues in our bodies.

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.270
New blood vessels grow around this collagen
and special cells called osteoblasts move

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.950
in to create the actual bone material.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.600
At this stage though, the bone material has
not mineralized, or become fully hard.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.569
Once the desired length is reached, which
often tops out at just a few inches, the final

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.879
phase begins: consolidation.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.800
In this phase, the bone material mineralizes
-- and this takes about a month for each centimeter

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800
in length!.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.250
The now slightly taller patient just has to
undergo several months of physical therapy

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.610
to learn how to walk again.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.030
As you might imagine, the whole process is
very painful.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.319
And, according to a study published in 2014
by the European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.500
and Traumatology, 77% of patients experience
complications, and 70% of those complications

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.620
were major, including axis deviation, or leg
alignment, hardening of joints, and psychological

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.620
problems.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.290
The Hospital for Special Surgery in the US
claims to have added up to a full foot in

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.590
height to those with dwarfism, although most
people are only able to achieve a height boost

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.599
of a few inches.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.860
So, yes, you can get taller.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.319
But in most cases, you might not want to.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.900
So how much force does it take to break a
bone anyway?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.849
We answer that question in this video.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.319
