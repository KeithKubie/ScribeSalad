00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.380
In the last several videos, we
assumed that the velocity of

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.430
the source, of the object that's
emitting the wave,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.730
we've assumed that that's less
than the velocity of the wave.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.420
And we saw what happens
with the Doppler

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.670
effect and all of that.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.240
But what I want to do in this
video is not make this

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.760
assumption.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.570
In particular, let's see what
happens, at least, at first

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.320
for our formulas, and then get
a conceptual understanding.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.900
Let's see what happens when the
velocity of the source is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
equal to the velocity
of the wave.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.790
The first thing we might try to
do is just apply this new

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.030
assumption into the formulas
that we had in the last video.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.210
And those formulas were here.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.650
These are the observed period
and frequency for an observer

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.980
that's in the direction
of the object.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.100
And if we make this assumption,
that the velocity

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.650
of the sound-- and the velocity
of the source-- we're

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.110
not necessarily dealing with
soundwaves, although that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.700
might be an easy visualization
for you.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.210
That tends to be how
I visualize it.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.990
But what happens to these
formulas when the velocity of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.070
the source is equal to the
velocity of the wave?

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.110
If these two quantities are
equal up here, you have

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.300
something, subtract the
same thing from it.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.270
This numerator right
here becomes 0.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.880
So it'll turn this whole
thing into being 0.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.440
So the period, or the observed
period, will be 0, which means

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.580
you don't have to wait
any time at all

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.400
between successive crests.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.280
The entire waveform just gets
infinitely bunched together.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.290
So it's kind of like
one impulse.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.600
And if we look at the frequency,
we can either look

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.000
directly at the formula, and
you'll see, you have something

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.180
divided by 0 right here.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.275
So you can say this is 1 over 0,
or you could just say that

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:44.300
the frequency is 1 over the
period, and you get this thing

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.550
that's undefined.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.980
But if you want to think about,
what does the frequency

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.120
approach as the velocity of
the source approaches the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.850
velocity of the wave, if this
thing is only a little bit

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.340
less that thing, this is going
to be a very, very, very

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.770
small, very, very small
positive number.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.300
So when you divide these
quantities by that very, very,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
very small positive
number, you're

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.350
going to approach infinity.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.070
So the frequency is undefined at
the speed, at the velocity

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.120
of the wave, but it's going
to approach infinity.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.100
It will approach infinity as
the source approaches the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.560
velocity of the wave. Not
necessarily a soundwave.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.150
I keep using soundwaves, because
that's how I tend to

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.930
visualize things.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.450
And we'll talk in future videos
specifically about

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.563
soundwaves.

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:39.510
And we'll touch on it a little
bit in this video.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.830
So what is this telling us?

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.440
Does this make any sense?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.640
And if you think about it, at
least to me, it starts to make

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.230
sense just what you saw in the
last couple of videos.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.850
The last couple of videos,
when something was moving

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.470
slower than the speed
of sound, you had,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.190
OK, I'm here now.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.800
And I'm about to release the
next crest. If I go one period

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.170
ago, maybe I was right there.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.720
And the crest that I had
released at that time period

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.830
maybe has traveled this
far, just like that.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.570
If you go a period before
that, I would

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.680
have been over there.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.400
And crest that I released then
would have traveled that far.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.850
We saw this in the
last two videos.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.400
And if you go the period
before that, I

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.330
would have been there.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.120
And the crest that I would
have released would

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.580
have been that far.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.790
This was the whole reason why
the Doppler effect happens.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.400
Because the observer sitting
right here-- let me do this in

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.890
a separate color-- the observer
sitting right here is

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.310
going to experience these crests
more frequently than an

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.380
observer sitting out here.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.520
Because the wavelength gets
compressed, because every time

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.980
this guy releases a new
crest, or a new cycle,

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.510
he has moved forward.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.570
He's moved forward in the
direction of this

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.160
motion right here.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.120
So let's think about what
happens when he is exactly

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.030
moving at the speed of the wave.
So let's say that the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.930
source is here now.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.200
This is right where he is.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.530
And he's right about to release
a new crest. So where

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.760
was he at one period ago?

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.490
So let's say he was here
one period ago.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.990
So one period ago, if he's right
going to release crest

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.390
or cycle right now,
one period ago, he

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.130
released another cycle.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.540
And where has that cycle gone?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.560
Well, we're assuming that the
wave is traveling at the same

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.540
velocity as this guy.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.020
But it's going radially
outward.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.260
So whatever he released then,
it will have traveled at the

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.260
same velocity as himself.

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.210
So it will have gotten
this far.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.280
He released it one period ago,
and that's where he was one

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.210
period ago.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.210
Over the course of the next
period, he traveled there and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.990
so did the wave. The wave
also traveled there.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.630
Now, where was this character
two periods ago?

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.910
When I talk about the period,
I'm talking about the actual

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.490
period of the wave. Every
period, or how long does it

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.750
take between similar points
in the cycle?

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.210
And I like to think of them as
the crests in the cycle.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.270
So two periods ago,
he was here.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.700
And he released a-- you can
imagine, a pulse, or crest.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.190
And where will that be now?

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.940
Well that will have traveled
as far as he did.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.300
He traveled that far,
and so will the

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.400
pulse that he released.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.800
It will have traveled-- actually
I have to make it a

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.360
little bit more symmetric.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.890
It will have traveled
that far.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.750
And if you go three periods ago,
I think you get the idea.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.750
If you go three periods
ago, he was here.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:41.650
And he released a pulse then,
or crest, or a cycle of the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.870
wave. And where will
that be now?

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.820
Well, it will have traveled
as fast as he's gotten.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.620
So it will have gotten
this far.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.830
Of course, it's traveling that
velocity in every direction,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.340
radially outward.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.980
Now think about the situation
for the observer.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.770
Think, in particular, about
the observer who's sitting

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.140
right here.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.330
Let's say he's just out of the
way so that this thing doesn't

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.600
run into him and kill him,
and what whatever else.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.330
But he's just out of the way,
just enough to experience the

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.420
sound, but not directly collide
with this object

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.340
that's emitting the-- well, I
shouldn't say sound-- emitting

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.410
the wave. I want to be
general right here.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.180
We're not assuming that
this is a soundwave.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.870
What's he going to experience?

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.020
Well, he's not going to-- well,
if we assume this is a

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.050
soundwave, he's not going to
hear anything until the thing

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.200
passes right there.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.770
And right when the thing passes,
it has all of the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.620
sound that it generated coming
with it at exactly

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.140
that moment in time.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.150
Instead of hearing things
periodically, all of the wave

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.630
fronts smack this
guy all at once.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.910
And perceptually, instead of
hearing a pitch, because

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.570
you're hearing something
periodic, you're just going to

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.540
hear a big thump, because all
of that sound energy is

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.020
getting to you at
the same time.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.150
You're just going
to hear a thump.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.900
Because it's no longer
really a frequency.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.010
All of the energy is coming
to you at the same time.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.400
And when you are talking about
sound, specifically, and

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.800
especially, when you are
trans-sonic, which means

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.410
you're around the speed of
sound, or parts of you are

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.570
above or below the speed of
sound, and you move into

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.410
supersonic speeds, that's
what people relate

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.850
to the sonic boom.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.880
And we're going to talk a little
bit more about that in

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.690
the next video and mach numbers,
all that, because I

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.110
just find all of that
fascinating.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.510
But I think this is intuitive.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.110
Because when you look at this,
everything is just reaching

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.660
you at exactly the same time.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.520
And this was the case of
soundwaves, but it would be

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.730
true of any type of waves.
