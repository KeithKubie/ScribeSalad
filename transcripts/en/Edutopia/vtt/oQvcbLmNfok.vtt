00:00:02.456 --> 00:00:05.786
&gt;&gt;Linda: The best activities in
classrooms develop a lot of skills

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:09.076
at one time, both cognitive
and social-emotional.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:21.216
&gt;&gt;As we talk a lot about the
complex thinking and problem solving

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:25.656
that people need to be able to do in
today's society, in order to do that,

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:31.706
you need the capacity to self-regulate,
to manage your time and your emotions.

00:00:31.756 --> 00:00:34.756
You need the capacity of
executive functioning,

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:38.976
to organize how you approach
things, to be metacognitive

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:40.926
and reflective about your work.

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:47.016
These things are developed in
certain kinds of work simultaneously.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.936
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: Creative problem solving is
a skill that we want our kids to have,

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:54.656
and the makerspace is the
place in the classroom

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:57.100
where we're cultivating
that skill in our kids.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.916
&gt;&gt;Carly: I'm supposed to make
something, and it's supposed

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:06.200
to help people, or help fix a solution.

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:13.850
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, so
let's go to your design.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.076
&gt;&gt;Carly: She'll get your approval,

00:01:15.076 --> 00:01:18.600
so then you can start getting
your materials and make it.

00:01:25,666 --&gt; 00:01:29,336
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: When you give kids
autonomy and choice and really hands

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:34.316
on materials, you have them applying
the learning in a way that helps them

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:36.376
to gain deep understanding.

00:01:37:19 --&gt; 00:01:42,246
&gt;&gt;Linda: If you give children a project
to undertake, a passion that they have,

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:44.346
that they want to find the answer to,

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:46.896
they need to be able
to organize themselves.

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:51.026
They will be using critical
thinking and problem solving,

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.146
and as they undertake these tasks,
they're building both the social

00:01:55.146 --> 00:02:00.656
and emotional foundation, and they're
also building the cognitive abilities

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:01.996
to demonstrate their learning.

00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:06.596
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: It's almost second nature to
them that you keep working on something.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.106
&gt;&gt;Student: I had to turn this a little.
It means it was going the wrong way,

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.016
because it's supposed
to go in the middle--

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:23.396
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: We send the message
in everything we do that struggle

00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:26.026
and making mistakes are
ways that you can learn.

00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:30.696
The makerspace is a physical place
and an approach to problem solving

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:35.196
that really lends itself to that
notion of practice being important.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:39.576
As you work harder on it, you change
it and improve it, it gets better.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:44.336
&gt;&gt;Linda: Because of that, they will
feel empowered, with a growth mindset,

00:02:44.826 --> 00:02:48.296
to continually get better
in their learning.

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:49.796
&gt;&gt;Student: So time to
take, times things apart.

00:02:49.796 --> 00:02:50.816
&gt;&gt;Student: It's called makerspace,

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:55.506
but we call it take apart,
so we can take it apart.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:58.846
&gt;&gt;Cynthia: When everything we do
is building independence in kids,

00:02:59.306 --> 00:03:02.776
building their ability to be
self-regulated, then you can release

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:07.456
to time and interest areas where kids
can go to the makerspace and stay there

00:03:07.456 --> 00:03:11.476
as long as they'd like, because
you've built that ability

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.246
to be self-regulated while
doing that autonomous work.

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:15.546
&gt;&gt;Student: I'll hold it like that.

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:19.386
&gt;&gt;Student: No, I got it.
This is like a level.

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:25.336
&gt;&gt;Linda: We see children as little
as three years old spending thirty,

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:29.616
forty minutes working on a
project, regulating themselves,

00:03:29.696 --> 00:03:33.036
because it's an environment that
both teaches them how to do it,

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:35.756
and is positive and affirming.
