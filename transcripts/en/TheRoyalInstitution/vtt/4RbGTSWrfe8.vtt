00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.300
British Rail are developing trains that fly.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.700
New wheels.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.480
They lift off the rails to a constant gap,
15 mm,

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.060
by powerful electromagnets which we can illustrate
by reference to this little ball.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.400
Which is an ordinary beach ball to which it's been attached a metal cap

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.859
capable of attraction by this electromagnet
which I will shortly switch on.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.919
And then the ball can be held up against the
magnet.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.900
So if I switch the mains on, the electromagnet
is now activated

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.600
and if I put the ball within the range of
the magnet

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.280
the magnet will pull the ball up and it will
actually stay fixed against the magnet.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.400
If I try and pull the ball away it's quite
difficult,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.180
but with a good pull it'll come.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.000
And if it's too far away it will, it will
fall.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.520
If it's too near, it will simply bump up against
the face of the magnet.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.140
So it's rather unstable in any intermediate
position

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.280
and what British Rail would like to do

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.350
would be to have a suspension which held the
ball or the train at a fixed gap.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.350
Now that can be achieved if you have a light
system here,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.020
going from this light to a photoelectric cell,

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440
which actually controls the current in the
electromagnet

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.530
in such a way that if the ball attracts, goes
towards the magnet

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.200
the current has made less and the ball falls
away slightly.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.639
And conversely on the other side.

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:37.420
Now if I can start it off in the right position
it will in fact hold that gap

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.310
which I hope you can see quite closely

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.140
and I can turn the ball without any interference.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.980
And that's the principle of magnetic levitation.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.520
Now it's not enough just to get the train
off the rails of course the train has to move!

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.119
So how about that? Well for that the proposal
and indeed the result

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.039
is to use an induction motor. A linear induction
motor.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.890
But first lets look at an ordinary rotational
induction motor which is shown here.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.110
It consists of a casing.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.330
A number of electromagnets are spaced around
the casing.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.030
And alternating current is fed into the magnets
in such a way

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.080
that a magnetic field is swept around the
casing.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.200
Rather like a brush with bristles pointing
inwards.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.980
Rotating at a speed determined by the frequency
of the current.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.640
Now that magnetic field intersects elements
in the rotor

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.920
and induces currents according to the experiment
that you've just seen.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.260
Those two currents interact with certain forces.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.230
The forces can't move the stata, but they
do in fact drive the rotor around,

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.820
in pursuit of the electromagnetic field.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.760
And that's the principle of an induction motor.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.920
However, the train has to move in a straight
line.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.660
So the next stage is to say, well, we'll make
this thing into a linear machine.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.760
Imagine that this casing is the stata with
the electromagnets spaced around it.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.420
And if I cut through the casing and lay it
flat

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.480
then I have the basis of a linear induction
motor.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.010
The poles are now spaced along the length
rather than around the circumference

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.540
and by feeding alternating current in the
correct phase along the length,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.650
then I get a travelling magnetic field which
drives the rotor

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.900
or some small object picking up the induced
electricity in that direction.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.120
And professor Laithwaite has kindly provided
this little demonstration for that.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.060
The electromagnets are in fact within this
little black box.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.240
If I switch it on I produce a travelling field
going to the right.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.100
If I put this copper tube in position over
it.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.220
Stop it initially.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.460
Then it will drive the rotor round and round.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.560
As the forces affect the lower part of the
tube

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.280
and put it into quite a fast rotation.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.420
However that's not quite the answer yet.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.720
So to get the train to move, then if we put that
plate on the top,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.590
I'll switch the machine off to begin with
so everything is nice and stationary.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.840
And if I know switch the machine on

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.160
the travelling field will now drive the plate
off in that direction.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.140
You're quite safe, it doesn't go that far. At
least it hasn't so far.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.280
And it fires away.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.490
So that if we had a very long track with electromagnets
spaced out appropriately,

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.240
then we could in fact drive the train without
propulsion.
