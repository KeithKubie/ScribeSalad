00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.230
A Team is probably best modeled as a Kind.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.460
It's a concrete structure that can have many entities.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.380
A Game is also best modeled as a Kind,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.500
for the same reasons as for Team. The Winning

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.590
Team is probably best modeled as an Entity. But,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.840
this answer is not so straightforward. It could, for

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.480
example, be a Property Value in an Entity. A

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.520
Player is probably best modeled as a Kind for

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.910
the same reasons as Team and Game. And, the Player Name sounds

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.800
like it's modeled through a Property Value. I hope you did well on

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.320
the quiz. All right, that's an introduction to DataStore. Now, it's about time

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.880
to check out some code, don't you think? Let's do that. Good luck.
