00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.640
[archive audio] This is Saturn 5. The rocket
that will send three Americans to the moon

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:21.199
in Project Apollo. But this historic journey
cannot be attempted without knowledge. And

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:29.699
so in 1961 the Gemini Program came into being
as a necessary prelude to Apollo. This is

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.450
the story of Gemini and its legacy to spaceflight.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.879
[narration] With one successful program under
its belt NASA had gained valuable experience

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.879
in space. Project Mercury had shown to the
world that the United States were capable

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.399
of sending people into space, but with the
president promising the moon by the end of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.090
the decade, NASA still had a lot of ground
(and distance) to cover.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.629
As with Mercury, astronauts on Gemini missions
rode inside launch capsules mounted to rockets

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.730
which were built by McDonnell Aircraft Corporation
and designed by Jim Chamberlain to carry two

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.070
passengers, which is where the project took
it�s name from - Gemini being latin for

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.840
twin.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.540
It was the first spacecraft to use a modular
design with it�s components, meaning failing

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.820
parts could easily be swapped out and replaced.
It was also the first spacecraft to include

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.619
an onboard computer - the Gemini Guidance
Computer.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:31.369
[archive audio] In the 18 months between March
1965 and November 1966 ten manned missions

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.210
were launched from Cape Kennedy.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.890
[narration] Part of the Gemini team was Neil
Armstrong, the first civilian astronaut, who

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.140
would later make history with Buzz Aldrin
and Michael Collins, also Gemini astronauts,

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.540
when they became the first people to land
on the moon.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.820
In order to do this, Project Gemini would
need to develop the technology, procedures

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.290
and train its personnel how to make the trip
and back

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.119
Having lost the race to put the first man
into space, the US efforts to win a stage

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.460
were once again thwarted when the Soviet Alexey
Leonov became the first person to conduct

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.590
a spacewalk on the 18th March 1965.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.360
It took the Gemini teams another two and a
half months to get their man out in space

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.940
as part of the Gemini 4 team.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.470
These spacewalks were another milestone for
the space faring nations but there were a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.870
number of unforeseen problems associated with
this new activity. Despite the low gravity

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.769
environment, astronauts on early Gemini spacewalks
reported extreme exhaustion, due to having

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.129
to wear bulky and restrictive space suits
for hours at a time.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.940
The breakthrough was made with astronaut Buzz
Aldrin who underwent underwater resistance

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.830
training, similar to what is used when scuba
diving, to build up the necessary muscle tone

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.110
to enable successful space walks.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.239
[archive audio] Although flight experience
was the primary objective of Gemini, the program

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.830
offered a unique space laboratory to science,
medicine, and technology.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.980
[narration] A return trip to the moon would
require around 8 days in space and so Gemini

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.019
worked towards preparing its astronauts for
this objective. In August 1965, the crew of

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.780
Gemini 5 achieved this goal, which was surpassed
two months later by the crew of Gemini 7 who

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.650
orbited the Earth for just under two weeks.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.110
But even before the long endurance flights,
the Gemini missions focussed on making sure

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.900
that humans could survive the journey by running
a number of scientific experiments during

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.030
the missions. These looked at how space exploration
affect basic human functions such as sleep

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.239
or eating.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.629
NASA became concerned about the issue of consuming
food in microgravity, particularly in the

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:47.920
case of crumbs blocking or interfering sensitive
equipment, or even being inhaled by astronauts.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120
This resulted in NASA pioneering the development
of space food that was pressed into blocks

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.330
or stuffed into tubes. Unfortunately nutrition
was prioritised over taste and appearance

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.750
so the eventual products were all of the same,
colour, texture and lacked any real flavour.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.959
One astronaut in particular was unimpressed
with NASAs attempt at space cuisine, and on

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.540
Gemini 3 John Young smuggled aboard a freshly
made corn beef sandwich. The resulting pandemonium

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.479
was perhaps predictable, as the sandwich fell
apart in microgravity and sent crumbs everywhere

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.280
- causing Young a lot of trouble back home
with NASA officials and congress.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.750
The incident of the corn beef sandwich did
not seem to hinder his career as he later

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:36.120
became one of the few astronauts to walk on
the moon.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.190
Just before Christmas in 1965, two Gemini
craft 6a and 7 succeeded in completing the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.580
first ever space rendezvous.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:52.259
[archive audio] Gemini 6 approached within
one foot of Gemini 7. Rendezvous. A major

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.710
landmark in the history of manned flight.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.660
[narration] With this maneuver completed,
the two crafts disengaged and prepared for

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.570
re-entry. But something caught the pilot's
eye...

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.539
[archive audio] Roger, Houston, Gemini 7 this
is Gemini 6. We have an object, looks like

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:14.550
a satellite going from north to south, probably
in a polar orbit...

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.440
[narration] The pilot had caught sight of
an unidentified object that was observed travelling

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.490
below. He identified it as a red spacecraft
being pulled by eight small objects - the

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.750
punchline to this joke was later delivered
with a rather scratchy rendition of jingle

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.720
bells on the harmonica.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:38.040
[archive audio] #Jingle bells#

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.780
We've got him too, 6. You're too much, 6.

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.330
[narration] Project Mercury proved that NASA
can send a man into space. Project Gemini

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.900
gave them the tools to take the next step
and send a team to the moon. Now all hope

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.100
lay with Project Apollo.
