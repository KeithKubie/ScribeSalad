1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,850
Death grip. Yeah. Those guys, which brings
us to the last fight, man. Perfect. Yeah,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,510
that's correct. Yeah. That Ben asked her
if I, dude, I watched that fight. Uh,

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:14,010
I've watched that finish like 10 times
trying to figure out what happened or

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,080
whether it was out or
whether he wasn't out.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,380
I was pretty convinced that at one point
in time he went out and then Kamara

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,340
loose man changed my mind.
Come on.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,450
Munch showed the that we watched the video
tape together. He's like, no, no, no.

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,150
He's giving a thumbs up. And I'm
like, Shit. Yeah. Okay. So I'm still,

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,420
cause the angles I've seen
haven't been the best.

10
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:34,830
I'm trying to see this thumbs up.

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,460
Was the thumb going up or with the thumb
in a thumbs up position going this way?

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,440
Right? Like on the, as the arm
drops was the coming of the, okay.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,370
So when I give somebody a thumbs up,
like let's say somebody wanted a job,

14
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:48,310
you want this job, buddy,
good job. That's it.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,820
That's what I want to do. You know? So
I mean, I don't know. Like, I mean, I,

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,663
so what I'm saying,

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,500
nobody's going to know whether he was
conscious or unconscious. What I saw,

18
00:00:58,501 --> 00:01:01,680
I saw everything that would indicate
I'm seeing that unconscious fighter.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,560
I see an arm go limp for
no reason whatsoever.

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,320
And so that's what I'm,

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,200
that's what I'm have to work with
because that's what, you know,

22
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,260
we don't know what someone's feeling
whenever we just see if they're doing

23
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,230
something that doesn't make sense and
you see an arm go limp at that time,

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,920
you're going to assume that the person's
unconscious. We assumed it. Yeah.

25
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,060
As the broadcast team,

26
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,900
we can hear you guys and that I'm
supposed to do certain things and like,

27
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,100
so here's the thing with that choke,
when I'm refereeing fights, you know,

28
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:33,660
there's sometimes where you know,
some positions or anxiety like uh,

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,880
you know,
you see two guys going after leg locks,

30
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,040
you see a noodle mess of legs
and you know, you got to,

31
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,850
you're going to have to help one guy out
and figure out who's tapping and make

32
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,030
sure you're on the right home. When I
see some chokes, a rear naked choke,

33
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:48,540
especially the guy in the back face up.
I took a sigh of relief.

34
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:51,540
My job just got so much
easier. This guy, you know,

35
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,060
it's not like he's going to
go out and then a second,

36
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:57,270
take some extreme amount of damage.
He may go out,

37
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,580
I'll have a second to make sure you're
not even a second or half a breath and

38
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:04,020
make sure he's okay
and then let it go out.

39
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:08,910
And he's not gonna take any other damage.
A bulldog choke.

40
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:13,410
We have anytime you have a choke where
somebody where there's pressure on the

41
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:17,460
neck and they're spinning, been in the
c spine backwards like that, that's a,

42
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:18,840
that's a rough situation for me.

43
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:22,230
So I see someone go limp and
I know that on top of it,

44
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,690
they're no longer putting tension on
their neck and their neck is just being

45
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,320
bent. I can't, I, you know,

46
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,590
I can't see that I should do something
different than that because that's the,

47
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:34,770
um, I like to talk to people about
this. I'd like to talk to people,

48
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:36,360
have opinions about fights,

49
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,270
especially people who are interested in
who they know what they're talking about.

50
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,420
Um,
because if I always have a situation,

51
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:44,850
if I always have been mindset that
I'm always doing the right thing,

52
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:48,140
I can't get better. So I'm going to have
to look at something and say, is there a,

53
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,380
you know,
a teachable moment there.

54
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:52,890
Is there a way I can learn from this
and is there a way I could do something

55
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,150
different? And No, I don't think,

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,950
I think with that same situation with the
arm going limp with type of a choke on

57
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:03,310
someone, I don't know of a defense that
requires the arm. You know what I mean? I,

58
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,750
I would think the arms should
be doing something else. I,
at this time, I don't, um,

59
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,450
I don't see that I should do
something different. You know,

60
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm always interested in
always looking and always,

61
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,080
I love these types of conversations, but
right now I can't think of, you know,

62
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,370
and they sell you something. It was an
amazing fight. It was. Yeah, it was.

63
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,130
It wasn't, I mean, first of
all was the first time I seen,

64
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:29,110
I'd refereed been asking, I don't think
I'd refereed him before. And you know,

65
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:33,040
when you're in his PR, his pressure is
something special. It's not the normal.

66
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,443
And uh,

67
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,290
the way Robbie dealt with it and Robbie
had him and he hadn't been trouble.

68
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,850
You know, I was so close to stopping that
fight when they're on the ground. Yeah.

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,810
So many times. Yeah. Yeah.
With some bombs. Yeah.

70
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,630
The amount of respect I have for those
two athletes, man is like, so that's,

71
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,130
so that's the thing is,
you know,

72
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:54,790
we never want to see anything that
could make you have a feeling that it's

73
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:58,420
inconclusive, but I can't think
of what else I should have done.

74
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,040
But you know, I mean, especially for that,
that fight for those two guys, you know,

75
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,240
you always want it. Yeah. The people
would have a feeling of conclusion there.

76
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,530
Well, when we talked about on the phone,
when you brought up the, the damage,

77
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:13,830
the possible damage to the
neck with the bulldog choked,

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,690
he might be cutting off nerves and
you might be bending the spine in a,

79
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,370
in a kind of a fucked up way. I really
hadn't considered that when, uh,

80
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,420
when I was thinking of the choke
when he grabbed hold of him,

81
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:26,260
I was just thinking it was a blood choke.
But you're right.

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,250
Like the way you lean in on a
bulldog choke, you lean back. Yeah.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,050
That's a lot of pressure on
the neck. I've, I've had,
uh, some chokes where there,

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,600
uh, I've, I've refereed a fight where
a guy did one of these moves. I would,

85
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:43,120
you had to move for it. Uh,
a technique where he's been
in the spine, back twister.

86
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,870
It wasn't a twister, um, that I
think guys have a name for it.

87
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,390
You probably know what the execution
or is. So that's what it was.

88
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,790
That's what it is. That kind of
explain it. Explaining to people the,

89
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,800
what that is is like if a guy is
a turn not to cut you off. Okay.

90
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,750
So for so long I've never really wanted
to talk about it because people weren't

91
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,410
doing it. This was years ago, I saw
it. But now if there's a name for it,

92
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:06,460
I guess it's okay. But you hadn't seen
a lot of people doing it before, right?

93
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,750
Well we,
uh,

94
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:12,010
we started doing it in 10th
planet a few years back. It's,

95
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,040
I think people have done it.
What it is basically folks,

96
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,090
it's like a guillotine from the back.
Um,

97
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,890
it's like taking a re you ever
like rear naked choke cooks,

98
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,730
but instead of choking guide this way,
which is how you would do it,

99
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:29,620
which is a wrap your form underneath his
neck and wrap the other arm behind his

100
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,640
head. Instead of doing that, you wrap
your arm all the way around the front,

101
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,230
like a guillotine hold,

102
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:39,880
but from the back and you
have ungodly leverage, right?

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,970
It's ungodly. How much pressure
you can put on someone's neck.

104
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:46,390
And our friend Scott Epstein, he, uh,

105
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,420
he used quite a few times. So we called
it the executioner. Is that it there? Oh,

106
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,980
I'm trying to find a picture of one.

107
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,640
I know this is the execution or
choke. This is a different, oh,

108
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,460
he calls it the executioner.
I looked that up and nothing came up.

109
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,860
I think I might have a have a heavy
here for you to something like this.

110
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:10,280
This is a little different. This
guy had arms in, this is different,

111
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,540
but it's similar. Yeah. It's
similar though. Similar.
Yeah. You could have arms in,

112
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,460
yeah. That's the same thing. Yeah.
This is it. That's 100%. So, um,

113
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,530
I dunno, we're going to show
people that. Right. Either way.

114
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,670
It's a real bad place to be in this
guy. Got It. Yeah. That's okay.

115
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,600
That's Scott Epstein. That's the north
shore south choke on it or is that, uh,

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,760
but what he would do if he wanted to do
an execution or is he would get his hips

117
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,370
underneath the guy and get back position.

118
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:46,800
This is just a really good,
uh, north south chose. So yeah.

119
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:50,240
So what I saw was the guy who
went north, south, and he, uh,

120
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,680
this was years ago at a king of
the cage and way out in Wisconsin,

121
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,540
and he had a, wow, this was a
long, long time ago. He had north,

122
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:04,310
south and he sat up once he had the guy,

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,240
he sat up and pulled the guy's body up
onto him and almost a sitting position

124
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,830
and then put hooks.

125
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,350
And then I've done it before where you
all rolled the guy to the side and I'm

126
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,690
just to walk it through and
figure out how it worked. Um,

127
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,230
he put hooks and I was sitting there,
I was like, okay, this is an illegal,

128
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,000
if I stop this fight, it's not, you
know, or this nun an illegal move,

129
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,710
but I don't want to
see how this plays out.

130
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:32,711
And the guy got one hook in and almost
the second hook was about to go in.

131
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,680
The guy tapped and when I pulled him off,
the guy couldn't move.

132
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,730
His neck was fucked up. Yeah.
He couldn't move. Uh, you know,

133
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:42,980
you got some sort of standard, I don't
know what's going on. He was, he was,

134
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,710
he couldn't move. He was terrified.
I was terrified. And, uh,

135
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,140
then it kind of, you know, uh, came
back and came back. Yeah. Jesus.

136
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,731
Yeah.

137
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:57,731
I know of several guys that have
gotten paralyzed because of a defense,

138
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,650
um, from a guillotine or trying to take
a god down when the ride. Yeah. You know,

139
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,140
when someone gets you to the team.
Yeah. I've heard of that. Yeah. So,

140
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,150
so that's why with some, uh, submissions,
you know, especially some of the jokes,

141
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:13,610
it's like, okay, a things
are slowing down and okay,

142
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:17,240
things are going a little bit easier for
me with that when things are not easy

143
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:21,050
at all. That's not something
that I want to, um, I want
to play with. I think if, uh,

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,910
you know, I'm kind of disappointed with
some, some of people have a platform,

145
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,740
I don't want to mention any names,

146
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,990
but some people have a platform
of kind of tossed it out.

147
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,840
It was something sensational and say,
Oh, look at this, there's, he'd wrong or,

148
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:35,720
right. I think that's a little
irresponsible when it's some, uh,

149
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,610
dangerous techniques like that.
Well,

150
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:41,360
I think you've really pointed that out
about the neck and a very important where,

151
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,210
and I think that's something that people
should really take into consideration.

152
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:47,010
When you see someone,
you've seen people, uh,

153
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,730
have you ever referred someone
who got caught in a twister? Yeah.

154
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,630
It's a horrible place to be. Yeah.
Dot. So it's a horrible place to be.

155
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,391
It's so your,

156
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:57,720
your neck is fucked up and there's so
much pressure and the fact that you're,

157
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,230
that you're left legs isolate and your,
your head's getting pulled to the,

158
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:04,320
it feels like it's going to break.
It's a fun place to be.

159
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,020
Even for the fact of the way it's
set up because it's not like it's,

160
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,490
it's not like a fast thing that catches
you off guard. It's a long road to it.

161
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:15,600
Yeah. So you know what's going on,
you know it's coming and you're like,

162
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:18,420
I'm doing this, but I know how
this is going to probably end.

163
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:20,520
And you're doing some little diff.
Yeah.

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
There's a chance on Joan Korean Zombie.

165
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,030
I think he got the first
ever one on Leonard Garcia.

166
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:30,360
I think that was the first to look
at that and so horrible, dude,

167
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,740
that is so that it's so bad.
That feels so terrible. Yeah.

168
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,180
And that's,
uh,

169
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,740
he then there's def con four when you
take a rear naked choke grip from the

170
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,220
twister position. Oh yeah.
Okay. Yeah, I've seen that.

171
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:47,520
Just you just rip and dude's heads
cleaned off. It's a horrible, you know,

172
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,410
those all those crazy like catch
wrestling, neck manipulation.
Right, right, right.

173
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,070
Those things to make my, my
neck hurt, just looking at
him. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,640
So anyway. Yeah, that's,
that's why I think, you know,

175
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,400
you can't always say look at things
as good or bad, but you know,

176
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,580
some situations I've seen referees in
and that one I think is a difficult

177
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:09,300
situation. Not so I've seen other harder
situations, but you know what I mean,

178
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,270
like, yeah. It's an
unusual one. Yeah. I mean,

179
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:16,590
we've seen quite a few bulldog chokes
that, uh, put someone on conscious. Uh,

180
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,670
most recently, uh, Raquel Pennington
against Ashley. Evan Smith. Crazy,

181
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,550
crazy fight for cal Pennington. So
fucking tough. I mean that was just,

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,280
that was a crazy fight, man.
It was just war and chaos.

183
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:31,980
And then with like one second to go,

184
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,550
she chokes her out and then lets her go.
And she's um,

185
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,570
she's asleep from the bulldog choke and
Ashley Evan Smith steps up covered in

186
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,620
blood. I mean it's fucking
crazy. That was crazy.

187
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,980
But there's that one.
Um,

188
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,040
didn't Chris Lights out Lidell
catch Tki in a bulldog choke?

189
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,320
I think he did for us. If we're
going to Carlos Newton. That's the,

190
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,140
that's the title. Yeah. That's the the,
yeah, that one that looked really tight.

191
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,360
Yeah. Go forget that. Go to, yeah,

192
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,390
that's the one road a Carlos Newton
chokes out pat Miletich cause this was for

193
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:08,640
the title and he caught him in
a bulldog choking and it's like,

194
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,600
that was what that was.
I don't think we had a name for it.

195
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:13,680
I think we used to call it a
school yard headlock, but yeah.

196
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,080
Then somebody called it a
bulldog choke at that time.

197
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:18,330
I remember people were calling it
bulldog trail. Oh. Like they are,

198
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:20,580
it already had that. And I don't know
if it had there. Maybe they gave it to,

199
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:24,690
but yeah, it's a legit move.
Like it's a legit move. Like if,

200
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,470
especially if you're a bad ass grin
type dude with that kind of grip on

201
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,460
someone's neck in that
position. Yeah. Horrible. Yeah.

202
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,890
That was, um, that's why I
say that referees have the
hardest job because you're,

203
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:41,220
you're in that situation. You do have
to take those things into consideration.

204
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:45,960
What kind of damages is doing this guy's
neck? Is he out? His arm went limp. Okay.

205
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:49,560
When do I stop? I gotta get, I gotta
save him. Like, yeah, no, that,

206
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:53,950
that is the tough part about it. You
know, you were evaluating a is always,

207
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:55,150
there's different,
you know,

208
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:58,210
and you're evaluating a threat
to the person you're evaluating.

209
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:01,270
If there's a threat coming, you how
much, how well can they deal with it?

210
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,570
There's a lot of stuff going on there
and you know, we take it really serious.

211
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:08,680
I take it really serious. It's
a, to me it's, um, it's a,

212
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,840
I feel that I have a sacred trust.

213
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,510
I feel that it's one of these
positions that like, um,

214
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,090
our athletes are not stupid people.

215
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,480
A lot of them could be doing a lot of
things with their life and they've chosen

216
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:22,330
this path to a,
and they take time from their family.

217
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:26,110
They take time away from other careers
where they can be progressing and all to

218
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:29,530
meet their dreams and hopes. And I
need to balance that with their safety.

219
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,090
So it's something I think about a lot.
You know what I mean? I'm, I'm, uh,

220
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,820
even in the way, uh, I talked
to my friends, you know
what I mean? To always, uh,

221
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,210
you know, I, I'm always on, I'm
always working as a referee.

222
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,450
Anytime I'm out in the streets or with
friends, people are going to ask me,

223
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:46,090
what do I think about this fighter?
Who Do I think can be better? And I,

224
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,890
because of his job you're doing, you
don't longer have the luxury of having,

225
00:12:50,891 --> 00:12:51,431
you know,

226
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:55,300
of talking about mixed martial arts in
the fun way about who's going to win and

227
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:56,890
how's this going to happen?
Because who knows?

228
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:00,150
I might referee the fight and everyone's
going to be on the Internet like hers

229
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:03,550
referee in the fight and
we're having beers yesterday.
And guess what he told me?

230
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,280
Right. So, yeah, it's just, you
know, so yeah. I take it serious. No,

231
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,710
you do it. I'm glad you have
that attitude. What does
this one right here? Oh yeah,

232
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:15,100
this is Carl is Carl is
right here. Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,310
In the transition he grabs the neck
and it's a crazy visual too because the

234
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,800
photograph, the fruits eat
right there, right there.

235
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,060
I mean that is crazy muscles and
Carlos's arm and shoulder and neck.

236
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,310
That caused student champion of the world
right there.

237
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:35,180
That moment in that crazy,
Carlos had some spectacular grappling,

238
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,280
real merrily on man while transition.
He was amazing. [inaudible] Jitsu.

239
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,170
His uh, his, his explosiveness is agility.
I mean, he was just, he was so athletic.

240
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:49,250
He was doing stuff that no one knows.
Yeah. He also had a really high level,

241
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:53,570
a submission game early
on when like in 96, 97,

242
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:56,990
a lot of people didn't have that kind of
a game in his submission game was tight.

243
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,400
The Matt Hughes one was crazy. I remember
that. Yeah. Yeah. That was crazy. That a,

244
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,360
catch him in a triangle choke where he
had him up and he's, yeah, that was,

245
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:09,410
he puts him to sleep. And
as they get up, Matt Hughes,

246
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,610
like you, here's car and her saying like,
stand up, you won. You won. He's like,

247
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:17,420
what happened? Yeah, yeah, they'll
double knockout. Yeah, I have that one.

248
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:21,490
I have one of the king of
the cage, a double knockout.
Those right here. This is,

249
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,230
look how God takes him strong used was,

250
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,530
he was so fucking strong
that builds them up there

251
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,880
and Carlos is trying to, so
he's, he's, he's squeezing,

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,300
squeezing. So Matt goes
unconscious, he's out cold,

253
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,640
he doesn't know what's going on and no
one knows what's going on and they get,

254
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,740
they,
they,

255
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,970
so Carlos has head hit the ground when
he went down like that and then knocked

256
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,820
him out. Right, right, right. And then
Matt up from the choke and they're like,

257
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:57,320
you won. Yeah, it's great.

258
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:01,010
That was a crazy scene that, that
scene was a tough one. I was like,

259
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,190
what do you do there?
Yeah,

260
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,000
well that was like the thing about
this Robbie Lawler Pan African fight,

261
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:08,270
like Uconn was saying,
they got to run it back and I was like,

262
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,910
it wouldn't be a bad thing to run it back.
I mean, well, at the same time, you know,

263
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,910
we gotta be honest here,
like as far as running back,

264
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,570
how many of the fights is
that happened in the UFC?

265
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:25,250
Are there because it's exciting
what people want to see. Yeah, most,

266
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,220
right. So Brock Lesnar DC
is a perfect example, right?

267
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,320
So that's exciting as
people want to see it.

268
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,110
And some of the excitement has been
generated by throwing me under the bus,

269
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:37,110
but cool. Cool. Cool. The people
at another time, I'm love ticket.

270
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,390
I got [inaudible] you know? But
yeah, no. So yeah, I think, um,

271
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,160
you know, anytime that, you know,

272
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:46,640
the athletes get to do what they do and
