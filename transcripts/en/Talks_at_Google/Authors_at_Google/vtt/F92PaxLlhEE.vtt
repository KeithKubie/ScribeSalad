[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.960
KAREN: Good morning.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm Karen [INAUDIBLE], and
I'm a managing director here

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.890
at Google in our Global
Partnerships Organization,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.860
and I'm also a
leader in our Women

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.350
At [? Org. ?] And
here at Google, I

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.760
have a passion for helping
women at our company

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.780
realize the unlimited
potential in our professional

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.230
and personal lives, and that
includes a future where we have

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.170
more women leaders at Google,
especially at our director

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.990
level and beyond, where
women are supporting

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.830
each other to
thrive and to grow,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.900
and where women feel
empowered to live lives

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.080
on their terms,
both professionally

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.860
and personally being
their authentic selves,

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.440
and finally, where women
feel confident building

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.060
careers at Google through
various stages of their lives,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.380
especially when
they start families.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.100
And in today's world,
it doesn't seem

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.010
like there is a standard
path to pregnancy.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.180
Those of us working on
starting our families--

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.670
it's important for us to
be educated and understand

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.010
what those paths are.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.680
So when I heard about
Mary Wong and her talk,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.170
I was so proud to
see that Google

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.570
is supporting
discussions like this

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.560
and working on educating us
on challenges and solutions

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.060
many face when there is a
desire to start a family.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.910
Mary Wong has been in practice
for more than 20 years,

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.780
helping thousands
of couples conceive.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.120
She's the founder of ALIVE
Holistic Health Clinic

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.930
and was an expert panel advisor
to the Canadian government

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.460
on infertility and adoption.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.290
As a Traditional Chinese
Medicine, TCM, practitioner

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.020
and patient who struggled
with infertility,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.950
Mary has made it her life's
mission to bring about change

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.190
and improve people's
health by bridging

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.990
the gap between Eastern
and Western medicine.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.260
Through her new book,
"Pathways to Pregnancy,"

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.110
Mary offers a moving
and eye-opening voice

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.380
to the national conversation
about conceiving.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.140
She has been featured
on CTV's "Your Morning,"

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.240
"ON Times," "Toronto
Star," and Sirius XM.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.350
And with that, please help
me welcome Mary to Google.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.932
And Mary unfortunately
hurt herself this weekend,

00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:35.860
so we'll let you--

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.360
MARY WONG: Oh, I have unmic'ed.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.110
Thank you so much.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.480
And thank you so much for
joining me here today,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.820
and I'm so pleased that
there's people that showed up

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.980
because I'll tell you,
this conversation is

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.030
a very private one, one
which touches my heart,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.620
and that's why I'm here
with you talking about it.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.260
And not only is it because
I'm a practitioner,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.410
but as Karen said,
it's because I myself

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.240
had fertility challenges
with my husband,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.890
and it took us half
a decade before we

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.410
had our little girl,
who I hope to introduce

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.190
to you at the end of this talk.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.440
Oh, right, I'm
supposed to use this.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.260
And that's what propelled me
to write my book "Pathways

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.250
to Pregnancy."

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.370
And really, it's
about dispelling

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.310
the shame and the stigma
that is attached to it.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.140
And utilizing 15
personal stories of hope,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.720
I guide you through the
various different pathways,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.430
which can be wide and varied.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.910
Whether it's natural or through
the integration of Eastern

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.490
and Western medicine,
there is possibility,

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.680
and you can create life.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.860
And the biggest piece for having
me here and to write my book

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.030
was to really ease
and prevent the pain

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.550
and suffering that women
and couples go through

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.660
as they go through the
challenges of infertility

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.750
struggle, as well as
preventing challenges

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.080
if you're just about to start
out, or maybe even one day

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.780
thinking about
conceiving and creating

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.780
a family for the future.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.620
So I want to tell
you a bit about what

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.400
I'll be talking about the
rest of this discussion here,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.670
and the very first thing
is what is infertility?

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.274
How prevalent it
is in our society--

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:21.940
and then I'll tell
you a little bit more

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.030
about my personal story.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.430
And then after, I'll
look at some common myths

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.700
that I will want to dispel and
then look at some solutions

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.200
surrounding that.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.380
And so I'll just name
some of the common myths--

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.660
that your eggs are getting
older every single day,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.430
like they're about to expire,
and it's only a woman's issue,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.510
and that it's an
individual's issue.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.770
And one of the very common
things, especially in New York,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.740
I find, there's this
thing about egg freezing,

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.520
and freezing your
eggs is the answer.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.730
So I'll talk about that.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.720
And then the last bit, which
any woman trying to conceive

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.560
will get, will be just relax
and you'll get pregnant.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.050
So I'll discuss all
that and hopefully

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.790
provide some good,
sound advice for you

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.540
that you can walk away with.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.330
And at the very end, I want to
invite my friend/patient who

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.710
has been with me--

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.810
oh, gosh, I don't know--

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.980
a while now.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.220
And she's going to come and
tell you about her story.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.820
It's a modern story
about family building,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.940
and I'm really pleased to have
her, and her name is Jackie.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.000
And then at the very end,
we'll go through some Q&amp;A,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.041
and if you have
more questions, you

00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:38.290
can certainly come up and ask.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.290
And due, again, to the
nature of this conversation,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.390
if you want to be
private about it,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.350
you can use the [INAUDIBLE]
just put your questions

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.700
through anonymously.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.180
So before I talk
further, I just want

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.680
to tell you a little story.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.810
That's my grandmother
that you see.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.500
And in my youth, I
had always wanted

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.000
to go into medicine,
meaning medical school.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.710
But in second year
of university,

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.680
my grandmother fell ill,
and in the hospital,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.920
the doctor gave her
two weeks to live.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.980
So we decided to bring her
home from the hospital,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.050
and as a last resort, we went
to Chinese medicine, TCM.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.230
So I was the one assigned
to drive her to Chinatown

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.390
through this herbal dispensary,
and she would get treatments

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.080
in the back room, a tiny little
room with just one little

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.460
treatment table.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.730
And I was fascinated by this
art-science that has been

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.990
around for thousands of years.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.940
But even more than
that, it was miraculous

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.430
that she recovered
within three months,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.020
and she was 86 at the time.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.850
She lived another eight years.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.160
So in that moment,
I'm like, oh, my gosh.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.890
How the heck did she
slip through the cracks?

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.150
And I need to do
something about this.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.900
So instead of going to apply for
medical school, what I ended up

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.920
doing was I just finished my
biological sciences degree,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.650
and then I went on to
study Chinese medicine,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.240
and I've never looked back.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.402
And so my goal was--

00:07:15.402 --> 00:07:17.610
I have to bridge that gap
between Eastern and Western

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.650
medicine, and I want
to create that access,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.890
because why doesn't
everybody know about this?

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.980
So here I am, and
today in these days,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.330
it's more in line with
the whole fertility bit.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.550
So that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.790
So infertility is defined
such as when a man and a woman

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.950
has been trying to conceive
naturally for a year

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.080
and they have no
success, and that's it.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.945
So to me, I don't
like that definition.

00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:49.820
I actually don't like
the word "infertility."

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.153
I don't use it in my practice
very much, although you'll

00:07:52.153 --> 00:07:54.230
see it even on my slides.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.740
I like to call it fertility
challenged, so that it's not

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:02.120
like infertility is a
state of permanence,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.490
but rather, a state of being
in the moment right now.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.860
And I think that we're human
beings capable of change

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.800
and the ability to heal.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.320
So that's where I come from.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.070
Either way, fertility
challenges are really prevalent,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.950
and I'll speak specifically
to the United States.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:26.030
Currently, right now, 7 million
women-- and probably more--

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.530
are experiencing infertility
in their reproductive age,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.590
and that does not even include
those that have already

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.419
gone through the
challenges, and it also

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.500
doesn't include those that
will have fertility challenges.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.070
So to put it in another
way, that's about one

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:47.720
in six women having fertility
challenges in a lifetime.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.690
And then to put that
into perspective,

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.540
you have to know that when
you walk into the Starbucks

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:59.210
next time or go into a meeting
room and there's 24 people,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.780
you'll know at least four people
are currently experiencing,

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.660
have experienced, or will one
day experience infertility.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.930
So that's really prevalent.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.500
And so who are these
faces of fertility?

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.640
Well, it can be you.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.470
It can be me.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.460
It is me, or was me.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.740
And it can really be anyone.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.370
And it also can be
even celebrities

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.210
that you'll recognize on
this screen here, 12 of which

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.960
here I show, but there are
many more who came out and told

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.720
their story, which I'm so
proud of because they're also

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.080
helping to lessen the
shame and decreasing

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.910
that taboo around it.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.830
And this includes
Mark Zuckerberg,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.040
who last year-- was
it last year now?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.560
When he announced the
pregnancy of him and his wife,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.060
it was so awesome
and inspiring to see

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.880
that he revealed that him
and his wife had issues.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.030
They had multiple miscarriages
before they gave birth

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.100
to their child.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.490
So again, the point
is you're really not

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.806
alone if you're currently
experiencing this,

00:10:03.806 --> 00:10:05.930
and there's certainly
nothing to be shameful about.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.880
However, it is still private.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.760
And I'll tell you, coming
from experience, that when

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.500
you have a non-pregnancy
month in, month out,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.580
trying to conceive and getting
that no every month, it kind of

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.960
wears on you as a human being.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.060
And I decided to look up what
the definition of a woman is,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.880
and I just googled it online.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.550
And dictionary.com
puts this out.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.150
"Adult human being who is
biologically female that is

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.560
capable of bearing offspring."

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.650
And I'm like, whoa.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.520
I think it's a little outdated.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.430
However, when you're a
woman that conceives, great.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.000
Fine.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.210
Or if you choose to not have
children, that's fine too.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.490
But what if you are
that person that has

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.890
been struggling to conceive?

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.325
That kind of gets you to a
place where, oh, my gosh.

00:11:01.325 --> 00:11:03.890
And I'm not saying everyone
does this, but I'll tell you,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.870
there were moments in
my life where I'm like,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.980
am I not good enough?

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.960
Am I not a woman?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.130
It's not a great--

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.930
not an empowering place to be.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.790
So I should have been
a fertility goddess,

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.300
and the reason why I say this
is because I have literally

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.730
helped thousands of women
and couples conceive.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.430
So really, there was
actually a pressure on myself

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.920
to be able to be
that person like--

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.700
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.980
--goes like this
and gets pregnant.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.710
And in fact, I would
say that growing up,

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.830
for most women and
most kids, you're

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.131
basically told to avoid
getting pregnant at all costs

00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:40.880
when you're young.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.160
So really, when the time
comes, you're like, oh, yeah,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.540
it's going to happen.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.700
So that's where I was.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.410
And certainly, I
thought, I don't drink.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.990
I don't smoke.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.850
I live a really healthy life.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.530
I help other people.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.080
Both my grandparents-- both my
grandmothers had children at 46

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.210
naturally.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.610
So for sure, it was
going to be a breeze.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.980
But yet, when I was 38, my
husband and I were trying,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.730
and even when we went
to the fertility clinic,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.440
everything looked great.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.510
But it wasn't until
finally, somehow,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:17.570
this other fertility doctor
I went to, a second one,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:22.600
decided to do an x-ray of
my reproductive organs.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.780
And that's called a HSG,
hysterosalpingogram.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:32.680
And what I saw on that
fuzzy screen in front of me

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.620
as I lied down on that
exam table blew me away.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.790
And I was shocked because
instead of the fallopian

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.640
tubes that you see on
this screen like this,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.350
my fallopian tubes were
really gnarled and tortuous

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.390
and basically irreparable.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.950
And believe me, I tried.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.690
We did everything under the
sun to try to help my tubes.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.080
But unfortunately, there
comes a point in time

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.580
when there are just
instances where

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.770
it may not work naturally.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.130
So it was a really
difficult concept to grasp,

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.190
because, again, I came
from a very natural place.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.682
I could heal myself, but
yet, in this instance,

00:13:10.682 --> 00:13:11.640
it's like, oh, my gosh.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.870
My husband's sperm
and my eggs will never

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:18.390
meet up unless we have
great intervention.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.550
No amount of relaxation
was going to do it for us.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:28.370
So I had to think long and
hard and evaluate our life.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:34.144
It's like, can we, and could
we, just live child-free?

00:13:34.144 --> 00:13:35.060
Because you know what?

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:35.910
We had a great life.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.660
I had a great job.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.190
I love my job.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.210
We travel.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.940
We can do anything, anytime.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.120
And yet there was
this deep desire

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.850
that is just inexpressible.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.120
And it's just innate
want and desire

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.060
that just could not be fulfilled
unless I just went for it.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.030
And so instead of--

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.470
oh, let me backtrack.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.720
If you asked me 15
years prior to that

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.370
if I would ever consider doing
IVF, which is fertilizing

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.180
my eggs outside of my body
and then putting it back in,

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.100
I would say absolutely not,
because I never even took

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.870
an aspirin.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:18.210
So yet, when I was confronted
with this challenge where

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:22.650
it's my eggs and his sperm would
not meet up, all of a sudden,

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:23.910
I changed my tune.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.470
And then instead
of looking at it

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.200
like, oh, this is
a horrendous thing,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.750
I looked at it as an
opportunity and thought,

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.660
wow, I can actually do
this at this day and age.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.397
There's technology
that can help.

00:14:35.397 --> 00:14:36.480
And so that's what we did.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.313
I surrendered to it.

00:14:37.313 --> 00:14:39.330
We surrendered to it,
and not just once,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.080
unfortunately, but
multiple times.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.510
So I don't want to go on
and on about my story.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.190
You can read that in my book.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.300
But I am really, really,
really grateful and blessed

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.570
that my husband and I
ended up having our child--

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:52.570
her name is Zoe--

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.290
and again, who I hope
you'll meet at the end.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.160
She'll be turning
five next Monday.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.260
So that's our story,
and the reason

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.850
why I tell you this is because
the first thing that I learned

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.780
was you know what?

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.650
I'm human, and I'm not
immune to life's challenges.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.440
And so there is
no shame in that.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.070
And I tell you, my story
also is that there is hope,

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:21.440
no matter where you're at.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.510
And-- ooh.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.150
I didn't expect to get
a little emotional.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.780
So yes, I really want
to be able to help.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.940
So when we conceived, I was 44.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.520
So I want to talk to this
myth about your eggs are

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.310
getting older every single day.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.040
So I'm not going to say that
there's no truth behind it,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.110
because absolutely, the
probability of conceiving

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.690
does decline with age.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.580
And for those of you--

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:56.810
actually, you know what?

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.132
Can I invite everyone to close
their eyes just for one moment?

00:16:00.132 --> 00:16:02.090
Because I want to ask
something, and of course,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.310
this is private conversation,
so I want to be respectful.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:08.270
So can you all just close
your eyes for one moment

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.395
and raise your hand
if you're over 35?

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.380
OK, so definitely more than
half the people in this room.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:24.990
And also, who here in
this room has children?

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.676
Raise your hand.

00:16:26.676 --> 00:16:28.150
OK, a third of the room.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.420
OK, great.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:29.920
Thank you.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.380
And you can open your eyes.

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.812
So for those that are over
35 and do not have children,

00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:38.770
I don't want you to panic
looking at this chart

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.440
because it looks really
kind of horrible,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.290
because what you'll see and
witness is that this graph will

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.600
show that after the
age of 35, there's

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.860
a decrease of probability
of trying to conceive.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.470
In every cycle,
there's less chance.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.780
And simultaneously,
there's a higher incidence

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:58.150
of miscarriage.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.987
And I'll tell you, if
anyone here has ever

00:17:00.987 --> 00:17:03.070
been to a fertility clinic,
as soon as you walk in

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.010
and you're 35 and over, the
first thing they'll tell you--

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.190
without looking at your chart
at all, just based on your age,

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:12.220
they'll tell you you are
of advanced maternal age.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.319
You better go straight
to IVF because that'll

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.881
increase your chances.

00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:18.339
And then the other thing they'll
tell you is reproductively

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:21.099
speaking, you are a geriatric--

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:25.720
very, very bad thing for them
to say to you because it, again,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.440
is not helpful at all,
doesn't help, especially

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.350
if you're going in.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.370
You're asking for help.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.930
You walk out deflated
and depressed, right?

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.650
And oftentimes, again, in
the nature of our society,

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.130
we're going in in
our 30s and 40s.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.030
So it's a very tough
state to be in.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.190
So when I tell you
to look at this,

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.020
please take it with
a grain of salt

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.829
and know that you are a dynamic
human being and you can change.

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:52.370
And there are things
that you can do,

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.580
and I'll discuss that further.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.610
And so what I always
say is it's not

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:03.400
like your eggs are in a sack
of marbles in the ovaries.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:07.110
It's not going to just
come out every month

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.970
like that marble just
sitting there, ready to go.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:14.830
But rather, if you look
at this, a brand-new car--

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.030
that 22-year-old
actually still has

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.970
a one-in-four or -five
chances of getting

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.380
pregnant every cycle.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.940
So really, if you do your
math, which isn't basic--

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.440
but we have a higher chance
of not conceiving than you

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.790
do conceive at any month.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:39.490
So if you have a 35-
or 40-year-old car

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.440
and you don't do anything
to it and you say,

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.630
OK, let's go for
a drive, well, you

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.980
might be having a
hard time with that.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:51.310
However, if you take care of it,
you check under the hood and--

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:55.495
oil and do your
overhaul, then maybe,

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:57.400
maybe, you can actually
take it for a drive.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.960
And that's not that much
different for our bodies.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.600
So there's a saying
in Chinese medicine

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.505
where we say if you cultivate
the soil before you plant

00:19:05.505 --> 00:19:08.680
your seed, anything can happen.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:14.110
So looking here, you
have a little seedling

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:18.890
growing into a bud and then a
flowering stage of a flower.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.830
So that takes time.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.710
And now, going to our
reproductive organs--

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.540
and this is a
follicular genesis,

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.650
meaning the development of
our eggs within our body.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.570
Well, we think about
it-- oftentimes,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.980
we think that when we
ovulate per cycle, that's it.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.050
It's that one little cycle,
maybe a 14-day window

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.630
depending on your
menstrual cycle.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:46.240
But really, our eggs don't
start as already ready to go.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.160
They actually
start out as a germ

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.430
cell, and this resting
germ cell-- it's inert.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.040
Nothing's really
happening, so they're OK.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.350
So it's really the environment
that it develops in

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.240
that we can potentiate.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.230
And if you give it lots of
love, and oxygen, and nutrients,

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.850
and supplements, and
good, positive self-talk,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.060
all that can impact
the state of yourself.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.580
So I say for you, look at
your pre-conception health

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.140
and take care of
it now, and that's

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.950
through lifestyle and
dietary habits, so much more.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.520
And I'll actually
adjust that too, but I

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:31.000
want to talk about this as well
because while I'm here talking

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.920
about eggs, and we really
relate to fertility as a woman's

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.480
issue--

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.240
but in reality, men are
completely and equally

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.640
likely to have
fertility challenges.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.460
And although we don't
really talk about it

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.304
as women, about how
challenging it is,

00:20:47.304 --> 00:20:48.970
well, it's even less
of a conversation--

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.210
it's a non-conversation
when it comes to male factor

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.040
infertility.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.014
And the way I see it is this.

00:20:56.014 --> 00:20:57.430
There's like this
male stereotype.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.860
You're a man, and
if you're virile,

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.780
and you can spread your seeds
and populate this Earth, right?

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.840
So when you don't have that,
if you're shooting blanks,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.940
or if your sperm's going
around doing back floats,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.360
it's going to be questionable.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.540
So of course they're not
going to talk about it.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.400
But I'm going to put
it to the forefront

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.770
because it's a huge issue.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.100
And as you see here,
the American Society

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.500
of Reproductive
Medicine actually

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.860
stated that male
factor comprises

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.030
40% of infertility challenges.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.500
So when a couple
cannot conceive,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.140
it's not just
necessarily the woman.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:45.700
And so 30% of it is solely male
factor, and then 10% of the 40%

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.660
is male and female combined.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.320
So that's very prevalent.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.300
So we talk about age.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.420
Age does impact
male factor as well.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.220
So again, there's this myth that
we think that male sperm can

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.320
just go on and on and on.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.060
Well, to a degree--

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.510
but really, after a
certain age, there

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.620
are studies definitely that are
showing now more and more where

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.640
the age of the male sperm
can impact and cause

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.530
higher incidences
of pre-term delivery

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:29.010
as well as higher
incidences of miscarriage.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:29.930
And see?

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.890
When we think of
miscarriage, we always

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.840
blame the woman somehow, right?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.830
And really, we have to look
at both sides of the equation.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.230
And then here, when
I talk about factors

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.900
affecting both male and female
fertility, there are so many.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.800
So it's way beyond just the age
that people are thinking about.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.070
So there's a genetic
and birth defects,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.430
and autoimmune factors,
hormonal imbalances, STIs,

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.590
which are Sexually Transmitted
Infections, the primary

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.810
of which is chlamydia.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.870
And then there's people that
go through cancer treatments

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.220
at a young age.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.100
Just chemo and
radiation, that impact.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.020
And, you know,
through technology

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.870
we're surviving
cancer, but then we

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.420
may not be able to conceive
after all our treatments,

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.880
and that's very sad.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.610
Then there are the lifestyle
factors, which includes things

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.900
like cigarette smoking
and heavy alcohol use,

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.190
and drugs, and even exposure
to environmental toxins,

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:31.470
or even the food that
we eat, you know,

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.680
it's not as wholesome and
as good as it used to be.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.500
The pesticides, the hormone
additives, like everything.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.800
Plastics from our water.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.190
Everything contributes
over time, cumulatively.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.890
And I'm not saying that
you can't get pregnant

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.540
with any of this,
it's just that we

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.040
have to be wary, and let's
decrease that as a factor.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.990
Right?

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.620
One last common one is
the unhealthy weight,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.140
because in the United States,
unfortunately, there's

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.810
a high incidence of
obesity, and obesity

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.080
is a contributing factor.

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.640
And obesity is also tied into
diabetes, blood sugar levels.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.440
That impacts fertility.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.720
And on the other side
of the coin for females,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.750
it's also unhealthy
weight being--

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.500
having too low of a
BMI, body mass index.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.880
That contributes.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.230
So there are other
pathologies or fertility

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.110
issues that are
strictly for women,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.840
and these are conditions
of endometriosis,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.650
polycystic ovaries, other
menstrual irregularities.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.900
Anyway, I just don't want
to keep going on and on.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.710
So then there are
also male factors,

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:45.210
specifically varicocele, which
is basically varicose veins

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:47.010
in the testicle area.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.300
And then vasectomy.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.000
And then reversal of
vasectomy for men,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.910
for example, who had
children, gets a vasectomy,

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.040
and then they go and
have a second marriage

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.290
and then they want
to have children,

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:02.190
and sometimes the reversals
don't work either.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.420
Impotency, this
is always of note,

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.700
in my opinion, so
prescriptions, even

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:13.380
over-the-counter
prescriptions, where

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.380
men are taking like
Rogaine for hair loss, that

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.850
can impact sperm; FYI.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.980
Vanity doesn't pay sometimes.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.030
And then the other
very important thing

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:33.870
for males to consider is about
the testicular temperature.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:39.230
Even if your testicles
raise 1 degree, 1 degree,

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.670
it can impact your
sperm formation.

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.650
The good news is that if
you change that lifestyle,

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:49.320
like eggs, they have
to develop, right,

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.240
so within a certain amount of
time, it can regulate as well.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.450
So when you're
wanting to conceive,

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.220
you do want to look at
your lifestyle factors.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.410
So, looking at all those
factors that affect and impact

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:06.897
fertility, I do have to say
that it could be very scary,

00:26:06.897 --> 00:26:08.730
and it's like, oh, my
gosh, how does anybody

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:10.170
get pregnant at all?

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.330
But thankfully people do.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.520
And do know that
whatever your diagnosis,

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.380
it doesn't mean that you
cannot have a baby; you can,

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.020
and there may be ways
that you can help it.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.490
So, again, it's not something
that is set in stone,

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:31.320
and you can dynamically change,
and you're capable of it,

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.340
and really my advice for you,
no matter what stage you're at,

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.000
is do early testing.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.910
So be aware of where you're
at, reproductively speaking.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.040
Go to your doctor, your GP.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.920
Get checked out, hormones
and all the rest of it.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.080
But then also find a
complementary practitioner

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.400
to see where you're at
in your overall balance,

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.710
because, again, that helps.

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.140
One thing that I
say to people, when

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.890
they do IVFs, the
medical doctors,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.960
the medical profession,
what they're good at

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.320
and what they aim for is to try
to increase the number of eggs.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:10.980
So that's the
quantitative approach.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.350
Whereas in Chinese
medicine, what we want to do

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.677
is we want to help
the qualitative part.

00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:17.010
And to me that's more important.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.760
Like who cares if
you've got like 100 eggs

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.760
if they're all bad.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.280
So look at things in
your life that if you

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.500
can do to help the quality
while you simultaneously

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.710
build more eggs.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.970
Great, maybe we can
optimize your chances.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:35.480
So it's really about integrating
Eastern and Western medicine

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.450
and then looking at your
lifestyle and dietary habits,

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.760
as well as, if you're
not even anywhere

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.790
near trying to conceive,
being fertility

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.390
aware, like know about your
periods, your menstrual cycles.

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.030
I mean, a lot of people don't
even know when they menstruate,

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.770
when they ovulate.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.340
So check that out.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:56.900
There's even fertility awareness
groups and practitioners

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.820
that do that.

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.940
So I like to bring
this image up,

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.280
because it's like you don't
have to necessarily have

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.890
little raisins shriveling
up every month.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.820
Really, with time and with lots
of love and care and nurture,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.850
maybe you will have like
really juicy, awesome,

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:14.950
grape-like eggs.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.380
So, the next one
I want to cover,

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.770
which really no one speaks
about and I want to bring it up,

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.330
is that infertility is
an individual's issue.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.850
And, listen, I've
been told, it's

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.390
like oh, you should have
started earlier, and, you know,

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:35.810
my mother, in fact, before we
got married, when I was single,

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:39.050
she said, well, you could
just have a baby like now

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.884
before you're too old, because
likely people are getting

00:28:42.884 --> 00:28:45.050
divorced all the time anyway,
you might as well just

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.170
do it now and the kid will
know that you love her.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.690
So, anyway, I didn't
opt to do that,

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.080
but it was in my mind for sure.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.900
But it's really not just
an individual's issue

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.010
because it's a
socioeconomic one.

00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.510
Right?

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.400
Because when you're
young, we're taught

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.130
to further our
education so that we

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.620
can have a really good
career, and having

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.420
that good career,
first of all, we

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.690
have to get up that
corporate ladder

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.870
to pay off our
student loans and then

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:19.310
be financially stable
enough so that only then can

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.200
we look at building families.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.824
And by that time, most of us
are like in our 30s and 40s.

00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:26.490
And that's a really,
really common thing

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.592
that I see in my
personal practice.

00:29:29.592 --> 00:29:31.550
And, again, I don't want
to beat this to death,

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.930
here's another graph.

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.710
So the fertility rate
does decline as we age.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.870
And, as I just
said, we're starting

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:42.770
to conceive when we're
in our 30s and 40s

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:47.190
when the rates are
on the decline.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.470
So that's just fact.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.870
And then it's also
a worldwide issue.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:53.060
So it's not an
individual issue, it's

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.630
also a trend that's across
the board that, again, no one

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:57.830
talks about.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.930
So I will acknowledge
that of course there's

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.300
overpopulation in this
world, but there's

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:06.800
a real imbalance, because as
much as there is overpopulation

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.045
in most--

00:30:08.045 --> 00:30:10.565
a lot of developing
countries, there

00:30:10.565 --> 00:30:14.270
are 83 countries in
this world right now,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:19.520
that's 38.25 countries in this
world right now experiencing

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.440
a decline in fertility rates.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.530
And to below replacement
fertility rate

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:29.150
means that one woman is
having two children or less

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.260
in their reproductive lifespan.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.330
And in the United States
right now, the rate is 1.89.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:39.230
And in Canada it's
even lower, 1.6.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.620
And we certainly know
that in Europe it's

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.490
even lower than that.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.040
And surprisingly
I found that there

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.440
were certain places
in Latin America,

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.580
even in Asia and the
Caribbean, they're

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:57.750
all having and experiencing
lower fertility rate.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.640
So the reason for
this is, of course,

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.300
as I just mentioned this
socioeconomic climate

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.410
where we delay our
childbearing years,

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:10.750
and with also the increase
of actual childlessness.

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:14.240
And the other bit
to this, of course,

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.000
is our access to birth
control pill, which

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.590
is a very good thing
because there's

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.450
a lot less teen
pregnancy right now.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.170
So back in '91, there
was over half a million,

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:29.730
whereas now, 2014, there was
just under a quarter million.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:34.730
So that's a decrease of 61% with
the use of birth control pill.

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.120
And lastly, another reason
for the fertility decline

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.280
is that there's a trend
toward smaller families.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.960
And again, partly due to
the socioeconomic climate.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.340
So what's the implication?

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:48.710
Well, again, people
don't talk about this.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.520
So with the rapidly
declining fertility rates,

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.300
without migration, what's
happening is this--

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.610
the baby boomers are getting
older, they're retiring,

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.830
and there's a heck
of a lot of them.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.990
So we're experiencing
a lot of older people

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:10.430
dependent on a lot smaller
number of young people who

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:14.390
are in the workforce to pay
for their social services

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:19.220
and pensions and also to
drive economic growth, which

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:24.140
is like, wow, I never thought
of that, but some places are.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.110
And there are
health care coverage

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.710
in place in some countries
that recognize this issue,

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.500
and this health care
coverage is for IVF.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.400
So places like Australia,
Belgium, Denmark, Finland,

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.590
Netherlands, Spain, the UK,
Israel, and in Canada, just

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:45.050
Ontario, one province,
which I actually

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.010
sat on the panel who made this
recommendation, by the way,

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.380
we fund IVF.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.280
And then I like the
Nordic countries,

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:59.960
so they're actually taking one
step further and subsidizing

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.770
education and daycare
care for those

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:08.390
so that it can encourage women
and couples to start trying

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.670
to have children younger.

00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:14.330
So fine and dandy if you're
actually in a couple situation,

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.970
but certainly not
so if you're single.

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:21.530
And the other last
bit as a solution,

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:27.020
there are some workplaces,
progressive workplaces,

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.940
such as Google,
so I'm really keen

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.246
and I'm very proud to be
here because you guys are

00:33:31.246 --> 00:33:32.870
one of the most
progressive workplaces.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:36.210
So I hope that other small
companies will follow suit--

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.220
well, big and small
companies will follow suit--

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:46.050
most places so that we can
really support this cause.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:52.190
And so there are packages with
perks, so those of you that

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.770
work at Google, you might
want to check out with your HR

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.840
what there is as
support, but I'm

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.880
pretty sure IVF
and IUI is funded,

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.370
and certainly egg
freezing is funded.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.550
And the other part of it is
even the holistic medicine bit,

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:08.900
so go get your
acupuncture and all that.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.489
So the funding also
includes egg freezing,

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:14.960
so I want to address that.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.980
The myth around egg
freezing is that it's

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.170
your ticket it's
a guarantee, you

00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:24.530
don't have to worry about
it because once you have

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:28.592
those eggs in the freezer, you
can go on with your career,

00:34:28.592 --> 00:34:30.050
you're totally
empowered, you don't

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:32.618
have to worry about the
pressure of making a baby,

00:34:32.618 --> 00:34:34.159
and you certainly
don't have to think

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.710
about your biological clock.

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.400
And the one really good one
that I actually like and love

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.150
is that if you're a person
who are confronted with cancer

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.889
and you need to go for
chemo and radiation,

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:51.010
you can have the option to
freeze your eggs before you

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:55.270
do your treatments.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:35:02.890
Now, the reality is that egg
freezing is merely an insurance

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.490
policy, so it's not
guaranteed in stone,

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:10.762
and it's really more
of a lottery ticket.

00:35:10.762 --> 00:35:12.220
So it's an expensive
lottery ticket

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.400
because it's about
$20,000 per cycle.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.700
And from where I sat, I
don't have it listed here,

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.870
but when I calculated it out,
one of the most recent studies,

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:27.400
although certain fertility
clinics are claiming otherwise,

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.300
but what I found was that it
takes about 21 eggs retrieved

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:36.820
and frozen to have one
take-home baby and that's a lot.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.100
because if anyone's
ever done IVF,

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:45.370
it's a lot to be able to get
21 eggs, no matter what age.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.440
And the other bit
to that is it's

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.182
not as easy as just walking
into your doctor's office

00:35:50.182 --> 00:35:51.640
and say, hey, just
suck out my eggs

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.850
right now, because it's
an orchestrated procedure.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:55.810
It takes a lot.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.960
You have to go and do
like injectable drugs,

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.080
you have to go into the
fertility clinics day in

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.955
and day out, do trans-vaginal
ultrasounds, blood work.

00:36:07.955 --> 00:36:10.210
It's like a whole
orchestrated event,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.350
and before they even take
out your eggs surgically.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.770
So it's not as easy.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:21.400
And the bit that
really scares me

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.910
is that when you think that
you have these eggs in the bank

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.220
and that it's a
guaranteed success,

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.680
it may delay our
child-building years even more.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.180
Right?

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.910
Because you're like,
oh, yeah, no problem,

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.390
I can just keep on
going with my career,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.640
and the next thing you know,
you wake up and you're 50

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.100
and it's like, oh, it's OK,
I have my eggs in the bank.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.500
But then if you thaw them
out, and, by the way,

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.040
this science isn't
that old, it's only

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:50.560
been off the experimental
phase since 2012,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.510
so it's really new science
of testing and research bit,

00:36:55.510 --> 00:37:00.010
and we don't really know what
will happen when the eggs are

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.350
in the freezer for 20 years.

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:04.345
I don't know.

00:37:04.345 --> 00:37:05.720
But they claim
that it will work,

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:08.870
so maybe in time it
will be really great,

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:10.820
but I'm just a
little weary myself.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.280
But that's my own
personal opinion.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.260
So if I haven't
scared you off at all

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.600
and if egg freezing
is still your ticket,

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.190
fine, I'm totally great with
that because this is your life

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.740
and I don't get to
be part of your life.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:25.770
But, I will say this,
if you choose to do egg

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:28.430
freezing, please,
please consider

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.660
that you can affect
your eggs by utilizing

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.090
pre-conception treatment
and taking care

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.510
of your pre-conception health,
again with the whole lifestyle

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:43.850
and dietary measures and
using things like acupuncture

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:44.800
and Chinese herbs.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.450
By the way, acupuncture,
we know as a fact,

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:50.810
increases the blood
flow to your ovaries

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.990
and reproductive organs.

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:56.420
And with that, you're going
to increase oxygenation.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:01.052
That blood flow will increase
nutrients, take away debris.

00:38:01.052 --> 00:38:01.760
So it's all good.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.270
And you have the side benefit of
causing a relaxation response,

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.810
which is really necessary
when you're going through this

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.565
because it's a very
stressful process.

00:38:13.556 --> 00:38:14.760
All right.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.880
So then that comes
to this-- just relax

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.310
and you'll get pregnant.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.000
And I'll tell you,
when a woman has

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.890
been trying to
conceive for a while,

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.410
you really don't
want to hear this.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.290
And for me, where my eggs
and my husband's sperm

00:38:29.290 --> 00:38:32.000
did not meet and no one
knows anything about our case

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.170
and they say just relax,
it's like, uh, OK, I'll try,

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.760
but I don't think
it's going to happen.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.060
So if you're sitting on the
other side of the fence,

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.130
please don't say that.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.250
However, there is truth
to this, a big truth,

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:51.190
in that when a lion chases
an animal in the wild,

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.610
they will not reproduce.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:53.110
Right?

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.193
I mean, they're like busy
running for their lives.

00:38:55.193 --> 00:38:57.940
They're in survival mode.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.910
Because the energy
and the blood flow

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.060
will be directed to where
it's necessary for survival,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:10.130
which is the heart, the brain,
and then your limbs to run.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:16.040
So the ironic part is when
you're trying to conceive,

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.680
especially if you're
like 30 or 40,

00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:22.010
and you have lots of layers
of stress in your life,

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:25.766
like maybe ailing
and aging parents,

00:39:25.766 --> 00:39:27.140
you have more
stress on your hand

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.560
because at work you have so
much more responsibility,

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.910
and then on top of that
trying to conceive month in,

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:37.490
month out, I say there's
a heck of a lot of stress,

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.640
and that can, in fact, impede
your chances of conceiving.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.550
And there are tests and
studies that show that.

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:48.380
Now, there is a study that
also says the opposite, where,

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:53.270
oh, gee, you can have stress
but you can still get pregnant.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:58.660
Well, that is also true
because really, it's

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.777
actually not
necessarily the stress

00:40:00.777 --> 00:40:02.860
that we have in our lives
that impacts our ability

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.190
to conceive, but it's really
how we respond to our stress.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:11.530
So Alice Domar, who was the
one who actually said and did

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.400
studies on this
extensively, she's, I think,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:21.590
based out of Boston, anyway, she
says that fertility treatment

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.640
can be at a level comparable
to the stress associated

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.040
with serious illness.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.160
So that equals the
stress of one going

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.979
through this kind
of thing, fertility,

00:40:33.979 --> 00:40:36.020
is like that one of going
through cancer or heart

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.025
disease.

00:40:37.025 --> 00:40:39.200
And that's something.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:42.690
Because-- I don't know
if I should say this,

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:44.090
but I'll say it--

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:49.000
when a woman is trying to
conceive it's in silence,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.350
nobody knows about it,
so that causes stress.

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:55.920
And then if you're at work
and in an unsupportive work

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.890
environment and you're
fearful of losing out

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.180
on your next promotion to
another male colleague,

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.284
you don't say a word.

00:41:04.284 --> 00:41:06.450
You have to pretend and
keep that smile on your face

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.430
and you have to
try to go to work.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:12.147
And that's tough, especially
if you have a 9-5 job

00:41:12.147 --> 00:41:13.980
and you're going to a
fertility clinic which

00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.370
requires you to go into
those clinics every morning,

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:20.250
which takes about an hour
and a half, two hours.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.400
And the clinic I went to, it
took probably like three hours.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.142
But imagine navigating that and
trying to get to work at 9:00.

00:41:26.142 --> 00:41:27.600
Well, first of all,
you're not even

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.210
going to get to work on time.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:34.530
And then pretending that you
care, well, you do, but you

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:38.130
can't when you're so focused in
trying to get to work on time,

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.920
it's just this cycle of stress.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.870
So what do you do?

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.670
Do you go on a mountain
and like you meditate

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:49.910
for a couple of months?

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:51.820
I don't think that's
feasible, considering

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.790
that our socioeconomic
climate where

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:57.550
you have to pay your rent.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:01.930
So I say-- there's a lot
of things I say, but here's

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.060
a couple of pieces of advice.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.670
If you're in a
relationship, please focus

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.369
in on your intimacy.

00:42:08.369 --> 00:42:09.910
What ends up happening
is that people

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.272
have this baby-making sex,
really contrived, not so fun.

00:42:14.272 --> 00:42:15.730
And for those who
are already doing

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.100
it will get it because
it's like, OK, you have sex

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.250
and then you've got to put
your feet up in the air,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.530
you've got your pillow
under your butt,

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.650
and it's like don't
even touch me, go away.

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:26.150
Right?

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.000
There's zero intimacy left.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.710
So I say, wait a minute.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.150
There's actually something
to creating that intimacy

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:35.400
after you have--

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.150
in fact, you don't
even have to have sex.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:39.670
Just like be intimate by
holding hands, for Pete's sake.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.790
Talk to each other,
communicate, because that

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:46.480
helps those natural
reproductive hormones,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.925
that love hormone will
have your body say, yes!

00:42:49.925 --> 00:42:51.950
Aside from me because
I have blocked tubes,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.100
but that's beside the point.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.110
So, there are other
things, though, right?

00:42:56.110 --> 00:43:00.250
So other things that help are
nice feel-good hormones that

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.630
has our body say yes would
be things like exercise.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.910
And I'm not talking like
running a marathon, which

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:09.910
requires too much
energy, but things

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.680
like just walking,
connecting with nature

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.510
and doing yoga or dancing.

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.290
Pole dancing, if you'd like.

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:15.790
Right?

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:17.140
Whatever suits you.

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.250
And then I added
meditation and hypnosis,

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:27.130
but I also realize that Google
or maybe a lot of places

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:31.780
where women can be that type A
or what I call AAA personality,

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:34.480
it may be torturous to think
about sitting down and going

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.691
om and meditating.

00:43:35.691 --> 00:43:36.190
Right?

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:37.481
And that's not really relaxing.

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:39.700
So you can't force
yourself to do that.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.360
So, what you can do is what
I call a walking meditation

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.280
or an eating meditation.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.470
Just being in that
present moment

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.740
to take that edge off of your
adrenals so that it's not

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.530
like [buzzing].

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:53.800
You just want to calm it down.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.249
Even if it's for five
minutes at a time.

00:43:56.249 --> 00:43:57.040
That will help you.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.544
That has your body
go OK, all right.

00:44:00.544 --> 00:44:01.960
And that's not
just for fertility,

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.390
that's for overall health.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:07.210
And lastly and very
importantly, because most of us

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.090
are at work more
than we are at home,

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:14.980
so I think it's really important
to have a supportive workplace.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.240
And if you're not in
the supportive workplace

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.850
and you can't help that, then
at least tell one person.

00:44:21.850 --> 00:44:24.250
Have some support
somewhere in your life,

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:29.350
whether it be with a colleague
or a manager, friends, family,

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:30.610
something.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:34.090
And then consider
proposing things

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.070
that will make it
less stressful at work

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.600
like telecommuting,
or flex hours

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.400
so that you can go
to a fertility clinic

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.830
and get those treatments
if you need to.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:52.140
And so the fact is 57% of women
participate in the workforce.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:56.160
So we really need to
look at our workplace.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.660
Right?

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:02.180
Compared to the '50s where
only 34% of us are there.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.120
So I say to you and
all those employers

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:08.990
out there that supporting
conception is good business.

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:10.790
There was a paper
that was written

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.570
by Andrew Oswald and
friends, and they

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:19.610
wrote a study called
Happiness and Productivity.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.090
And I think that's where
Google got this from.

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:25.430
I'm not sure if someone
can tell me otherwise,

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.500
but they recognized
that a happy employee

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.690
is a productive employee.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:34.740
So that means there's higher
productivity, higher sales,

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:38.960
Higher creativity, and much
less incidences of wanting

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.880
to leave an organization.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.850
And I tell you, when I see
patients day in day out,

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.610
when I see patients that
don't have that supportive

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.560
environment, do you
know what they do?

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:52.640
I have witnessed women
have to leave work,

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.160
or they're so stressed out,
they have to go to the doctor,

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.450
and the doctor says,
hey, you need time off,

00:45:57.450 --> 00:46:00.590
so they can go on stress
leave, sick leave,

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:04.840
unpaid leave just to
try to have a kid.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:07.160
But if we transform
our society where

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.080
we create that
support around it,

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:13.370
I'll tell you, as a woman
having gone through this,

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.885
there's nothing better
than having a distraction

00:46:15.885 --> 00:46:17.510
because when you're
trying to conceive,

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.050
that's all you can think about.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:22.220
So if you're in a happy
workplace and it's supportive,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.690
it's like, oh,
thank goodness I can

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.610
go to work so I
can like not have

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:28.520
to think about my
fertility challenges,

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.110
even for like a minute.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:38.730
So that's why I
allude back to Google,

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.970
and I think that's probably
one of the reasons,

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:45.270
amongst many reasons,
why you are considered

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.570
the number-one workplace,
not just one time but seven

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:49.840
times in 10 years.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.950
And that was rated right
from "Fortune Magazine."

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:55.860
So, again, I
really, really would

00:46:55.860 --> 00:47:00.960
love to see other
companies, big or small,

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:07.350
adopt this scenario to help
our future children be created

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:11.630
so that they can
impact this earth.

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:15.590
So my final thoughts is that
for you as an individual,

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:19.020
let's take charge of
our fertility early,

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.740
and let's focus in on
our preconception health.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.710
And then, also, a
very, very big piece

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.430
is that no matter what
your diagnosis, please

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:34.200
know that there is options, and
just be open to opportunity,

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.800
because you never know
the possibilities.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:43.660
And before I introduce
you to Jackie,

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.440
I just really want to
acknowledge some people,

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:50.740
and it's not in
my book, but it's

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.290
those of you who
are out there who

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:56.260
have gone through this
journey and decided

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.190
to get off this road.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.460
I honor you.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:05.250
And it's not
necessarily the path

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:10.950
that you have chosen initially,
but I say that you are fertile,

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:15.220
fertile in your life
because you make

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.900
a difference in this world.

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:21.190
You are a mother in this
life, mothering nature,

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:26.860
mothering animals, or the
communities, or the workplace,

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.840
but you do make a difference.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:35.350
So now I'm just going
to say one last thing.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:40.635
They say it takes a
village to raise a child.

00:48:40.635 --> 00:48:45.140
Well, I say it takes a
village to create a child.

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:45.640
Thank you.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:54.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.450
I'm going to blame it
on my bum leg, that's

00:48:56.450 --> 00:49:01.430
why I'm so weepy today,
but I'm really, really,

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:05.600
really thrilled and honored
to have my patient/friend who

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.630
has come all the way from
Toronto to join me to tell you

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.130
her story.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:11.390
It's inspiring.

00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:12.080
It's hopeful.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.550
And this is Jackie, who is so
lovely to bring me a tissue.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:20.450
And before she
starts talking, she

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:25.880
came to me when she was in her
early 40s, wanting to conceive,

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:29.820
and I don't want
to spoil her story,

00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:33.270
but it's an awesome
one to share with you.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:36.440
I do want to note that she's
actually not in my book.

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:39.190
There are 15 stories, and
she's not one of them.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:41.810
And it's not because
I don't like you,

00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:44.410
but it's because there were
actually a lot of stories,

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.970
and at the time it
just didn't come up,

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:50.600
but she's so awesome to be
able to share her story,

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.296
which, of course, again,
it's private, right,

00:49:53.296 --> 00:49:54.420
and she's willing to share.

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.251
So thank you.

00:49:55.251 --> 00:49:55.750
Jackie.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:56.708
JACKIE: You're welcome.

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:00.722
Hi, everyone.

00:50:00.722 --> 00:50:02.430
It's an honor to be
here today at Google,

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:05.160
but also an honor to be asked
by Mary to come and talk

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.960
about my story.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.340
I decided a while ago mostly
I wanted to support Mary,

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.860
but I also thought it was
really important to share

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:16.424
what has gone on in my life,
because I thought maybe

00:50:16.424 --> 00:50:18.840
it's validating for those of
you who are out there to hear

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.579
someone else and what
they've gone through

00:50:21.579 --> 00:50:24.120
and hear the emotions and the
ups and the downs of everything

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.860
that I have experienced.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.950
So I was probably in
my late 30s, maybe 38,

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.140
I was dating a guy
for a few years

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.690
and we split up
when I was about 38.

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:36.060
I had never really thought
so much about children.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.710
I wanted them at some
point in my life,

00:50:37.710 --> 00:50:40.530
but I was so career-minded.

00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:44.710
I was what Mary called a AAA
career person personality.

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.860
And so when we split
up, it all of a sudden

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:50.470
became an issue that
really was important to me.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:53.700
So I decided, I think I
can do this on my own.

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.310
So my first reaction
was to think, now,

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.570
how am I going to
do this on my own?

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:01.140
And because it was so
recently after we split up,

00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.860
I started calling
up my ex and saying,

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.901
hey, you want to get
together, and it was usually

00:51:04.901 --> 00:51:07.490
right around my
ovulation cycle, and so

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.240
we did that for a few
months, didn't work.

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.520
Then I thought, now I've
got to reach out to someone

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.560
and figure out how am
I going to get someone

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.870
to donate some sperm to me.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.710
So I went through
an entire process,

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.209
and I won't share
that with you now,

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:21.630
but happy to talk about
it with you after.

00:51:21.630 --> 00:51:22.810
But found someone.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:28.890
And I used my donation sperm and
went to a specialist in Toronto

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:32.130
and asked him, here I
am, I'm approaching 40

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.650
and I really want to have
children, what can I do?

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:36.150
So he immediately
gave me the speech

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:39.031
that Mary talked about-- well,
you chances aren't pretty good,

00:51:39.031 --> 00:51:40.530
I don't know what
to tell you, we'll

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.210
try this, let's skip
everything else,

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.460
we'll move right to
the final stage, which

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:47.280
is called IVF in
vitro fertilization,

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.646
where we take your eggs
and we match them up,

00:51:49.646 --> 00:51:51.270
and we'll try and
put them back in you,

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:52.590
and we'll hope for the best.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.320
And I think he even
crossed his fingers.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.640
So we tried that.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.490
And I had always lived
a very healthy life.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.320
I didn't really take
a lot of meditation.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.055
I thought, I should be OK
to do this the first time,

00:52:04.055 --> 00:52:05.370
it shouldn't be an issue.

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:07.980
Sure enough, I got my bag
full of fertility drugs

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:10.410
and started injecting at work
in the bathroom, like you've

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:11.760
heard the stories.

00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.250
I got my egg count so high
that at the first time

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.320
I retrieved 28 eggs.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:19.230
They took these 28 eggs
and they fertilized them

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:20.950
in their laboratory.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:25.050
And five days later, they had
these embryos, and only five

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.617
of them lasted five days.

00:52:26.617 --> 00:52:28.950
So they took two of them,
because in Canada you can only

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:33.000
do two at a time, put them back,
and they hoped for the best.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.887
So I waited those two
weeks very hopeful

00:52:35.887 --> 00:52:37.470
that this is going
to work because I'm

00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:39.070
a very healthy person.

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.220
And so at the end
of the two weeks

00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.810
I went in for my
blood test, and I

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:45.750
couldn't wait till the afternoon
was over, phoned them up,

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.966
and unfortunately
they didn't take.

00:52:47.966 --> 00:52:49.590
I went through this
two or three times,

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:53.790
putting back the ones that
worked, and waited the two

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.680
weeks, and unfortunately
it didn't work.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:58.770
I went through this
IVF cycle five times.

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:00.990
And as I got to the end
of it, the number of eggs

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:04.380
were less and less, but it just
wasn't working well for me.

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.410
I decided at this stage,
I was well into my 40s,

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:10.200
and I thought, I'm going
to give this one more try,

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.350
but what I'm going to do is I'm
going to not worry about it,

00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:16.380
not stress about it, and I
decided this is my last one.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.840
But at the same time
I'm going to keep

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.260
trying to live this work-life
balance that these people talk

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.420
about, and I'm going to
enjoy some of the things

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:25.920
that I had in the past.

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.620
So, when I was younger I
played some competitive tennis,

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.110
and I decided to sign
up for tennis club.

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:32.670
When out, started
playing tennis,

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:34.826
started looking at
places to travel,

00:53:34.826 --> 00:53:36.450
planning trips, doing
different things.

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.700
And I thought if
this doesn't work,

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.670
at least I've now
developed a personal life.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:44.460
So I went out and started
going through this cycle.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.950
Right before I started the
cycle, I made a decision,

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:49.530
I'm going to go and
see every person that

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.060
can give me good advice.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.480
During this process, someone
had recommended Mary to me.

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:57.450
And I started going to
Mary for acupuncture

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:59.850
to help make myself
more fertile,

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:02.250
probably stress relief, too.

00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:05.850
So we went and we tried
to develop my ovaries

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:09.780
and to develop my
nest to create eggs.

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.280
I started playing
some more tennis.

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.690
I started socializing more.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.460
I tried to cut back on work.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.860
And so I thought, this
one's going to work.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.640
As a very strong
safety measure, I also

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.500
came here to New
York City, and I

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.530
thought if I can go and
get an appointment with one

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.620
of the best fertility doctors
and get their advice, for sure

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:29.899
that's going to work.

00:54:29.899 --> 00:54:32.190
So I went to, and I don't
know if I can name-drop here,

00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.510
but I went to the doctor
that Celine Dion used.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:37.330
I thought, if it works for
her, it's going to work for me.

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:39.630
So I went there and we
had a complete workup

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:42.210
and he looked at
everything, and, ironically,

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.950
his protocol was
exactly the same as what

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.810
I was doing already at home.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:49.290
So I went home, I
tried it one more time.

00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:50.760
This protocol took two months.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.010
So I had sort of a ramp-up
of one set of drugs

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:54.570
and then another set.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:56.100
Started playing tennis.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.470
Went away on a trip.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:59.590
Enjoyed myself a
little bit more.

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:03.560
And ironically, an
interesting thing happened.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:06.760
I was playing tennis, and
during my second or third tennis

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.370
lesson, my tennis
pro asked me out.

00:55:09.370 --> 00:55:11.950
And I thought, hmm, OK, why not?

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:13.600
Something to occupy my mind.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.079
So we went out on a few
dates and we started dating.

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.370
Keeping in mind that through
this whole dating process,

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:20.890
I'm injecting fertility drugs
and taking all this stuff

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:22.870
in order to have kids.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:26.980
So it came time to the implant,
and it was about a week away,

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:28.697
and I called up the
doctor and I said,

00:55:28.697 --> 00:55:30.280
is there any way we
can postpone this?

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.724
And he said, well, you've
been taking the drugs for two

00:55:32.724 --> 00:55:35.140
months, I think you're going
to have a really good chance,

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.700
I think we should do this.

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.270
So I decided I'm going
to go ahead and do it.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:43.072
So one evening I
told my boyfriend

00:55:43.072 --> 00:55:44.530
what I was going
to do, and I said,

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:46.330
this is something
I really want, I've

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.730
been using sperm
donated from a friend,

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:50.170
it's something I
really want to do

00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:51.760
and it's really important to me.

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.980
We stayed up the
whole night talking.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.950
And by the next
morning, he had offered

00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:00.430
to introduce him as the
donor instead of my friend.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:01.930
So we rushed to the
doctor's office,

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.060
he runs through all the tests,
the blood tests, the samples,

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.310
everything, and at the last
minute we switched it out

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:08.290
and we put it in, and
I thought, maybe this

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.000
is the one that's going work.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.890
Put it back in.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:15.070
Waited my two weeks, which
was really, really painful.

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:16.810
And went in for my blood test.

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:18.670
Later that afternoon I phoned.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.870
It was negative.

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:24.040
So I decided that
I've met a nice guy.

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.530
I'm going to live the rest
of my life with this person,

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.660
and I'm going to
enjoy my life and I'm

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:31.420
going to have better
work-life balance.

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:34.496
So about a month later, I wasn't
feeling well and I went to Mary

00:56:34.496 --> 00:56:36.370
and I said, Mary, I'm
just not feeling great.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:37.270
Can you help me out?

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:39.430
And so we tried a couple
of different things.

00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:41.615
I still wasn't feeling well
for a couple of months.

00:56:41.615 --> 00:56:43.240
And then I went to
the doctors and they

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:45.156
said can you run some
tests because maybe it's

00:56:45.156 --> 00:56:48.130
the effects of the drugs and
I'm a little bit worried.

00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.770
So they did a bunch
of blood tests,

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.910
and a couple of days later
the doctor phoned me up

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:54.910
and he said, I've got
some bad news for you.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:56.020
And I said, what is it?

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.560
And he said you're
eight weeks pregnant.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:04.090
So as it had turned out, the
advice that Mary had given me

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.190
all along while I was
in treatment with her,

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:09.070
was sometimes drugs just
don't work for people.

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:13.000
Sometimes medical intervention
is just not the right thing

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.780
for some people's bodies.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.920
So what I had to do
was wait till after I

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.960
had gone through that
whole process of my life

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.580
to find out that
it just would have

00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:24.250
worked the old fashioned way.

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:26.050
So ironically,
the way it happens

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:30.084
is that as we had a child,
a very healthy child.

00:57:30.084 --> 00:57:31.750
And I'll tell you
something interesting.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:35.080
When I was pregnant and I went
in for my delivery and all

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:38.679
of my appointments, at
that stage I was 44,

00:57:38.679 --> 00:57:40.720
and they referred to me
as a high-risk pregnancy.

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:43.150
And I said, why are you
referring to me as high risk?

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:44.800
It's been a very
easy pregnancy, other

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:46.540
than being sick all the time.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:50.360
And they said, well,
anybody over the age of 38

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:53.140
is just deemed high risk
because they don't think

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:54.670
you can get pregnant again.

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:57.315
So you automatically get
categorized as high risk.

00:57:57.315 --> 00:57:59.440
So that's already a negative
feeling the whole time

00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:01.600
you're carrying your pregnancy.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:05.470
So ironically, when
my son was about one,

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.900
my boyfriend at the time, we
were about to get married,

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:10.300
made a decision that
parenting was just

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:14.800
too big of a responsibility for
him, so as of the age of one,

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.180
it then became me and my son.

00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:19.960
So it kind of is a full-circle
story that it ended up being me

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:23.870
and my beautiful son that
lived our lives together.

00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:24.910
So that's my story.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.340
I hope it means
something to some of you,

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:29.440
whether it was
validating, inspiring,

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.510
just made you feel
better, I hope

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:32.890
I was able to do that for you.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:35.890
And I'm so thankful to
Mary, who not only helped me

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:38.530
through acupuncture,
but just changed

00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:42.130
the whole process of what I
was feeling to be positive

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:45.070
and encouraging and
helpful and inspiring,

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:46.850
and I can't thank
her enough for that.

00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:48.870
So thank you very much.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:52.251
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:57.275
MARY: I see a
couple of kids here.

00:58:57.275 --> 00:58:58.150
Shall we invite them?

00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.691
JACKIE: Sure.

00:58:58.691 --> 00:59:00.940
MARY: Do you want to meet them?

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:04.645
Zoe and Tristen, would you like
to come on stage for a minute?

00:59:04.645 --> 00:59:07.930
Is that OK?

00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:11.402
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:15.405 --> 00:59:17.530
JACKIE: They don't take
stairs, they just climb up.

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:18.571
MARY: It's not a contest.

00:59:18.571 --> 00:59:19.694
It's not a contest.

00:59:19.694 --> 00:59:20.642
Hi.

00:59:20.642 --> 00:59:21.590
JACKIE: Hi.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.590
MARY: Hi, sweetie.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:24.090
All right.

00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:29.067
So that concludes our talk,
and sometimes this happens.

00:59:29.067 --> 00:59:30.650
JACKIE: Do you want
to say hi, Google?

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.285
TRISTEN: Hi, Google.

00:59:32.285 --> 00:59:33.470
MARY: Do you want to say hi?

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:38.047
ZOE: Daddy!

00:59:38.047 --> 00:59:38.546
Daddy!

00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:45.420
JACKIE: OK.

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:46.170
You want to get off the stage?

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:47.660
We're going to do Q
and A. Thanks, guys.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:48.550
Thank you for coming.

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:49.216
MARY: Thank you.

00:59:49.216 --> 00:59:52.478
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:52.478 --> 00:59:53.410
MARY: All right.

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:55.780
There's a couple of questions,
and we want to get to it

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.630
very quickly because we
just have five minutes.

00:59:58.630 --> 01:00:03.040
So, what questions
should you ask

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.560
a reproductive
endocrinologist when

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.820
they advise you to go to IVF
instead of other methods?

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.420
Well, as Jackie just mentioned,
the first line of defense

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.110
is IVF.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.990
Let's go straight to IVF because
that'll give you your chances,

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.640
increase your chances.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.280
And, again, in her case, it
was actually the opposite.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.410
So it's not always
the best answer.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:26.080
And if you-- and, again,
this is not my journey,

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.330
this is your journey, and
if you feel confident enough

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.700
and if you haven't tried it--

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.310
if you haven't given it enough
of a shot, it's like, well,

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.990
why not try more naturally?

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:38.290
Sometimes they may add a little
bit of drugs, and that's OK,

01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.780
but you could still do
timed intercourse with that.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:42.580
So you can ask
them, if you're not

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.830
comfortable with
full intervention,

01:00:44.830 --> 01:00:47.560
you can say, hey, what's the
lowest amount of intervention I

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:48.290
can do?

01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:50.830
Maybe we could even just
do cycle monitoring, which

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:53.500
is literally looking
at your ovaries

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:57.010
developing over the course
of your menstrual cycle

01:00:57.010 --> 01:01:00.640
and let that be enough
of an intervention.

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.440
So I hope that answers that.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.530
You know, everyone's different.

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.810
And some people want
to go straight to IVF.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:10.120
And, again, that's not
necessarily the best answer.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.920
It is for some, but
not for everyone.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.080
So second question.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.930
A common myth for egg
freezing is the procedure

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:18.460
may cause early menopause.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.740
Is this true?

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.120
Wow, that's a great question.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.550
Again, egg freezing,
as I had mentioned,

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:26.790
is a very new science.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.360
But I would say that no--

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.470
I'm not sure.

01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:32.105
And certainly if you
just do one IVF cycle,

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.730
I don't think it's
going to cause that.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:38.530
Now, I'm going to tell you
something that is very true.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:43.750
I did many, more than five,
six IVF cycles with drugs,

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.400
and I am in early menopause.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.650
So I'll be in--

01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:52.840
I'll be 50 this year,
and I was already

01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.960
in menopause last year
or the year before even.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.240
So is it due to IVF?

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.500
Not 100% sure.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:00.280
But it is early.

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:03.340
JACKIE: But conversely, I
did many, many processes,

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:07.690
and I'm turning 54 this year
and I'm not in menopause yet,

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:11.080
so hopeful.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.670
MARY: So, yeah, right.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.050
And everyone's an individual.

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:15.910
We all respond differently.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:20.110
OK, third, your
presentation was the first

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:23.060
I'd seen with a 120-day
egg development cycle.

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:26.260
I was treated for an ectopic
pregnancy with Methotrexate,

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.456
and they said I could start
trying again after 120 days.

01:02:29.456 --> 01:02:31.330
Should I wait longer
than three months, based

01:02:31.330 --> 01:02:33.790
on your development chart?

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:37.490
Again, I mean, this
depends on your scenario,

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.160
and are you working
with someone?

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.610
Are you taking pre-conception
health treatments?

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:45.550
Methotrexate is a
cancer drug, so you

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.300
do want to get that
out of your system,

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.390
so that's probably why
they say that anyhow.

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.710
Right?

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:53.500
But then taking a
little bit of extra time

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:57.670
to really help, again,
the quality, rather

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.580
than, oh, my gosh, every
month is a missing month

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.820
and I have to do it.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.600
That doesn't necessarily
work, because, to me, it's

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.270
much better to have a better--

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:09.190
to have your body
in a better place,

01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:11.800
rather than trying in
month in, month out

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.350
and then maybe even getting
more failed miscarriages.

01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:16.660
You'd rather have one
that counts, right?

01:03:16.660 --> 01:03:19.690
I mean, having that take-home
baby is much more important.

01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:22.330
So what are your thoughts
on autoimmune specialists

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:26.430
and infertility
following multiple five-

01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:29.640
to seven-week miscarriages
with PGS normal embryos?

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.670
My RE recommended an
autoimmune specialist,

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:35.190
but I can't find much
scientific evidence that this

01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:36.450
may make a difference.

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.641
What would you do following
these miscarriages?

01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:40.140
OK.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:43.670
So, in my book I actually
have a chapter on autoimmune.

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.070
How much time do I have left?

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:46.710
Does someone-- I don't know.

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:48.810
OK, fine.

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:50.250
I'll just go.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:55.284
So autoimmune is there, and
there are some specialists that

01:03:55.284 --> 01:03:56.700
claim that they
can help, and I've

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.160
witnessed some women that
did some crazy, wild things,

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.090
like go to Mexico to do
these autoimmune treatments.

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:06.300
And it is controversial,
but I have seen it work.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.220
So, again, you'd have to see.

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:11.910
But then on the other
side of the picture,

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:15.330
I've also witnessed people that
have autoimmune markers, which

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.810
they can detect through
blood work, and yet over time

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:21.450
and even just having
themselves be in a more

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:24.210
balanced place, those--

01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:26.430
by the way, one of
those autoimmune markers

01:04:26.430 --> 01:04:27.897
is called natural killer cells.

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:30.480
So how horrible is that, going
through life thinking about oh,

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.330
my gosh, I'm killing my
cells, I'm killing embryos,

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:34.800
I'm a killer.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.430
Right?

01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:36.840
Not very empowering.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.400
So it's like, well,
look at your life

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.280
and let's see about
aligning it in a way

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.540
that our body, instead of
producing autoimmune response,

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:50.250
will actually say, yes, I
want this, I love my embryos,

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:51.540
and then you'll get pregnant.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:53.760
And I actually have
seen this So, again,

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.020
you can go either way.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.700
No hard-fast rule.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.360
Many miscarriages are caused
by chromosomal abnormalities.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.600
How much does a man's health or
well-being, stress, et cetera,

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.760
impact the eventual
health of an embryo?

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.740
So I took care of
that earlier when

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:09.390
I talked about male factor.

01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:11.010
It does contribute.

01:05:11.010 --> 01:05:14.520
If I had a previous
ectopic pregnancy

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.350
and salpingectomy,
salpingectomy means

01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:20.980
taking out the fallopian
tube, how much at risk

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.140
am I for ectopic?

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.730
Well, you are more at
risk, because chances

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:29.280
are when a person has
one ectopic pregnancy,

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.130
there's a higher incidence
of another ectopic, which

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:35.430
means implantation of embryo
developing in the fallopian

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.570
tube.

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:40.020
Do you advise that I move to
ART to prevent another rupture?

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.182
Well, the first thing is
that you don't necessarily

01:05:42.182 --> 01:05:43.140
have to have a rupture.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:46.290
When you get pregnant, you
go and do early testing

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.280
to see where you're at.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.800
You have to visualize that
it's actually in your uterus.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.730
And if it's in
your uterus, great.

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.430
But, again, in Eastern medicine,
one of the things that we do

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.810
is we want to create
lots of love, luscious,

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:03.480
juicy endometrial linings
so that your embryos can

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:07.350
stick in that uterine lining
and prevent the fallopian

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:08.920
tubes from--

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.210
for, sorry,
migration of embryos.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:16.784
How much does endometriosis
prevent pregnancy?

01:06:16.784 --> 01:06:18.450
It depends on the
case, but it certainly

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:22.980
doesn't have to preclude you
from getting pregnant at all.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.950
And certainly there are
cases where it's so severe

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:28.980
and you're getting like
lots of scar tissuing

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.690
that really blocks all the
different reproductive organs.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:36.390
But, again, depending
on the severity,

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:39.510
it can be helped either
naturally, or sometimes

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:43.170
with intervention, like medical
surgical removal of tissue,

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:44.610
adhesions.

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:47.820
So, can you mitigate
with homeopathy?

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:50.760
So I cannot really address
homeopathy because I

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:53.940
don't practice
homeopathy, but perhaps.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.510
But certainly I can speak
to naturopathic medicine

01:06:57.510 --> 01:07:01.230
and Chinese medicine, and
they can potentially help.

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:03.630
And lastly, what are the most
important dietary changes

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:06.870
you recommend in preparing
for an IVF cycle?

01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:10.950
Do you recommend cutting
out alcohol completely?

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:14.520
Well, I would say yes.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.650
And it doesn't have
to be for life,

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:20.580
but, again, as I talked about
when leading up to there's

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.590
90 to 120 days of
egg development,

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:26.650
so you really want to give it
the best environment possible.

01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:27.810
So why not?

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.630
And the other question,
actually I relay it back to you,

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:34.500
ask yourself, if I don't get
pregnant in this IVF cycle,

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.510
am I going to blame it on
that one drink that I had?

01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:39.450
Now, on the opposite
side of the coin,

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:42.570
I also don't love it when people
are like so strict and anal

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:45.510
about their diet and lifestyle
that it becomes an impediment

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:48.360
and stress-building
in and of itself

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:53.760
because, again, increased
stress can impede and decrease

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.040
our chances of conceiving

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.100
OK, I think that's it.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:57.700
Thank you.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:01.050
[APPLAUSE]
