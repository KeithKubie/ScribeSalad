00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.130
The database we'll be working with in this course is:

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.320
MongoDB. There are a couple of reasons for that. One of

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.070
which is, since I work for MongoDB it would be bizarre

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.700
for me to do this using a different database and potentially

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.760
a career limiting move. But, the primary reason for talking

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.130
about MongoDB in this particular course is because it makes a

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.410
lot of sense for data analysis applications. MongoDB is widely used

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.810
in big data. And, it's the leading no SQL database. Now,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.490
while MongoDB is a no SQL database. The term

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.640
we, we most commonly use is document database. Let me

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.000
talk a little bit about what we mean by that.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.800
We're not talking about a database for storing PDF documents

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.480
or Microsoft Word documents. What we mean by documents is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.220
an associative array. Now, this is the same type of

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.930
structure that you see in a JSON object. Or a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.230
PHP array. A Python dictionary or Ruby hash, and similar

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.980
data structures in other programming languages. MongoDB allows

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.670
us to store these types of hierarchical data structures.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.360
Directly in the database as individual items or

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.920
documents. Now the documents stored in mongoDB use a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.030
JSON like syntax. I say JSON like because

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.180
mongoDB is more flexible with the use of quotes

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.010
and other small syntaxical elements than strict JSON.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.520
And yes, it is somewhat oxymoronic to describe anything

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.230
Javascript related as strict.
