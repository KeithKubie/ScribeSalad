1
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.870
Okay.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.800
<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:05.620
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:09.770
June 5th, 2017. What's going on? How I, yeah,

5
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.750
how's it going? How was your weekend? Um,

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.700
it's really not Monday morning at this point. I mean,

7
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:18.160
it's still my Monday morning, just 20 to fucking 11,

8
00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:22.210
but by the time I finished this shit's going to be about noon, noon.

9
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.580
I'm Saskatoon seed, the northern lights.

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.490
Um, I just had a fucking amazing weekend.

11
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.290
I want to thank everybody who came out to cluster fest up in,

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.590
um, San Francisco, this new comedy festival. Um,

13
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.200
I was up there Saturday and on a Sunday.

14
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.910
Um, I had like, I had like a make a wish weekend was crazy.

15
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.380
I went up there. Um, let's see. What did I do?

16
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:57.940
I did the two dope Queens podcast. Then I did, uh,

17
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.000
I did the comedy jam. Goddamn comedy jam.

18
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.040
We playing outside near City Hall, which I called the fucking state capitol.

19
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.250
Anytime you see a dome, I'm like, that's gotta be the Capitol of the state.

20
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.160
I mean, what, why, why would they spend that much fucking money?

21
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.850
Making something look that impressive. And all it is is just city hall.

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.990
You're telling me the fucking mayor lives there. Jesus Christ.

23
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.320
I'd love to see the governor governor's above the mayor, right?

24
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.400
Is that how it works? It's like meter maid, then it goes mayor,

25
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.503
then governor,

26
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.480
then state representative congressman, right. And then a senator.

27
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.530
And then the MotoGP level is you're the fucking, uh, you the president,

28
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.720
alright.

29
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.630
Tweets and gets up and storms out of interviews when he doesn't like the

30
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:50.610
questions. Um, the fuck is going on with it.

31
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.140
You know, I watched this thing on, uh,

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.160
what's his face of Lottie Dottie there Vladimir Putin saying like,

33
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.820
how like anybody who's like an opponent of his, they stay fucking kill them.

34
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.800
There's, they've had all these weird suicides.

35
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.120
So one guy tied himself to a chair and somehow threw himself into a pool.

36
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.090
That one right there is not only,

37
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.640
um, getting rid of your enemy,

38
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.720
but it's also displaying your level of power because when you're not even trying

39
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.440
to hide it like that, oh yeah. That was a suicide. Um,

40
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.640
anyways, and then he's like, poisoning fucking people in all this shit.

41
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.230
Whenever I watched those shit, I'll never watch up. Um,

42
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.540
stories about people like that. There was this guy,

43
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.480
and he's gotten poisoned twice.

44
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.760
First Time you went into a coma for a week and he was in the hospital for like a

45
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.790
fucking month.

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.790
Now he walks with like a limp and he went right back to protests and you know,

47
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:58.680
the current regime in Russia. And then he fucking,

48
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.990
they poisoned him again. He goes to the same hospital. This time they realized,

49
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.250
you know, with his symptoms going right,

50
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.630
this guy's probably been poisoned against.

51
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.650
So they knew something a little better.

52
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.390
So they got them out in like a week to 10 days.

53
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.660
I don't know about you guys the first time I get poisoned and I, and I live,

54
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.340
I'm going to say to the cause, listen guys, I'm passing the torch. Okay?

55
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:21.340
I did my part. I'm going to, uh,

56
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.470
I'm going to start making those furry Russian hats.

57
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.070
I'm going to open a little fucking kiosk down at the local, um,

58
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.180
people's mall, whatever the fuck it is. It's, you know, it's funny,

59
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.860
as everybody thinks Russia's communists, right?

60
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.360
Somebody told me that the other day going like that dude,

61
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.480
they haven't been communists for like fucking 25 years. They're like over here.

62
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.590
It's like a small group of people running shit except a a, you know,

63
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.560
rather than tweeting and walking out on shit, they just kind of poison people.

64
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.320
They've taken it to the next level.

65
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.950
I believe that kids say it's turnt up. Um, but anyways,

66
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.280
cluster fest, I just,

67
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.430
I went to bed watching that as I started talking about a comedy festival and

68
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:03.910
then I go over talking about a guy getting poisoned and continuing to do what

69
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.050
the fuck if he ever got poisoned doing stand up. That's it. I'm done.

70
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.680
I'm done. I would just,

71
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.910
I would send out a tweet, uh, to whom,

72
00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.380
whoever poisoned me, uh,

73
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:20.590
what would you like me to be doing with my life so I can get on with that.

74
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.560
Um, stock stock room at best buy. You got it. I'll fucking load.

75
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:29.530
And unload flatscreen TVs for the rest of my fucking life.

76
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.300
To not go into another week long coma and stay in the hospital for God damn

77
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.570
month. Knowing that there's people out there that not only can poison me,

78
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.640
I don't know who the fuck they are. And when they did it,

79
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.880
it was just sitting there talking to his wife.

80
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:47.470
Everything's fine and out of fucking nowhere he see you went from feeling all of

81
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.400
a sudden, hey, you know, I feel a little at, is it hot in here? Boom,

82
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.500
right into a coma to fucking 20 minutes later

83
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.050
continues to fight the good fight. Man, that's amazing.

84
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.080
That's amazing. You know, if there is an afterlife for whatever,

85
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.550
I feel like that guys in the pre-checked TSA line, you know,

86
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.760
just goes right through. Um,

87
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.530
I saw this little youtube video on this guy who allegedly had a 200 IQ and I

88
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.960
guess the average person has a hundred you get up to about one 31 40.

89
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.450
You're a fucking genius. You know,

90
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:27.451
fucking Tesla had a one 50 fucking Galileo and a one 60.

91
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:33.511
Somebody had a one 90 and this guy's got a 200 so he's allegedly the smartest

92
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:37.120
person on the fucking planet and he lives in the fucking middle of nowhere and a

93
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.880
Goddamn farm with like a couple of yaks and some chickens.

94
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.140
Then he met some other super genius woman out of Brooklyn. Um,

95
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.620
I don't know if you heard them both talk. I didn't buy it.

96
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.670
I didn't buy it first. I Dunno what's his wife started talking and it's just,

97
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.290
they never really made him demonstrate how fucking smart he was.

98
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.100
He just was talking about what he was doing.

99
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.780
He was trying to prove that heaven exists. So

100
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.173
<v 2>yes,</v>

101
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.610
<v 1>right there. That was suspect to me once, just kind of like going like,</v>

102
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.911
all right,

103
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.240
this guy is like the smartest person ever and he's like a fucking religious

104
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.074
freak,

105
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.873
<v 2>you know?</v>

106
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.510
<v 1>I don't know. That's always a, uh,</v>

107
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.820
I haven't found too many smart people that are like that level

108
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.010
into religion. I have found smart people into religion,

109
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:29.200
but they're kind of like, hey, this is what I believe. You don't believe it.

110
00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:32.040
I get it. But you know, it works for me. So while I have a nice day,

111
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.920
they supposed to tell you you're going to fucking burn forever or some shit.

112
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.870
I Dunno, like always trying to prove the existence they have.

113
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.440
What about hell does that exist?

114
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

115
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.540
<v 1>I don't fucking know. Um, I'll, I'll send a, uh,</v>

116
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.310
I'll post it. Is that what I'm supposed to say? I'll post the fucking clip. Um,

117
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.810
anyways, let me get back to cluster. I'm fucking talking in circles here. Um,

118
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.610
so yeah. So I landed, I did a private gig and then I did two broke girls.

119
00:07:02.611 --> 00:07:07.260
Then I played drums at the goddamn comedy jam outside the fucking Mayor's house

120
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.030
in this giant square. There was a couple thousand people there.

121
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:14.683
<v 2>Um,</v>

122
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.940
<v 1>and I forgot to adjust this one symbol. So I tell him to bring my stick up.</v>

123
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:21.740
This my, he had like the fucking crash symbol. The other drummer,

124
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.250
we had the crashed symbol, nick right above it.

125
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:26.470
And I kept hitting it and I was mission shit. I was fucking up,

126
00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:29.590
but I just kept going. It's kind of a learning experience.

127
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:31.880
Like I fucked up a lot. I thought and uh,

128
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.020
but I just kept going and somehow landed on its feet.

129
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.650
And then later on that night I did a show there.

130
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.710
I don't know how many fucking people were there. It was freezing.

131
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.860
It was the coldest I've ever been doing standup up. It just like outside,

132
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.490
you know, safe for those people who don't live in San Francisco.

133
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.390
And I've made this mistake because I took a vacation there a long time ago in

134
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:55.510
July and I dressed like it was July. Um,

135
00:07:55.511 --> 00:08:00.040
San Francisco summer I believe is like end of September to like middle of

136
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:01.660
October. It's really quick

137
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.750
and the rest of the time it is fucking freezing. So,

138
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.340
um, I was in this little fucking trailer in the back,

139
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.250
which always cracks me up about this business. You know, you're like,

140
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.290
I'm going to make it some day. I'm going to be a star.

141
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.110
And you end up in a fucking trailer park for most of your career.

142
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.320
So I'm in this trailer, right? Not even a double wide.

143
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.040
I'm fucking sitting there and oh, by the way,

144
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:31.780
Les Claypool Band played across the way before I went up.

145
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.610
So I got to hear them play. I couldn't see him play,

146
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:37.810
but I got to meet him briefly. This is my make-a-wish weekend.

147
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:43.450
I just fucking broke out the double pedal and I've been trying to play a Tommy

148
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:46.030
the cat and that type of shit, which I'm failing miserably at.

149
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.730
And here I am meeting the fucking guy that wrote the Goddamn Song.

150
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.560
He was cool as hell. His band sounded amazing. Um,

151
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.440
and uh, yeah, so I was standing down and I did a show. It was me,

152
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:01.830
Joe de Rosa and Pete Davidson and I was sitting in the trailer trying to get

153
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:05.460
warm, um, you know,

154
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.110
learning from the east coast going right.

155
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.600
If I'm already cold with my hoodie and my jacket on,

156
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.890
I need to take this shit off and let my body adjusts. So when I go out there,

157
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.300
when I put the Hoodie jacket on, I'll LBR right. That's something, um,

158
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.070
you learn as a kid.

159
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.000
If you already put all your snow shit on inside the house and your body adjust

160
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.160
to your temperature in the house with that shit on,

161
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.260
you can then go outside and you're going to be freezing cold. I don't know.

162
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.760
Well how it works. That's how it works. You gotta take your fucking jacket off.

163
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:35.130
So I was doing that and as I'm doing it,

164
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.010
I'm listening to Rosa and he's murdering in like the laughs he's getting is not

165
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.420
opening a show. Laughs. And he went out there at like, no pun intended, cold.

166
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:47.580
There was no nothing, no music. I don't even,

167
00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:50.580
what the fuck it was just ladies and gentlemen, Jonah rose on,

168
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:55.230
he walked out to the parking lot where the hell we were performing and he was

169
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:57.420
getting laughs that were not open or laughs.

170
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:03.140
And then he brought up up Pete Davidson and he's fucking killing justice hard.

171
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:06.390
Both of them absolutely murdered. Whoever was at the show,

172
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:08.160
I know can back me up on that. And

173
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.200
then I went out there and it was a,

174
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.730
it was one of the more memorable shows I've had with like the a,

175
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.550
the mayor's house there. They had the dome,

176
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.950
it was all lit up and like this Celtic screen, which was pretty cool. And, um,

177
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.560
where they'd sat everybody,

178
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.200
they would like these traffic lights that would tell him butyl walk or not walk.

179
00:10:29.201 --> 00:10:32.130
And I kept, you know, was seeing the sign when they were counting down,

180
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.090
whether it was safe to walk across the alleged traffic that was no longer there.

181
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.020
I kept thinking that was like the end of my set. It was like fucking me up.

182
00:10:40.021 --> 00:10:43.530
And whenever the red light came on, I'm like, does that mean to wrap it up?

183
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.260
I kept it until it's a fucking traffic. Like mmm. I Dunno. Anyways,

184
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.130
so I did that. And then on Sunday, no, and then I went to a big after party.

185
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.540
You got to hang out with Derosa big Jay, Nate bar, gutsy,

186
00:10:57.541 --> 00:11:00.150
all these fucking guys, man. Just having a great time.

187
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:04.830
And then the next day I got to interview Jerry Seinfeld, um,

188
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.100
promoting his comedians in cars,

189
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.630
getting coffee that's going to be out on Netflix. And um,

190
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.770
I can't even tell you how fucking nervous I was to do that cause I was just

191
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:18.690
like, all right, I was joking in the interview going like,

192
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.700
I always feel like I'm one dumb comment away from you just standing up and just

193
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:27.300
walking out of the room and I never see you again. Like that's the vibe he has.

194
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.510
And as I said that he stood up and just walked out of the,

195
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.450
starts to walk off the stage. Um,

196
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.140
I was like really nervous because I thought that, uh,

197
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.730
I dunno, I just thought he was going to give really quick,

198
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:45.930
short answers and I was just going to be sitting there like Chris Farley when he

199
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:49.910
did that sketch, what he ever interviewed a Paul McCartney, like,

200
00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:51.300
remember we did Seinfeld.

201
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.970
That was awesome. Like I thought it was literally going to be that guy, but I'm,

202
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.550
within two seconds I realized I'll wait.

203
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:04.180
This guy did the tonight show with Johnny Carson. You know,

204
00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.960
why wouldn't he come out here and absolutely fucking kill it if he just sat here

205
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.560
giving me quick answers to thing would go nowhere and then he would look bad

206
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:14.200
with me. Um, it was amazing,

207
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:18.010
was one of the most fun things I've gotten to do in my career. And um, you know,

208
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:21.550
before I interviewed him for whatever, I had all these fucking questions.

209
00:12:21.551 --> 00:12:23.890
Like I was going to look at my car, I'd never interviewed somebody like that.

210
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:27.400
So I had all these questions I was going to ask him, you know,

211
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.780
he's favorite car of all time, his favorite met of all time, you know,

212
00:12:31.781 --> 00:12:35.260
what level dictator would you still be willing to do a private show for?

213
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.280
You know what I mean? Um, and I never even had to look at them.

214
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.400
Nice. A few of those, I think I asked him who his favorite met was.

215
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:46.060
I forget who he said it was someone from like the 69 series, but um,

216
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.930
it's probably that guy that dove caught the ball. Um,

217
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.140
but before I went and interviewed them, I was looking up, you know,

218
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.110
some information about them. Just so I would have something.

219
00:12:56.111 --> 00:12:57.010
I was trying to think what the fuck.

220
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.940
And I asked this guy that he's not been asked a million times before,

221
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:06.490
and I just happened to seats as Jerry Seinfeld comments on Kathy Griffin, um,

222
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.360
controversy. And they cut to him. They were just like, Jerry,

223
00:13:10.361 --> 00:13:13.570
what do you think about the whole Kathy Griffin, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

224
00:13:13.571 --> 00:13:17.440
blah, blah. And he just goes, it's stupid. Who Cares?

225
00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.260
That was it. And I was like, oh my God,

226
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.040
is he going to do that when I interview them? Is it going to be that quick? Um,

227
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:29.380
[inaudible] thank God, thank God he didn't. Um, thank God he didn't.

228
00:13:29.381 --> 00:13:34.000
So it went great. Thank Christ. And then I,

229
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.370
um, the interview ended, um,

230
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.270
I dunno. We would just say, man, that was a lot of fun. That went great.

231
00:13:44.271 --> 00:13:49.190
It was awesome. And then he left, and then me and Josh,

232
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.700
Adam Maya's jumped in a car. It didn't really jump in a car.

233
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.850
Jerry jumped in his car because he does life. Right. You know,

234
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.450
he gave me some great advice about being on the road. He said,

235
00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:01.880
when the show's over, you just go and go back to the room.

236
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.610
Egos go back to the room and I go, you ever just want to go out and have a cup?

237
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.660
He goes, go back to the room, goes, there's nothing,

238
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.420
nothing good is out there.

239
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.530
Just go back to the room and do you know I already knew that d not many times

240
00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:19.840
I've learned that fucking lesson. And he said to me, he goes,

241
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:21.790
if you want to look this good in your sixties,

242
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.340
go back to the room and he looks fucking great.

243
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.690
So I'm gonna try to do that.

244
00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.080
<v 1>How do you go back to the room? You don't go back to the room.</v>

246
00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:33.280
You have no stories.

247
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.833
<v 2>Okay,</v>

248
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.860
<v 1>I'm going to be in Montreal this weekend. How do I go back to the room?</v>

249
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.300
One of my favorites to Gab buys in the fucking world is there.

250
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:44.950
How do I go back to the room?

251
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:49.090
I'm going to have to tell you every time I go back to the room, um,

252
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.650
I'm hating it right until I get to the elevator.

253
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:57.490
And then I go up in the elevator and I go into the room and I put the TV on and

254
00:14:57.741 --> 00:15:00.860
the second I get into the bed, I'm like, oh my God, this is awesome.

255
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.640
This is fucking great. I don't know why. I just,

256
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:11.170
you know, I think I finished the show. I'm wired, I'm excited.

257
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:15.780
It went well. And then I, you know, I go on the road with friends. Yeah.

258
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.530
And they're always, what do you think? Uh, maybe go have a couple to a tree.

259
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.890
And I always say yes.

260
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.523
<v 0>Okay.</v>

261
00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.720
<v 1>I always say yes. So anyways, so the show ends.</v>

262
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.180
I've learned to go back to the room.

263
00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:33.070
I've also learned to have the car service right fucking there.

264
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.370
Like Jerry, it was just, it just, just like his act,

265
00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:40.480
there was no fat on him fucking leaving the stage, going to the dressing room,

266
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:44.080
getting his shit. And he just walked right out and I said, I go, yeah,

267
00:15:44.081 --> 00:15:46.870
of course. I go, look it, look, this is how you do your life.

268
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.080
The fucking cars ready. My guys, I don't know where the fuck he is.

269
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:54.980
And he just laughed. And he just got in his car and it was over. So

270
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.860
I usually don't have any sort of a car service. I usually just walk out. Okay.

271
00:15:59.861 --> 00:16:03.610
So the reason why I have a car service was because I had tickets to go to the

272
00:16:03.611 --> 00:16:06.160
game, to the NBA finals.

273
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:08.680
My make a wish weekend continues.

274
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.510
So my car guy goes, yeah, I'm Fuckin Dude,

275
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.860
I'm fucking deaf. The street and the car garage. And I go, all right,

276
00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:21.800
so we're right here. I told them where we're at. Come to the stage door.

277
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.710
The dude comes to the stage door on foot

278
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.610
and walked us back to the fucking cock.

279
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:34.760
The show ended at three 45 to final started at five o'clock so I'm like,

280
00:16:34.761 --> 00:16:39.300
what the fuck man? So we walked all the way over to this parking garage.

281
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.600
[inaudible] got in the elevator, went downstairs. I'm like,

282
00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:44.340
I'm in the parking garage with the crowd.

283
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.080
It's the most anti showbusiness thing ever. It's the most anti Elvis left.

284
00:16:49.081 --> 00:16:53.250
The fucking building was fucking pedestrian was shameful.

285
00:16:53.251 --> 00:16:56.790
I should've had my a year in show business card revoked.

286
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.020
So we get in the car and was sitting in the traffic with the fucking crowd to

287
00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:05.860
get out of the parking garage. Nothing VIP about a complete fucking moron.

288
00:17:05.861 --> 00:17:07.830
I am. So we ended up, uh,

289
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.600
me and Josh were riding in the car over and we're just laughing. Go Dude,

290
00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:14.140
we're going to the fucking NBA finals final. So would ever the fuck you saying.

291
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.063
And um,

292
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.030
and we had a couple of cigars and we said to the guy who turned out to be the

293
00:17:19.031 --> 00:17:21.870
greatest driver ever, we were like, dude, is it okay if, uh,

294
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.520
I don't get the guy in trouble.

295
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.740
He may or may not allegedly have let us smoke the cigar in the back of the car.

296
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.550
And, um, we ended up getting to the finals and, uh,

297
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.500
we missed about half of the first quarter.

298
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.630
And it's just one of those things like,

299
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:41.920
I can't believe I'm here and I love that fucking arena.

300
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:43.480
It's gonna be a shame when they leave it.

301
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:46.150
I'm going to tell warrior fans right now, enjoy that arena.

302
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.640
Cause your next arena is not going to be that loud.

303
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.030
The new ones that never that loud,

304
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:55.830
because they build in all of those luxury boxes and everything is just so

305
00:17:55.831 --> 00:18:00.680
fucking big and far away from the court. Um, but anyways,

306
00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:05.130
so we go to the game and we're watching the game and it's fucking, you know,

307
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.980
it's great through about the first two and a half quarters and then the worry is

308
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:12.180
just start pulling away.

309
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:17.181
And I gotta tell you as a fan of sport and competition that Kevin Duran,

310
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.250
the allowing Kevin Duran to go to the warriors was,

311
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.210
that's out of all those things. Lebron going to Miami,

312
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.750
a fucking Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen going to the Celtics,

313
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.290
Shaq and Phil Jackson go into the Lakers.

314
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.370
This one might be the worst one because at least like,

315
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.500
like Shaq and Phil Jackson, that was a bad time. But still,

316
00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:49.620
you still had like the Spurs, they attempt Duncan, they had David Robinson,

317
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:53.640
you know, you still had something to compete with. And um,

318
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.253
<v 0>okay.</v>

319
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.750
<v 1>You know, with the Celtics, when we won,</v>

320
00:18:57.751 --> 00:19:00.630
we still the beat the fucking Lakers and God knows they always had 9 million

321
00:19:00.631 --> 00:19:01.770
fucking free agents.

322
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.280
And even the fucking heat that first year they lost to the mavericks.

323
00:19:07.651 --> 00:19:12.470
But this one, it was just like, I'm trying to think of an analogy to compete.

324
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.120
Be like if Matt Magic Johnson joined the, uh,

325
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:21.770
the Celtics or Larry Bird joined the Lakers after the 1985 championship.

326
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.290
When we lost him in the finals, he just joined the fucking Lakers. Um,

327
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:30.641
I got go. Yeah.

328
00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:33.850
It just felt it felt fucking dirty when I was watching it going like,

329
00:19:33.851 --> 00:19:38.590
this just doesn't feel good. It just, I dunno,

330
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.610
I wasn't an NBA final game and I was actually bored,

331
00:19:42.611 --> 00:19:47.530
which is funny because I, I thought when I was at home,

332
00:19:47.531 --> 00:19:50.020
I didn't know what the warrior fans were chanting when they were saying

333
00:19:50.021 --> 00:19:54.070
Warriors, warriors. I thought they were chanting boring,

334
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.840
boring.

335
00:19:55.841 --> 00:19:58.600
I literally thought that that's what they were saying because there was so much

336
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.440
look at last years Western Conference finals that was fucking unbelievable.

337
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.740
That seven game series with the thunder and the warriors.

338
00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:13.450
And then you look at last year's NBA final was fucking amazing when seven games

339
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.070
and was won in the last second by the Cavaliers. It was incredible basketball,

340
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:22.240
incredible level of competition. It was amazing.

341
00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:24.820
And then, I don't know,

342
00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:28.390
I don't understand how the Chris Paul trade was bad for basketball,

343
00:20:28.391 --> 00:20:31.120
but Kevin Duran go into the warriors

344
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:37.200
and then just watching him puffing their chest out and punching it fucking chest

345
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.760
and, and the crowd going crazy as if they don't realize what they're watching.

346
00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:43.700
<v 0>Okay.</v>

347
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.160
<v 1>Like acting as though like, yeah, man,</v>

348
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.410
this year's our last year you beat us. But you know what, we dug down deeper.

349
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.110
No, you didn't. You didn't.

350
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

351
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.460
<v 1>You picked up the best guy that almost fucking beat your last year and added a t</v>

352
00:20:58.461 --> 00:21:01.220
a team. It was like, I don't know,

353
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.740
every time they get to within three to five points, what's, I have to tell you,

354
00:21:06.741 --> 00:21:08.820
it's pretty fucking amazing when you're playing a team.

355
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:12.260
They haven't even lost the game yet. They've lost one game since February.

356
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.330
Um,

357
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.330
and they were already playing like that before they had Kevin Durant.

358
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:25.240
So I'm not trying to rain on people's parade here or anything, but,

359
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.220
uh, I really don't have anything to say about the game other than I will for me.

360
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.640
I watch sports to watch competition.

361
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.840
I don't watch it to watch a layup. Um,

362
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.810
I mean the fact that they have all of those guys and then they can rotate them

363
00:21:44.811 --> 00:21:47.750
out and when they, Lebron is sitting down,

364
00:21:47.751 --> 00:21:50.900
they got another two Lebron still out there. It's just fucking,

365
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.370
I dunno, there was a lot, I don't know. There was a lot of like,

366
00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:03.280
I just couldn't believe I didn't hear one warrior fan address it. You know,

367
00:22:03.281 --> 00:22:06.570
at some point just kind of be like, if yes, it's kind of a,

368
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.560
I mean, any Celtic fans out there, you didn't feel like, dude, what the fuck?

369
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:16.000
That year in 2000 we were like in last place and then Kevin McHale's in the

370
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.840
front office of the Timberwolves and trades away Kevin Garnett for nothing.

371
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.620
A former Celtic does that to the Timberwolves like that should have been

372
00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:27.700
investigated the same way. The power is salt trade when, what's his face?

373
00:22:27.701 --> 00:22:31.960
Jerry West was in the front office of the Grizzlies. Yeah.

374
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:35.620
We'll give you pau Gasol for his fucking brother who's now good.

375
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:40.030
But he wasn't back then, was a horrible fucking trade. Um,

376
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.960
those were bad enough, but I think this is the worst one ever. Like this is, um,

377
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.650
I'm still holding out. I have to root for the Cavaliers.

378
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.370
I'm still rooting for the fact that they can somehow, uh,

379
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.731
you know,

380
00:22:53.731 --> 00:22:57.000
obviously they've got to win the next one most obvious fucking statement ever.

381
00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:59.160
But um, yeah,

382
00:22:59.161 --> 00:23:02.280
I got to tell you from about halfway through the third coordinate started

383
00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:07.281
pulling away and then the Cavaliers kept fighting back and they just had,

384
00:23:08.611 --> 00:23:12.400
it was, it was ridiculous. It was like, I don't know,

385
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:13.540
I just walked out of there going like,

386
00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:17.890
that felt like a fucking regular season game. I didn't feel like, I dunno.

387
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.043
I Dunno.

388
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:24.870
I don't know how the fuck

389
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.580
somebody explained to me what that that's competition. Like as a warrior fan,

390
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:35.050
you're going to look at that and just be like, yeah, man, that feels good.

391
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.200
And you have to be honest with yourself. Warrior fans,

392
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:42.640
weren't you guys bitching at Lebron when he went to Miami and he won two down

393
00:23:42.641 --> 00:23:46.580
there, right once say, and that's fucking bullshit.

394
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.650
And to pile on team now. Now if you were,

395
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.500
you got to say that about your own fucking team and I didn't eat that once.

396
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.580
I just saw everybody fucking walking around thumping their chest like this was

397
00:23:56.581 --> 00:24:01.320
the greatest fucking thing ever. You know what else is funny too,

398
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.530
I really think is hilarious is um,

399
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.980
when the little kids come out and they do their dance routines,

400
00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.100
that aggressive hip hop dancing, it's the funniest shit ever to me.

401
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:12.600
Like what dancing has become.

402
00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.600
It's like you're literally sitting there like when like a little kid dance when

403
00:24:15.601 --> 00:24:20.160
I was a kid, it was cute. It was adorable. Now you just sitting there like this,

404
00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:21.900
does this kid want to fight me?

405
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.150
I think his six year old is squaring off with me.

406
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.080
This whole fucking new generation where everybody's just walking around like

407
00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:34.560
they're these gods.

408
00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:39.650
I don't know what the fuck that is about these fucking Instagram douchebags who

409
00:24:40.171 --> 00:24:44.550
are trying to be inspirational people is they're showing off their fucking abs

410
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.840
like, like they're trying to help you by showing off their beauty and their own

411
00:24:48.841 --> 00:24:53.520
success and standing in front of private jets, holding up a water cash.

412
00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.310
I just, I for the fucking life of me,

413
00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:01.260
I can't understand why that behavior isn't ridiculed and why it's actually like

414
00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:02.280
aspired to.

415
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.610
<v 3>Okay,</v>

416
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.050
<v 1>go out and get yours.</v>

417
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.540
So fucking get what?

418
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:17.720
A bunch of fucking shoes. I Dunno. Oh God. I'm just a crabby old man.

419
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:18.930
I have to tell you. Um,

420
00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:27.050
if the Cleveland Cavaliers and somehow signed a giant free agent at the level of

421
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:29.880
Kevin Durant,

422
00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.380
then I think this would be probably the greatest NBA finals ever.

423
00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.770
Cause it would be like two hall of fame fucking teams

424
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:42.150
going at it with each other. Um,

425
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.170
and then even if I, you know, I always hated that fucking,

426
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.640
you know, I, I hate the super teams as you can obviously tell,

427
00:25:51.641 --> 00:25:56.120
but at least if you have two of them going at it, then it becomes interesting.

428
00:25:56.121 --> 00:26:00.290
Like back in the day when the, uh, roided up free agent,

429
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:03.890
red sox went up against the roided up free agent Yankees.

430
00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:08.700
I know it was bad for baseball, but at least there was, I dunno,

431
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.480
there was another roided up free agency fucking team out there.

432
00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:15.700
This is just like, um, I dunno,

433
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.280
I just don't understand how you play a team that has the talent that Lebron has

434
00:26:20.281 --> 00:26:23.100
and it's like fucking child's plate because you got this other,

435
00:26:23.101 --> 00:26:27.990
this fucking juggernaut you just signed in a, I don't know,

436
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:33.630
it was weird. It was a weird feeling leaving there. So I think I've, I fucking,

437
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.070
um, I dunno. I think that was a little too long.

438
00:26:38.071 --> 00:26:39.900
I probably talked about it too long, but like,

439
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:42.960
I was so excited to go to the fucking game and then you just,

440
00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.040
it would have been nice if one warrior family like, yeah, you don't,

441
00:26:46.041 --> 00:26:49.200
it's kind of bullshit. But uh, you know, you'll, Brian did in Miami,

442
00:26:49.201 --> 00:26:53.730
so does that kind of make it okay? I mean a, Hey,

443
00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:57.750
you know, that guy touched a kid, so why can't we touch a kid? Right.

444
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.030
Doesn't it? Isn't that how it isn't how it works? Yeah. I was joking with Josh,

445
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:04.110
I got to that felt dirty

446
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.680
and then I also have to too. I absolutely fucking cannot stand the west coast,

447
00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:17.690
the west coast fucking, um, sports fan. I just cannot stand them.

448
00:27:17.691 --> 00:27:22.340
I did not hear one intelligent thing yelled during the game. I mean their,

449
00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.090
their, their commentary is different reads of, Oh shit.

450
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:27.783
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

451
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.920
<v 1>Oh that's it. Nobody fucking seems to know what's going on.</v>

452
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.610
There was one guy behind me going, oh,

453
00:27:33.611 --> 00:27:36.570
I never seen the calves come out with this lineup. Oh, they're going big.

454
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.830
There was a couple of people,

455
00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:40.260
but everybody else was just fucking mouth breathers.

456
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.760
Just waiting for the ball to go through the net to be like, oh shit,

457
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.720
they don't want no, no,

458
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.860
I'm sorry it didn't meet the fucking blow tears there. All right. I'm all right.

459
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:56.880
I'm done fucking whining about that shit. But it is bullshit. It is.

460
00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.150
I actually heard, this is what it on this fucking west coast sports fan.

461
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.920
I went into the bathroom and somebody yelled out with two championships going on

462
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:08.370
three and somebody goes two and a half. We got two and a half.

463
00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.720
I don't know if he was saying like they should've got it called a championship

464
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:15.150
last year or they were already racking this one up. Okay.

465
00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.950
Because they already fucking, we're going to win game two. I Dunno.

466
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.190
I don't fucking know. I have no, I have no idea.

467
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.230
I hope that that's what that guy was saying.

468
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.170
Do you think I shit on the whole fucking thing long enough?

469
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.480
I really didn't think it was going to go that long.

470
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.300
I'm already fucking 28 minutes in. Alright,

471
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:37.470
let's do a little bit of advertising here. Oh, by the way, uh, rest in peace,

472
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:41.800
blue apron, blue apron decided not to, uh,

473
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.680
continue advertising with me because I said, um, you know,

474
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.780
when they were re I was reading the copy, it says, you know,

475
00:28:48.781 --> 00:28:50.910
when you have fresh ingredients, food tastes better.

476
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:53.610
And it was like really fresh ingredients taste better.

477
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.420
That's the reason they're claiming that they, they, they stop, um,

478
00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.390
wanting to advertise in the podcast.

479
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.320
Not because six weeks ago I read that story where they were, you know,

480
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:09.510
going to farmer's markets, trying to box out the little man, you know,

481
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.200
I know that's what it was. I know that they just were like, well,

482
00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:15.450
we can't do it now, or he's gonna bring that shit up,

483
00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.030
that filthy shit that we allegedly did up again.

484
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.120
So we're just going to wait and we're going to wait for him to do one fucking

485
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:24.600
read that we don't like and then we're going to be out. Come on. Blue Apron.

486
00:29:24.601 --> 00:29:29.520
How dumb do you think I am? Huh? Stop going down to farm farmer's markets,

487
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:32.010
allegedly. You know,

488
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.810
do you want John Cougar? Mellencamp do you have to write another fucking song?

489
00:29:36.811 --> 00:29:39.540
Is that what the hell you going after? All right, here's our,

490
00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:42.130
here's our old friends. They don't give a how I read these, these,

491
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.650
I like these guys. This is all zip,

492
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.480
but Curtis, are you hiring? Do you know where to post your job? Well are Ya,

493

do you know where to post your job to find? You know what?

494
00:29:53.701 --> 00:29:56.130
I got to start this read over again. You know what I was just thinking.

495
00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:59.160
I bet if I turned on ESPN, you turn on ESPN.

496
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.750
You know if and when the warriors, when the championship it,

497
00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.240
I bet those fucking guys, they're not going to address it on any level.

498
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.570
<v 4>They're going to be like, Oh, where do you meet? Gay weighed 60 [inaudible].</v>

499
00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.210
Where do you put the at? You'd have various teams of all time.

500
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:18.380
I mean, even the 96 balls law's two games.

501
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:20.410
[inaudible]

502
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:24.730
<v 1>they're going to do that and they will never address of fucking ridiculous</v>

503
00:30:24.731 --> 00:30:28.330
citizen. How bad for basketball it was. That Duran left the thunder

504
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.940
just to fucking go pile on fucking pile on.

505
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.950
Anyway. Sorry. All Zip recruiter. Are you hiring bull? Are Ya,

506
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.560
is that what you're doing?

507
00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.560
Do you know where to post your job to find the best candidates?

508
00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:50.170
Talk about the challenge of finding great talent and slash or the importance of

509
00:30:50.171 --> 00:30:54.520
finding great talent to succeed to successful business. Oh, I gotta tell you,

510
00:30:54.521 --> 00:30:57.330
you know, when I walked down the street with my sandwich board going,

511
00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.490
who's talented? You know, it's really hard and I always think, you know,

512
00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:05.230
I wish there was a better way, you know, because you know, in order to win,

513
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.870
you got to fucking have all the best guys on one team.

514
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.870
So they win by 30 every night. Um, dude,

515
00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:15.640
you realize the fucking Cavaliers scored 63 or 64 points in the first half and

516
00:31:15.641 --> 00:31:18.880
they was still down by five. I mean, what are you going to do?

517
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.040
You scored 64 65 points usually up by 10 or 15.

518
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.700
How ZipRecruiter is different with ZipRecruiter. You can post, um, you know,

519
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:33.400
it's, and this is what the west coast sports fans just going to say hater.

520
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.750
That's all they got.

521
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.960
I don't know if it's cause they get up three hours later then people on the east

522
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.450
coast, but they, I know they just baked their brains in the sun,

523
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.660
but I don't know they fuck, oh, I'll tell you that rough out here. You know,

524
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.420

612
00:36:53.731 --> 00:36:55.440
let's read some questions here for this week.

613
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.840
See if I can stop talking about that fucking golden state thing. Uh, hey bill,

614
00:37:00.841 --> 00:37:05.360
would love if you would find it. I would love,

615
00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.600
I would love it if you would find it to come back to Sweden.

616
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.850
Malmo gets boring. There's too few redheads to spend my money on here.

617
00:37:13.851 --> 00:37:18.620
Thank you. All right. I feel like he was vaguely trashing me yet.

618
00:37:18.621 --> 00:37:22.220
He likes my comedy. Um, I'm definitely going to be coming back to Sweden.

619
00:37:22.221 --> 00:37:23.540
Last time I went through Europe,

620
00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:28.280
I didn't do the Scandinavians countries.

621
00:37:28.281 --> 00:37:33.080
What are the Scandinavian countries people come on? Norway, Sweden,

622
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.910
Denmark. I know there's one other one in there.

623
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.193
It's not Finland.

624
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.850
That's part of the Nordic countries that also include Scandinavia.

625
00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.203
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

626
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.360
<v 1>I can't even remember. It's been so long since I was there.</v>

627
00:37:49.361 --> 00:37:51.940
I learned that Scandinavia was like three countries and then those three

628
00:37:51.941 --> 00:37:53.410
countries are part of the Nordic countries,

629
00:37:53.411 --> 00:37:58.411
which included Finland and this little island just north of uh,

630
00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.690
Great Britain. Right. Isn't it? Something like that.

631
00:38:01.691 --> 00:38:05.710
I will definitely be back and I'll have a brand new, our few fucking blue eyed,

632
00:38:05.711 --> 00:38:10.030
blonde haired cunts and a, we'll have a great time, uh,

633
00:38:10.031 --> 00:38:13.180
from a lovely French lady.

634
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.720
Hey Bill. Uh, hello bones. Your uh,

635
00:38:19.721 --> 00:38:21.100
I just wanted to say,

636
00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.150
I just want to send a little message and hopefully have it heard that being a

637
00:38:25.151 --> 00:38:28.720
video, very video graph for myself.

638
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.500
I immensely appreciate the graphic work and details and efforts of family.

639
00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.610
I'll thank you. Such a great show on so many levels. That's it.

640
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.930
All the best to everyone involved with bill in general. And of course,

641
00:38:40.931 --> 00:38:45.220
Bill himself a French fan fan from Patty. Hey,

642
00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:48.520
guess what? French lady

643
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:57.440
Fam Della Francais, um, lady of the France, uh, of,

644
00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.350
um, the show is actually the, the, the animators is Gaumont,

645
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.970
which is in France. All right. And then of course, you know,

646
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:11.350
then they farm it out to these people. Big Jump in, in Ottawa.

647
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.280
That's how it works. But you guys are part of the mix. And I'm,

648
00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:20.281
what's great about France is if you use French animators and animation company

649
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.360
is you get a, the government gives a little bit of money. It makes it cheaper.

650
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.880
You know, it's a smart thing. It's like a Trump thing.

651
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:32.080
They try to bring fucking business, you know, into their country.

652
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:36.880
Like Trump says he wants to do as he walks away from the Paris agreement. Um,

653
00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.150
it's just a hoax climate change, not global warming anymore.

654
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:44.710
It's climate change, jets, little change in the climate. Um,

655
00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:46.710
I saw some lady on TV going like, you know, I,

656
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.820
I think it's good for this country that we do it.

657
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:52.630
And because we've always been a leader in, um, environmental issues.

658
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.530
Yes, we have been a leader fucking fucking it up the most as far as I can tell,

659
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:04.930
if I'm to believe what the scientists are saying. Oh, scientists,

660
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.830
their information. Anyways. Um, by the way,

661
00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:11.530
thank you to everybody that's watching season two, the, uh,

662
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.660
people have been loving it and uh, you know, it's a ton of Goddamn works.

663
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.060
It thank God you guys enjoyed it, uh, or have been enjoying it.

664
00:40:19.061 --> 00:40:21.970
Please tell more people to watch it. The more people you tell to watch it,

665
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.570
hopefully the more fans we get and then they'll let us do a season three.

666
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.790
Um, you know, and if not,

667
00:40:30.791 --> 00:40:32.890
I'll just have all kinds of free time in my life.

668
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.390
It's kind of a win win for me either way.

669
00:40:36.391 --> 00:40:40.090
People either I get to continue working with these great people doing this great

670
00:40:40.091 --> 00:40:44.860
show or a, I'm going to become a hell of a drama. Um,

671
00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.000
all right, well thank you so much and I can't wait to get back to, uh,

672
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.240
France at some point. Uh,

673
00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.330
just gotta wait till the little one gets a little bit bigger. Um,

674
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.000
we're actually, I'm, I or I want to do, I was talking this to Nia.

675
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:59.890
I want to get like some sort of fucking, uh, you know,

676
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.190
French person over here, right. That can, you know,

677
00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:06.410
help make my daughter's smart cause she's got to learn from somebody. I know.

678
00:41:06.411 --> 00:41:07.151
I ain't gonna be me.

679
00:41:07.151 --> 00:41:09.910
And as she feels to teach us in French and teaches us all French,

680
00:41:09.911 --> 00:41:13.990
how great would that be? My little cutie pie be over in a France speak,

681
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.230
being fluent. Huh? I'm cute with that. But you know,

682
00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:21.160
she's sitting up a by herself now. It's fucking amazing.

683
00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:23.350
She has this look on her face. She's like proud of herself.

684
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.900
It's the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life. It's just the best.

685
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:29.620
I'm telling you. It's the best. There's no material and having a kid,

686
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:34.010
there really isn't, other than your fear that something gonna happen to them.

687
00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:37.160
But I feel like that's been fucking done to death. You know what I mean?

688
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.590
Other than that, it's just, it's been fucking phenomenal. Um, okay.

689
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:47.050
Uh, F is for family. Hey Bill, I'm a big fan of your work, uh,

690
00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.590
in from Puerto Rico. Oh,

691
00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:54.120
help you top to see you perform some day here. Um,

692
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:57.750
I watched the second season of Memphis from family and is great.

693
00:41:57.751 --> 00:42:01.140
Even better than the first one. Completely hilarious. Well,

694
00:42:01.141 --> 00:42:05.040
take care and keep the good work. Keep up the good work. How would that work?

695
00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:09.750
You know, Puerto Rico is like not a state, but it's one of those,

696
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.360
yet another place that we kind of just decided was ours. Um,

697
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:19.370
if I go on stage there too, I don't know. I went on stage in Singapore.

698
00:42:19.371 --> 00:42:21.680
I didn't get caned. I'm sure I'll be all right in Puerto Rico.

699
00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.700
I'd love to fucking go there. Bring my wife. She can go to the fucking beach,

700
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:30.280
you know. Oh, I'll be there with all the lovely ladies.

701
00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.380
All those fucking j Lo's walking around. I think that would be, that. I could,

702
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.230
I could definitely be talked into that.

703
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:41.530
I go over there and tell my fucking shit jokes. I'm all right.

704
00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:46.060
Can't stop smoking cigarettes. Uh,

705
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.300
all right. Get Job on new season.

706
00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.410
Get job on the new season of F is for family.

707
00:42:53.411 --> 00:42:55.510
I'm halfway through and it's hilarious.

708
00:42:55.511 --> 00:43:00.511
I've been smoking for seven years now I'm 22 and I can't stop smoking.

709
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.710
Uh, it's really starting to affect my health and I'm sick of it.

710
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.080
I quit boozing and smoking weed,

711
00:43:08.081 --> 00:43:12.360
but I've never been able to quit smoking cigarettes. All right.

712
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.480
And what the fuck? How do I help you do this? I tried to replace it with weed,

713
00:43:15.481 --> 00:43:19.380
but it just makes me want to smoke a cigarette after alcohol gives me cravings

714
00:43:19.381 --> 00:43:23.400
too. You used to smoke cigars, so maybe you've got some good tips.

715
00:43:23.401 --> 00:43:27.060
I still smoke cigars to help me quit. By the way. She a,

716
00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:29.340
you should come to Minneapolis soon and play a show.

717
00:43:29.341 --> 00:43:32.950
Check out the new Vikings stadium. It's amazing. Um,

718
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.140
let's see you guys. Yeah. Near the twin stadium is amazing.

719
00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:40.780
You guys are doing are right up there as the wilds.

720
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:46.150
The last time I went to a, I went to, what are you at at,

721
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.170
at the Timberwolves game?

722
00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.930
Kevin Garnett was still there and you played in the target center and that was a

723
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.260
shit hole. Um, all right,

724
00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.950
well they say quitting cigarettes is as hard as quitting heroin. So,

725
00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:02.430
um, I dunno, I,

726
00:44:02.431 --> 00:44:04.740
I would try to get professional help.

727
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.030
I am so happy I never started doing that. And, um,

728
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.270
you know, I don't, I like, I used to smoke cigars like, you know,

729
00:44:14.271 --> 00:44:16.790
once every like four days or something like that. Now I smoke,

730
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:21.030
I'm like once every two weeks, sometimes three weeks.

731
00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:22.980
And I really don't have the craving to do it.

732
00:44:22.981 --> 00:44:26.830
I kind of wait for like the right time to do it.

733
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.410
Like riding in a car to go over to the NBA finals that felt like, yeah,

734
00:44:31.411 --> 00:44:34.380
this is a cigar fucking moment. Um,

735
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.950
but the way I was doing it before, it was just like fucking, you know,

736
00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.250
every guy, Dan couple of days, like, you know,

737
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:45.900
having a humor and all that type of stuff, you can really just, I dunno.

738
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:50.760
Um, I, I still think I smoked too many of them and, um,

739
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:52.353
<v 2>yeah,</v>

740
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.840
<v 1>I don't eat right when I'm on the road and I drink too much when I'm on the road</v>

741
00:44:55.841 --> 00:44:59.260
and it's something I have a personally I have to stop doing that.

742
00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:05.320
Um, I, and you know what it is, it's really,

743
00:45:05.321 --> 00:45:08.200
I find it's just developing, I know people say this,

744
00:45:08.201 --> 00:45:12.610
but it's just developing new habits. Like a, you know,

745
00:45:12.611 --> 00:45:14.800
if you're eating shit food, you crave shit food.

746
00:45:14.801 --> 00:45:19.090
If you're eating salads and good stuff, you crave that. And um,

747
00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.020
I dunno, I'm a creature of habit. If it's just like every night, you know,

748
00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.060
we're going out and we're having drinks after the show, it just became,

749
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.500
it just your body's like, oh, now we do this, it's in like this routine.

750
00:45:29.501 --> 00:45:34.150
So you Kinda have to force yourself to break up your routine. Um,

751
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.010
and I think you just have to make a decision that you're going to be stronger

752
00:45:38.011 --> 00:45:42.600
than it, you know, unless you have like some sort of, you know,

753
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.820
<v 2>yeah.</v>

754
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.540
<v 1>Super Addictive, like personality, like those people.</v>

755
00:45:47.541 --> 00:45:50.330
And you've got to go into the doctor drew house or some shit like that. I mean,

756
00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:52.040
I don't know what your deal is, but I would definitely,

757
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:56.450
I would seek professional help. Um, all right.

758
00:45:56.451 --> 00:45:59.840
VIP airline. Hey Bill. That airline with the hot air

759
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:07.060
hostesses, um, exist. It only flies between Paris and New York. Oh,

760
00:46:07.061 --> 00:46:08.620
I was talking about a VIP airline.

761
00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:11.650
We don't have to go on with people that are going to take the shoes off and put

762
00:46:11.651 --> 00:46:13.300
their feet up over the Goddamn,

763
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.193
<v 2>um,</v>

764
00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:20.770
<v 1>you know, sticking between your fucking, what do they do?</v>

765
00:46:20.771 --> 00:46:22.900
The sticking between your fucking arm rest and that type of thing.

766
00:46:22.901 --> 00:46:25.420
Just those God damn animals. They should just have a first class one.

767
00:46:25.421 --> 00:46:28.750
They should have animal airlines and then fucking raised right airlines.

768
00:46:28.751 --> 00:46:30.400
So he's saying there is a VIP airline,

769
00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:33.430
but it only flies between Paris and New York. It's only business class.

770
00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:38.230
They give you iPods, feed you chef made food and plenty of good French wine.

771
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.310
The tickets aren't even that expensive. Um,

772
00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:45.280
treat Nia to a holiday. Best from France. Well,

773
00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:46.810
what's the name of the fucking airline?

774
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.740
You got to give me the name of the airline dude. Ah, now I gotta look it up. Oh,

775
00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:53.420
hey. I gotta tell you I'd look up, you know. Well,

776
00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:58.600
I got time to fucking do this with my internet even work fucking scam that that

777
00:46:58.601 --> 00:47:03.100
is all right. Uh, the I P airline,

778
00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.470
New York to Paris. Come on.

779
00:47:08.471 --> 00:47:12.820
What do you say? Let's say American Airlines, New York to Paris flights,

780
00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.780
Air France. The companion

781
00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:22.270
discovered Paris was a unique for all business class airline. I found it.

782
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.550
<v 2>Okay.</v>

783
00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:30.090
<v 1>It's La, c o m p a g N, I e. Dot Com.</v>

784
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:31.923
<v 2>Um,</v>

785
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.300
<v 1>1800 bucks, dude. You said it was a thousand.</v>

786
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.760
I want to see some pictures here. Plenty trip to Paris.

787
00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:48.570
Oh Wow. Okay. I'm, I'm impressed with their little terminal there.

788
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:54.220
My company. No, dude, I live in La. I live in La,

789
00:47:54.221 --> 00:47:56.290
so I'm not gonna fucking connect through New York.

790
00:47:56.830 --> 00:47:58.300
I'm just going to say fuck it.

791
00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:04.150
Use all my miles and uh, jump on a plane. Okay. For whatever in New York.

792
00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:06.220
That'd be a nice thing to do. Maybe if I'm doing a Gig in New York,

793
00:48:06.221 --> 00:48:10.210
then afterwards we can just go fly out a dad. It's a good idea. God dammit.

794
00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.460
That's a good fucking idea. Who knows? Maybe it's,

795
00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:19.150
I'll ask the wife about that one. You know what I mean? You know that works. Oh,

796
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:22.290
that was a question I wanted to ask Jerry. I forgot to do. I wanted to ask him,

797
00:48:22.291 --> 00:48:22.451
do,

798
00:48:22.451 --> 00:48:26.290
can you just come home with a new Porsche or do you have to clear it with your

799
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:29.530
wife? You know, can you get to a fucking like,

800
00:48:29.531 --> 00:48:32.920
can you just look at it and be like, dude, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. You know,

801
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.120
look around your house. You like this, this, this, this echo echo.

802
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:42.430
Um, all right. Heart surgeon busted for filming. Me taking a piss.

803
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.753
<v 2>What?</v>

804
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:50.990
<v 1>Bear dear Billy. Take tits. I got the fuck that mean.</v>

805
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:55.420
That's hilarious. I heard this story on your podcast last week.

806
00:48:55.880 --> 00:49:00.700
This fucking phone keeps vibrating. This whole podcast. The phone Fart,

807
00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:06.240
Wayne. Oh, what the fuck is all of this stuff?

808
00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:11.020
Oh, Jesus Christ. Alright, here we go.

809
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.980
I heard this story on your podcast last week about the Oxford students stabbing

810
00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:18.610
her boyfriend in the leg with a butter knife and how she was led off easy

811
00:49:18.611 --> 00:49:20.590
despite her psychotic actions.

812
00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.670
I have a similar story that involved myself a little while ago.

813
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:29.560
I'm a musician and was playing a solo gig near some markets in the popular

814
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:34.900
popular part of Brisbane. Where the fuck is that? I've been there.

815
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.170
Oh, that's Australia. Ah, Australia. Huh? That was the next thing.

816
00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.150
Let me sit calm. I went to the next, uh, page fucking hilarious.

817
00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:47.890
During one of my breaks, I went to take a leak in the public amenities.

818
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:50.051
Uh,

819
00:49:50.051 --> 00:49:53.980
I was doing my business in one of the stalls when suddenly I noticed an iPhone

820
00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:57.160
slowly coming over the top of my stall to my left.

821
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.910
I can only see half of the phone, but could tell the camera was going.

822
00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:05.320
Obviously it took me by surprise and for about two seconds my head went through

823
00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:09.940
a does not compute mode. I was only halfway through taking a piss. I said,

824
00:50:09.941 --> 00:50:14.650
what the fuck? Out Loud. When I heard the stall next to mine open very quickly,

825
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:18.280
I looked behind me and saw short, possibly Asian guy running.

826
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:22.960
I tried to stop mid Piss, very difficult, adjusted myself, quickly,

827
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:27.961
ran and ran out after him only to find hundreds of people through the markets.

828
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.390
I couldn't see him anywhere. I was infuriated. It was infuriating.

829
00:50:32.391 --> 00:50:34.490
My first thought was, oh great,

830
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.840
now I'm going to be uploaded to some quote. I love public pissing.

831
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.170
Dot Khan porn site. Uh,

832
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.430
I was really fucking pissed off, no pun intended from this guy evidently,

833
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:50.030
but kind of glad I didn't catch it because I probably would have dragged him by

834
00:50:50.031 --> 00:50:54.170
the balls to the police and then they would charge me for his salt.

835
00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.040
I don't think you would because it's a guy to guy a physical confrontation and

836
00:51:00.711 --> 00:51:04.460
on his phone there would be your Dick. Anyways,

837
00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.900
a few days later I was telling my friend what had happened and he said that he

838
00:51:08.901 --> 00:51:13.550
heard about an Asian German national being caught filming seven men in the

839
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:17.240
public toilets in the same area and he found the article online.

840
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:22.241
So it turns out this 26 year old guy's a trainee heart surgeon on holiday in

841
00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:27.620
Australia celebrating his graduation from medical school. Here's the article.

842
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:33.140
What the fuck? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Well,

843
00:51:33.141 --> 00:51:36.590
at least he doesn't work on somebody fucking urinary tract him and he's,

844
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.800
he's, he's uh, he at least had enough discipline to be like, listen,

845
00:51:42.801 --> 00:51:45.290
I can't be near the Dick area. I don't trust myself to,

846
00:51:45.291 --> 00:51:48.800
he's up by the fucking hat. Um,

847
00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:54.230
okay. This, this article is slowly but surely opening. What, what is the,

848
00:51:54.231 --> 00:51:55.370
what is going on in the world?

849
00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:59.960
The judge went easy on him and didn't record a conviction because of his

850
00:51:59.961 --> 00:52:03.370
promising career. What the fuck?

851
00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.200
I guess if you're a doctor you can get away with anything. What the fuck.

852
00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.570
So just because you're an elite student in this world,

853
00:52:08.571 --> 00:52:12.200
you get let off easy for doing really fucked up things.

854
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.260
Apparently none of the other men filmed or aware of what he was doing.

855
00:52:15.261 --> 00:52:17.360
So I called the police in the area. He was caught.

856
00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.630
They asked me to describe what I was wearing at the time, blah, blah, blah.

857
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:25.040
And said the phone was confiscated, the footage was deleted. I fucking hope so.

858
00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:28.190
They also act. I was him saying that. I just gave it a great read,

859
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:31.040
so it sounded like me. If I could pat myself on the back.

860
00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:35.540
They also asked if I wanted to press charges. I said, fuck yes.

861
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:41.330
The cop I spoke to said he would pay the pervert a visit very soon to lay the

862
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:44.270
charges as the guy was due to leave the country in two days.

863
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.330
I called back on the day he was supposed to leave the country,

864
00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:50.570
but the cops said they wouldn't won't be pressing charges because they had

865
00:52:50.571 --> 00:52:55.571
already been laid by the arresting officer and that the student had received a

866
00:52:56.961 --> 00:52:59.690
conviction. Even though the article said he hadn't weird,

867
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:03.140
but apparently he will never be able to enter Australia again for the rest of

868
00:53:03.141 --> 00:53:03.974
his life.

869
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:07.100
I just think it's so fucked up that these people can get away with such

870
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.180
disgraceful actions,

871
00:53:08.181 --> 00:53:12.620
especially someone like this heart surgeon who could potentially be playing with

872
00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:15.290
some poor guy's balls as he lays under the anesthetic.

873
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:17.240
I'd love to hear your thoughts. Well,

874
00:53:17.241 --> 00:53:20.750
they kind of have the guy in check because heart surgery, you need other people.

875
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.280
Um, oh, here's the guy. German Torres

876
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.870
Ludi Tran was fine. 800 bucks sounds like about a hundred dollars a dick.

877
00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.633
<v 0>Okay.</v>

878
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:42.120
<v 1>After pleading guilty to several seven counts.</v>

879
00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:47.040
Oh seven counts, seven and 800 site. I just, I don't know,

880
00:53:47.041 --> 00:53:48.570
but 115 [inaudible] yeah,

881
00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:51.880
but on a 15 bucks a whack or something like that on a 12 bucks, I dunno.

882
00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.680
A count of recording in breach of privacy.

883
00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.810
A trainee heart surgery. Okay. This guy, 26, a German national,

884
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:04.890
Jesus Christ, even fucking Asians, if they go to Germany,

885
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:07.920
they becomes sex perverts. I thought it was just the Germans.

886
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:12.950
What is it with that country? They just ended the pea in, in the shit.

887
00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:17.100
And what the fuck is going on over there? Um,

888
00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.440
<v 0>okay.</v>

889
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.500
<v 1>So he's fine. Uh, 800 bucks.</v>

890
00:54:21.501 --> 00:54:24.440
It's a pleading guilty to the Brisbane magistrates and Saturday on seven concert

891
00:54:24.441 --> 00:54:27.710
recording and breach of privacy. The court heard.

892
00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:31.400
Lee had been in Australia for a month to celebrate his recent graduation from

893
00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:35.240
medical school when he was, when he filmed the naked men on Friday.

894
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.800
Lee Film seven men in the space of three hours by holding his iPhone over the

895
00:54:39.801 --> 00:54:44.390
wall of the neighboring cubicle. None of the men realize they were being filmed,

896
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:48.380
but his behavior drew the attention of South Bank security.

897
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:51.110
Who contacted police. Lee was arrested.

898
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.660
The police found the video of the men on his phone acting magistrate Bob Blah.

899
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:59.270
Describe his ass actions. It's disgusting. The fences of disgusting.

900
00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.460
The offenses are disgusting offenses involving a serious breach of the privacy

901
00:55:04.461 --> 00:55:05.570
of other adult males.

902
00:55:05.571 --> 00:55:09.110
I can only assume the offending was for sexual gratification purposes.

903
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:12.670
Um, Lee's lawyer, Kate McCarthy,

904
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:17.330
has said her client had been accepted into cardiology unit in Germany and would

905
00:55:17.331 --> 00:55:21.740
fly home on January 12th is a very promising career ahead of him. She said,

906
00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.320
she said her client was ashamed of his actions,

907
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:28.130
but asking that a conviction not be recorded against him because it could

908
00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.490
jeopardize his career and ability to travel. Mr Schubert.

909
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:37.030
Finally $800 and did not record a conviction. Wow, man.

910
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.030
Uh, you know, that's fucked up. That's really fucked up.

911
00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:42.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

912
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:45.870
<v 1>That's really fucked up. And am I crazy to think that because he's,</v>

913
00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:52.960
these actions are against men, you know,

914
00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:57.010
some atmos do a, it's just not as serious. I don't think, you know,

915
00:55:57.011 --> 00:56:01.460
I just think that's, I dunno either people like, Eh, you know,

916
00:56:01.461 --> 00:56:05.410
they think it's funny. Like if this is the thing, if a,

917
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:10.530
if a woman told another woman that's some woman I guess was filming and they'd

918
00:56:10.571 --> 00:56:13.210
be like, what the fuck am I banging away? Maybe because it was a woman though,

919
00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.690
but last week was a woman she had and she stabbed the guy with the knife.

920
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:18.570
<v 0>Okay.</v>

921
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:21.210
<v 1>Maybe it isn't any of these issues. Maybe this is just, if you're listening,</v>

922
00:56:21.211 --> 00:56:25.450
if you want to get away with shit and you don't want to be a banker or be the in

923
00:56:25.451 --> 00:56:28.570
an insurance company, then I would say get into the,

924
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.420
have a promising medical career front of you.

925
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:36.010
Evidently that just absolves you of everything that's really upsetting.

926
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.231
Um, all right, let's,

927
00:56:38.231 --> 00:56:42.220
let's you want to you and the only way to follow up that upsetting story is the

928
00:56:42.221 --> 00:56:45.490
only thing I know that's more upsetting than somebody filming another man peeing

929
00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:50.440
without him knowing is me reading out loud helix. Everybody. Hey Alex,

930

Talk like everybody else shared Jack our sleep like anyone else.

933
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.710
So why is your mattress one size fits all?

934
00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.780
What army movie is that from your mother's, Oh, not here anymore.

I'm going to teach you how to walk, talk, show, share lock,

United States, Marine Corps. Um,

937
00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:20.640
because a truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks until

938
00:57:21.311 --> 00:57:25.210

939

they've been out playing the penguins at at least two out of the three games.

So maybe they'll tie it up and maybe someone like myself will get what I want,

I have to be honest with you. So no jokes or anything.

1030
01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:55.310
Thank you guys for watching it. Uh,

1031
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:59.940
please continue to tell people about it and um, cause we already have cease.

1032
01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:01.530
We know we want to do in season three.

1033
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:05.010
We just have to wait for Netflix to give us the green light and they give us to

1034
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.640
greenlight by you guys watching it and talking about it online,

1035
01:03:08.641 --> 01:03:13.530
which you guys are doing. So I can't thank you enough. And um, and that's it.

1036
01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:15.570
Thank you to everybody at cluster fest. I had a great time.

1037
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:18.570
Thank you to the city of San Francisco. Uh,

1038
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.900
thank you to the warriors for still playing in the Oracle, you know?

1039
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:23.410
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1040
01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:24.910
<v 1>Great. Fucking old. Oh, you know what's funny,</v>

1041
01:03:24.911 --> 01:03:29.050
when I did that Seinfeld interview, I s I jokingly said that this,

1042
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.320
this venue feels like an old ABA arena and evidently the Old San Francisco

1043
01:03:34.331 --> 01:03:38.980
warriors used to play there. So I felt pretty good about calling that one.

1044
01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:42.610
Um, all right. [inaudible] you're overstaying your welcome. Okay.

1045
01:03:42.611 --> 01:03:46.300
Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday and that's it.

1046
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:48.010
Let's go calves. Come on, man.

1047
01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:54.650
If you beat the fucking warriors with all their cool drum malls that they added

1048
01:03:55.291 --> 01:03:58.590
all of that fucking Juggernaut of a Goddamn team walking around,

1049
01:03:58.591 --> 01:04:03.160
thumping themselves in the chest as if what they're doing. I've,

1050
01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.710
I've said this for fucking ever,

1051
01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:08.250
and I'll say the last time when you were a little kid on the playground and you

1052
01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.360
were choosing up teams, even little kids knew when it was getting to,

1053
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.500
when it was not on, on how I this, this is not going to this,

1054
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:18.510
there's no competition here. Even as kids, you knew this,

1055
01:04:20.550 --> 01:04:22.470
the warriors are doing right now,

1056
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:25.470
they're doing something that even children know are wrong.

1057
01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:28.440
Even children would break that up. You know, I really think it is.

1058
01:04:28.441 --> 01:04:30.930
I think stern left the NBA. Maybe that's what it is.

1059
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.270
Maybe he would have stepped in. Who knows?

1060
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:38.220
I always thought that that guy was shady. Um, I do know this. Without a doubt,

1061
01:04:38.221 --> 01:04:43.221
Cleveland's going to win a fucking game because the NBA does not make money as

1062
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.770
nearly as much money on a four game series versus five, six, seven.

1063
01:04:46.771 --> 01:04:48.060
So at some point,

1064
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:51.510
I'm looking for them to fucking just start calling everything on the warriors.

1065
01:04:51.511 --> 01:04:55.530
But then again, I am a fucking conspiracy theory. Fucking freak. Um,

1066
01:04:56.850 --> 01:04:59.280
I don't know. I still feel like the cavs not played the best game yet.

1067
01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.860
All right. I'm going to say they're going to win game three. Fuck it.

1068
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:05.730
I'm putting it out there. Alright, go fuck yourselves. I'll see you on Thursday.
