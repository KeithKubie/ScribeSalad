THAT'S -- THE "CHARLIE HEBDO"

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.036 size:88% position:44% line:85%
MASSACRE, PARIS. THAT WAS --

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:42.141 line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH WELL THAT, TOO, BUT I WAS
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE BAGA

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:44.777 align:start position:0% line:91%

NIGERIA.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.813 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.648 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAGA AND DORON BAGA.

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.918 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE THOSE NIGERIAN SATIRICAL
MAGAZINES? I DON'T --

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.120 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, THEY'RE TOWNS, JON.

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.288 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELL, THEY WERE TOWNS.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.756 line:91%
BOKO HARAM DESTROYED THEM AND
KILLED THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:57.824 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES!

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.324 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOKO HARAM.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:00.626 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'VE HEARD OF THEM.

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.794 align:start position:0% line:91%
HASHTAG BRING BACK OUR GIRLS.
YES?

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.895 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:04.897 size:81% position:41% line:85%
WELL, HASHTAG THEY DIDN'T.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.737 line:91%
IN FACT, SINCE THEN, BOKO HARAM
HAS CAPTURED AN AREA THE SIZE OF

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:12.271 align:start position:0% line:85%
SLOVAKIA.

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.373 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S TWO SLOVENIAS.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.843 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S NINE MILLION AMERICAN
FOOTBALL FIELDS.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.777 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP )!

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:18.945 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S A LOT OF AREA.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:19.979 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DID NOT REALIZE.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.115 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, AND YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE, JON.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:27.253 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT A SINGLE HEAD OF STATE WENT
TO NIGERIA AFTER THE

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.322 align:start position:0% line:91%
JANUARY ATTACKS, NOT EVEN OBAMA,
AND HE'S AFRICAN.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:31.257 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELL, WELL, WELL
-- HE'S NOT -- AFRICAN AMERICAN.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.726 size:81% position:41% line:85%
HE WAS NOT BORN IN AFRICA.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.527 align:start position:0% line:85%
BORN IN HAWAII.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.562 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:37.563 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.564 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
I GOT YOU.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:39.832 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GOT YOU.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.768 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT. WELL, IF IT
MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:43.936 align:start position:0% line:91%
OBAMA DIDN'T GO TO
PARIS, EITHER.

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.373 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, BUT AT LEAST YOU COULD
HAVE SENT US JAMES TAYLOR.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.007 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT?

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.975 size:88% position:44% line:85%
AFRICA DOESN'T GET A FRIEND?

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.411 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon:  SETTLE FOR PAUL

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.579 align:start position:0% line:85%
SIMON?

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:56.482 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OH, OKAY BUT ONLY IF HE
PROMISES NOT TO STEAL OUR MUSIC.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:00.353 line:85%
HASHTAG BRING BACK OUR SONGS.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:05.024 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK, JON, IN FRANCE, 1.6
MILLION PEOPLE MARCHED FOR 12

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.225 size:88% position:44% line:85%
CARTOONISTS, WHICH IS GREAT.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:08.861 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT BY THAT MATH, THE WHOLE
WORLD SHOULD HAVE BEEN MARCHING

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:09.995 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN NIGERIA.

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.933 size:88% position:44% line:91%
LIKE SOMETIMES IT JUST FEELS
LIKE AFRICA IS THE VEGAS OF

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.636 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
ISLAMIC TERROR -- WHAT HAPPENS
IN AFRICA STAYS IN AFRICA.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.572 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT WAS A
TREMENDOUS ACCENT.

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:22.441 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.443 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELL, YOU KNOW,
DOESN'T IT STAY IN AFRICA?

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:27.013 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, DOES IT REALLY AFFECT US
HERE? I MEAN --

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.147 line:85%
&gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'D THINK THAT, JON.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.283 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE UNDERWEAR
BOMBER?

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.417 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE WAS NIGERIAN.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.551 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  OH, RIGHT.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND BECAUSE OF HIM, YOU KNOW,
NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO WEAR

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.356 line:85%
UNDERWEAR ON AIRPLANES NOW.

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:41.027 line:85%
&gt;&gt; I-- I THINK YOU ARE.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.963 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  BETTER SAFE THAN
SORRY IS WHAT I WOULD SAY.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:47.066 line:91%
THE POINT IS THIS, "CHARLIE
HEBDO" WAS A DIRECT ATTACK ON

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.669 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUR WESTERN VALUES OF FREE
SPEECH AND EXPRESSION.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.337 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.841 line:91%
AND BOKO HARAM LITERALLY MEANS
WESTERN EDUCATION IS FORBIDDEN.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.042 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  REALLY?

00:02:57.075 --> 00:03:00.346 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU SEE, JON, WE'RE FIGHTING
THE SAME TERRORISM, SO NEXT

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
TIME, JUST INCLUDE US IN YOUR
MARCHES.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.753 align:start position:0% line:91%
NIGERIAN SCHOOL GIRLS USE
PENCILS, TOO, SO YOU DON'T EVEN

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:08.954 size:78% position:39% line:85%
HAVE TO CHANGE THE PROPS.

00:03:08.987 --> 00:03:11.991 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU KNOW, WE'D LOVE
TO, TREVOR, HONESTLY, THE STATES

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:16.262 line:91%
WOULD LOVE TO, BUT OUR GLOBAL
WAR ON TERROR CALENDAR IS SO

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:19.465 line:91%
FULL BETWEEN THE ISIS, THEY'RE
TRYING TO SET UP A CALIPHATE

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND -- 
&gt;&gt; YEAH, AND SO IS BOKO HARAM.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.803 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY KIDNAP PEOPLE, THEY SELL
THEM INTO SLAVERY.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.638 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT'S PRETTY ISIS-ISH.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.473 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;  YEAH. THEY WEAR THESE
COSTUMES.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.108 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  HOLY ( BLEEP ).

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.877 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ISIS-ISH.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.679 size:78% position:39% line:85%
THAT'S LIKE ISIS COUTURE.

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:35.414 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH. ARAB SPRING COLLECTION,
IN FACT.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:38.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NICE.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:39.418 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY EVEN HAVE THE SAME FLAG,
JON.

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:42.588 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEY HAVE THE SAME FLAG?

00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:43.689 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S JUST LAZY.

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:47.927 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SEE, JON, BOKO
HARAM IS BLACK ISIS.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.464 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT SOUNDS LIKE
THE MOST AWESOME PAM GRIER MOVIE

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:52.331 align:start position:0% line:85%
EVER.

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, JON, BOKO HARAM

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:59.605 align:start position:0% line:91%
MUST FEEL LIKE TYLER PERRY--
HUGE NUMBERS BUT NO RECOGNITION.

00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:00.806 align:start position:0% line:85%
( LAUGHTER )

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:04.443 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  LOOK, TREVOR, I GET

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:05.811 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:10.249 line:91%
THAT'S TOO BAD BECAUSE IF BOKO
HARAM IS NOT STOPPED THEY MIGHT

00:04:10.282 --> 00:04:13.452 align:start position:0% line:91%
TAKE OVER NIGERIA'S OIL FIELDS?
AND --

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: EH, EH, EH -- NIGERIA'S
WHAT NOW?

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WELL, OIL.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:21.227 align:start position:0% line:91%
NIGERIA HAS THE WORLD'S TENTH
BIGGEST OIL RESERVES,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.828 align:start position:0% line:85%
37 BILLION BARRELS.

00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:26.465 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S FUNNY.

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:29.802 size:78% position:39% line:91%

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.912 align:start position:0% line:91%
PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE JAMES TAYLOR

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:47.086 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS CALL AND
