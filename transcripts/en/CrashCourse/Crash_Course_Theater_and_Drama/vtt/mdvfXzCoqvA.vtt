00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.870
Bonjour, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Theater, and bienvenue to our second

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.070
episode set in France: French Renaissance
2: The Renaissancening.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.760
Today, we’re taking a closer look at theater
architecture in Renaissance France, company

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.420
organization, and the status of actors.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.560
And remember all of those neoclassical rules
from the last time?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.099
Today we’ll meet a guy who broke a bunch
of them: the hilarious, possibly incestuous,

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.540
much-buried comic writer Jean-Baptiste Poquelin,
better known as Molière.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.579
We’ll look at his most controversial play
Tartuffe, and also the play that killed him.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:46.680
So grab your baguette, and let’s go.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.579
INTRO
The first French theaters weren’t purpose-built…

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.370
for theater.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.470
Most were former tennis courts.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.289
Really, really large tennis courts.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.510
But in 1548, the main producer of mystery
plays, the Confrerie de la Passion, decided

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.860
to build a permanent home, the Hotel de Bourgogne.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.610
The government outlawed mystery plays that
same year, though, so the Confrerie accidentally

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.250
ended up owning a secular theater.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.750
It consisted of a pit or parterre below and
a bunch of galleries and boxes above, the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.060
highest of them called the paradis, because
it was so close to heaven.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.150
Get it?

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.400
In 1634 the Theatre du Marais was built, on
the site of a former tennis court, no less.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.810
It burned down, and a nicer version was built
in 1644.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.730
So the Hotel de Bourgogne had to get nicer,
too.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.180
At first, these theaters were built assuming
medieval style scenery, not all that fancy

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.740
Italian chariot and pole stuff, but they got
there eventually.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.890
The government didn’t allow a theater troupe
to settle permanently in Paris until 1629,

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.520
so in the early years, the Confrerie rented
the theater to some of the hundreds of touring

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.670
companies who just happened to be passing
through.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.770
The repertory, then, mostly consisted of medieval
farces, classical adaptations, and foreign

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.869
plays, plus a handful of new French pastorals
and tragedies when they got lucky.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.250
In 1629, the king allowed the Troupe Royale
to settle in at the Hotel de Bourgogne.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.280
And in 1643 another company was allowed to
take over the Theatre du Marais.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.190
They were joined in 1658 by Molière’s company,
the Theatre de Monsieur.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.680
So - now that theaters have actors, who went
to go see those actors at their theaters?

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.230
Well, everyone!

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.780
Though women usually wore masks.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.320
Like London, performances took place in the
afternoons.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.210
Unlike London, the snack bar sold macarons.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.660
C’est magnifique!

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.770
Nobles were sometime seated on the edge of
the stage, scandalously close to the working

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.620
men standing in the pit.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.280
Companies usually consisted of eight to twelve
actors, plus a couple of apprentices, and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.430
every member shared some of the proceeds.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.290
After 1607 women performed as well.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.520
The status of actors remained dicey, but in
1641 superfan Louis XIII issued a proclamation

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.220
saying that actors should be really, really
careful not to perform anything immoral or

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.290
indecent.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.500
But as long as they avoided lewdness, “we
desire that their occupation, which is capable

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.150
of providing innocent diversion for our people
from certain blameworthy activities, shall

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.260
not be held to their discredit, nor prejudice
their reputation.”

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.410
Isn’t it nice when acting isn’t criminalized?

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.850
I think it’s nice when acting isn’t criminalized.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.250
But, that still doesn’t change the church’s
habit of denying actors baptism, marriage

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.930
or Christian burial.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.440
We’ve come a long way, I guess.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.150
Still plenty far to go, though.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.920
As Louis XIII’s proclamation suggests, his
successor Louis XIV, and their chief ministers

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.470
loved theater and made France the performing
arts vanguard of the late Renaissance.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.960
Richelieu was such a fan that he had a theater
built into his own house, the Palais Cardinal,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.740
and made sure there was plenty of Italianate
scenery to fill it.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.930
But even before Richelieu’s time, the court
went big for royal entries, processions, festivals

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.600
and masques, called ballets de cour.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.640
Remember those really expensive and elaborate
masques that sort of bankrupted England and

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.240
helped bring about the Civil War?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.099
Charles picked up the habit in France.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.900
Louis XIV loved masques.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.030
When Versailles was being built, he sponsored
one called “Pleasures of the Enchanted Island.”

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.100
And It lasted three days.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.730
Around this time, opera also came into vogue,
courtesy of composer Jean-Baptiste Lully.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.710
Other kinds of theater weren’t as fancy.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.650
French comedy was mostly a mix of medieval
farce and ancient sources with jokes borrowed

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.230
from touring Italian commedia dell’arte
players.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.600
In the seventeenth century, a popular homegrown
troupe emerged consisting of the actor-writers

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.400
Turlupin, Gros-Guillaume, and Gaultier-Garguille.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760
Obviously these are stage names.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.139
No one names their kid “Fat William.”

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.139
Or Turlupin.

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.220
Gaultier played old men, Gros-Guillaume played
fat men, Turlupin played wily servants.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.050
They became so popular that they had to play
two shows a day in their temporary theater,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.890
which upset the more respectable actors at
the Hotel de Bourgogne.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.620
Those actors appealed to Richelieu.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.470
He went and saw the comedians and decided
... they were funny!

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.730
They should join the Bourgogne’s Troupe
Royale!

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.730
And that went pretty well until Gros-Guillaume
made fun of a magistrate… and then was thrown

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.410
into jail… and died.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.150
Such is the world Molière arrives in—stock
characters, ancient sources, and fat jokes.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.060
Molière used them all, but also created something
new: contemporary comedies tweaking the morals

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.250
and manners of the French bourgeoisie—the
very people who were his audience.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.220
Molière was born in 1622 and well educated.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.570
When he left school his dad gave him a position
at court: the keeper of the king’s carpets

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.930
and upholstered furniture.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.930
Very Fancy.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.040
But Molière gave it all up to become ... an
actor.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.210
When he was twenty-one, he ran off with the
actress Madeline Bejart and they founded the

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.970
Illustre Theatre.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.380
They toured for a couple years before going
bankrupt.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.430
Molière went to prison for a day.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.380
Someone paid the debt, and then the troupe
went back to touring.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.270
Molière founded a new company, picked up
a couple of patrons, and started writing farces

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.250
that gently mocked French manners.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.669
He arrived in Paris in 1658, and impressed
the king – who gave his troupe the title

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.880
Troupe de Monsieur and let them share a palace
theater with a commedia company.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.270
And how did Molière celebrate?

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.790
He wrote Les Precieuses Ridicules, a play
that made fun of the Academie Francaise.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.290
It probably won’t shock you to learn that
Molière was not into the neoclassical rules.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.900
Molière spent most of his life in hot water.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.840
He wrote School for Wives, a comedy about
an old man who tries to marry his young ward.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.440
When people called it immoral, he wrote The
Critique of the School for Wives, a play that

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.330
mocked those objections and the people who
made them.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.720
A group called the Devots objected to the
naughtiness of the plays and their realism,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.639
but the king was a fan, and even gave Molière
a pension.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.670
And when the original palace theater was torn
down, the king hooked Molière up with another

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.700
palace theater.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.970
Scholars have divided Molière’s comedies
into comedies of manners, character, and farces.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.290
Molière wouldn’t have understood his output
this way, but some of his plays lean heavily

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.490
on the stock characters we’ve come to know
and love.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:16.020
Others, while still funny, have greater psychological
depth and are more closely attuned to contemporary

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.060
French society.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.940
Molière’s comedy wasn’t based on exaggeration
or wild coincidence—I’m looking at you,

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.940
Plautus.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.030
He believed that the duty of comedy was to
hold a mirror up to life, a mirror that involved

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.280
some extremely witty dialogue.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.240
“You haven’t achieved anything in comedy
unless your portraits can be seen to be living

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.570
types,” he said.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:42.330
One of Molière’s best-loved and most scandalous
plays is the 1664 comedy Tartuffe or L’Imposteur!

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.389
Hold up that mirror, Thoughtbubble:
We meet Orgon, a bourgeois dad who has recently

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:50.810
fallen under the sway of Tartuffe, a holy
man.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.039
Actually, Tartuffe isn’t a holy man: he’s
a con man, and everyone in Orgon’s family

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:59.120
realizes this but Orgon, and his mother.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.020
Orgon believes Tartuffe and decides to give
him his daughter, Mariane.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.870
Mariane is not psyched.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.030
Tartuffe also convinces Orgon to disinherit
and banish his son, Damis.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.479
Orgon’s family tries to get him to see through
Tartuffe, but they’re unsuccessful.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:19.910
Elmire, Orgon’s clever wife, convinces Orgon
to hide under the table while Tartuffe tries

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.490
to seduce her.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:27.330
Finally Orgon realizes Tartuffe is a fraud,
but Tartuffe gets hold of some incriminating

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.000
letters and has Orgon kicked out of his own
house and accused of treason.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.019
It seems like it’s all going to end badly,
but somehow Louis XIV hears about Tartuffe’s

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:39.990
duplicity and arranges to have him arrested.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.079
Rex ex machina!

00:08:41.079 --> 00:08:46.649
Orgon gets his stuff back, the family is reunited,
and his daughter gets to marry someone she

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:47.649
likes.

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:52.189
Guess how much the Catholic church liked Tartuffe?

00:08:52.189 --> 00:08:53.410
Not at all!.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:59.010
A lot of religious leaders thought Molière’s
attacks were about them specifically.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:05.619
The Archbishop of Paris wrote a letter saying
he would excommunicate anyone who saw or even

00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:07.139
read the play.

00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:11.569
Pressured by the church and by family, the
king supported a ban.

00:09:11.569 --> 00:09:16.240
Molière had to revise the play, rewriting
it so that it made less fun of the church

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.310
and he also changed the main character’s
name, but that version was banned, too.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.100
He wrote a third version in 1669, and that’s
the one we have today.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.199
Thanks, Thoughtbubble!

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:33.279
In 1667, an anonymous letter was published,
Lettre sur la comédie de l'Imposteur, defending

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.279
the comedy.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:37.559
It was probably written by Molière, but we
don’t know for sure.

00:09:37.559 --> 00:09:41.370
The letter said that it’s right to laugh
at the ridiculous and that the audience would

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.639
become more moral through that laughter.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:49.910
The author hoped people would see the hypocrisy,
pretension and greed that Moliere skewered,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:54.329
and work to rid themselves of those same qualities.

00:09:54.329 --> 00:09:57.140
Basically: LOOK IN THIS HERE MIRROR, SOCIETY.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.920
In 1673, Molière premiered his last play,
The Imaginary Invalid, about a hypochondriac

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.999
who tries to marry his daughter off to a doctor.

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:08.620
Molière played Argan, the hypochondriac.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.939
But Molière really was ill.

00:10:10.939 --> 00:10:17.589
He’d had tuberculosis for many years and
began coughing up blood during a performance.

00:10:17.589 --> 00:10:23.730
He was carried home and died that night, before
he could renounce acting and be given last

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.730
rites.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.550
That’s right: the church denied him a Christian
burial.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.100
But Louis XIV intervened and had him buried
in a churchyard.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.249
Now here’s the part Yorick likes: A century
later, after the Revolution, Molière was

00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:40.180
dug up and moved to the museum of French monuments.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.069
Twenty-five years after that, he was buried
again in Pere Lachaise, where you can visit

00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:45.540
his grave today.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.709
Rest in peace, Jean-Baptiste.

00:10:47.709 --> 00:10:51.519
After Molière’s death, there’s a bunch
of hassle with theaters and troupes, but several

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:55.589
members of his troupe were absorbed into the
newly formed Comedie Francaise, which is still

00:10:55.589 --> 00:10:59.550
going today and still performs his plays as
part of the repertory.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.290
Next time we’re heading off to the “””New”””
World.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.209
Oh, and guess who gets scripted theater going

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:07.209
That’s right.

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:08.720

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:43.480
Until next time… curtain!
