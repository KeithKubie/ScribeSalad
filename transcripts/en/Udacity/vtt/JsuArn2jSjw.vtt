00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.493
So, the answer to this question is 0.675 or 1350 divided by 2,000. And 0.325

00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:14.820
or 650 divided by 2,000. Now hopefully, you noticed a nice pattern here is that

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.060
the frequencies for these two alleles should add up to one always. No matter how

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.490
many alleles we have, when we calculate

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.250
the allele frequency, they should all add back

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.486
up to one. Now, how do we get this answer? Well, we see here that we have 500

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:35.440
po, plus alleles, and we have another 500 alleles in

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.670
that same homozygous group, right? 500 people

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.260
that are homozygous dominant are actually 1,000

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.600
alleles of the dominant allele. Then we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.378
have 350 heterozygous individuals, 350 more dominant alleles.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:59.286
So that equals 1,350 total. 1,350 divided by 2,000 gives us 0.675. The recessive

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:05.144
allele would be 150 and another 150 because of the homozyous condition,

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:10.474
right? And then 350 in the heterozygous condition. So this is a total of 650

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:15.450
recessive alleles. And we divide it by 2,000 to get 0.325 for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.700
the allele frequency of the recessive allele.
