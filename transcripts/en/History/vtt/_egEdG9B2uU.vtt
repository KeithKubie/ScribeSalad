00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.000
NARRATOR: Ancient
astronaut theorists

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
suggest evidence of alien
contact on these islands

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.880
dates back thousands
of years and can

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.040
be found within the
teachings of Shintoism.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.040
Shintoism is the primary
religion of Japan,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.080
with over 107 million followers,
and is designed around a set

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.380
of ritual practices that
connect present-day Japan

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.040
to its ancient mystical past.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.920
At its center are
celestial beings

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.250
that, according to
the Japanese people,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.580
still roam their
islands to this day.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.580
The term "Shinto" translates
as "the way of the kami,"

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.500
or "the way of the gods."

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.750
It's a tradition that has
a millennia-long history

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.250
in Japan.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.830
There are over
eight million kamis,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.580
according to the
Shinto tradition.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.040
And each one of them has its own
particular personality traits,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.750
if you will.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.580
So in that sense, they are
quite different from the notion

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.290
of monotheistic god that we
have in traditions that are

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.120
most widespread in the West.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.460
The kami are these
celestial beings

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.460
that are able to
inhabit basically

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.290
anything, from a human
being, to an animal,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.920
and even inanimate objects.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.790
So on the one hand, there are
these multidimensional beings.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.460
But then, they
also describe them

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.620
as having come down from
their celestial palace

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.080
in the sky, which is
called Takamagahara.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.580
The celestial kami will come
into the terrestrial world,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.120
our world.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.920
And they need a home.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.330
So they have these major shrines
for these kami, when they come

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.790
into the world, so
they can feel at home

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
in the terrestrial world.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.830
The Japanese
archipelago is dotted

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.330
with over 81,000 shrines that
are devoted to the kami gods.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.000
And it's believed
that these are houses,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
or places where these
extraterrestrial beings come

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.170
to live when they're on Earth.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.170
The Japanese people will
visit the shrines of the kami

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.750
with the belief that
they are actually

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.170
praying to an
extraterrestrial being who

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.170
can fulfill their blessings.
