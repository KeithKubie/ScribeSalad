00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.760
Probably - because you’re here - you’re
one of those slightly unusual types. We definitely are.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.519
You probably like thinking more than most
people.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.580
You probably need to spend quite a lot of
time on your own.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.300
At parties you’re perhaps more the introvert

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.270
You probably like a certain sort of book.
Big ideas interest you.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.950
Superficial conversation sinks your spirits.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.510
As a result, not surprisingly, you’re probably
also a bit isolated. It’s not that there’s

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.930
no one at all you could spend time with. You
have friends and places to go.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.010
It’s just that the kind of connections you
crave, the deeper, more thoughtful ones, remain

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.870
remarkably hard to find.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.230
There’s a lot of technology around of course:
a whole lot of apps promising to hook you

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.440
up with people.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.240
Maybe you’ve even tried a few.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:03.170
The problem is, to put it gently, the other
people who are on them - and what they want

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.260
to do and talk about.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.799
The emphasis quickly gets pretty basic. Looks
are kind of paramount. There’s a feeling

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.229
of slick superficiality.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.799
That’s why we decided to build our own app,
an app to connect people a bit like you and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.319
we: the more bookish, introverted types.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.479
You can download it for free here - and connect
in a matter of minutes.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.909
It’s always good watching films together
- it’s going to be even nicer finally being

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.040
able to meet and talk to one another.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.640
