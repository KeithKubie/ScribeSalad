around data visualization in the last

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
around data visualization in the last
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070
around data visualization in the last
three years or so it's been very much

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
three years or so it's been very much
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200
three years or so it's been very much
focused on data visualization for a

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
focused on data visualization for a
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.959
focused on data visualization for a
machine-learning so you'll get to hear a

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
machine-learning so you'll get to hear a
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.470
machine-learning so you'll get to hear a
lot about what we do today I also could

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
lot about what we do today I also could
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810
lot about what we do today I also could
lead the pair initiative which is stands

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
lead the pair initiative which is stands
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.930
lead the pair initiative which is stands
for people plus AI research and there we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940
for people plus AI research and there we
 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490
for people plus AI research and there we
have a bunch of different kinds of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
have a bunch of different kinds of
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
have a bunch of different kinds of
things that we do as part of this

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
things that we do as part of this
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.290
things that we do as part of this
initiative we produce open source

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
initiative we produce open source
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.930

familiar with tensorflow is anyone

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
familiar with tensorflow is anyone
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.670
familiar with tensorflow is anyone
tensorflow yes yes yes I'm seeing some

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680
tensorflow yes yes yes I'm seeing some
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.440

noddings here we also put out

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450
noddings here we also put out
 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.720
noddings here we also put out
educational materials so some of this

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
educational materials so some of this
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969
educational materials so some of this
actually starts to overlap with the data

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
actually starts to overlap with the data
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.149
actually starts to overlap with the data
visualization for machine learning we've

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
visualization for machine learning we've
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.109
visualization for machine learning we've
noticed that even as we at Google try to

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119
noticed that even as we at Google try to
 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.660
noticed that even as we at Google try to
retrain our own engineering workforce to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670
retrain our own engineering workforce to
 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999
retrain our own engineering workforce to
use machine learning it turns out that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
use machine learning it turns out that
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.010
use machine learning it turns out that
if you have simulations and data

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
if you have simulations and data
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.340
if you have simulations and data
visualization front ends to play with

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
visualization front ends to play with
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.639
visualization front ends to play with
some of these systems you just speed up

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649
some of these systems you just speed up
 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.819
some of these systems you just speed up
learning by like a factor of 10 instead

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
learning by like a factor of 10 instead
 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.889
learning by like a factor of 10 instead
of going back to the command line to

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899
of going back to the command line to
 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.019
of going back to the command line to
learn some of the basics so we can talk

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:33.029
learn some of the basics so we can talk
 

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:35.859
learn some of the basics so we can talk
a little bit about that today as well

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869
a little bit about that today as well
 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.050
a little bit about that today as well
all right so the first thing kind of

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
all right so the first thing kind of
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.429
all right so the first thing kind of
let's start at the beginning with the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
let's start at the beginning with the
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.709
let's start at the beginning with the
data right why might you want to

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719
data right why might you want to
 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.409
data right why might you want to
visualize your training data and what's

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:48.419
visualize your training data and what's
 

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:50.899
visualize your training data and what's
special about your training data one of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
special about your training data one of
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120
special about your training data one of
the things that we started saying at

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
the things that we started saying at
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510
the things that we started saying at
Google is that whenever you start

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
Google is that whenever you start
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.029
Google is that whenever you start
working with machine learning and you

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039
working with machine learning and you
 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.849
working with machine learning and you
you look at your results and maybe your

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859
you look at your results and maybe your
 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.069
you look at your results and maybe your
results are not coming out as strongly

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
results are not coming out as strongly
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.080
results are not coming out as strongly
as you would wish there is this innate

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090
as you would wish there is this innate
 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.380
as you would wish there is this innate
intuition or this you're like itching to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
intuition or this you're like itching to
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.330
intuition or this you're like itching to
debug you're a machine learning model

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
debug you're a machine learning model
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.790
debug you're a machine learning model
right one of the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800
right one of the
 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740
right one of the
things we always say is before you even

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750
things we always say is before you even
 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.930
things we always say is before you even
debug your model debug your data and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940
debug your model debug your data and
 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.720
debug your model debug your data and
that becomes it's it's incredibly

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
that becomes it's it's incredibly
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.880
that becomes it's it's incredibly
important I'm sure you're talking about

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
important I'm sure you're talking about
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.380
important I'm sure you're talking about
a lot of that here in the class as well

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390
a lot of that here in the class as well
 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.450
a lot of that here in the class as well
problem is we don't have good tools to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460
problem is we don't have good tools to
 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.410
problem is we don't have good tools to
do that today so we're starting to build

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420
do that today so we're starting to build
 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.440
do that today so we're starting to build
us at Google and other places

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
us at Google and other places
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.550
us at Google and other places
everybody's starting to think about what

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560
everybody's starting to think about what
 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.140
everybody's starting to think about what
might be interesting tools for you to

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150
might be interesting tools for you to
 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.750
might be interesting tools for you to
start to debug your training data the

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
start to debug your training data the
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.700
start to debug your training data the
data that your system is going to rely

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710
data that your system is going to rely
 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.930
data that your system is going to rely
on so we started to approach this from a

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940
on so we started to approach this from a
 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.780
on so we started to approach this from a
data visualization perspective so what I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790
data visualization perspective so what I
 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.370
data visualization perspective so what I
have here is a screenshot of the CFR ten

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380
have here is a screenshot of the CFR ten
 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.590
have here is a screenshot of the CFR ten
data set everybody familiar with that

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600
data set everybody familiar with that
 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.830
data set everybody familiar with that
data set very simple data set of images

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
data set very simple data set of images
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.300
data set very simple data set of images
ten classes that's all and so what I'm

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310
ten classes that's all and so what I'm
 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.390
ten classes that's all and so what I'm
going to demo for you right now is a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400
going to demo for you right now is a
 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.580
going to demo for you right now is a
visualization we created it's called

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590
visualization we created it's called
 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.640
visualization we created it's called
facets and facets is a visualization

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
facets and facets is a visualization
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.820
facets and facets is a visualization
right now I'm visualizing Safari ten and

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830
right now I'm visualizing Safari ten and
 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.060
right now I'm visualizing Safari ten and
all I'm doing as you can tell is I'm

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070
all I'm doing as you can tell is I'm
 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.330
all I'm doing as you can tell is I'm
just looking at all the pictures these

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340
just looking at all the pictures these
 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.430
just looking at all the pictures these
are not all it's it's a sample of cifra

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440
are not all it's it's a sample of cifra
 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.600
are not all it's it's a sample of cifra
ten of the pictures in each class and I

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610
ten of the pictures in each class and I
 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.510
ten of the pictures in each class and I
can very easily zoom in and I can see

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520
can very easily zoom in and I can see
 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.090
can very easily zoom in and I can see
what the pictures look like I can zoom

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100
what the pictures look like I can zoom
 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.810
what the pictures look like I can zoom
out and even as simple as this is it

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820
out and even as simple as this is it
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.270
out and even as simple as this is it
already starts to give me a window into

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280
already starts to give me a window into
 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.060
already starts to give me a window into
what's happening with my data one of the

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070
what's happening with my data one of the
 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.040
what's happening with my data one of the
things I can see right away is that the

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050
things I can see right away is that the
 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.140
things I can see right away is that the
heels are different right something you

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150
heels are different right something you
 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.310
heels are different right something you
may expect so the the top row here is

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320
may expect so the the top row here is
 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.350
may expect so the the top row here is
airplane and you can see that it has a

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360
airplane and you can see that it has a
 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.400
airplane and you can see that it has a
ton more blue than say bird or a cat or

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410
ton more blue than say bird or a cat or
 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.410
ton more blue than say bird or a cat or
deer and so this ship that may be

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420
deer and so this ship that may be
 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.850
deer and so this ship that may be
expected right because I take pictures

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860
expected right because I take pictures
 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.979
expected right because I take pictures
of airplanes against the sky and I take

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989
of airplanes against the sky and I take
 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.270
of airplanes against the sky and I take
pictures of ships against the water okay

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280
pictures of ships against the water okay
 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.440
pictures of ships against the water okay
but then I can start to play some

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450
but then I can start to play some
 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.870
but then I can start to play some
interesting games I can say show me the

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880
interesting games I can say show me the
 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.530
interesting games I can say show me the
same data set within each category but

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540
same data set within each category but
 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.219
same data set within each category but
now I want you to arrange this in terms

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229
now I want you to arrange this in terms
 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.760
now I want you to arrange this in terms
of hue distribution okay so now I can

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770
of hue distribution okay so now I can
 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.090
of hue distribution okay so now I can
start to see okay

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
start to see okay
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.340
start to see okay
these are little histograms of my

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350
these are little histograms of my
 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.480
these are little histograms of my
pictures per category per hue and voila

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
pictures per category per hue and voila
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.340
pictures per category per hue and voila
what are the bluest of the blue

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350
what are the bluest of the blue
 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.270
what are the bluest of the blue
airplanes or there might be some

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280
airplanes or there might be some
 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.720
airplanes or there might be some
interesting blue birds here okay

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730
interesting blue birds here okay
 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.090
interesting blue birds here okay
these are also against the sky that's

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100
these are also against the sky that's
 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.310
these are also against the sky that's
interesting let me see you I have some

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320
interesting let me see you I have some
 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.570
interesting let me see you I have some
Reds on airplanes okay interesting just

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580
Reds on airplanes okay interesting just
 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.830
Reds on airplanes okay interesting just
a very easy organic way to start looking

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840
a very easy organic way to start looking
 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.230
a very easy organic way to start looking
at my data I can also look for things

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
at my data I can also look for things
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.130
at my data I can also look for things
like okay what are the classes of in my

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140
like okay what are the classes of in my
 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.310
like okay what are the classes of in my
data set that have the the most if you

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320
data set that have the the most if you
 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.560
data set that have the the most if you
will kind of equal distribution of hues

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570
will kind of equal distribution of hues
 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.870
will kind of equal distribution of hues
you get to things like ships and trucks

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880
you get to things like ships and trucks
 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.670
you get to things like ships and trucks
and and so forth and you have these

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
and and so forth and you have these
 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.330
and and so forth and you have these
bulges of kind of earthy tones for the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340
bulges of kind of earthy tones for the
 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.540
bulges of kind of earthy tones for the
animals right which makes sense I can

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550
animals right which makes sense I can
 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.250
animals right which makes sense I can
also start playing other games so I can

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260
also start playing other games so I can
 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.200
also start playing other games so I can
come here and say okay now give me a

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210
come here and say okay now give me a
 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.620
come here and say okay now give me a
confusion matrix of my data and again

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630
confusion matrix of my data and again
 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.610
confusion matrix of my data and again
the confusion matrix is going to pair

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
the confusion matrix is going to pair
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.180
the confusion matrix is going to pair
each one of these rows is what the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190
each one of these rows is what the
 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.570
each one of these rows is what the
system thinks my image is versus each

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580
system thinks my image is versus each
 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.810
system thinks my image is versus each
one of the columns is what the humans

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820
one of the columns is what the humans
 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.130
one of the columns is what the humans
have hand labeled my image to be so the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140
have hand labeled my image to be so the
 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.830
have hand labeled my image to be so the
good news to me is that right away I can

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840
good news to me is that right away I can
 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.330
good news to me is that right away I can
see that the diagonal is the most

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340
see that the diagonal is the most
 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.970
see that the diagonal is the most
populated set of cells that's good

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980
populated set of cells that's good
 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.560
populated set of cells that's good
because that's where my system and the

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570
because that's where my system and the
 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.940
because that's where my system and the
humans agree right and another

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950
humans agree right and another
 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.620
humans agree right and another
interesting thing I can see here right

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630
interesting thing I can see here right
 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.420
interesting thing I can see here right
away is that I have a couple of cells

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430
away is that I have a couple of cells
 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.030
away is that I have a couple of cells
that are highly populated I have this

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040
that are highly populated I have this
 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.060
that are highly populated I have this
cell here ton of pictures and I have

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070
cell here ton of pictures and I have
 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.810
cell here ton of pictures and I have
this other cell here ton of pictures and

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820
this other cell here ton of pictures and
 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.240
this other cell here ton of pictures and
sure enough these are my system is

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250
sure enough these are my system is
 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.190
sure enough these are my system is
getting confused between dogs and cats

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200
getting confused between dogs and cats
 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.330
getting confused between dogs and cats
okay so that already might start to give

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340
okay so that already might start to give
 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.310
okay so that already might start to give
me some hints as to what I might want to

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320
me some hints as to what I might want to
 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.320
me some hints as to what I might want to
debug about my system maybe I need to

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330
debug about my system maybe I need to
 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.290
debug about my system maybe I need to
give it more images of cats and dogs so

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300
give it more images of cats and dogs so
 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.320
give it more images of cats and dogs so
it does better on those classes now keep

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330
it does better on those classes now keep
 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.230
it does better on those classes now keep
this in mind this is C far 10 this is

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240
this in mind this is C far 10 this is
 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.810
this in mind this is C far 10 this is
kind of a hello world data set of

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820
kind of a hello world data set of
 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.690
kind of a hello world data set of
machine learning everybody looks at this

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700
machine learning everybody looks at this
 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.580
machine learning everybody looks at this
data set

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590
data set
 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.010
data set
everybody benchmarks against this data

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020
everybody benchmarks against this data
 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.220
everybody benchmarks against this data
set it's been looked at by thousands of

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.230
set it's been looked at by thousands of
 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.680
set it's been looked at by thousands of
people right so we started visualizing

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690
people right so we started visualizing
 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.500
people right so we started visualizing
this and we're like oh okay so my system

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510
this and we're like oh okay so my system
 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.720
this and we're like oh okay so my system
is very sure that these are cat these

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730
is very sure that these are cat these
 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.120
is very sure that these are cat these
are not cats so let's see what the cats

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130
are not cats so let's see what the cats
 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.330
are not cats so let's see what the cats
are that my system is very short are not

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340
are that my system is very short are not
 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.760
are that my system is very short are not
cats interesting okay so I can see how

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770
cats interesting okay so I can see how
 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.760
cats interesting okay so I can see how
like this guy here has a lot big ears

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770
like this guy here has a lot big ears
 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.380
like this guy here has a lot big ears
maybe it's getting confused about that

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390
maybe it's getting confused about that
 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.600
maybe it's getting confused about that
all right but then we started seeing

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610
all right but then we started seeing
 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.390
all right but then we started seeing
some interesting things I challenge you

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400
some interesting things I challenge you
 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.210
some interesting things I challenge you
to find something in the bottom rows

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220
to find something in the bottom rows
 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:19.870
to find something in the bottom rows
that is indeed not a cat anyone a frog

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880
that is indeed not a cat anyone a frog
 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.180
that is indeed not a cat anyone a frog
yes look at this this was hand labelled

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190
yes look at this this was hand labelled
 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.760
yes look at this this was hand labelled
cat but my system is a hundred percent

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:27.770
cat but my system is a hundred percent
 

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.650
cat but my system is a hundred percent
sure it's a frog and I have to give it

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660
sure it's a frog and I have to give it
 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.750
sure it's a frog and I have to give it
to it I think it's a frog I don't think

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:31.760
to it I think it's a frog I don't think
 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.080
to it I think it's a frog I don't think
it's a cat at all but why does that

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090
it's a cat at all but why does that
 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.080
it's a cat at all but why does that
matter it matters because just by giving

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.090
matter it matters because just by giving
 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.560
matter it matters because just by giving
you the ability to look at your data you

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:41.570
you the ability to look at your data you
 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.720
you the ability to look at your data you
can start to see actual mistakes in your

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:43.730
can start to see actual mistakes in your
 

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.170
can start to see actual mistakes in your
data right and again this is a data set

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180
data right and again this is a data set
 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.240
data right and again this is a data set
that thousands of researchers and

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.250
that thousands of researchers and
 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.060
that thousands of researchers and
practitioners use and benchmark again

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:52.070
practitioners use and benchmark again
 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.000
practitioners use and benchmark again
benchmark against and nobody knew that

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.010
benchmark against and nobody knew that
 

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.610
benchmark against and nobody knew that
there were a couple of mistakes there

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:56.620
there were a couple of mistakes there
 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.860
there were a couple of mistakes there
interesting things right so again just

00:07:59.860 --> 00:07:59.870
interesting things right so again just
 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:03.070
interesting things right so again just
creating a the ability to look at your

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.080
creating a the ability to look at your
 

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.970
creating a the ability to look at your
data very easily can buy you can get rid

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:06.980
data very easily can buy you can get rid
 

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.840
data very easily can buy you can get rid
of a lot of headache for you so that's

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:09.850
of a lot of headache for you so that's
 

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:15.640
of a lot of headache for you so that's
that's facets and we open sourced facets

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:15.650
that's facets and we open sourced facets
 

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.590
that's facets and we open sourced facets
so facets is available for anyone to use

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:17.600
so facets is available for anyone to use
 

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.930
so facets is available for anyone to use
and it's been downloaded a bunch of

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:19.940
and it's been downloaded a bunch of
 

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.760
and it's been downloaded a bunch of
times you don't have to use it for

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:21.770
times you don't have to use it for
 

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.170
times you don't have to use it for
machine learning it's a visualization

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:23.180
machine learning it's a visualization
 

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.750
machine learning it's a visualization
tool for any kind of faceted data set so

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:25.760
tool for any kind of faceted data set so
 

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.270
tool for any kind of faceted data set so
you can use it for anything you want and

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280
you can use it for anything you want and
 

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.720
you can use it for anything you want and
here at MIT people have started using it

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:31.730
here at MIT people have started using it
 

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.180
here at MIT people have started using it
so joy for instance at the Media Lab was

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:34.190
so joy for instance at the Media Lab was
 

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.220
so joy for instance at the Media Lab was
using facets to look at racial bias

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.230
using facets to look at racial bias
 

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.350
using facets to look at racial bias
racial and gender bias in facial

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360
racial and gender bias in facial
 

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.720
racial and gender bias in facial
recognition

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:42.730
recognition
 

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.360
recognition
facial recognition systems from industry

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:46.370
facial recognition systems from industry
 

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.720
facial recognition systems from industry
and she was using the visualization to

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:49.730
and she was using the visualization to
 

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.850
and she was using the visualization to
make the point that

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:51.860
make the point that
 

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.780
make the point that
the category of women of color where the

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:55.790
the category of women of color where the
 

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.970
the category of women of color where the
was the category that these system would

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:57.980
was the category that these system would
 

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.910
was the category that these system would
consistently do worse at alright I'm

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920
consistently do worse at alright I'm
 

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.610
consistently do worse at alright I'm
gonna I'm if I have time I'm gonna come

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:06.620
gonna I'm if I have time I'm gonna come
 

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.620
gonna I'm if I have time I'm gonna come
back to the what if tool the only thing

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.630
back to the what if tool the only thing
 

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.389
back to the what if tool the only thing
I'll say about this tool is that it's

00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399
I'll say about this tool is that it's
 

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.610
I'll say about this tool is that it's
another open-source tool that we created

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:12.620
another open-source tool that we created
 

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.180
another open-source tool that we created
that allows you to probe a machine

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.190
that allows you to probe a machine
 

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.300
that allows you to probe a machine
learning model as a black box and to

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.310
learning model as a black box and to
 

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.550
learning model as a black box and to
probe for things like machine learning

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560
probe for things like machine learning
 

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.400
probe for things like machine learning
fairness different concepts of ML

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:24.410
fairness different concepts of ML
 

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.470
fairness different concepts of ML
fairness if we have time we'll come back

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480
fairness if we have time we'll come back
 

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.060
fairness if we have time we'll come back
to this alright so we just talked about

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.070
to this alright so we just talked about
 

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.650
to this alright so we just talked about
the importance of looking at your data

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:32.660
the importance of looking at your data
 

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.540
the importance of looking at your data
now let's talk a little bit about what

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:34.550
now let's talk a little bit about what
 

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.190
now let's talk a little bit about what
can you learn when you're looking at

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200
can you learn when you're looking at
 

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.500
can you learn when you're looking at
your model sort of how is your model

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:38.510
your model sort of how is your model
 

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.210
your model sort of how is your model
understanding the world how is it making

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:40.220
understanding the world how is it making
 

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.560
understanding the world how is it making
sense of very very high dimensional data

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:43.570
sense of very very high dimensional data
 

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.329
sense of very very high dimensional data
so I'm gonna walk you through a very

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:46.339
so I'm gonna walk you through a very
 

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:51.220
so I'm gonna walk you through a very
quick exercise in high dimensionality so

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:51.230
quick exercise in high dimensionality so
 

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.759
quick exercise in high dimensionality so
a warm-up exercise M nest yes M nest

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:54.769
a warm-up exercise M nest yes M nest
 

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:57.420
a warm-up exercise M nest yes M nest
everybody familiar with omnis

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:57.430
everybody familiar with omnis
 

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:02.380
everybody familiar with omnis
data set of machine learning and i'm

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:02.390
data set of machine learning and i'm
 

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.360
data set of machine learning and i'm
going i'm going to start pulling us over

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370
going i'm going to start pulling us over
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.780
going i'm going to start pulling us over
to the world of visualization again so

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:07.790
to the world of visualization again so
 

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.699
to the world of visualization again so
think about each one of these images as

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:09.709
think about each one of these images as
 

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:13.030
think about each one of these images as
a very high dimensional vector how might

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040
a very high dimensional vector how might
 

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.370
a very high dimensional vector how might
I think about that all I'm going to do

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.380
I think about that all I'm going to do
 

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.079
I think about that all I'm going to do
is I'm going to count the pixels and

00:10:17.079 --> 00:10:17.089
is I'm going to count the pixels and
 

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:19.480
is I'm going to count the pixels and
depending on the color of the pixel I'm

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.490
depending on the color of the pixel I'm
 

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.120
depending on the color of the pixel I'm
gonna give it a value from zero to one

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.130
gonna give it a value from zero to one
 

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.480
gonna give it a value from zero to one
one if it's all white zero if it's black

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.490
one if it's all white zero if it's black
 

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.490
one if it's all white zero if it's black
something in the middle if it's a gray I

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:27.500
something in the middle if it's a gray I
 

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.519
something in the middle if it's a gray I
end up with a vector boom i transformed

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:30.529
end up with a vector boom i transformed
 

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:33.759
end up with a vector boom i transformed
an image into math that's great

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:33.769
an image into math that's great
 

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:36.699
an image into math that's great
now I have a great way to compare these

00:10:36.699 --> 00:10:36.709
now I have a great way to compare these
 

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:40.060
now I have a great way to compare these
images alright so then we created a

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.070
images alright so then we created a
 

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.170
images alright so then we created a
visualization to actually look at this

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:43.180
visualization to actually look at this
 

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.840
visualization to actually look at this
so this is another tool that's open

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:46.850
so this is another tool that's open
 

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.019
so this is another tool that's open
sourced by pear and this is called the

00:10:50.019 --> 00:10:50.029
sourced by pear and this is called the
 

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:52.660
sourced by pear and this is called the
embedding projector and now what we're

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:52.670
embedding projector and now what we're
 

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.750
embedding projector and now what we're
doing here we're looking at M mist in

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760
doing here we're looking at M mist in
 

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.360
doing here we're looking at M mist in
high dimensional space okay so this is a

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:58.370
high dimensional space okay so this is a
 

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.000
high dimensional space okay so this is a
3d projection of of the Emnes

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.010
3d projection of of the Emnes
 

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.390
3d projection of of the Emnes
numbers okay all I did here since I have

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:06.400
numbers okay all I did here since I have
 

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.050
numbers okay all I did here since I have
ground truth I colored the numbers by

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:10.060
ground truth I colored the numbers by
 

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.710
ground truth I colored the numbers by
the ground truth okay and the projection

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720
the ground truth okay and the projection
 

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.740
the ground truth okay and the projection
I'm using here is T's me it's a

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:16.750
I'm using here is T's me it's a
 

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:20.070
I'm using here is T's me it's a
nonlinear projection it does really well

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:20.080
nonlinear projection it does really well
 

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.330
nonlinear projection it does really well
in keeping track of local clusters it

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:24.340
in keeping track of local clusters it
 

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.220
in keeping track of local clusters it
doesn't do very well at all in

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.230
doesn't do very well at all in
 

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.260
doesn't do very well at all in
understanding the global structure of

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:28.270
understanding the global structure of
 

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:32.280
understanding the global structure of
things but locally it's very good so

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:32.290
things but locally it's very good so
 

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.580
things but locally it's very good so
what do we have here the good news is

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:35.590
what do we have here the good news is
 

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.820
what do we have here the good news is
that we have clusters that's a good

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:38.830
that we have clusters that's a good
 

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.640
that we have clusters that's a good
starting point and we have space between

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:41.650
starting point and we have space between
 

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.680
starting point and we have space between
clusters so that's really good because

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:43.690
clusters so that's really good because
 

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.870
clusters so that's really good because
it tells me that somehow these

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:45.880
it tells me that somehow these
 

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.690
it tells me that somehow these
categories are being pulled apart from

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:48.700
categories are being pulled apart from
 

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.570
categories are being pulled apart from
each other we also have so let's start

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:51.580
each other we also have so let's start
 

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.790
each other we also have so let's start
playing with this tool

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800
playing with this tool
 

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.420
playing with this tool
it lets me rotate in many different ways

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.430
it lets me rotate in many different ways
 

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.600
it lets me rotate in many different ways
I can zoom in and out to look more

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:00.610
I can zoom in and out to look more
 

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.470
I can zoom in and out to look more
carefully at things I can also click on

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480
carefully at things I can also click on
 

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.810
carefully at things I can also click on
things so basically just so you know

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:06.820
things so basically just so you know
 

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.430
things so basically just so you know
what's going on here I'm setting up a

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440
what's going on here I'm setting up a
 

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:12.270
what's going on here I'm setting up a
demo using the same tool that shows you

how a visualization like this can work

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.170
how a visualization like this can work
 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.360
how a visualization like this can work
in a real system in a large system the

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.370
in a real system in a large system the
 

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.550
in a real system in a large system the

right very easy toy example what I'm

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:27.820
right very easy toy example what I'm
 

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.260
right very easy toy example what I'm
showing you now and this is it's taking

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:31.270
showing you now and this is it's taking
 

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.470
showing you now and this is it's taking
its time to get to the T Snee projection

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480
its time to get to the T Snee projection
 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.200
its time to get to the T Snee projection
it's calculating T's needs calculating

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:37.210
it's calculating T's needs calculating
 

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.340
it's calculating T's needs calculating
all the clusters in this data set and I

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:41.350
all the clusters in this data set and I
 

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.720
all the clusters in this data set and I
want to be able to interact with it

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:42.730
want to be able to interact with it
 

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.760
want to be able to interact with it
that's why I'm taking my time and I'll

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:44.770
that's why I'm taking my time and I'll
 

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:47.490
that's why I'm taking my time and I'll
talk to you while this is working in the

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:47.500
talk to you while this is working in the
 

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.590
talk to you while this is working in the
background okay so we're gonna let this

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600
background okay so we're gonna let this
 

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.810
background okay so we're gonna let this
do its thing it's gonna run in the

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:51.820
do its thing it's gonna run in the
 

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.030
do its thing it's gonna run in the
background I'm gonna try to get it not

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040

to distract us completely meanwhile

00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:58.840
to distract us completely meanwhile
 

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.620

let's talk about interpretability in a

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.630
let's talk about interpretability in a
 

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.550
let's talk about interpretability in a
real world scenario so a couple years

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560
real world scenario so a couple years
 

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.940
real world scenario so a couple years
ago Google came out with something

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:08.950
ago Google came out with something
 

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.860
ago Google came out with something
called a multilingual neural net

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:10.870
called a multilingual neural net
 

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.010
called a multilingual neural net
Translate system what what does that

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.020
Translate system what what does that
 

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:14.889
Translate system what what does that
mean

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:14.899
mean
 

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:17.850
mean
it means that up until that moment

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:17.860
it means that up until that moment
 

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.739
it means that up until that moment
whenever you wanted to use neural nets

00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:20.749
whenever you wanted to use neural nets
 

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:23.259
whenever you wanted to use neural nets
to translate between two languages you

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:23.269
to translate between two languages you
 

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:25.900
to translate between two languages you
had to train a model on a pair of

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:25.910
had to train a model on a pair of
 

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:28.619
had to train a model on a pair of
languages so I trained a model between

00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:28.629
languages so I trained a model between
 

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:31.629
languages so I trained a model between
English and French French English I

00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639
English and French French English I
 

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:34.269
English and French French English I
trained a different model for English

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279
trained a different model for English
 

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:37.359
trained a different model for English
and Japanese Japanese English okay so it

00:13:37.359 --> 00:13:37.369
and Japanese Japanese English okay so it
 

00:13:37.369 --> 00:13:40.059
and Japanese Japanese English okay so it
was all based on pairs for the first

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:40.069
was all based on pairs for the first
 

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:42.699
was all based on pairs for the first
time Google came up with an architecture

00:13:42.699 --> 00:13:42.709
time Google came up with an architecture
 

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:46.090
time Google came up with an architecture
they'll let you ingest multiple

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:46.100
they'll let you ingest multiple
 

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.210
they'll let you ingest multiple
languages and translate high-quality

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.220
languages and translate high-quality
 

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.309
languages and translate high-quality
translations into multiple languages

00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:51.319
translations into multiple languages
 

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:54.840
translations into multiple languages
okay and that was that was a revelation

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:54.850
okay and that was that was a revelation
 

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.720
okay and that was that was a revelation
it was it was quite a feat and so that's

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:58.730
it was it was quite a feat and so that's
 

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.429
it was it was quite a feat and so that's
called the multilingual translation

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:00.439
called the multilingual translation
 

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:03.009
called the multilingual translation
models there's another thing that was

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:03.019
models there's another thing that was
 

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:04.720
models there's another thing that was
interesting in what these systems were

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:04.730
interesting in what these systems were
 

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.829
interesting in what these systems were
doing somehow they were able to do what

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839
doing somehow they were able to do what
 

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:11.949
doing somehow they were able to do what
we call zero shot translation okay and

00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959
we call zero shot translation okay and
 

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:16.689
we call zero shot translation okay and
so what that means is that imagine I

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:16.699
so what that means is that imagine I
 

00:14:16.699 --> 00:14:19.989
so what that means is that imagine I
have a system that is that is ingesting

00:14:19.989 --> 00:14:19.999
have a system that is that is ingesting
 

00:14:19.999 --> 00:14:22.989
have a system that is that is ingesting
a bunch of sentences that translate

00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:22.999
a bunch of sentences that translate
 

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:25.960
a bunch of sentences that translate
between English and Japanese Japanese in

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:25.970
between English and Japanese Japanese in
 

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.509
between English and Japanese Japanese in
English and it's also ingesting a bunch

00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519
English and it's also ingesting a bunch
 

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:30.579
English and it's also ingesting a bunch
of sentences that translate between

00:14:30.579 --> 00:14:30.589
of sentences that translate between
 

00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:33.660
of sentences that translate between
glish and Korea and back and forth okay

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:33.670
glish and Korea and back and forth okay
 

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.629
glish and Korea and back and forth okay
somehow this system was able to also do

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:37.639
somehow this system was able to also do
 

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:39.549
somehow this system was able to also do
Japanese to Korean and Korean to

00:14:39.549 --> 00:14:39.559
Japanese to Korean and Korean to
 

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:42.009
Japanese to Korean and Korean to
Japanese without ever having seen a

00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:42.019
Japanese without ever having seen a
 

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:44.470
Japanese without ever having seen a
single example of a sentence that goes

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480
single example of a sentence that goes
 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.319
single example of a sentence that goes
straight from one to the next okay from

00:14:47.319 --> 00:14:47.329
straight from one to the next okay from
 

00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:49.869
straight from one to the next okay from
Japanese to Korean so one of the

00:14:49.869 --> 00:14:49.879
Japanese to Korean so one of the
 

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:52.929
Japanese to Korean so one of the
challenges one of the big unknowns is

00:14:52.929 --> 00:14:52.939
challenges one of the big unknowns is
 

00:14:52.939 --> 00:14:55.059
challenges one of the big unknowns is
that the people building these systems

00:14:55.059 --> 00:14:55.069
that the people building these systems
 

00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:57.910
that the people building these systems
they weren't sure how is the system

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920
they weren't sure how is the system
 

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.489
they weren't sure how is the system
being able to do this with high quality

00:15:00.489 --> 00:15:00.499
being able to do this with high quality
 

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.769
being able to do this with high quality
translation high quality translation is

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:02.779
translation high quality translation is
 

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:05.829
translation high quality translation is
extremely hard to get is extremely

00:15:05.829 --> 00:15:05.839
extremely hard to get is extremely
 

00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:08.650
extremely hard to get is extremely
announced and so how is it doing that

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:08.660
announced and so how is it doing that
 

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.609
announced and so how is it doing that
oh this was the data that we decided to

00:15:12.609 --> 00:15:12.619
oh this was the data that we decided to
 

00:15:12.619 --> 00:15:15.309
oh this was the data that we decided to
visualize to actually start answering

00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:15.319
visualize to actually start answering
 

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:18.220
visualize to actually start answering
that question okay it turns out that

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:18.230
that question okay it turns out that
 

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.600
that question okay it turns out that
between the encoder and the decoder

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:21.610
between the encoder and the decoder
 

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.460
between the encoder and the decoder
there is an attention vector in the

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:24.470
there is an attention vector in the
 

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.960
there is an attention vector in the
middle

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:24.970
middle
 

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.179
middle
and this is the data that we were that

00:15:27.179 --> 00:15:27.189
and this is the data that we were that
 

00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:30.090
and this is the data that we were that
we were going to visualize all right the

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:30.100
we were going to visualize all right the
 

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.579
we were going to visualize all right the
question in these researchers Minds

00:15:32.579 --> 00:15:32.589
question in these researchers Minds
 

00:15:32.589 --> 00:15:33.780
question in these researchers Minds
these are the people who were building

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:33.790
these are the people who were building
 

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.280
these are the people who were building
the Translate system was imagine I have

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:37.290
the Translate system was imagine I have
 

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.369
the Translate system was imagine I have
space with multiple languages an

00:15:40.369 --> 00:15:40.379
space with multiple languages an
 

00:15:40.379 --> 00:15:42.900
space with multiple languages an
embedding space a very high dimensional

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:42.910
embedding space a very high dimensional
 

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.449
embedding space a very high dimensional
space of language what were these

00:15:45.449 --> 00:15:45.459
space of language what were these
 

00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:48.869
space of language what were these
multilingual systems doing were they

00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:48.879
multilingual systems doing were they
 

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.210
multilingual systems doing were they
doing something like what's here on the

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:51.220
doing something like what's here on the
 

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.559
doing something like what's here on the
Left where they would resolve the space

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:55.569
Left where they would resolve the space
 

00:15:55.569 --> 00:15:58.850
Left where they would resolve the space
by keeping all the English in one corner

00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860
by keeping all the English in one corner
 

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.199
by keeping all the English in one corner
keeping all the Japanese on the other

00:16:01.199 --> 00:16:01.209
keeping all the Japanese on the other
 

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:04.350
keeping all the Japanese on the other
corner and keeping all the Korean in

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360
corner and keeping all the Korean in
 

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.170
corner and keeping all the Korean in
another corner and then just mapping

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:07.180
another corner and then just mapping
 

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.309
another corner and then just mapping
between these spaces for translations or

00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319
between these spaces for translations or
 

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:13.139
between these spaces for translations or
where's the system doing something more

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:13.149
where's the system doing something more
 

00:16:13.149 --> 00:16:15.600
where's the system doing something more
like what you see on the right where

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:15.610
like what you see on the right where
 

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.449
like what you see on the right where
it's way more messy but they're bringing

00:16:18.449 --> 00:16:18.459
it's way more messy but they're bringing
 

00:16:18.459 --> 00:16:21.150
it's way more messy but they're bringing
together these multiple languages okay

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160
together these multiple languages okay
 

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.559
together these multiple languages okay
and so this why does this matter why

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:25.569
and so this why does this matter why
 

00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:27.179
and so this why does this matter why
does it matter if it's one way or

00:16:27.179 --> 00:16:27.189
does it matter if it's one way or
 

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:30.360
does it matter if it's one way or
another way it matters because if what

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:30.370
another way it matters because if what
 

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.249
another way it matters because if what
the system was doing was mixing up the

00:16:34.249 --> 00:16:34.259
the system was doing was mixing up the
 

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:37.079
the system was doing was mixing up the
different languages in the same high

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:37.089
different languages in the same high
 

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:40.079
different languages in the same high
dimensional space it had a very specific

00:16:40.079 --> 00:16:40.089
dimensional space it had a very specific
 

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:43.410
dimensional space it had a very specific
implication which meant it the system

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:43.420
implication which meant it the system
 

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.429
implication which meant it the system
didn't care as much that one string said

00:16:47.429 --> 00:16:47.439
didn't care as much that one string said
 

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:51.179
didn't care as much that one string said
for instance home and another string

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:51.189
for instance home and another string
 

00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:54.720
for instance home and another string
said cazza it knew that these two

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:54.730
said cazza it knew that these two
 

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.929
said cazza it knew that these two
strings had the same semantic meaning so

00:16:57.929 --> 00:16:57.939
strings had the same semantic meaning so
 

00:16:57.939 --> 00:17:00.389
strings had the same semantic meaning so
if it was co-locating these very

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399
if it was co-locating these very
 

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.920
if it was co-locating these very
different strings from very different

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:01.930
different strings from very different
 

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.380
different strings from very different
languages in the same high dimensional

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:04.390
languages in the same high dimensional
 

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.090
languages in the same high dimensional
space it meant that it was paying

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:06.100
space it meant that it was paying
 

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.149
space it meant that it was paying
attention to actual the semantics the

00:17:09.149 --> 00:17:09.159
attention to actual the semantics the
 

00:17:09.159 --> 00:17:12.000
attention to actual the semantics the
actual meaning of the words and that

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.010
actual meaning of the words and that
 

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.429
actual meaning of the words and that
matters because that then tells us that

00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439
matters because that then tells us that
 

00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:16.649
matters because that then tells us that
these are the first indications of a

00:17:16.649 --> 00:17:16.659
these are the first indications of a
 

00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:20.340
these are the first indications of a
universal language okay and so but we

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:20.350
universal language okay and so but we
 

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.960
universal language okay and so but we
had no way of knowing so we decided to

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:21.970
had no way of knowing so we decided to
 

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.870
had no way of knowing so we decided to
visualize and how might we visualize

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880
visualize and how might we visualize
 

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.319
visualize and how might we visualize
this imagine I have a sentence that says

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:28.329
this imagine I have a sentence that says
 

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.320
this imagine I have a sentence that says
something like the stratosphere extends

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.330
something like the stratosphere extends
 

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.779
something like the stratosphere extends
from 10 kilometers to 50 kilometers in

00:17:33.779 --> 00:17:33.789
from 10 kilometers to 50 kilometers in
 

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:36.820
from 10 kilometers to 50 kilometers in
altitude

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:36.830
 
 

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.840
 
what does that look like in high

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:38.850
what does that look like in high
 

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.550
what does that look like in high
dimensional space it looks like a bunch

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:40.560
dimensional space it looks like a bunch
 

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.160
dimensional space it looks like a bunch
of points where some points are going to

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:43.170
of points where some points are going to
 

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.470
of points where some points are going to
be closer together like the 10 and the

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480
be closer together like the 10 and the
 

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.900
be closer together like the 10 and the
15 maybe because they're both numbers

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:47.910
15 maybe because they're both numbers
 

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.650
15 maybe because they're both numbers
okay so again location has a specific

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:51.660
okay so again location has a specific
 

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.660
okay so again location has a specific
meaning here in high dimensional space

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:53.670
meaning here in high dimensional space
 

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.580
meaning here in high dimensional space
and then what we do with the

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:55.590
and then what we do with the
 

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.490
and then what we do with the
visualization is we connect these dots

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500
visualization is we connect these dots
 

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.720
visualization is we connect these dots
and so that is my sentence in high

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:02.730
and so that is my sentence in high
 

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.120
and so that is my sentence in high
dimensional space it's the path of my

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.130
dimensional space it's the path of my
 

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.450
dimensional space it's the path of my
sentence okay so now I have my sentence

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460
sentence okay so now I have my sentence
 

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.820
sentence okay so now I have my sentence
in English what does this look like when

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:10.830
in English what does this look like when
 

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.190
in English what does this look like when
I have to set to when I have a

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200
I have to set to when I have a
 

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.400
I have to set to when I have a
translation does it look like this where

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:16.410
translation does it look like this where
 

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:19.430
translation does it look like this where
I have my English sentence in one corner

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440
I have my English sentence in one corner
 

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.800
I have my English sentence in one corner
and I have the Portuguese version of

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:21.810
and I have the Portuguese version of
 

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.900
and I have the Portuguese version of
that sentence on another corner or does

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:26.910
that sentence on another corner or does
 

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.170
that sentence on another corner or does
it look more like something like this

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:29.180
it look more like something like this
 

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.030
it look more like something like this
okay and so this is what we're trying to

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:32.040
okay and so this is what we're trying to
 

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.900
okay and so this is what we're trying to
find out

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:32.910
find out
 

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.190
find out
so the visualization for this let me see

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200
so the visualization for this let me see
 

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.200
so the visualization for this let me see
is actually this here so what I'm

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.210
is actually this here so what I'm
 

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:44.330
is actually this here so what I'm
showing here again we're back in the

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:44.340
showing here again we're back in the
 

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.630
showing here again we're back in the
embedding projector and I'm visualizing

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640
embedding projector and I'm visualizing
 

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.150
embedding projector and I'm visualizing
a multi-dimensional tea lingual system

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160
a multi-dimensional tea lingual system
 

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.000
a multi-dimensional tea lingual system
that takes in English Japanese and

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.010
that takes in English Japanese and
 

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.660
that takes in English Japanese and
Korean I am coloring each one of those

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:56.670
Korean I am coloring each one of those
 

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.230
Korean I am coloring each one of those
languages by a different color so

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240
languages by a different color so
 

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.690
languages by a different color so
English is blue Korean is red Japanese

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700
English is blue Korean is red Japanese
 

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.040
English is blue Korean is red Japanese
is yellow okay my question to you is as

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:07.050
is yellow okay my question to you is as
 

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:11.180
is yellow okay my question to you is as
messy as this looks do you see a big

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.190
messy as this looks do you see a big
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.370
messy as this looks do you see a big
neighborhood of red and a big

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380
neighborhood of red and a big
 

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.870
neighborhood of red and a big
neighborhood of blue and a big

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880
neighborhood of blue and a big
 

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.440
neighborhood of blue and a big
neighborhood of yellow no right so that

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.450
neighborhood of yellow no right so that
 

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:20.000
neighborhood of yellow no right so that
right there was our very first

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.010
right there was our very first
 

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.340
right there was our very first
indication that something really

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:22.350
indication that something really
 

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:24.980
indication that something really
interesting was happening because we

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:24.990
interesting was happening because we
 

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.160
interesting was happening because we
started to see clusters that had the

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:28.170
started to see clusters that had the
 

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.450
started to see clusters that had the
three colors together okay and so the

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:32.460
three colors together okay and so the
 

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:35.570
three colors together okay and so the
thing that I was hoping to show you but

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580
thing that I was hoping to show you but
 

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.370
thing that I was hoping to show you but
I don't know that I'm gonna be able to

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:37.380
I don't know that I'm gonna be able to
 

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:42.620
I don't know that I'm gonna be able to
show you let me see if I can oh maybe

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:42.630
show you let me see if I can oh maybe
 

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.030
show you let me see if I can oh maybe
maybe I'll show you like this

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:44.040
maybe I'll show you like this
 

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.289
maybe I'll show you like this
so if I do a search for

00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299
 
 

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:53.250
 
stratosphere well it it just did a bunch

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:53.260
stratosphere well it it just did a bunch
 

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.200
stratosphere well it it just did a bunch
of stuff here that is not helpful

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.210
of stuff here that is not helpful
 

00:19:55.210 --> 00:20:05.190
of stuff here that is not helpful
ah I'm gonna try to drag it all the way

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200
ah I'm gonna try to drag it all the way
 

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.930
ah I'm gonna try to drag it all the way
here do you see this little cluster here

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:06.940
here do you see this little cluster here
 

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.350
here do you see this little cluster here
the stratosphere with the altitude

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360
the stratosphere with the altitude
 

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.029
the stratosphere with the altitude
between 10 and 50 kilometers okay ignore

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039
between 10 and 50 kilometers okay ignore
 

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:17.039
between 10 and 50 kilometers okay ignore
all of this junk here this is not

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:17.049
all of this junk here this is not
 

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.620
all of this junk here this is not
supposed to be there but this is what I

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:19.630
supposed to be there but this is what I
 

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.659
supposed to be there but this is what I
care about if I look at this cluster

00:20:23.659 --> 00:20:23.669
care about if I look at this cluster
 

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:26.909
care about if I look at this cluster
okay and I look at the nearest neighbors

00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919
okay and I look at the nearest neighbors
 

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:28.649
okay and I look at the nearest neighbors
these are the nearest neighbors here

00:20:28.649 --> 00:20:28.659
these are the nearest neighbors here
 

00:20:28.659 --> 00:20:31.590
these are the nearest neighbors here
that I'm mousing over the three

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600
that I'm mousing over the three
 

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:35.340
that I'm mousing over the three
languages are here okay and my nearest

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.350
languages are here okay and my nearest
 

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.409
languages are here okay and my nearest
neighbors for that ain't for that

00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:37.419
neighbors for that ain't for that
 

00:20:37.419 --> 00:20:40.320
neighbors for that ain't for that
sentence in English both in Japanese and

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:40.330
sentence in English both in Japanese and
 

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:43.529
sentence in English both in Japanese and
in Korea are all in that cluster alright

00:20:43.529 --> 00:20:43.539
in Korea are all in that cluster alright
 

00:20:43.539 --> 00:20:46.890
in Korea are all in that cluster alright
so that in fact did you see I just

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:46.900
so that in fact did you see I just
 

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.590
so that in fact did you see I just
clicked out and you see the cluster has

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600
clicked out and you see the cluster has
 

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.060
clicked out and you see the cluster has
three colors here so that was our

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.070
three colors here so that was our
 

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.390
three colors here so that was our
indication that this was actually the

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400
indication that this was actually the
 

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.340
indication that this was actually the
beginning of a universal language

00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.350
beginning of a universal language
 

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.760
beginning of a universal language
this system was actually being able to

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:02.770
this system was actually being able to
 

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.850
this system was actually being able to
coalesce the three spaces of three

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:05.860
coalesce the three spaces of three
 

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.690
coalesce the three spaces of three
different languages in terms of semantic

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:09.700
different languages in terms of semantic
 

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.740
different languages in terms of semantic
meaning now keep this image in mind and

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:13.750
meaning now keep this image in mind and
 

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.159
meaning now keep this image in mind and
I want to show you a sister image of the

00:21:17.159 --> 00:21:17.169
I want to show you a sister image of the
 

00:21:17.169 --> 00:21:22.130
I want to show you a sister image of the
image a visualization of a sister system

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140
image a visualization of a sister system
 

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.770
image a visualization of a sister system
this system here it's the same kind of

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:25.780
this system here it's the same kind of
 

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.659
this system here it's the same kind of
visualization but this is a system that

00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:27.669
visualization but this is a system that
 

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:30.799
visualization but this is a system that
takes in English Portuguese and Spanish

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:30.809
takes in English Portuguese and Spanish
 

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:33.690
takes in English Portuguese and Spanish
okay what do you see that's different

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:33.700
okay what do you see that's different
 

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:39.060
okay what do you see that's different
here separated right I see a big

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.070
here separated right I see a big
 

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.700
here separated right I see a big
neighborhood of red there and so we saw

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:41.710
neighborhood of red there and so we saw
 

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.080
neighborhood of red there and so we saw
this and we're like wait wait wait a

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.090
this and we're like wait wait wait a
 

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:45.630
this and we're like wait wait wait a
second we thought there were indications

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640
second we thought there were indications
 

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.880
second we thought there were indications
of a universal language going on what is

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:47.890
of a universal language going on what is
 

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.110
of a universal language going on what is
that doing there by itself so we did a

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:52.120
that doing there by itself so we did a
 

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.810
that doing there by itself so we did a
statistical analysis for quality of

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:54.820
statistical analysis for quality of
 

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.960
statistical analysis for quality of
translation and we found out that the

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:57.970
translation and we found out that the
 

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:00.470
translation and we found out that the
sentences in this cluster the

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480
sentences in this cluster the
 

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.080
sentences in this cluster the
was being pulled apart they were the

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:03.090
was being pulled apart they were the
 

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.600
was being pulled apart they were the
translation translations were all bad

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:05.610
translation translations were all bad
 

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:10.190
translation translations were all bad
low-quality translations okay so what

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200
low-quality translations okay so what
 

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.980
low-quality translations okay so what
does that tell us it tells us that the

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:12.990
does that tell us it tells us that the
 

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.890
does that tell us it tells us that the
geometry of the space matters that if

00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900
geometry of the space matters that if
 

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:19.010
geometry of the space matters that if
you have a multilingual system kind of

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.020
you have a multilingual system kind of
 

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.070
you have a multilingual system kind of
in the case Google had if your system

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080
in the case Google had if your system
 

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.620
in the case Google had if your system
looks like this that's bad news that

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:24.630
looks like this that's bad news that
 

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.539
looks like this that's bad news that
means that your system is not being able

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:26.549
means that your system is not being able
 

00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:29.120
means that your system is not being able
to cluster in the right way and it's

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:29.130
to cluster in the right way and it's
 

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.100
to cluster in the right way and it's
having difficulties and it's going to do

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:31.110
having difficulties and it's going to do
 

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.260
having difficulties and it's going to do
a bad job with translations

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:33.270
a bad job with translations
 

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.340
a bad job with translations
okay so again visualization here not

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:37.350
okay so again visualization here not
 

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.320
okay so again visualization here not
only to give you a sense of the

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:39.330
only to give you a sense of the
 

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.450
only to give you a sense of the
landscape of what's happening these

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460
landscape of what's happening these
 

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.210
landscape of what's happening these
massively high dimensional spaces but

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220
massively high dimensional spaces but
 

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.400
massively high dimensional spaces but
also giving you a clue of how to start

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:46.410
also giving you a clue of how to start
 

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.830
also giving you a clue of how to start
debugging your system maybe you need

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840
debugging your system maybe you need
 

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.720
debugging your system maybe you need
more training data in in Portuguese

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:52.730
more training data in in Portuguese
 

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.340
more training data in in Portuguese
maybe it's something else but you have a

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:55.350
maybe it's something else but you have a
 

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.700
maybe it's something else but you have a
problem okay so this was really exciting

00:22:58.700 --> 00:22:58.710
problem okay so this was really exciting
 

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.380
problem okay so this was really exciting
because it was the first time anyone

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:00.390
because it was the first time anyone
 

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.470
because it was the first time anyone
could see kind of like an MRI version of

could see kind of like an MRI version of
 

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.850
could see kind of like an MRI version of
this neuro net and the fact that it was

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:06.860
this neuro net and the fact that it was
 

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.650
this neuro net and the fact that it was
functioning at the super-high level it

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:09.660
functioning at the super-high level it
 

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.600
functioning at the super-high level it
was functioning for a language a couple

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:14.610
was functioning for a language a couple
 

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.250
was functioning for a language a couple
of other things I wanted to show the

of other things I wanted to show the
same visualization can let us to

00:23:20.419 --> 00:23:20.429
same visualization can let us to
 

00:23:20.429 --> 00:23:22.370
same visualization can let us to
understand things about our own language

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380
understand things about our own language
 

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.820
understand things about our own language
that I think are very interesting so

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:24.830
that I think are very interesting so
 

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.169
that I think are very interesting so
this is again the embedding projector

00:23:27.169 --> 00:23:27.179
this is again the embedding projector
 

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:32.360
this is again the embedding projector
and you can one of the things I didn't

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.370
and you can one of the things I didn't

is not only do you have these

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:35.570
is not only do you have these
 

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.260
is not only do you have these
projections like T Snead that you just

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:39.270
projections like T Snead that you just
 

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.710
projections like T Snead that you just
saw or PCA you also can create custom

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720
saw or PCA you also can create custom
 

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.890

projections you can say let's look at

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900
projections you can say let's look at
 

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.020
projections you can say let's look at
the English language so imagine each one

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:48.030
the English language so imagine each one
 

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.150
the English language so imagine each one
of those dots is a word in the English

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:50.160
of those dots is a word in the English
 

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.799
of those dots is a word in the English
language okay

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:51.809
language okay
 

00:23:51.809 --> 00:23:56.030
language okay
and now what I want to understand is the

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:56.040
and now what I want to understand is the
 

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.850
and now what I want to understand is the
notion of biases in our language okay

00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860
notion of biases in our language okay
 

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.560
notion of biases in our language okay
you may be familiar with papers like

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:03.570
you may be familiar with papers like
 

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.520
you may be familiar with papers like
this one about word embeddings and the

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:07.530
this one about word embeddings and the
 

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.680
this one about word embeddings and the
fact that you can do you can do

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:09.690
fact that you can do you can do
 

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.169
fact that you can do you can do
calculations in

00:24:11.169 --> 00:24:11.179
calculations in
 

00:24:11.179 --> 00:24:13.839
calculations in
in the direction of certain vectors so

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:13.849
in the direction of certain vectors so
 

00:24:13.849 --> 00:24:17.589
in the direction of certain vectors so
you can say oh look you know in word

00:24:17.589 --> 00:24:17.599
you can say oh look you know in word
 

00:24:17.599 --> 00:24:20.859
you can say oh look you know in word
embedding space if I take the direction

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:20.869
embedding space if I take the direction
 

00:24:20.869 --> 00:24:24.579
embedding space if I take the direction
between China and Beijing if I take that

00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:24.589
between China and Beijing if I take that
 

00:24:24.589 --> 00:24:28.029
between China and Beijing if I take that
direction and I follow roughly that

00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039
direction and I follow roughly that
 

00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:31.719

in Tokyo and so on and so forth so there

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:39.289
in Tokyo and so on and so forth so there
 

00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:42.579
in Tokyo and so on and so forth so there
are these meaningful directions in

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:42.589
are these meaningful directions in
 

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:44.680
are these meaningful directions in
wording bedding spaces that are

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:44.690
wording bedding spaces that are
 

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:47.320
wording bedding spaces that are
incredibly powerful so now let's use

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:47.330
incredibly powerful so now let's use
 

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.399
incredibly powerful so now let's use
that to start visualizing language what

00:24:51.399 --> 00:24:51.409
that to start visualizing language what
 

00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:54.099
that to start visualizing language what
I did here is I went to the embedding

00:24:54.099 --> 00:24:54.109
I did here is I went to the embedding
 

00:24:54.109 --> 00:24:56.409
I did here is I went to the embedding
projector that you just saw and I looked

00:24:56.409 --> 00:24:56.419
projector that you just saw and I looked
 

00:24:56.419 --> 00:25:00.279
projector that you just saw and I looked
for the word book okay and then I

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:00.289
for the word book okay and then I
 

00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:03.310
for the word book okay and then I
filtered all the words by the hundred

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320
filtered all the words by the hundred
 

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.969
filtered all the words by the hundred
top nearest neighbors to book so I have

00:25:06.969 --> 00:25:06.979
top nearest neighbors to book so I have
 

00:25:06.979 --> 00:25:11.070
top nearest neighbors to book so I have
words like biography and publishing and

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080
words like biography and publishing and
 

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.139

00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:16.659
manuscript all the nearest neighbors to
book but then I said okay now I want to

00:25:16.659 --> 00:25:16.669
book but then I said okay now I want to
 

00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:19.719
book but then I said okay now I want to
see these words along the following

00:25:19.719 --> 00:25:19.729
see these words along the following
 

00:25:19.729 --> 00:25:23.320

goes from old to new so the closest the

00:25:27.399 --> 00:25:27.409
goes from old to new so the closest the
 

00:25:27.409 --> 00:25:29.799
goes from old to new so the closest the
more to the left of where it is the

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:29.809
more to the left of where it is the
 

00:25:29.809 --> 00:25:32.289
more to the left of where it is the

interesting now let's look at a

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.070
interesting now let's look at a
 

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.539
interesting now let's look at a
different set of words my ex is now is

00:25:58.539 --> 00:25:58.549
different set of words my ex is now is
 

00:25:58.549 --> 00:26:03.159
different set of words my ex is now is
man to woman and my focal word my anchor

00:26:03.159 --> 00:26:03.169
man to woman and my focal word my anchor
 

00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:06.099

word is engineer and all of its nearest

00:26:06.099 --> 00:26:06.109
word is engineer and all of its nearest
 

00:26:06.109 --> 00:26:08.229
word is engineer and all of its nearest
neighbors so I can tell already the

00:26:08.229 --> 00:26:08.239
neighbors so I can tell already the
 

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:10.570
neighbors so I can tell already the
engineer is closer to man than it is to

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:10.580
engineer is closer to man than it is to
 

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.119

00:26:13.129 --> 00:26:15.009
woman by the way the y-axis doesn't mean
anything it's random just pay attention

00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:15.019
anything it's random just pay attention
 

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:18.500
anything it's random just pay attention
to the X location okay

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:18.510
to the X location okay
 

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.110
to the X location okay
so closer to man I have engineers

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120
so closer to man I have engineers
 

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.180
so closer to man I have engineers

keep in mind is the fact that you're
 

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.650
keep in mind is the fact that you're
training on a biased data set and so

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:15.660
training on a biased data set and so
 

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.160
training on a biased data set and so
being aware of these biases can actually

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:19.170
being aware of these biases can actually
 

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:23.210
being aware of these biases can actually
be incredibly important and hopefully

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220
be incredibly important and hopefully
 

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.280
be incredibly important and hopefully

it would probably show up in the middle

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960
it would probably show up in the middle
 

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.460
it would probably show up in the middle
which would not be very illuminating

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:11.470
which would not be very illuminating

strongly so let's take let's talk about

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:21.830
strongly so let's take let's talk about
 

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.520
strongly so let's take let's talk about
a concrete example the word Bank okay

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:24.530
a concrete example the word Bank okay
 

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.320
a concrete example the word Bank okay
the word Bank can be a financial

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:26.330
the word Bank can be a financial
 

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.210
the word Bank can be a financial
institution it can also be a river bank

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:28.220
institution it can also be a river bank
 

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.830
institution it can also be a river bank
right if my corpus of data that I

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:32.840
right if my corpus of data that I
 

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.120
right if my corpus of data that I
trained on is on financial news there is

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:37.130
trained on is on financial news there is
 

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:38.590
trained on is on financial news there is
going to be a very high pole towards

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600
going to be a very high pole towards
 

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.800
going to be a very high pole towards
financial institution vocabulary right

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:41.810
financial institution vocabulary right
 

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.420
financial institution vocabulary right
and I will see that bias in my data set

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:45.430
and I will see that bias in my data set
 

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.280
and I will see that bias in my data set
hopefully what also shows up if my data

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:48.290
hopefully what also shows up if my data
 

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.060
hopefully what also shows up if my data
set is broad enough is that when I

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.070
set is broad enough is that when I
 

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:54.310
set is broad enough is that when I
highlight that word in the visualization

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320
highlight that word in the visualization
 

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.040
highlight that word in the visualization
here I was filtering but imagine I have

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.050
here I was filtering but imagine I have
 

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.290
here I was filtering but imagine I have
the entire language okay let's say I

00:29:59.290 --> 00:29:59.300
the entire language okay let's say I
 

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.570
the entire language okay let's say I
highlight the word Bank

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:00.580
highlight the word Bank
 

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.760

it definitely lights up all of the

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:03.770
it definitely lights up all of the
 

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.730
it definitely lights up all of the

that's highly connected to that but it

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:08.990
that's highly connected to that but it
 

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.140
that's highly connected to that but it
also lights up stuff like River

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.150
also lights up stuff like River
 

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.810
also lights up stuff like River
elsewhere in the visualization and that

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:13.820
elsewhere in the visualization and that
 

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.450
elsewhere in the visualization and that
is one indication where you're like oh

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:16.460
is one indication where you're like oh
 

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.430
is one indication where you're like oh
interesting there are these disparate

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440

very separate clusters here maybe
there's something there maybe that's one

there's something there maybe that's one
 

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.240
there's something there maybe that's one
indication that you have these multiple

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:25.250
indication that you have these multiple
 

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:49.970

so part of what we were trying to
 

00:30:52.899 --> 00:30:55.649
so part of what we were trying to
understand was what mode at all it was

00:30:55.649 --> 00:30:55.659
understand was what mode at all it was
 

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:58.320

in we had no clue we were literally like
 

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:03.090
in we had no clue we were literally like
if it separates that's fine if it

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:03.100
if it separates that's fine if it
 

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.220
if it separates that's fine if it
doesn't separate that's interesting

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:05.230
doesn't separate that's interesting
 

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.570
doesn't separate that's interesting
literally we were like just give me a

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580
literally we were like just give me a
 

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.980
literally we were like just give me a
telescope so I can look into this world

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:10.990
telescope so I can look into this world
 

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.490
telescope so I can look into this world
and see what it looks like the system

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:14.500
and see what it looks like the system
 

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.279

was working really well so it was more

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:17.289
was working really well so it was more
 

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:20.039
was working really well so it was more

how is it working so well what is it
 

00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:24.629
how is it working so well what is it
doing that it can get to these very high

00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:24.639
doing that it can get to these very high

think it should do this or we think it
 

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.259
think it should do this or we think it
should do that it was literally like

should do that it was literally like
 

00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:43.049
should do that it was literally like

another set of questions that came up
 

00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:52.680
another set of questions that came up
was like well here's a system that's not

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:52.690
was like well here's a system that's not
 

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.799
was like well here's a system that's not
working so well why is it not working so

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:55.809
working so well why is it not working so
 

00:31:55.809 --> 00:31:58.320
working so well why is it not working so
well and so that was the point that I

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:58.330
well and so that was the point that I
 

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:00.720
well and so that was the point that I
was trying to make when I showed Olek

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:00.730
was trying to make when I showed Olek
 

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.269
was trying to make when I showed Olek
this system between English Japanese and

00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279
this system between English Japanese and
 

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:05.879
this system between English Japanese and
Korean that was working really well that

00:32:05.879 --> 00:32:05.889
Korean that was working really well that
 

00:32:05.889 --> 00:32:08.759
Korean that was working really well that
looked like this okay now let's look at

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:08.769
looked like this okay now let's look at
 

00:32:08.769 --> 00:32:10.440
looked like this okay now let's look at
a system that was not working so well

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:10.450
a system that was not working so well
 

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.710
a system that was not working so well
and it's a sister system okay here's a

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720
and it's a sister system okay here's a
 

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.649
and it's a sister system okay here's a
clue about why maybe it was not working

00:32:16.649 --> 00:32:16.659
clue about why maybe it was not working
 

00:32:16.659 --> 00:32:36.360
clue about why maybe it was not working
as well does that make sense yeah sure

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:36.370
 
 

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:46.420
 
in terms of biases oh yeah I think one

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:46.430
in terms of biases oh yeah I think one
 

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:48.430
in terms of biases oh yeah I think one
thing that would be wonderful

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440
thing that would be wonderful
 

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.350
thing that would be wonderful
that I don't know that anyone has done

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360
that I don't know that anyone has done
 

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.950
that I don't know that anyone has done
yet is exactly what I let me know if I'm

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960
yet is exactly what I let me know if I'm
 

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.960
yet is exactly what I let me know if I'm
understanding your question correctly I

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:55.970
understanding your question correctly I
 

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.850
understanding your question correctly I
think it would be wonderful to compare

00:32:57.850 --> 00:32:57.860
think it would be wonderful to compare
 

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.890
think it would be wonderful to compare

00:32:59.890 --> 00:32:59.900
embedding spaces of different languages
 

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.410

right it could be that in English we

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:02.420
right it could be that in English we
 

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.200
right it could be that in English we
have a set of biases that maybe don't

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.210
have a set of biases that maybe don't
 

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.350
have a set of biases that maybe don't
exist in Turkish I don't know but and

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360
exist in Turkish I don't know but and
 

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.100

French how much does that set of how do
 

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.310
French how much does that set of how do
those embedding spaces differ I think

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320
those embedding spaces differ I think
 

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.710
those embedding spaces differ I think
that would be incredibly interesting one

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720

are the kinds of biases you want to be

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:27.619
are the kinds of biases you want to be
 

00:35:27.619 --> 00:36:03.420
are the kinds of biases you want to be
aware of and try to mitigate work around

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:07.720

it is important for me to know that the

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:40.460
it is important for me to know that the
 

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:43.089
it is important for me to know that the
translation to that sentence could be he

00:36:43.089 --> 00:36:43.099
translation to that sentence could be he
 

00:36:43.099 --> 00:36:52.160
translation to that sentence could be he
but it could be she right

or do I want a distribution do I want
 

00:36:56.049 --> 00:36:58.499
or do I want a distribution do I want
you to decide for me what the

you to decide for me what the
 

00:36:58.509 --> 00:37:00.630
you to decide for me what the
translation is again like if I am if I

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640
translation is again like if I am if I
 

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.980
translation is again like if I am if I
don't know the language I'm translating

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:01.990
don't know the language I'm translating
 

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:05.009
don't know the language I'm translating
from right I want to understand what are

00:37:05.009 --> 00:37:05.019
from right I want to understand what are
 

00:37:05.019 --> 00:37:06.749
from right I want to understand what are
the possibilities in my own language I

00:37:06.749 --> 00:37:06.759
the possibilities in my own language I
 

00:37:06.759 --> 00:37:12.720
the possibilities in my own language I
can understand so that therein lies the

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:12.730
can understand so that therein lies the
 

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.329

dilemma it really depends on what do you
 

00:37:15.339 --> 00:37:17.549
dilemma it really depends on what do you
think what do you think the user the

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:17.559
think what do you think the user the
 

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:19.890
think what do you think the user the
users intent is and how do you work with
