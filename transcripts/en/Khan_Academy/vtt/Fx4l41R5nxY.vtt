00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] We already
have several videos

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.232
talking about the Byzantine
Empire which is really just

00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:07.840
the continuation of the
Roman Empire after its fall

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.589
and they even call
themselves the Roman Empire.

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.506
But I wanna do in this video
is a bit of a deep dive

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.980
to make sure we understand
the different elements

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.333
of continuity and change
between what we consider

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.527
the Roman Empire when it
was one unified western

00:00:22.527 --> 00:00:26.318
and eastern Roman Empire
and then what we later call

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:29.795
the Byzantine Empire, so what
was the same between them

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:33.193
and then what changed over time?

00:00:33.193 --> 00:00:36.399
So let's just do a review,
this is what things look like

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.398
at around the year 400.

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:41.447
As you can see from an
administrative point of view,

00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:43.445
even though it was considered one empire,

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:46.268
it was already being governed separately,

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:48.094
the west being governed from Rome,

00:00:48.094 --> 00:00:51.042
the east being governed
from Constantinople.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.861
And most historians mark the
beginning of the Byzantine

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:57.347
Empire with the rule of
Constantine, who moves the capital

00:00:57.347 --> 00:01:01.710
to Byzantium, it gets
renamed Constantinople.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.013
But as we've talked
about in multiple videos,

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:08.180
in 476, you have the fall
of the western Roman Empire

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:12.084
and the west becomes
fragmented, a bunch of various

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:14.958
Germanic kingdoms, but
the eastern Roman Empire

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.282
with its capital at
Constantinople, continues.

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:20.975
And once again, they did not
call themselves the Byzantines,

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:22.603
they called themselves the Romans,

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:24.908
they called themselves the Roman Empire.

00:01:24.908 --> 00:01:26.827
It was only much much
later that historians

00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:29.847
tried to separate this
period of the Roman Empire

00:01:29.847 --> 00:01:32.645
by calling it the Byzantine Empire.

00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:35.794
There is a bit of a
resurgence under Justinian,

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.075
he's able to capture
significant portions of the west

00:01:39.075 --> 00:01:42.553
including the Italian
peninsula but then over time

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:46.258
the Byzantine Empire contracts,
especially in the east,

00:01:46.258 --> 00:01:49.590
it has to contend with
the spread of Islam.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.460
As we go even further in time,
as we enter into the second

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.504
millennium, we can see
that the Muslim Turks

00:01:55.504 --> 00:01:59.632
make further inroads into
the Byzantine Empire.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:01.349
Also during the Fourth Crusades,

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.234
western crusaders sack Constantinople.

00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:08.321
And we can go all the way to 1453

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:12.240
where all that was left at the
time of the Byzantine Empire

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.362
or you could say the eastern
Roman Empire is Constantinople

00:02:15.362 --> 00:02:19.529
and in 1453, that also
gets sacked by the Ottomans

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.911
and that's the official end
of the Byzantine Empire,

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.330
the eastern Roman Empire,
which you can see continues on

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.431
for another 1000 years after the fall

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:30.515
of the western Roman Empire.

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:32.548
Now with that review out of the way,

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:35.090
let's think about how the Byzantine Empire

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.173
was the same and different
from the Roman Empire.

00:02:40.707 --> 00:02:43.645
So first let's think
about the center of power.

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:46.755
Well the Roman Empire is
named after its seat of power

00:02:46.755 --> 00:02:49.799
during the great majority of its history.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.308
The seat of power of the
Roman Empire is Rome.

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:57.041
Near the end of the western
Roman Empire it becomes Ravenna

00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:59.803
and of course we talk
about Constantine changing

00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:02.064
the capital to Byzantium
which eventually became

00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:04.724
Constantinople and
that's the official start

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:06.877
of at least the roots
of the Byzantine Empire

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:09.009
although Constantine was emperor of both.

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.238
It's fair to say that Rome
was the capital of the Roman

00:03:11.238 --> 00:03:14.760
Empire from its early days as
a kingdom all the way until

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.056
the first several centuries
of the common era.

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:21.649
The roots of the Byzantine
Empire are with Constantine

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.686
changing the capital, the
seat of power of the combined

00:03:24.686 --> 00:03:28.539
empire and moving it
from Rome to Byzantium,

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.777
which will eventually be
called Constantinople.

00:03:32.777 --> 00:03:34.914
Now let's think about language.

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:37.944
So the language of the
Roman Empire is Latin.

00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:40.649
In the early days of the Byzantine Empire,

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:44.659
Latin is used in conjunction with Greek

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.556
but over time, it becomes more Greek.

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:50.758
In fact, Heraclius in the seventh century

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:55.577
makes Greek the official
language of the Byzantine Empire.

00:03:55.577 --> 00:03:58.577
Now religion, for most of Roman history,

00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:01.879
their religion is the Roman Pantheon.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.343
Now near the end of what
is called the Roman Empire,

00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:08.838
when Constantine comes around
in the early fourth century,

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:11.565
Christianity gets
legalized and Theodosius,

00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:16.347
who is the last emperor to
rule over both east and west,

00:04:16.347 --> 00:04:20.670
he makes Christianity
the official religion.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.199
Since the eastern Roman
Empire's roots, the Byzantine

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.651
empire's roots are considered
to be with Constantine.

00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:30.359
It has a Christian
nature from the beginning

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:33.974
and it only becomes more and
more Christian over time.

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:37.094
In other videos, we will talk
about the eventual spiritual

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:40.388
split between east and west,
the Latin Christian church

00:04:40.388 --> 00:04:43.335
and the Greek Christian church
and they're going to diverge

00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:46.572
more and more as we go into the year 1054

00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:49.162
when there is the official Great Schism.

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:52.508
In terms of law, the Roman
Empire has a long tradition

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:56.446
of law and I guess we could
just call it the Roman law.

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:58.568
In fact, so profound
has its influence been

00:04:58.568 --> 00:05:00.939
on western civilization that many of our

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.389
legal terms today come from Latin.

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.663
What historians would
consider the Byzantine Empire

00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:10.863
would continue Roman law,
much of it written in Latin.

00:05:10.863 --> 00:05:13.795
Justinian would famously
try to reform Roman law,

00:05:13.795 --> 00:05:16.259
make it more consistent,
make it more clear.

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.676
Justinian's code.

00:05:18.675 --> 00:05:23.208
And you have the emperor Leo
III has the famous Ecloga

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:26.135
but as you have these revisions
and these reformations

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:29.161
of Roman law, they are more
and more written in Greek

00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:31.283
than Latin and they do have more

00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:33.700
and more of a Christian influence.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.936
In terms of governance,
especially under the Roman Empire,

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:42.255
the notion of a province
was the main subdivision

00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:45.940
under which the empire was governed.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.091
Once you have Emperor
Dioclesian come onto the scene

00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:51.456
and this is shortly before
the time of Constantine,

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:56.108
he reformed it and he set up
what is known as a tetrarchy

00:05:56.108 --> 00:06:00.329
where you had these two emperors
of east and west and then

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:03.527
you would have essentially
their subordinate emperors

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:07.025
but along with that, he
redefined what a province is,

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:09.358
so you had smaller provinces

00:06:10.545 --> 00:06:12.935
which then would go into
diocese, which would then go into

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:16.071
prefects, which would
then go into a tetrarch.

00:06:16.071 --> 00:06:18.805
Once you have the start
of the Byzantine Empire,

00:06:18.805 --> 00:06:21.517
they would have elements of this.

00:06:21.517 --> 00:06:24.546
Constantine, remember Constantine
wasn't only the Byzantine,

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:26.823
wasn't only the emperor of the east,

00:06:26.823 --> 00:06:28.930
he was emperor of both east and west,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.137
but he got rid of the tetrarchy
but he kept Dioclesian's

00:06:32.137 --> 00:06:35.437
notions of these smaller
provinces going into diocese,

00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:39.000
going into prefects, so
you have that continuity

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.274
but then later on in
the mid seventh century,

00:06:42.274 --> 00:06:45.323
it was turned into more
of a feudal-themed system

00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:47.255
in the Byzantine Empire, and
once again, this was under

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:51.382
Heraclius who also made
Greek the official language.

00:06:51.382 --> 00:06:53.396
And the reason why I say it's
feudal, it was comparable

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:56.310
to the feudal system in
western Europe at the time,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.757
was that it provided land
grants to local rulers

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:03.354
in exchange for their military
service and the ability

00:07:03.354 --> 00:07:07.104
for them to send resources
up to the emperor.

00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:11.166
In terms of culture, you
have many of the things

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:13.030
that we associate with the Roman Empire,

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:17.197
you have chariot racing,
you have gladiator fights,

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:22.680
you have imperial birthdays,
you have the Olympics,

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.943
which carries over from the
Ancient Greeks that actually

00:07:25.943 --> 00:07:30.110
lasts over 1000 years as we
go into the Roman Empire.

00:07:31.044 --> 00:07:33.863
Some of these continue
and some of them don't.

00:07:33.863 --> 00:07:36.613
So for example, the notion
of chariot racing does

00:07:36.613 --> 00:07:39.177
and famously Justinian
is almost overthrown

00:07:39.177 --> 00:07:44.010
after a rowdy chariot race,
you don't have the Olympics,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.646
Theodosius felt that it wasn't in line

00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:49.886
with Christian tradition,
but you did have things

00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:53.803
like imperial celebrations,
imperial birthdays,

00:07:54.677 --> 00:07:56.220
so the Byzantine Empire
definitely continued

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.598
some of the traditions but
also eliminated others.

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:02.573
So this is a just a rough overview.

00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:04.482
I encourage you to
think about it yourself.

00:08:04.482 --> 00:08:06.103
Are we missing any dimensions?

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:09.523
And what other aspects do
you think were the same

00:08:09.523 --> 00:08:12.360
as we go from the traditional Roman Empire

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.169
into the continuation of the Roman Empire,

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:18.505
which historians will later
call the Byzantine Empire?
