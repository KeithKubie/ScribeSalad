00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now it's time to see the single corner model of a car in action.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The program test different strengths of braking

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so that we can learn about the equilibria that we've analyzed before.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The mass of 1/4 of the car and the effective mass of the wheel are provided

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
20 kg for that effective mass of the wheel is a little on the high side,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but helps to make the simulation more stable.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Your first task is to fill in the initial values.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You want to start with the car speed of 120 km/h and no slip, perfect rolling.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The other task for you is to implement the forward Euler method.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We make sure that the wheel slip never decreases below zero.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This helps to make things more stable.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Your task is to compute x which is the position, V which is the velocity of the car,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and W which is the velocity of the rim of the wheel and then we're cleaning up a little

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to make sure that the velocity of the rim of the wheel is never negative.

00:00:58.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Again, we measure to make things more stable.
