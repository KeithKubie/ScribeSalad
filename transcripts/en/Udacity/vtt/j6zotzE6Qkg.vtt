Hi, I'm Alice Boxhall a software
engineer on the Google Chrome

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.070
accessibility team.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.650
And I'm Rob Dodson,
a developer advocate for Chrome.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.850
We can help you understand how you
can make your websites accessible and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.700
usable for everyone.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.740
We're also working with our
friend Mike from Udacity.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.670
&gt;&gt; I'm Mike Wales,
a program manager here at Udacity.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.450
I'll be helping you through exercises,
so

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.290
you can make sure your applications
are accessible to everyone.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.310
&gt;&gt; Accessibility is a pain to spell.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.200
So we often shorten it a little why, but
it doesn't have to be a pain to work on.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.480
We'll show you how you can get some easy
wins to help improve access ability with

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.160
minimal if it.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.900
How you can use what's built into
HTML to create more accessible and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.600
robust interfaces.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.810
Add some advanced techniques for

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.910
creating really polished
accessible experiences.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.356
&gt;&gt; You'll also see as we go that a great
deal of this work will help you create

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:51.936
interfaces which are more delightful and
easy to use for really everyone.

00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:56.416
In fact, I think a lot of developers
have only a pretty hazy understanding of

00:00:56.416 --> 00:01:00.826
what accessibility means, something
to do with government contracts and

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:02.790
checklists and screen readers.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.540
And there are plenty of
misconceptions floating around,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.795
like a lot of developers feel that
addressing accessibility is going to

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:12.669
force them to choose between creating a
delightful and attractive experience and

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:15.700
taking a box saying that
their site is accessible.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.750
So, what do we mean by accessibility and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570
really like what are we
here to learn about?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.860
&gt;&gt; Well, broadly speaking when
we say a site to be accessible,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.840
we're saying that the site's content
to be available to everyone.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.400
And functionality can
be operated by anyone.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.840
Literally that everyone
should be able to access it.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.010
When it comes to developing sites
which are accessible by everyone,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.000
we need to be a bit more specific.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.460
&gt;&gt; As developers, it's easy to fall into
the trap of assuming that all users can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.200
see and
use a pointer interface like a mouse or

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.640
a touch screen and experience your
application the same way that you do.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240
And this can lead to creating
an experience which might work well for

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.770
a narrow range of people, but creates
issues for anyone outside of that range.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.674
&gt;&gt; Accessibility in that case prefers
the experience of users who might be

00:01:58.674 --> 00:02:00.375
outside of that narrow range.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:03.434
And who might access or
experience things differently to the way

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:06.290
the person we picture as
a typical user would.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.870
Specifically, concerned users who are
experiencing some type of impairment or

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.610
disability and I say experiencing
that because it makes absolutely no

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.730
difference whether that impairment is
situational, temporary or permanent.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.410
&gt;&gt; So with that in mind, let's explore
what happens when we actually do take

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.120
an inaccessible site and
make it more accessible.
