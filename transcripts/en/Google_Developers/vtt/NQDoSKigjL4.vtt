SUSANNAH RAUB: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.060
has asked this question.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.615
RETO MEIER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:10.430
JENNY MURPHY:This is primarily a
question and answer show, so

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.680
if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.510
MANO MARKS: Hi, welcome
to our latest Maps

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.850
Developer live event.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.770
This week we are talking with
Raleigh Seamster from the

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.720
Google Earth Outreach team.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.820
I'm Mano Marks, sorry.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.740
This is Raleigh right here.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.600
And we apologize for getting a
little bit of a late start.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.480
Raleigh is from, as I mentioned,
the Google Earth

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.200
Outreach team.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800
And she just organized a really
amazing event last week

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.510
called Geo for Good.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.630
So we asked her to come in this
week to talk to us about

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.390
what happened.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.290
So Raleigh, can you talk a
little bit about what Google

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.440
Earth Outreach is, and what the
Geo for Good event was?

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.040
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: Sure, so
Google Earth Outreach is a

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.890
program which helps nonprofits
and public benefit

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.110
organizations use Google Maps
in order to visualize their

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.330
cause and message
to the world.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.500
And as part of the program
we offer a lot

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.590
of different things.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.920
We offer software grants
to nonprofits.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.710
We offer trainings, both online
and in person, as well

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.520
as many other resources
on our website.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.790
And so what we were doing last
week was holding a three-day

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
workshop that we called the
Geo for Good user summit.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.040
Now since we launched in 2006,
we've held many, many

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.050
different trainings all over the
world of different types.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.060
This summit was the
first of its kind.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.150
It was a special event.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.120
And the purpose of
this summit--

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.820
usually we're working with
groups that may not be as

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.740
familiar with Google's
mapping tools.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.910
But this time around we were
bringing our non-profits we

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.180
know, different hall of famer
non-profits that have already

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.900
produced amazing work in Google
Earth and Maps, as well

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.870
as some new ones.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.210
And we're bringing them here
to Google headquarters in

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.560
Mountain View to refresh
them in all the amazing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.980
developments in these products
that have happened over the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.550
last couple of years, as well
as some completely new tools

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.420
like Google Maps Engine and
Google Earth Engine.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.160
So the basic structure of the
summit was to have hands-on

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.350
sessions in all of these
different tools, as well as

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.410
break out sessions, giving
participants the opportunity

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.040
to explore and do deeper dives
on topics like KML

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.440
coding and Maps API.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.130
MANO MARKS: Cool.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.610
So we have actually here a few
demos that Raleigh has

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.990
identified from participants
in the summit.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.200
So we just want to go through
a few of these.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.130
This first one here-- if
we can put that up--

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.830
is from Living Oceans.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.950
And why don't you tell us a
little bit about what the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.590
purpose of the site is.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.860
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: Yeah, sure, so
Living Oceans Society their

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.240
mission is to protect British
Columbia specific coastline.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.310
And so they work a lot on topics
of marine planning and

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.610
conservation.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.160
And they had all of these
amazing maps on paper.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.950
And so they've been doing a lot
with Google tools in order

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.800
to put these maps online so
both stakeholders and the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.730
public can explore.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.190
And this map in particular is an
example of how they've used

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.280
Google Maps Engine in order to
bring in different map layers

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.960
onto the same map.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.120
It has this nice widget that
lets you turn layers off and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.000
on and understand
what they mean.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.240
And then you can click on the
individual points to explore

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.900
more information.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.430
It's very interactive.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.090
And they have this embedded
right on their website.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.860
MANO MARKS: So here
you can see it's

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.900
got interesting layers.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.780
Kayak routes, ferry routes,
incidents where there were

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.200
vessels, protected areas, and
you can turn those on and off.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.400
And you see they display here.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.200
So this is using the Maps API,
and it's using Fusion Table

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.620
Layers to render a number of
these different data layers.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.350
And you can see how you can just
turn those on and off.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.460
Let's take a look at
I Love Mountains.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.340
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: So this is
another example of a great

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.740
organization we've been
working with since the

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.690
beginning of our program.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.250
Appalachian Voices is a
nonprofit based in Appalachia

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.990
that works to raise public
awareness about coal mining's

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.200
impact on the region.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.440
They've done a number of
different projects over the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.400
years and this one in particular
is using Maps API

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.300
to display data layers.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.340
So they're pulling in from
various national data sets

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.170
about the impacts of
coal mining on

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.080
health in the region.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.040
So what you see right now, for
example, is data on life

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.490
expectancy changed by county
in Appalachia.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.460
And if you can see it, there's
green markings where coal

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.960
mining is happening.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.810
And then the red indicates the
areas in which the life

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.940
expectancy has lowered by
a great percentage.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.450
And so you can really overlay
these two data sets using Maps

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.510
API and see how the
data correlates.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.040
MANO MARKS: Right, so they're
using I believe KML layers to

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:39.020
render the different regions
where the [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.780
maps basically.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.120
The individual areas where you
see differences in life

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.760
expectancy.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.800
You see where red is-- you
actually see this decrease a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.230
half a year to a year.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:57.460
And dark red, such as in this
region, of more than a year in

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.220
the last decade.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.260
So in the last decade, people
living in these areas have

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.980
lost basically a year of
expectancy from their life.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.690
And they've got other
data ranges here.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.150
So you've got overall well
being, birth defect indexes,

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.620
and a whole bunch
of other stuff.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.280
And you can see overall well
being for a pretty big swath

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.620
of this area has just
dramatically dropped.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.050
And I just really like this as
a nice, very clean, easy to

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.520
use and understand way to tell
the story about mountain

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.310
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.260
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: If
you see above,

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.760
there's a get embed code.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.240
And they do a great job of
making their maps shareable

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.470
across the web.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.590
MANO MARKS: Right, so you can
have a share embed code here

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:47.870
and it's just an iframe.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.555
It's like putting a video in
your blog or putting a map

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:52.240
right in your blog.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.970
Yeah, a really nice way to
pull that all together.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:04.010
Let's take a look at Eyes
On The Forest here.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.980
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: Sure,
this is a project

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:07.440
from the last year.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.100
And what's interesting about
this is the WWF and an

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.690
Indonesian nonprofit called
Eyes On The Forest--

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.760
MANO MARKS: WWF is--

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.250
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: World
Wildlife Fund.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.040
Thank you.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.740
And basically what they're doing
is they're working to

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.100
protect wildlife in Sumatra.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.410
There's a lot of really unique
animal species there such as

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.890
the Sumatran tiger, rhinos,
and elephants.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.580
And the palm oil production and
pulp paper industry on the

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.400
island are very quickly
deforesting and degrading the

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.590
natural habitats that these
animals live in.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.160
And they were looking for a way
to really communicate this

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.060
message to CEOs of companies
that buy the paper and

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.070
buy the palm oil.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.110
And show the impact that this
is having on the island.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.720
So what they did is they brought
all of their data sets

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:06.120
about wildlife habitat ranges,
carbon stocks, forest ranges,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.110
protected areas, and stored
it in Google Maps Engine.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:13.940
And then they're using Google
Maps API as the front end, the

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.880
interface, through which
the public can

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.760
explore these data layers.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.890
And it's quite--

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.960
Mano's going to show you in
a minute-- but it's quite

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.470
interesting, because there's a
pull-out menu that when you

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:28.850
hover over a certain data
set it tells you more

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:30.060
about that data set.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.799
So it's really geared towards
explaining to the public these

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.270
complicated data sets.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.320
MANO MARKS: Right, so as you can
see here from the map if I

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.669
hover over, say the Sumatran
rhinoceros, it tells me a lot

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.050
about what's going on there.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.580
And a lot about the rhinos and
how they are critically

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.410
endangered.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.460
And you can also select the
different wildlife ranges.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:59.610
You can see in 2007 and
then the 1980s.

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.330
And this follows a fairly
similar pattern we saw on a

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.520
number of these different sites,
where you have this

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.930
left nav where you pull up
individual data layers.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.770
Because there's so much data
you want to be able to give

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.000
the user and interactivity that
allows them to select

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.710
what they're viewing and
what they're not.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.800
And I particularly like that
they're using Maps Engine with

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.890
the Google Maps API, because
that allows them to display

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.660
just really large, large
amounts of data.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.420
Now Google Maps Engine is--

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.160
for those of you who
don't know--

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.980
it's a new serving technology
from Google.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.470
We released it last year.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.220
And it's basically storing all
your GIS data and then serving

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.490
it out over Google's
infrastructure.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:56.020
And it allows people to use both
the Maps API but also to

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.770
use their native data format.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.060
So you can upload shape files
or KML files or whatever GIS

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.790
data formats that you have--

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.950
those vector and raster data--

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:12.150
upload them to Maps Engine and
then we handle all the serving

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.090
out of that data.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.570
And you can obviously combine
it with our data as well.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.110
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: And the cool
thing to note about Google

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.160
Maps Engine is that eligible
non-profits can apply for a

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.980
grant of Google Maps Engine
through the Google Earth

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.400
Outreach program.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.080
We'll share with you some links
as to how you find out

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.150
more information about that.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:37.530
MANO MARKS: We'll put links in
the description of the video

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.150
once it's posted.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:49.070
Let's take a look at this
Living Oceans site here.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.470
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: So again,
Living Ocean Society they're

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.240
working to communicate different
marine planning

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.360
issues to the public.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.210
And this site is an example of
using the Google Earth plug-in

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:03.250
API in order to share
different data

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.160
layers on the map.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.350
So they have that left hand nav
that you can turn on and

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:09.810
off layers.

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.430
But the cool thing is that since
they're using the Earth

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.730
API, you can tilt and rotate
and explore in the 3D view.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.750
MANO MARKS: Right, and so you
can see here turning on and

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:25.810
off layers within
the Earth API.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:30.520
And you just get this real
nice sense of the ocean.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.300
I'd like to see them put
something under the ocean,

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:38.730
because you can actually go
under the ocean with the Earth

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.040
API and see things on
the ocean floor.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.080
I don't think we have a lot of
good terrain data down there

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.480
in this particular region.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.520
Yeah, makes for a very nice
smooth experience and allows

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.480
you to display a lot of data
directly in the browser.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.710
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: We find that
using Google Earth resonates

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.660
especially with environmental
organizations that are working

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.560
with issues dealing with the
land and the landscape.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.780
And they love being able to
use Google Earth's rich

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.918
terrain and 3D imagery in order
to communicate those

00:12:12.918 --> 00:12:14.040
issues to the public.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.440
MANO MARKS: Right, and then have
that on the plug in right

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.400
on their website allows them
to have a nice smooth 3D

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.650
experience.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:31.650
And I wanted to show one
map that I show.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.310
This is actually just a sample
that I developed.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:39.700
There is an organization called
Save the Elephants, and

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:44.490
they produce a GP extract of one
particular elephant over a

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:49.880
year period in this
park within Kenya.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:55.010
And you can see on here that all
I did was I took the GPX

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.300
track and loaded it
into the browser.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.610
And then just parsed
it as XML.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:06.870
And using our new heat map and
symbols capabilities that we

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.590
put into the Google Maps
API this summer.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:20.840
So the heat map is a layer and
the symbols are symbols on

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.610
pulley lines in this case
but also on markers.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.560
I'm going to zoom in
a little bit here.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.770
You can see I actually put a
little symbol of an elephant

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.060
on the line, and I'm animating
it as it's

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.550
moving around the line.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:47.380
So you can see the little
elephant moving there.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.740
And basically what we do is we
allow you to do custom symbols

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.350
on maps using SVG paths.

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.490
So we then parse those SVG
paths, render them into

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.730
canvas, and overlay them
on top of the map.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:06.800
And here I'm just changing the
position every few seconds.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.960
I'm changing the position of
the symbol along the line.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.870
Just a very small incremental
percentage.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.390
But I can turn that
on and off.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.830
I can interact basically
with this dynamically.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.310
I can change the color, because
this is all happening

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.770
in the browser.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.490
It happens very quickly.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.330
It's all rendered
in the browser.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.870
I can turn on and off the
heat map as well.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:45.420
And in this case, you can see
I also used arrows on the

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.540
lines between the waypoints.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.950
So I just added a symbol,
a repeating symbol,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.960
that repeats every--

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.510
I think it was 100 pixels
on the line.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.490
You can see an arrow that
basically tells you the

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.930
direction that that elephant was
going at that particular

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.470
time between different
waypoints.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.600
That then turned into a breakout
session where that

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.138
was mostly what I talked about
during that session.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:18.590
Any last minute thoughts
Raleigh?

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:21.200
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: I guess just
if you're interested to know

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.800
more about what non-profits are
doing with Google Maps,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.410
Google Maps API, Google Earth,
head to our website

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.660
earth.google.com/outreach.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.480
We have tons of case studies
and examples there.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.700
We have a section where
you can read about

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.790
our software grants.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.720
So if you are at a nonprofit,
or are working with a

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.100
nonprofit, you can encourage
them to apply

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.650
for a grant if needed.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.380
We also have a developer
marketplace, where developers

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.720
that like working with
nonprofits and are looking for

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.120
work with nonprofits can list
themselves in a marketplace.

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.880
And we also have a page
of training resources.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.380
So if you're a developer working
with nonprofits, and

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.980
you want to give them some basic
training on how to use

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:10.900
these tools, we have materials
that can help you do that.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.930
MANO MARKS: Great, well thanks
for coming in and talking to

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.070
us today Raleigh.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:21.100
And we'll post links to a lot
of these samples and to the

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.090
Earth Outreach resources
in the video and

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.080
on our Google+ page.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.240
Thanks everybody for watching.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.490
RALEIGH SEAMSTER: Thank you.
