00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.390
Wanna be an astronaut?

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:08.250
I hope you like spelunking!

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.630
Hey moon walkers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.920
Training to become an astronaut takes years.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.990
They have to be ready for anything, which
is why they take courses in engineering, medical

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.970
sciences, public speaking, even Russian if
they’re going to be aboard the ISS.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.830
All those things you can learn easily down
here on solid ground, but when you’re on

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.310
Earth, how do you train for all the possible
scenarios in the far-off isolation of space?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.220
You may not realize it but space is a stressful
environment.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.340
To prepare for its rigors, the ESA sends astronauts
through the CAVES course, which stands for

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.570
Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising
human behaviour and performance Skills because

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.690
the ESA doesn’t understand acronyms.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.200
During the course, astronauts from all over
the world spend two weeks in a cave.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.320
They’re deprived of natural light and familiar
surroundings while the instructors throw new

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
problems at them to keep them under constant
tension.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.200
They have to learn to work together, which
is not easy when you’re stressed, your body

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.130
clock is messed up, and you’re dealing across
cultural boundaries.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.840
Training in harsh environments is a running
theme for astronauts.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.069
Astronauts-to-be have been left stranded for
days in deserts, frozen tundra, and chucked

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.609
out of helicopters into the mediterranean
sea.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.289
Part of the goal is to learn to survive in
case of a crash landing, but more importantly

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.659
it helps astronauts learn to get along when
they’re stuck in space with only each other.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.469
Learning to work together is all well and
good, but how do you train to work in a weightless

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.700
environment?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.090
The most well known tool to get astronauts
ready for that space oddity is what they call

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.420
The Vomit Comet, a modified cargo plane with
an empty padded interior.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.490
The Vomit Comet can simulate a zero gravity
environment by flying in parabolic arcs.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.390
At the top of the arc when the plane starts
to descend again, it does so at the same rate

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.289
as gravity.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.619
Inside the astronauts start to float, or at
least that's what it looks like.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.179
Really they’re just falling with style.

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.369
After 25 seconds of falling they start heading
up again, experiencing 1.8 gs before starting

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.369
to float.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.929
They’ll do this about 30 times a flight.

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.750
I think you see where it gets its name.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.510
Floating for a few seconds at a time is good
preparation for what it’ll be like inside

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.950
the ISS.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.700
But they can’t exactly wear bulky space
suits inside the plane, I mean, what would

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.830
you do if you threw up inside the helmet?

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.530
So, to get ready for spacewalks, NASA built
a giant swimming pool.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.120
It’s called the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, or
NBL.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.250
At the bottom of its 23 million liters of
water is a mock-up of the ISS -- although

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.010
not quite as large.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.540
In the NBL astronauts can practice the missions
they’ll be doing in full space suits.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.280
We recently spoke with Astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria
to ask about his training experience in the

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280
NBL:

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.220
"We would do the tasks that we were gonna
perform on a planned spacewalk underwater

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.830
several times before we would do it for real.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.180
You know they have lightweight mock ups of
things or neutrally buoyant mock ups and it's

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.460
actually extremely helpful because when you
get outside it feels pretty comfortable."

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.300
The suits the astronauts wear in the NBL are
weighted in such a way that they are neutrally

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.590
buoyant underwater, meaning that even though
they and the suit can have a combined mass

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.870
of almost 160 kilograms, underwater they don’t
sink or float.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.230
They just hang out, like they would in space.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.680
There are some important differences though:
the drag of the water means that some tasks

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.280
are easier and are others are harder.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.210
And the astronauts aren’t weightless inside
the suit, so if it isn’t fit well and they’re

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.780
in an odd orientation like with their head
upside down, it’ll be very uncomfortable.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.780
And comfort is important, when you consider
that for approximately every hour an astronaut

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.900
will spacewalk, they’ll spend approximately
10 in the pool.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.319
When astronauts are in space they’re dealing
with something completely new to the human

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.010
experience, and the stakes are high if they
get it wrong.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.290
With that in mind, it’s easy to see why
space agencies go to such extremes to prepare

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.010
them here on Earth.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.680
Thanks to WORX Switchdriver for sponsoring
this episode.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.910
If you’re looking for the perfect holiday
gift, the switchdriver let’s you rotate

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.040
between drill and driver with a quick twist
to get twice the project work done in half

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040
the time!

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.069
It also delivers cordless power that’s lightweight
and versatile.

We spend all this time preparing for what
space will feel like, but what would actually

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.419
happen if you went into space without a space
suit?

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.460
Find out here.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.190
You think you could handle a ride on the Vomit
Comet?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.750
Let us know in the comments, make sure you
