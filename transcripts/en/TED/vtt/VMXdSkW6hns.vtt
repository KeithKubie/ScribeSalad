00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.496
I remember my aunt
brushing my hair when I was a child.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.616
I felt this tingling in my stomach,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.720
this swelling in my belly.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.336
All her attention on me,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.600
just me.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.136
My beautiful Aunt Bea,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.960
stroking my hair
with a fine-bristled brush.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440
Do you have a memory like that
that you can feel in your body right now?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.376
Before language,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.880
we're all sensation.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.856
As children, that's how we learn

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.576
to differentiate ourselves
in the world -- through touch.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.080
Everything goes in the mouth,
the hands, on the skin.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.736
Sensation --

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.840
it is the way that we first
experience love.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.040
It's the basis of human connection.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.536
We want our children to grow up
to have healthy intimate relationships.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.776
So as parents,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.856
one of the things that we do
is we teach our children about sex.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.136
We have books to help us,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.936
we have sex ed at school for the basics.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.296
There's porn to fill in the gaps --

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.176
and it will fill in the gaps.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.456
(Laughter)

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.376
We teach our children "the talk"
about biology and mechanics,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.456
about pregnancy and safe sex,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.080
and that's what our kids grow up thinking
that sex is pretty much all about.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120
But we can do better than that.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.296
We can teach our sons and daughters
about pleasure and desire,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.576
about consent and boundaries,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.256
about what it feels like
to be present in their body

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.200
and to know when they're not.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.456
And we do that in the ways
that we model touch, play,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.216
make eye contact --

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.560
all the ways that we engage their senses.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.936
We can teach our children
not just about sex,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.440
but about sensuality.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.456
This is the kind of talk
that I needed as a girl.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.816
I was extremely sensitive,

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.576
but by the time I was an adolescent,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.096
I had numbed out.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.856
The shame of boys mocking my changing body

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.856
and then girls exiling me for,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.696
ironically, my interest in boys,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.320
it was so much.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.816
I didn't have any language
for what I was experiencing;

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.536
I didn't know it was going to pass.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.096
So I did the best thing
I could at the time

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.320
and I checked out.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:24.576
And you can't isolate
just the difficult feelings,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.216
so I lost access to the joy,
the pleasure, the play,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.776
and I spent decades like that,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.496
with this his low-grade depression,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.040
thinking that this is
what it meant to be a grown-up.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.456
For the past year,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.696
I've been interviewing men and women
about their relationship to sex

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.656
and I've heard my story again and again.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.256
Girls who were told
they were too sensitive, too much.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.496
Boys who were taught to man up --

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.256
"don't be so emotional."

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.880
I learned I was not alone in checking out.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.560
It was my daughter who reminded me
of how much I used to feel.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.696
We were at the beach.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.056
It was this rare day.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.216
I turned off my cell phone,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.840
put in the calendar,
"Day at the beach with the girls."

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.440
I laid our towels down
just out of reach of the surf

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.440
and fell asleep.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.856
And when I woke up,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.800
I saw my daughter
drizzling sand on her arm like this,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.016
and I could feel that light tickle
of sand on her skin

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.520
and I remembered my aunt brushing my hair.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.736
So I curled up next to her

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.240
and I drizzled sand on her other arm
and then her legs.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.400
And then I said,
"Hey, you want me to bury you?"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.776
And her eyes got really big
and she was like, "Yeah!"

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.056
So we dug a hole

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.816
and I covered her in sand and shells

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.640
and drew this little mermaid tail.

00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:52.176
And then I took her home
and lathered her up in the shower

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.456
and massaged her scalp

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.240
and I dried her off in a towel.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:57.136
And I thought,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.936
"Ah. How many times had I done that --

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.456
bathed her and dried her off --

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.936
but had I ever stopped and paid attention

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.600
to the sensations
that I was creating for her?"

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.256
I'd been treating her
like she was on some assembly line

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.400
of children needing to be fed
and put to bed.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.376
And I realized

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.976
that when I dry my daughter off
in a towel tenderly the way a lover would,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.320
I'm teaching her
to expect that kind of touch.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.336
I'm teaching her in that moment
about intimacy.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.839
About how to love her body
and respect her body.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.960
I realized there are parts of the talk
that can't be conveyed in words.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.856
In her book, "Girls and Sex,"

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.176
writer Peggy Orenstein finds

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.896
that young women are focusing
on their partner's pleasure,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.120
not their own.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.616
This is something I'm going to talk about
with my girls when they're older,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.736
but for now, I look for ways to help them
identify what gives them pleasure

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.680
and to practice articulating that.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.256
"Rub my back," my daughter says
when I tuck her in.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.240
And I say, "OK, how do you want me
to rub your back?"

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.456
"I don't know," she says.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.760
So I pause, waiting for her directions.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.656
Finally she says,
"OK, up and to the right,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.920
like you're tickling me."

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.376
I run my fingertips up her spine.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.176
"What else?" I ask.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.120
"Over to the left, a little harder now."

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.976
We need to teach our children
how to articulate their sensations

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.640
so they're familiar with them.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.656
I look for ways to play games
with my girls at home to do this.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.256
I scratch my fingernails
on my daughter's arm and say,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.000
"Give me one word to describe this."

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.160
"Violent," she says.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.216
I embrace her, hold her tight.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.000
"Protected," she tells me.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.336
I find opportunities
to tell them how I'm feeling,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.576
what I'm experiencing,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.936
so we have common language.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.176
Like right now,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.120
this tingling in my scalp down my spine
means I'm nervous and I'm excited.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.720
You are likely experiencing sensations
in response to me.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.016
The language I'm using,

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.640
the ideas I'm sharing.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.776
And our tendency
is to judge these reactions

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.336
and sort them into a hierarchy:

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.576
better or worse,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.640
and then seek or avoid them.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.816
And that's because we live
in this binary culture

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.256
and we're taught from a very young age
to sort the world into good and bad.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.976
"Did you like that book?"

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.360
"Did you have a good day?"

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.760
How about, "What did you
notice about that story?"

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.216
"Tell me a moment about your day.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.480
What did you learn?"

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.856
Let's teach our children to stay open
and curious about their experiences,

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.720
like a traveler in a foreign land.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.136
And that way they can stay with sensation
without checking out --

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.496
even the heightened
and challenging ones --

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.736
the way I did,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.080
the way so many of us have.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.296
This sense education,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.896
this is education I want for my daughters.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.696
Sense education is what I needed as girl.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.680
It's what I hope for all of our children.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.976
This awareness of sensation,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.040
it's where we began as children.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.376
It's what we can learn from our children

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.656
and it's what we can
in turn remind our children

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.000
as they come of age.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.376
Thank you.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.520
(Applause)
