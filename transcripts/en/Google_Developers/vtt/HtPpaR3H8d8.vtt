VIC FRYZEL: Hey, everyone.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.240
Welcome back to Google
Developers Live.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm Vic Fryzel, and this
is Nicolas Garnier.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.090
Today, we're going to be talking
about the Google Drive

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.720
SDK and a new way to install
your application, which we

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.850
call the Install Scope.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.990
So just to give some background,
when we first

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.180
launched the Google Drive SDK,
you had to install your

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.220
application using the Chrome
Web Store, and installation

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.360
was required for an application
or to do anything

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.530
with the Drive API.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.850
We've gotten a lot of feedback
about that, and we've since

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.810
changed things a little bit.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.690
So no longer is installation
required for your app to work

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.470
with the Drive API.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.100
It's just required for your app
to show up in the Google

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.760
Drive user interface.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.360
And we've also changed the
installation mechanism a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.900
little bit.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.060
So you can still install your
application from the Chrome

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.040
Web Store, but we've added
a new way for you to

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.890
install your apps.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.180
So the Install Scope is
essentially an OAuth 2.0 scope

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.760
that you add when requesting
an OAuth token.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.500
And if this token is granted to
your application, if this

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.610
token is approved by the user,
then your application is

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.130
automatically installed
into the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.950
Google Drive user interface.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.840
So this is kind of an important
distinction, because

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.020
previously, a user would have to
go to the Chrome Web Store

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.340
and click Add to Drive to
install the application, but

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.210
that's no longer the case.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.520
So this allows installation
of Drive applications from

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.370
outside of the Chrome Web
Store, maybe in your own

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.550
application, for instance.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.700
So today, what we're going to
do is go through how to use

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.250
this scope, and we're going to
show you how an application

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.580
gets installed into Drive.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.610
NICOLAS GARNIER: With
the new scope.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.220
So what would we like
to start with?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.370
VIC FRYZEL: Maybe we'll go
through the documentation.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.790
NICOLAS GARNIER: All right.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.600
So this is the documentation.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.750
I hope you guys can see
that on the screen.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.100
The new Install scope here,
which I'm highlighting and--

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.180
which I'm trying
to highlight--

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.190
sorry.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.430
And guys, if you're familiar
with OAuth 2, you need to send

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.630
user to the grant screen.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.490
And on the grant screen,
you'll get a message,

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.920
depending on which scopes
you are trying to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.790
get the user to approve.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.080
And for that particular scope
here, which we call the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.200
drive.install scope, this whole
scope, you'll get this

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.560
little message, which basically
says My App.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.130
It should be the name of your
application right there.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.430
My App is requesting permission
to add itself to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.290
Google Drive and appear
basically in the Google Drive

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.460
Open With menu and appear in the
Google Drive Create menu.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:43.100
So this is basically going to
enable your app to appear on

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.190
the user's menu inside Google
Drive, which I can

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.130
show you right now.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.630
I have a few applications
installed.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.820
So this is my Drive, and as you
can see here on the Create

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.910
under More, I have a bunch of
third-party applications that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.650
I have installed already, like
Balsamiq, like Pixel Editor,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.870
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.740
Chart, et cetera.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.430
And also, if I, I think,
right-click on the file--

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.650
and here I haven't
right clicked.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.555
I left-clicked instead.

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:17.110
In our Open With, for example,
here, I can with HelloFax open

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.980
the Google document, and
also with [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.390
Writer.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.760
So enabling the Install Scope is
basically going to add your

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.360
application there, basically,
on your Google Drive.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.100
You integrate your application
inside the Google

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.820
Drive UI of the user.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.220
Do you think we should demo
that with the OAuth 2

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.820
Playground?

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.520
VIC FRYZEL: Sure.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.310
That sounds like a good idea.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.385
NICOLAS GARNIER: So I don't
know if you guys know the

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:43.140
OAuth 2 Playground.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.400
The OAuth 2 Playground is a tool
that lets you basically

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.220
play with the OAuth 2 protocol
and use the APIs, mostly

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.780
Google APIs.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.440
I mean, we make it easy for
Google APIs also to work with

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.080
third-party APIs.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.560
So it lets you play around with
APIs and basically with

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.460
the OAuth 2 protocol.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.910
So this is the interface of
the OAuth 2 Playground.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.020
As you can see here, you can
manually, basically, enter a

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.610
scope that you want
to basically

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.760
authorize to OAuth 2.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.940
Since the drive.install scope
is not listed on the default

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.160
list that we have here, that
is kind of convenient.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.463
You can simply write it
down on that text box.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:26.230
VIC FRYZEL: So to be clear, this
is just copied and pasted

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.840
from the documentation.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.920
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yes,
that's right.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.170
VIC FRYZEL: If you were writing
a real application,

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.220
you would request at least all
three of these scopes.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.150
But here we're just requesting
only the Install scope so that

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.070
we can demonstrate installation
only.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.640
This token that we get back
actually won't be able to do

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.020
anything with the Google Drive
SDK outside of be installed,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.030
and that's significant.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.280
So in a real application, you
would request the other scopes

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.550
that we mentioned in
the documentation.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.570
NICOLAS GARNIER: The
drive.install scope only

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.880
enables DUI integration.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.660
You'll not get access
to any data.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.360
So it's important to also ask
for access to these other

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.080
scopes, like the drive.file
scope or the

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.670
Drive wide scope, basically.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.920
So one really interesting
feature about the OAuth 2

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.080
Playground is that it's actually
a Google Drive

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.280
application.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.990
If you can install the OAuth 2
Playground on your Drive, you

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.240
will get an option to open
any file with the OAuth 2

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.940
Playground and basically play
around with the API on that

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.700
particular file, or also, have
the OAuth 2 Playground under

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.310
the Create With menu.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.760
And basically here, if we're
going to authorize the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.980
drive.install scope with the
OAuth 2 Playground, what

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.560
that's going to do is that's
going to add the OAuth 2

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.820
Playground to my drive,
basically install the OAuth 2

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.280
Playground to my drive, so
basically enable the drive UI

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.672
integration that the OAUth 2
Playground has implemented.

00:05:43.672 --> 00:05:45.690
VIC FRYZEL: So the first thing
Nicolas is going to do is

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.250
click authorize APIs,
and this is going to

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.520
spawn the OAuth flow.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.880
So when he clicks this, you see
the screen here asking for

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.590
the application to add itself to
Google Drive, which is the

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.930
exact same screen that's in
the documentation here.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.200
So this is exactly what where
we're about to add.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.750
So when he clicks Allow Access,
we're actually going

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.770
to grant the token.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.070
NICOLAS GARNIER: So we get
redirected back to the OAuth 2

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.490
Playground, so the redirect
step was the first step of

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.560
OAuth 2.0 if you're using the
server side flow and also the

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.810
contact flow, actually.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.450
The second step, if you're using
the server side flow, is

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.080
to exchange the OAuth
code that we give

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.250
you in the URL here.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.330
You can see in the URL when the
user gets redirected to

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:39.030
your application here to the
OAuth 2 Playground, now we

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.320
simply have to exchange
that code for tokens.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.230
So I'm simply going to click
that button, and here we go.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:48.530
So we are getting access tokens
and refresh tokens.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.030
Guys, I invite you to look it
up if you want to learn more

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.720
on the OAuth 2.0 protocol,
which is the best way to

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.460
authorize to use Drive APIs.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.370
Look it up if you have
more questions.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:11.060
Here, we're going to basically
focus on what enabling

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.120
authorizing the drive.install
scope does to--

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.080
I mean, how that adds
the OAuth 2

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.170
Playground to your drive.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.160
So all we have to do here
is authorize the scope,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.640
basically, and nothing else.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.360
We can choose the scope and the
token that was granted by

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.520
the scope to actually
access any data.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.390
What that does is now if I
go back to my drive and I

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:43.160
refresh, now if I right click
on the file in my Google

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.850
Drive, I should have if
everything works right.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.690
See, the OAuth 2 Playground is
now an option, so basically,

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.090
the OAuth 2 Playground has been
installed to my drive.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.950
The OAuth 2 Playground's Drive
UI integration has been

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.480
enabled on my drive.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.130
That's what authorizing the
drive.install scope did.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.980
And now I can use the OAuth 2
Playground like it was a drive

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:10.110
app and perform operations
on that particular file.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.300
VIC FRYZEL: What's important
to note is the Allow Access

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.930
screen that Nicolas just got
was for that one particular

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.770
file, because his application
had never opened that one file

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.030
before, so we weren't requesting
new access there.

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.130
It was just access
to that one file.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.900
NICOLAS GARNIER: Well, since it
was the first time we were

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.510
using the OAuth Playground from
the Google Drive UI, you

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.140
get that prompt, which you don't
get in subsequent times,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.440
which if we were not using the
OAuth Playground-- we were

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.890
using a real application--

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.850
you would typically get
that grant screen

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.760
only the first time.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.310
And after the user has
authorized access and you've

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.130
exchanged the OAuth code for
tokens, the user will not see

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.050
that grant screen anymore.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.430
It will simply go through
directly to the application.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.650
So maybe we should talk a little
bit about what that

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:03.500
improves, what was the former
way to install applications.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.590
VIC FRYZEL: So this enables you
to spawn an install flow

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:09.730
from within an application.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.670
Here, the sample application
we're using is the OAuth 2

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.790
Playground.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:16.080
But previously this wasn't
possible, because all

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.840
installation had to happen
through the Chrome Web Store.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.990
So, here, let's for instance,
take Lucidchart.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.120
If I come to Lucidchart, and I
click Add to Chrome, and I

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.200
click Add, this is actually
installing Lucidchart into

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.650
Nicolas' drive, which I think
you had installed twice.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:41.070
And then if I come back here
to Drive and I refresh, I

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.000
should see Create More--

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.510
Lucidchart diagram.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.230
So that installation required
you to start with

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.610
the Chrome Web Store.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.580
What this new Install scope is
going to allow Lucidchart to

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.420
do is put an Install button on
their own page so that if a

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.220
user with Google Drive lands at
Lucidchart's website, they

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.790
can now allow installation
right from there without

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.150
having to redirect the user
through the Chrome Web Store.

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.940
So we still recommend that
developers list in the Chrome

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.550
Web Store for marketing reasons,
but no longer is this

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:21.620
directly attached
to installation.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.640
So you can still install from
the Chrome Web Store.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.400
I mean, that's fine.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.760
We haven't changed
anything there.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.660
We've just tried to make things
a bit more scalable and

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.815
easier for developers.

00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:30.640
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah, we've
added a feature.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.430
And one particular--

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.530
something very interesting here
is that it makes it way

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.790
easier for developers to
get started, right?

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:40.050
So in the past, you
had to basically--

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.950
to start developing that UI
integration, you had to create

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.220
first the Chrome Web Store
listing, maybe your test

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.070
Chrome Web Store listing,
which takes a while.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.530
You have to enter a bunch
of images, assets.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.630
You have to prove that you are
the owner of the website on

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.780
the Chrome Web Store listing,
and then you would be able, as

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.090
a developer, to install your
Chrome Web Store listing

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:04.660
application and start
developing, start building

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.870
that drive UI integration
on your router.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:12.070
Now, by authorizing a simple
scope, which you have to do

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.210
anyway-- you have to authorize
the other drive scopes--

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.650
you simply get the UI
integration enabled, and you

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.250
can start working from there.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:25.500
It's a really faster way to get
started for developers and

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.080
start coding.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.360
VIC FRYZEL: I think it shaved
maybe 10 minutes off of the

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.340
time to start coding.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.960
NICOLAS GARNIER: Actually,
even more.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.530
I mean, I've created a bunch of
Chrome Web Store listings.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:38.870
If you're not used to it and
don't have the proper images

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.860
of the exact right pixel size,
it would take maybe half an

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.230
hour or something like that
to get started there.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.400
And now we're making
it a lot easier.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.480
In one minute you could even
use the OAuth 2 Playground,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.570
and enter your app's credentials
and the Install

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.550
scope, click Install, and,
boom, you will have your

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.620
application installed
on your drive UI.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:01.850
VIC FRYZEL: So a few
other things

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:03.200
about the Install scope.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.000
If Nicolas were to revoke the
token that he granted here,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.630
the application would no longer
be installed in the

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.900
Drive User interface.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:14.270
NICOLAS GARNIER: So revoking
a token, there's a

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.520
few ways to do that.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.910
The first way is to go to your
Google Accounts page.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.560
And you have a way to view all
the third-party applications

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.360
that have access to
some of your data.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.520
If you revoke the token there
that has the drive that

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.585
Install scope authorized for,
basically what that does is

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:33.910
that uninstalls the application

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.022
from your Drive UI.

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:39.370
VIC FRYZEL: Also, this allows
third parties to do uninstall.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.360
So, here, a Drive developer
could also send a request to

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.880
Google to revoke the token
on the user's behalf.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.280
And given that, the application
would uninstall

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.130
itself from Google Drive.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.920
So it's a little bit more
scalable, whereas, otherwise,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.380
the user would have to go into
the Google Drive UI and manage

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.520
their applications to
uninstall the app.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.570
So I think we can
show that here.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.120
If I go to Settings, and then
Manage Apps, here are all of

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.260
the apps that Nicolas has
installed, and I can remove

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.860
any app on here, and
then just click OK.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:20.650
So that is pretty much it
for the Install scope.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.460
