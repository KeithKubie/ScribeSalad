00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.050
ALAN PRICE: My
name is Alan Price,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.470
and I'm honored to serve as
director here at the John F.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.560
Kennedy Presidential
Library and Museum.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.680
Together with my colleague,
Steven Rothstein,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.870
who is director of the
Kennedy Library Foundation,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.120
and both of our
teams, we welcome you

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.660
to the PEN/Hemingway
Award Ceremony.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.520
I would like to
acknowledge all those

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.950
who make this event
possible, including

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.850
the many sponsors listed in your
program, whose representatives

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.310
and leaders are
present with us today,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.140
and who also join in welcoming
all of you, both here

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
and online, for today's
celebration of writers,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.720
writing, and the power
of a writer's voice.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.990
PEN America and the
Hemingway Foundation partner

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.060
with the Hemingway
Family Award to make

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.958
this extraordinary
award possible.

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.250
We are thrilled to have
members of the Hemingway family

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.360
joining us, here in Boston
and watching online.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.270
Our greetings go out
over the livestream

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.830
to Ernest Hemingway's son,
Patrick, and his wife, Carol,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.590
who are watching from
their home in Montana.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.420
Patrick and Carol
are the vanguard

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.210
of support for the
PEN/Hemingway Award

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
and for the Ernest Hemingway
Collection that resides here

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.810
in the John F. Kennedy Library.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.510
We are honored to be
the world's largest

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.840
repository for the
writer's personal papers,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.050
photographs, and mementos.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.630
Patrick's annual readings
from his father's works

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.420
at the PEN/Hemingway
Ceremony had for decades

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
been an important moment
for us here at the library.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.840
And now, stepping into his
uncle's role this year,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.480
is the writer's grandson,
Dr. Séan Hemingway.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.930
He and his wife, Dr.
Colette Hemingway,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.920
co-chair the Hemingway
Council, which raises funds for

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.350
and awareness of the collection.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.080
And we are delighted to welcome
Séan and Colette's daughter,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.460
Anouk Hemingway, the
writer's great granddaughter.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.540
One of the reasons I was
drawn to the Kennedy Library

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.350
and excited by the opportunity
to lead this great institution

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.380
is the fact that we
preserve and provide access

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.650
to the Ernest
Hemingway Collection.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.100
With over 90% of his
manuscripts and papers

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.150
and over 10,000
photographs and artifacts,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.740
we hold this jewel of a
collection in the public trust.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.460
As Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis expressed it

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.640
so well in a letter to
Mary Hemingway, quote,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.910
"I would be so proud
to have Jack's papers

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.230
in Ernest Hemingway's library."

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.170
Ernest Hemingway's writings
captured my attention

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.710
and imagination and inspired me
throughout my formative years.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.500
I particularly
enjoyed those moments

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.080
when I felt like I
was eavesdropping

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.760
on dangerous situations and
important conversations.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.640
I encountered a romanticism
and heroism that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.980
ennobled me to dream bigger.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.810
There was tragedy that made me
a more compassionate person.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.350
President Kennedy admired
courage, particularly courage

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.100
in the public sector, as
an all too rare virtue

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.840
worthy of our study,
admiration, and recognition.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.320
How do we best develop
courage in people?

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.460
Reading Ernest
Hemingway couldn't hurt.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.520
Ernest Hemingway contributed
greatly to my development

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.230
as a human being.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.680
In keeping with the ideals
of the liberal arts,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.660
Hemingway harness
the power of language

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.790
to develop in me the powers
of observation, appreciation,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.120
and healthy skepticism.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.460
This informal education on life
also carried a secret lesson--

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.440
how to write.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.830
Hemingway shaped my conscious
and intuitive appreciation

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.460
of great writing and the
beauty of the English language

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.180
that emerges when one strips
away ornamentation and allows

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.980
the reader's imagination to
fill in the details of a story.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.380
Now that I am here at
the Kennedy Library

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.270
and have the
occasional privilege

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.230
of holding in my hands
some of his handwriting,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.800
and typing, and drafting,
and redrafting, and editing,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.730
and corresponding, and
cutting, and the craftsmanship

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.680
and hard work that go into the
creation of a sentence that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.440
tries to say something
true, my life

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.110
has come full circle
to better understand

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.470
my own life as a creation
of Hemingway's genius.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.050
I would like to now
share and contrast

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.590
to fragments of writing.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.090
One comes from Ernest Hemingway.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.390
It is the first sentence
of a short story titled

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.063
"The Capital of the World."

00:04:55.063 --> 00:04:55.730
You may know it.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.280
"Madrid is full of
boys named Paco,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.790
which is the diminutive
of the name Francisco,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.170
and there is a Madrid joke about
a father who came to Madrid

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.220
and inserted an advertisement
in the personal columns of El

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.920
Liberal which said, 'Paco,
meet me at Hotel Montana noon

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.200
Tuesday, all is forgiven, Papa,'
and how a squadron of Guardia

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.670
Civil had to be called out
to disperse the 800 men who

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.040
answered the advertisement."

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.140
I do love that sentence.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.530
Within it is a whole
story, a whole world.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.770
It was published in 1936.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.220
I first read the
story in 1979, which

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.710
happened to be the year that
this Kennedy Library was

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.820
dedicated.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.160
And some of you, I
have reminded today,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.900
were here for that dedication.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.820
Welcome back.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.260
This past January, in an attempt
to create something positive

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.960
during the time of a
government shutdown,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.750
I put pen to paper in
my own humble attempt

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.610
to write a true sentence.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.070
The following sentence emerged.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.280
"Having planned and
attained the perfect weight

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.890
at the anticipated
Saturday, Hector

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.260
ate a carefully measured pound
of cheese smothered nachos

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.920
and announced from his back
porch to family and neighbors

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.750
that his body was now
precisely 1% nacho

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.070
before blowing out the candles
and making his only birthday

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.020
wish that would
actually come true."

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.810
As I sit here it,
our challenge now,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.740
faced by so many writers
who look to papa's writings

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.660
like a beacon, is to do the work
necessary to prove ourselves

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.250
more than lesser
copies of the original.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.240
And now it is my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Séan Hemingway.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.380
Dr. Hemingway is the John
A. and Carol O. Moran

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.000
Curator in Charge of New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.700
He is a renowned
archaeologist with a specialty

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.490
in Greek and Roman
bronzes and has

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.760
excavated prehistoric,
classical, and Roman

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.700
sites in Greece and Spain.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.850
He received his doctorate
from Bryn Mawr College,

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:25.850
studied as a Fulbright
Scholar at the American School

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.960
of Classical Studies in Athens,
and has been a visiting curator

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.510
at the American Academy in Rome.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.450
He is the author of numerous
scholarly publications,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.170
including The Horse and
Jockey from Artemision--

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.100
A Bronze Equestrian Monument
of the Hellenistic Period

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.760
and of the novel The
Tomb of Alexander.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.730
He is also editor of the
Hemingway Library Editions

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.770
of Ernest Hemingway's works.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.880
Please join me in welcoming to
our stage Dr. Séan Hemingway.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.317
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.720
SEAN HEMINGWAY: Thank you, Alan.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.030
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.210
It is a privilege for me to be
here with you this afternoon

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.120
and represent the
Hemingway family.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.880
For many years, as Alan
said, my uncle Patrick,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.000
Ernest Hemingway's second
son, would read something

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.120
from his father's
work at this event,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.850
and I would like to
continue that tradition.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.440
Patrick and Carol Hemingway
are watching the livestream

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.549
of this today in
their home in Montana,

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.150
and so I send them
warm greetings

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.950
and a big thank you
for all that they

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.712
have done to support great
literature and the Hemingway

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:45.670
Collection here at the
John F. Kennedy Library.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.260
The passage I'm going to read
to you as an unpublished account

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.680
of the Spanish Civil War from
my grandfather's paper here

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.980
at the Kennedy.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.060
It was written by Ernest
Hemingway in the summer of 1936

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.500
and will be included in the
forthcoming Hemingway Library

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.830
Edition of his novel For
Whom the Bell Tolls, which

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.330
will be published in July.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.980
Here it is.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.910
"During the last 15 months,
I saw murder done in Spain

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.710
by the fascist invaders.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:26.290
Murder is different from war.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.870
Men can hate war and
be opposed to it,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.240
yet become accustomed
to it as a way of life

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.970
when it is fought to defend
your country against an invader

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.220
and for your right to live
and work as a free man.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.850
In such a case no
man who is a man

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.360
gives any importance to his life
because so much more important

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.830
things are at stake.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.880
A man observing this same
war and writing of it

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.010
cares nothing for
his life either

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.470
if he believes in the
necessity of what he is doing.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.330
He cares only to
write the truth.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.780
So when the German Messerschmitt
plane dives on your car

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.080
with all four machine
guns chattering,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.180
you swerve to the side of the
road and jump out of the car.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.650
You lie flat under a tree if
there is a tree, or in a ditch

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.360
if there's a ditch.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.970
Or sometimes you lie
in the open field.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.260
And when the plane comes
back to try to kill you again

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:29.600
and as bullets throw dust
spouts over your back,

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.980
you lie with your mouth dry,
but you laugh at the plane

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.660
because you're alive.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.640
You have no hatred.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.170
It is war.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.330
He thinks your
car is a staff car

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.670
and he has a right to kill you.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.790
He does not kill
you, so you laugh.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.850
The Messerschmitt is too fast
for good ground strafing.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.650
When he pulls up
from the dive, he

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.050
drops some little bombs
like hand grenades

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.200
tied in bunches out of a chute.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.330
They make a big
flash and a roar,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.005
and there is a
roll of gray smoke.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.650
You're still alive,
and the Messerschmitt

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.760
is gone, his motor in a whine
like a circular saw hitting

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.380
a log in a lumber mill.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.340
You try to spit because you know
from experiment that you cannot

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.760
spit if you are really scared.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.780
You find your mouth is too dry
to spit, and you laugh again,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.250
and that is all.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.110
There is no bitterness
when the fascists

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.560
try to kill you because
they have a right to, even

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.590
by mistake.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.700
But you have anger and hatred
when you see them do murder,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.438
and you see them do
it almost every day."

00:11:44.438 --> 00:11:46.422
Thank you.

00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:49.894
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.720
CLARISSE ROSAZ SHARIYF:
Thank you, Séan.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:07.740
I don't think it's fair for me
to follow his beautiful words.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.430
Good afternoon.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.220
My name is Clarisse
Rosaz Shariyf,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:13.530
and I'm the director
of public programs

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.590
and literary awards
at PEN America.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.160
I bring greetings from
our CEO, Suzanne Nossel,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.670
and PEN America
President, Jennifer Egan,

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.720
who wished they could
be here today with us.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:32.730
I also would like to
start by congratulating

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:38.310
our winner, Tommy Orange, for
his extraordinary achievement.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.860
He's the reason
why we gather today

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.080
on this beautiful afternoon.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.170
I'm honored to be here to
celebrate the PEN/Hemingway

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.020
Award, and in an
annual award built

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.420
on the vision and
commitment of the Hemingway

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.200
family, the Hemingway
Foundation, the John F. Kennedy

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.240
Presidential Library and
Museum, the Ucross Foundation,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.150
and the dedicated group
of writers, volunteers,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.910
and leaders who for many
years brought to life

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.360
a PEN community in
Boston and New England.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.670
And on that note, I'd like
to say a special thank you

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.860
to Helene Atwan,
who is here today,

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.210
for many years of leadership
for this special award.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.300
I would like also to thank our
finalists, who are here today

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.200
with us.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.900
Thank you, Viet Thanh
Nguyen, for agreeing

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.730
to be our keynote speaker.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.780
And thank you to you, our
audience, for joining us.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.040
For those who may not know PEN
America, I'll say a few words.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.480
We stand at the intersection
of literature and human rights

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.200
to protect free expression
here and abroad.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:48.160
Founded in 1922,
PEN America's work

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.790
is built on the fundamental
principles and beliefs

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.920
articulated in the
PEN International

00:13:53.920 --> 00:14:00.310
Charter, which reminds us that
literature knows no frontiers.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.360
Members of PEN pledge
themselves to do their utmost

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.320
to dispel race, class,
and national hatreds

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.220
and to champion the ideal
of one humanity living

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.990
in peace in the world.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.880
And I always go back
to this charter time

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.790
and time again to
remember in my daily work

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.360
why we do the work that we do.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.260
Our strength is our membership
though, a nationwide community

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.280
of more than 7,000 novelists,
journalists, nonfiction

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.730
writers, editors, poets,
essayists, playwrights,

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.930
publishers, translators,
agents, and of other writing

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.160
professionals, as well as
devoted readers and supporters

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.190
who join with these
writers to carry out

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.410
PEN America's mission.

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.320
Please consider to join
us in this beautiful fight

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.460
and struggle.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.400
You can join us as a member,
but also as a supporter.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:57.490
And if you are in New
York in a few weeks,

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.690
we will hold our annual World
Voices Festival from May 16

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.950
through may 12.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.320
I encourage you to look
at the schedule online,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.240
and if you are up for
a day trip or more,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.890
please join us in New York
for a wonderful celebration

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:17.320
of literature, international
literature also.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.930
Today we are also
celebrating a long tradition

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:21.610
and a longstanding program.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.000
Since 1963, the PEN
America Literary Awards

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.840
have honored many of the
most outstanding voices

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.750
of literature across
diverse genres including

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.040
fiction, poetry, science
writing, essays, biography,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.180
et cetera.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.730
With the help of our
partners, PEN America

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.200
confers over 20 distinct
awards, fellowships, and grants

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:50.080
in prizes every year,
awarding nearly $370,000

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.030
to writers and translators.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.980
And this is a special way to
close out our 2019 PEN American

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:03.370
Literary Awards cycle, honoring
today our PEN/Hemingway winner.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.810
So today my role is to
introduce and present the awards

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.960
to the winner and finalists.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.970
The PEN/Hemingway Award
honors a debut novel

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.060
of exceptional merit
by an American author,

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.000
and we are glad to have a chance
to recognize some of the most

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.330
exciting new additions to
the American literary canon

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.610
with this award.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.650
Before we begin our
presentation though,

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:31.390
this would not happen without
the work of our judges.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.640
I want to extend
our deepest thanks

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.720
to our award judges, Cristina
Garcia, Dinaw Mengestu,

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.640
and Scott Simon, who generously
dedicated their time and energy

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.280
to the task of reading
the incredible, diverse,

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:51.220
and exciting debut novels
that were published in 2018.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.530
And this year we had an
incredible selection of work

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.510
from different backgrounds,
different places in the US,

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.660
but all vital stories.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.369
I'm going to announce the
honorable mentions first.

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:11.230
So Megan Kenny for
her novel, The Driest

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.650
Season, a coming-of-age story
set during World War II.

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.270
Congratulations, Megan.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.730
Please help me with
a round of applause.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.188
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:44.520
Our second honorable
mention is unfortunately

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.910
unable to be with
us this afternoon

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.440
because he is
currently incarcerated.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.950
But please join me in
congratulating Nico Walker

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.560
for his debut
novel, Cherry, which

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.690
has been described as
the first great novel

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.840
of the opioid epidemic.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.050
Tim O'Connell, his editor,
is here in his stead.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:07.630
Congratulations, Niko, and
thank you Tim for being here.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:30.240
And now to our finalists.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.000
Our first finalist,
Akwaeke Emezi,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.870
is the author of the
novel Freshwater.

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:42.800
Our judges said, Akwaeke
Emezi's Freshwater

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.430
is an inventive and
impressive debut novel,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:50.600
mixing genres and traditions
to explode and explore

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.550
identity and trauma.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.920
A coming-of-age
story, Freshwater

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.750
follows Ada from Nigeria to
an American college campus,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.650
drawing on Igbo cosmology
and contemporary culture

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.680
to explore the
plural individual.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.920
Akwaeke is unable to
be here this afternoon,

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.680
but to read from the novel,
Lily Philpott from PEN America

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.744
will come to the stage now.

00:19:17.744 --> 00:19:21.223
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.890
LILY PHILPOTT: Thank you.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.720
It's an honor to be here, and
I hope to do Akwaeke justice.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.840
This is from the
beginning of Freshwater.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.040
"So there she was--

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.770
a fat baby with
thick, wet black hair.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.110
And there we were,
infants in this world,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:57.950
blind and hungry, partly
clinging to her flesh

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.230
and the rest of us
trailing behind in streams,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.910
through the open gates.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.410
We've always wanted
to think that it

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.180
was a careless
thing the gods did,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.370
rather than a
deliberate neglect.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.350
But what we think
barely matters, even

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.880
being who we are to them--

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.500
their child.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.400
They are unknowable-- anyone
with a sense realizes that--

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.710
and they are about as gentle
with their own children

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:20.510
as they are with yours.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.300
Perhaps even less so, because
your children are just weak

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.060
bags of flesh with a timed soul.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.420
We, on the other hand--

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.070
their children, the
hatchlings, godlings, ogbanje--

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.520
can endure so much more horror.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.020
Not that this mattered--
it was clear that she--

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:38.870
the baby-- was going to go mad.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.030
We stayed asleep, but
with our eyes open,

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.270
still latched onto her body
and her voice as she grew,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:48.320
in those first slow years when
nothing and everything happens.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.260
She was moody,
bright, a heaving sun.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:51.860
Violent.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.600
She screamed a lot.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.850
She was chubby and
beautiful and insane

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.160
if anyone had known
enough to see it.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.950
They said she followed her
father's side, the grandmother

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:04.230
who was dead, for her dark
skin and her thick hair.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.360
Saul did not name
her after his mother,

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.050
though, as perhaps
another man would have.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:11.690
People were known to
return in renovated bodies;

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.860
it happens all the time.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.090
But when he looked into the
wet blackness of her eyes, he--

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.850
surprisingly for a blind
man, a modern man--

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.950
did not make that mistake.

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.380
Somehow, Saul knew that
whatever looked back out

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:29.180
of his child was not his mother,
but someone, something else.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.360
Everyone pressed into the air
around her, pinching her cheeks

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.250
and the fatty tissue
layered underneath,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:37.970
pulled in by what they thought
was her, when it was really us.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.160
Even asleep, there are
things we cannot help,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.310
like pulling humans to us.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.120
Saachi watched
the visitors flock

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.070
around the baby,
concern sprouting

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.110
in her like a green shoot.

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.710
This was all new.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:52.310
Chima had been so
quiet, so peaceful, cool

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.990
to Saachi's heat.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.630
Disturbed, she looked for
a pottu and found one,

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.260
a dark circle of velvet
black, a portable third eye,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.330
and she affixed it to
the baby's forehead,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.720
on that smooth expanse
of brand-new skin.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.910
A sun to repel the
evil eye and thwart

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.710
the intentions of
wicked people who

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.550
could coo at a child and then
curse it under their breath.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.610
She was always a
practical woman, Saachi.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.130
The odds were good that
the child would live.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.740
At least the gods had
chosen responsible humans,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.130
humans who loved her fiercely,
since those first few years are

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.530
when you are most
likely to lose them.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:31.340
Still, it does not make up for
what happened with the gates.

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.950
The human father, Saul,
had missed the birth.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.770
We never paid him much
attention when we were free--

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.280
he was not interesting to us;
he held no vessels or universes

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.300
in his body.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.300
He was off buying crates of
soft drinks for the guests

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.760
while his wife fought us
for different liberations.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.730
Saul was always
that type of man,

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.920
invested in status and
image and social capital.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.170
Human things.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.240
But he allowed her
name and it was later,

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.910
when we were awake, that
we knew that and understood

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.890
at last why he'd been chosen.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:03.620
Many things start with a name.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.860
After the boy Chima was born,
Saul had asked for a daughter,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.980
so once our body arrived, he
gave it a second name that

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.870
meant 'God answered.'

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.940
He meant gods answered.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.610
He meant that he called
us and we answered.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.230
He didn't know what he meant.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.620
Humans often pray and forget
what their mouths can do,

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.450
forget that every
ear is listening,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.820
that when you direct
your longing to the gods,

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.697
they can take that personally."

00:23:27.697 --> 00:23:28.691
Thank you.

00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:32.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:39.038 --> 00:23:40.830
CLARISSE ROSAZ SHARIYF:
Our second finalist

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.790
is Ling Ma, author of
the novel Severance.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.640
Our judges said,
"Ling Ma's Severance

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.050
is a dark and hilarious satire
drawing on the Occupy Wall

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.540
Street movement, the
millennial workplace,

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.500
and our current obsession
with plagues and zombies.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.620
Candace Chen, the
20-year-old daughter

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.470
of recently deceased
Chinese immigrants,

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:08.040
survives a fever
epidemic, outlasting

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.820
most of her fellow New
Yorkers with deadpan humor.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:15.780
But Severance is more than
your average dystopian novel."

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.769
Please join me in welcoming
Ling Ma to read from her work.

00:24:19.769 --> 00:24:23.262
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.060
LING MA: Well, great.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.370
So I'd like to thank PEN
America and the JFK Library

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.540
for administering the
PEN/Hemingway Award for Debut

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.510
Novel and just for recognizing
writers who are just

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.690
starting out in their careers.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:07.480
So much of writing or
any creative process,

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.700
it's a process of uncertainty.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.920
And I think for new writers to
be given some acknowledgment,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.650
that's really helpful.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.680
I'd just like to read very
briefly from the beginning

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.632
of this novel.

00:25:22.632 --> 00:25:24.090
I wanted to read
from the beginning

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:28.350
just because this is when my
process was the most uncertain,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.080
and I really had no
idea what I was doing.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.155
So enjoy.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.080
Can you guys hear me?

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.733
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:38.400
LING MA: Oh, OK.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:43.410
"After the end
came the beginning,

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.980
and in the beginning, there
were eight of us-- then nine,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.910
that was me--

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:50.280
a number which
would only decrease.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.190
We found one another after
fleeing New York for the safer

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.260
pastures of the countryside.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.960
We'd seen it done in the
movies, though no one could say

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.330
which one exactly, which movie.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.070
A lot of things didn't
play out as they'd

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.650
been depicted on screen.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.470
We were brand strategists
and property lawyers

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.200
and human resource specialists
and personal finance

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.400
consultants.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.080
We didn't know how
to do anything,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.340
so we googled everything.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:20.580
We googled 'how to survive in
wild,' which yielded images

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:24.510
of poison ivy, venomous
insects, and bear tracks.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.640
That was OK, but
we wanted to know

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.290
how to go on the offensive--

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:30.570
against everything.

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.860
We googled 'how to build fire'
and watched YouTube videos

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.530
of fires being lit with
flint against steel,

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:41.340
with flint against flint,
with magnifying glass and sun.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.620
We couldn't find
the requisite flint,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:46.560
didn't know how to
identify it even.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.590
And before we tried
using Bob's bifocals,

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.950
someone found a Bic
in a jean jacket.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:54.960
The fire brought us
through the night

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.850
and delivered us
into a morning that

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.250
took us to a deserted Walmart.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.750
We stockpiled bottled
water and exfoliating body

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.600
wash and iPods and beers
and tinted moisturizer

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.550
in our stolen jeeps.

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.370
In the back of the store,
we found guns and ammo, camo

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.530
outfits, scopes, and grips.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:18.630
We googled 'how to shoot
gun,' and when we tried,

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.250
we were spooked by the recoil,
by the salty smell and smoke,

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.670
by the liturgical drama of
the whole thing in the woods.

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.490
But actually we loved
to shoot them, the guns.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.350
We like to shoot
them wrong even,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:35.280
with a loose hand, the pitch
forward and the pitch back.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.020
Under our judicious
trigger fingers,

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.500
beer bottles died, vogue
magazine died, chia pets died,

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.320
oak saplings died,
squirrels died, elk died.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.930
We feasted.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.760
Google would not last long.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:52.387
Neither would the internet
or any of the infrastructure.

00:27:52.387 --> 00:27:53.970
But in the beginning
of the beginning,

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.800
let us brag, if
only to ourselves

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.520
in the absence of others,
because who was there to envy

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.060
us, to be proud of us?

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.770
Our googlings darkened,
turned inward.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.550
We googled 'Maslow's pyramid' to
see how many of the need levels

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.980
we could already fulfill--

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.410
the first two.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.070
We googled '2011 fever
survivors,' hoping to find

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:21.060
others like us, and when all we
found were the same outdated,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.630
inconclusive news articles,
we googled 'seven stages

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.080
grief' to track our
emotional progress.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.630
We were at anger,
the slower among us

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.850
lagging behind at denial.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.800
We googled 'is there a
god,' clicked 'I'm feeling

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.550
lucky,' and were directed
to a suicide hotline site.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:44.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:47.370
In the 12 rings it
took for us to hang up,

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.730
we held our breaths for someone
else, some stranger's voice

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.310
confirming that we weren't
the only ones living,

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.340
despite Bob's
adamant assertions.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.710
There was no answer.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.930
From this and
other observations,

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.690
it was deduced that we
were alone, truly alone."

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:05.190
Thank you.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.662
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:16.803 --> 00:29:18.220
CLARISSE ROSAZ
SHARIYF: Thank you.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.900
And I'll just add
quickly that what

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.570
makes this ceremony
very special is

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.540
that we're able to actually
center the writing.

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.060
And as you can tell,
we've heard already

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.500
such beautiful and
powerful words.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:39.050
So now onto the program with
our winner, Tommy Orange.

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:42.350
His brilliant novel There There
was recognized by our judges

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.950
in their citation in
the following way,

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:51.830
"Tommy Orange's There There is
a devastatingly beautiful novel,

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.780
as acutely attuned to our
current cultural and political

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:01.220
condition as it is to be
indelible legacy of violence

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.260
that brought us here.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.830
This novel is not only
breathtaking but also

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.010
profoundly moving,
as Orange assembles

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:14.210
a chorus of characters whose
collective narrative disrupts

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:17.480
and expands our
literary landscape.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.470
The breadth and
scope of this novel

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:23.120
are matched only by the fierce
and relentless intelligence

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.520
that Orange brings to
his characters, who

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:29.540
despite tragedy,
heartbreak, and loss, reside

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.440
in a remarkable world
of hard earned grace."

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.650
Please join me in
congratulating and welcoming

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:38.843
Tommy Orange to the stage.

00:30:38.843 --> 00:30:42.294
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.190
TOMMY ORANGE: Thank you
for that introduction,

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.700
and thank you all
for coming today.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.385
I apologize for my lack
of professionalism.

00:31:20.385 --> 00:31:21.840
I'm going to read from my phone.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.570
Sincerely, I'm sorry.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.995
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.900
I first read Hemingway
10 years ago.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.570
At the time I was living
in southern Oregon,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.440
commuting 20 miles on my bike
every day between Phoenix

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:52.060
and Ashland, where I worked
for a New Age company.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.550
The guy hired me
because I'm native,

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.050
and he was having
dreams telling him

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:59.200
to bring back the ghost dance.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.780
Not needless to say,
the guy was white,

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.250
a retired record
label executive who

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.740
hired me to ship things
like meditation CD's

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:15.360
and spiritual stones and
scented, colored aura sprays.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.130
I was reading Hemingway
because of the way

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:19.890
I'd heard writers
who wrote about how

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.140
to write revere his writing.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.990
I read all of his short
stories that summer.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:30.620
I was then writing objectively
unreadable short, short stories

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.290
the length of
then-limited tweets.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:38.630
I had quit my job
to write and read

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.960
as much as possible in
isolation in southern Oregon,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.500
staying with a woman who had
advertised a room for cheap

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.660
in an artist's commune.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.820
When I got to her door,
I found a six foot tall

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:53.690
wooden engraving of the
named Jesus on fire,

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.870
and exactly zero other
artists living there.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:58.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:03.570
I kept to myself that summer,
read Hemingway, shipped New Age

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:09.060
novels with talking dogs in
them all over the country.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:12.448
By then, I knew all I
wanted to do was write,

00:33:12.448 --> 00:33:13.990
and I was just
starting to understand

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.480
the work you need
to put in to just

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.820
have a chance at writing well.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.240
Hemingway was part of that.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:28.300
I never even dreamed of
anything close to this.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.960
I'd like to thank the Hemingway
Foundation for acknowledging me

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.630
in this way, for all the work
that it takes to get someone

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:37.690
like me here, for
creating this award,

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:40.870
and acknowledging a new writer.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:43.030
Thank you to Viet
for his presence

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.370
here today, for his
work, and for the person

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.050
he is in the publishing
world, the way

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.120
he carries himself
and asks us to be

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.110
better writers and humans.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.940
I'd like to thank everyone
at PEN America for the work

00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:00.800
they're doing in our world.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.090
And to everyone at Knopf,
my publicist, Gabrielle,

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:08.460
and my wonderful editor, Jordan,
and my agent, Nicole Aragi.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:11.520
Thank you to my wife and
son for putting up with me,

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.429
both while writing the
book and now for putting up

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.760
with me being gone so much.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:20.550
I couldn't have done it
without their love and belief,

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:24.310
nor without the love
and belief and reception

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.810
I've gotten for the book
since it's been out.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.750
So I'm going to read--

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:37.170
there were originally--
the version of the book

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:44.130
that I sent to my agent had
two references to Hemingway.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.860
One of them was cut with the
death of a character that never

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:49.800
made it, so I'm going to
read from the part that

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.179
made it, obviously.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.094
Are both of these functional?

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.040
Sorry.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.150
"Bill Davis.

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:13.620
Bill moves through the bleachers
with the slow thoroughness

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.110
of one who's had a job too long.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:21.180
He slogs along, plods,
but not without pride.

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.640
He immerses himself in his job.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.370
He likes to have something
to do to feel useful,

00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:30.510
even if that work, that job,
is currently in maintenance.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:35.050
He's picking up garbage missed
by the initial post-game crew.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.480
It's a job for the old guy
they can't fire because he's

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.980
been there so long.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.780
He knows.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:45.410
But he also knows he means
more than that to them,

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.020
because don't they count on
him to cover their shifts?

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.990
Wasn't he available any day
of the week for any shift?

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.000
Didn't he know the ins
and outs of that Coliseum

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.280
better than anyone?

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.220
Hadn't he'd done almost every
single available job over all

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.860
the years he'd worked there?

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.170
From security, where
he started, all the way

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:07.370
to peanut vendor, a job he'd
only done once and hated.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.370
He tells himself he means more.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:14.420
He tells himself he can
tell himself and believe it,

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.500
but it's not true.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.510
There's no room here
for old people like Bill

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.360
anymore, anywhere.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:28.180
Bill makes an arc like the
bill of a hat with his hand

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.310
and puts it on his
forehead to block the sun.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.140
He wears light
blue latex gloves,

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.880
holds his trash
grabber in one hand,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:38.830
and a clearish gray
garbage bag and the other.

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:40.840
He stops what he's doing.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.390
He thinks he sees something
come over the top rim

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:47.140
of the stadium, a small
thing, an unnatural movement,

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.640
definitely not a seagull.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.450
Bill shakes his head,
spits on the ground

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.960
then steps on the
spit, pivots, then

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.430
squints to try to see
what it is up there.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.780
His phone vibrates
in his pocket.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.840
He pulls it out and sees that
it's his girlfriend, Karen.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:07.460
No doubt it's about
her man boy son, Edwin.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.640
Lately, she's been calling
all the time about him, mostly

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.800
about him needing
rides to and from work.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.290
Bill can't stand the
way she babies him,

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:20.040
can't stand the
30-odd-year-old baby he is,

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:23.880
can't stand what the youth are
allowed to become these days,

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.300
coddled babies all of them,
with no trace of skin,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.720
no toughness left.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.610
There's something
wrong about all of it,

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.760
something about the ever-present
phone glow on their faces

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.340
or the too fast way
they tap their phones,

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.490
their gender fluid
fashion choices,

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:43.130
their hyper-PC gentle way of
being, while lacking all social

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.960
graces in old world
manners and politeness.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.350
Edwin's this way too,
tech savvy, sure,

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.440
but when it comes to the
real, cold, hard, gritty world

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.920
outside beyond the screen,
without the screen,

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.830
he's a baby.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.110
Yes, things look bad these days.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.790
Everyone talks like
it's getting better,

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.100
and that just makes it all the
worse that it's still so bad.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.080
It's the same with his own life.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.910
Karen tells him
to stay positive,

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:11.740
but you have to
achieve positivity

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.360
in order to maintain it.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.630
He loves her though, all
the way, and he tries,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.480
he really tries, to
see it as being OK.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.420
It just seems like young people
have taken over the place.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.110
Even the old people in charge,
they're acting like kids.

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:30.410
There's no more scope,
no vision, no depth.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:33.110
We want it now,
and we want it new.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.140
This world is a mean
curve ball thrown

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.230
by an overly-excited
steroid-fueled kid pitcher who

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.230
no more cares about the
integrity of the game

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.810
than he does about the Costa
Ricans who painstakingly stitch

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.500
the balls together by hand.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.660
The field is setup for baseball.

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.040
The grass is so short
it doesn't move.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.260
It is the oak cork stillness
of the center of a baseball.

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.000
The grass is chalked
to straight lines

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.825
that separate foul and fair
that reach out to the stands

00:39:00.825 --> 00:39:02.950
and back toward the infield,
where the players play

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:06.700
the game, where they pitch
and swing and steal and tag,

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.820
where they signal and hit
and strike and ball, score

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:13.480
runs, where they sweat and
wait in the shade of the dugout

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.600
just chewing and spitting
until all the innings run out.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.010
Bill's phone rings again.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.008
This time he answers.

00:39:21.008 --> 00:39:21.800
"Karen, what is it?

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.888
I'm working."

00:39:23.888 --> 00:39:25.680
"I'm so sorry to bother
you at work, honey,

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.290
but Edwin needs to
be picked up later.

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.590
He just can't, you
know, after what

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.942
happened to him on the bus."

00:39:33.942 --> 00:39:35.150
"You know how I feel about--"

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:37.760
"Bill, please just
do it this time.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.380
I'll have a talk with him later.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.460
I'll let him know he can't count
on you anymore," Karen says.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:45.140
Count on you anymore.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.210
Bill hates the way
she can turn it on him

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:49.370
with just a few choice words.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:50.540
"Don't put it like that.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:52.250
Put it on him.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.680
He needs to be able to
make it on his own now.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.490
He's--"

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.990
"At least he's got a job now.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:58.800
He's working every day.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.710
That's a lot for him.

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.070
Please.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.310
I don't want to discourage him.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.310
The goal is to get him out
there on his own, remember?

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.370
And then we can talk about you
being able to move in finally,"

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:11.740
Karen says, her voice sweet now.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.790
"OK."

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:14.020
"Really?

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:14.560
Thanks, hon.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.930
If you could pick
up a box of Franzia

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.840
on the way home, the pink one.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.180
Were out."

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.930
"You owe me tonight,"
Bill says, and hangs

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.000
up before she can respond.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.300
Bill looks around the stadium
appreciating the stillness.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.110
He needs this kind of
stillness, clean of movement.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.245
He thinks about the
incident on the bus, Edwin.

00:40:35.245 --> 00:40:38.740
It could still make Bill
laugh just to think of it.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.040
He smiles a smile
he can't contain.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.020
On his first day of
work, Edwin got into it

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.210
with a vet on the bus.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.550
Bill doesn't know how it
started, but whatever happened,

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.827
the bus driver ended up kicking
both of them off the bus.

00:40:51.827 --> 00:40:54.160
Then the guy chased Edwin all
the way down International

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.970
in his wheelchair.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:59.058
Luckily, he chased him
the right direction,

00:40:59.058 --> 00:41:00.850
and Edwin made it to
work on time despite--

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.300
--getting kicked off the bus,
probably because he got chased.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.380
Bill laughs out loud
thinking about Edwin

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.770
running for his life
down International,

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.640
making it in on time
to work a sweaty mess.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.900
Well, that part
wasn't funny actually.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.380
That part made it sad.

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.050
Bill walks by a metal
surface on the east wall.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:25.330
He sees himself reflected there.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:28.560
He studies is unstable,
distorted reflection

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.090
in the dented metal paneling,
straightens his shoulders,

00:41:31.090 --> 00:41:32.740
picks up his chin.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.840
The guy in the black
windbreaker there,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.940
whose hair is fully
gray and receding

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.440
and whose stomach
comes out a little

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.870
more each year, whose feet
and knees hurt when he stands

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:43.540
or walks too long, he's OK.

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:46.050
He's making it.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.870
He could easily
not be making it.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:52.480
He's almost always
not been making it.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.790
This Coliseum, the team,
the Oakland Athletics,

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.150
had once been the most important
thing in the world for Bill

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:04.000
during that magical time for
Oakland, 1972 to 1974, when

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.770
the A's won three
World Series in a row.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.490
You don't see that
happen anymore.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.330
It's too much of a business now.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.530
They would never allow that.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.070
Those were strange years
for Bill, bad, awful years.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.910
He'd gotten back from Vietnam
after going AWOL in '71,

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.860
dishonorably discharged.

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:26.070
He hated the country, and
the country hated him.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.170
There were so many drugs
coursing through him then

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:30.780
it was hard to believe he
could still remember any of it.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.210
Most of all, he
remembers the games.

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.280
The games were all he had then.

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.200
He had his teams, and they were
winning, three years in a row

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.170
right when he
needed it after what

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.960
felt to Bill like a
lifetime of losing.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.390
Those were the years of
Vida Blue, Catfish Hunter,

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.110
Reggie Jackson, the
bastard Charlie Finley.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.750
And then when the Raiders
won in '76 two championships

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.880
that San Francisco
teams hadn't won yet,

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.250
it was a really good
time to be from Oakland,

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.960
to feel that you were from
that thing, that winning.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.890
He got hired at the
Coliseum in 1989

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.220
after doing five years at
San Quentin for stabbing

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.740
a guy outside a biker
bar on Fruitvale

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.080
down by the railroad tracks.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.840
It wasn't even Bill's knife.

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.710
The stabbing was coincidental.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:17.540
It was self-defense.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.910
He didn't know how the
knife ended up in his hand.

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.650
Sometimes you just did things.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.165
You acted or reacted
the way you needed to.

00:43:24.165 --> 00:43:25.790
The problem had been
that Bill couldn't

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.560
get his own story straight.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:29.390
The other guy had
been less drunk,

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.190
had a more consistent story.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.740
So Bill took the fall.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.780
It was his knife
somehow in the end.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.200
He was the one with a history
of violence, the crazy AWOL

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.030
Vietnam vet.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.010
But jail had been good to Bill.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.433
He read almost the
whole time he was in.

00:43:45.433 --> 00:43:46.850
He read all the
Hunter S. Thompson

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:49.060
he could get his hands on.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.710
He read Hunter's lawyer,
Oscar Zeta Acosta.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:54.240
He loved The Autobiography
of a Brown Buffalo

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.140
and The Revolt of
the Cockroach People.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.140
He read Fitzgerald and
Hemingway, Carver and Faulkner,

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.640
all the drunks.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.890
He read Ken Kesey.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.260
He loved One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.122
He was pissed when
they made the movie

00:44:08.122 --> 00:44:10.580
and the native guy, who was
the narrator of the whole book,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.680
just played the crazy,
silent, stoic Indian

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.410
who threw the sink through
the window at the end.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.900
He read Richard
Brautigan, Jack London.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.580
He read history
books, biographies,

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.830
books about the prison
system, books about baseball,

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:24.320
football, California
native history.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.450
He read Stephen King
and Elmore Leonard.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:28.980
He read, and he
kept his head down,

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.272
let the years dissolve the
way they could when you were

00:44:31.272 --> 00:44:37.110
somewhere else inside them, in a
book, on the block, in a dream.

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.840
Another good year that came
out of bad times for Bill

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.375
was 1989, when the A's swept
the San Francisco Giants.

00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:45.000
When in the middle
of the World Series,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.730
just before the start of game
three, the earth slipped,

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:49.950
dropped, quaked.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.560
The Loma Prieta earthquake
killed 63 people,

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.110
or 63 people died because of it.

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.870
The Cypress Freeway
collapsed, and someone

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.210
drove right off the Bay
Bridge where a section

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.160
had collapsed in the middle.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.260
That was the day
baseball saved lives

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.660
in Oakland and the
greater Bay Area.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.880
If more people hadn't
been at home sitting

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.500
around the TV watching
the game, they

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.540
would have been on freeways.

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.840
They would have been out in the
world where it was collapsing,

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.120
just falling apart."

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.019
Thank you.

00:45:19.019 --> 00:45:22.442
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:38.882 --> 00:45:40.090
SHARON DYNAK: Good afternoon.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:44.830
I'm Sharon Dynak, President
of Ucross Foundation.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:49.510
Raymond Plank, the founder of
Ucross, was a force of nature.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.570
He grew up in Minnesota,
the son of a farmer;

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:56.230
graduated from Yale; became
a World War II bomber

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:00.520
pilot; founded an international
oil and gas company, Apache

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.940
Corporation; started other
nonprofits, such as the Fund

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.630
for Teachers; and in
1981, he had the vision

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.530
to create an artistic
oasis in Ucross, Wyoming,

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:14.530
population, 25.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.470
I first met Raymond
over 20 years ago

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:21.760
at this same literary
event that we are at today.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:25.990
He passed away last
November at the age of 96

00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:29.740
at his beloved home in
Ucross surrounded by family,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:34.570
and outside by wild turkeys
that he had kept well-fed, owls,

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:37.090
bald eagles, and
towering trees that he

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:40.570
himself had planted
40 years earlier.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.640
Ucross is a one of
a kind residency

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.820
that gives some of the world's
most gifted individuals

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:49.690
the opportunity to work in
beautiful studios on a 20,000

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:54.880
acre ranch on the majestic high
plains of the American West.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.470
We offer the rare gift of
uninterrupted time to create.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.290
The vastness of the
landscape translates

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:05.290
into a vastness of imagination.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.720
More than 2,000
writers, visual artists,

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.560
and composers have spent time
at Ucross, and all of them

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:14.080
would tell you that
Raymond created

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.630
something very special there.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.150
Ucross has partnered with
the PEN/Hemingway Awards

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:24.730
since 1996, an idea that came
from Annie Proulx, who was

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:26.800
a Ucross trustee at the time.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.740
She had written her first
two novels at Ucross.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:32.650
She'd served as a
judge and suggested

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:36.430
that we offer more support
to emerging writers in whose

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:39.040
work she saw so much potential.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.570
Since then, Ucross has given
residencies to 65 PEN/Hemingway

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:48.070
honorees, including Colson
Whitehead, Elizabeth Gilbert,

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:52.900
Ha Jin, Yaa Gyasi, Kevin
Powers, and Sigrid Nunez,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.440
who won the National Book
Award just last year.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.660
When Raymond was a
first grader, a teacher

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.420
suggested he write
a diary in order

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.270
to improve his penmanship.

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.310
He kept the diary
his entire life.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.180
He became a book lover
and read constantly,

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.780
logging the names of
every book he read.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.060
In his last years,
he wrote a memoir

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.430
that he chose to call
A Small Difference,

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:21.220
noting that all of us
have the chance to leave

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:23.800
the world a better place.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.810
Raymond had a number
of things in common

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.440
with Ernest Hemingway.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.420
He hunted all over the world.

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.440
He loved to fish,
including in Michigan.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.980
They were both
legendary pipe smokers.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:37.990
They both loved Wyoming.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.340
One of Raymond's favorite
toasts was, "To courage."

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:45.520
His legacy to all of us
at Ucross and for writers

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.400
everywhere is to continue to
approach life courageously

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:56.800
with curiosity, enthusiasm,
and intensity, to make time

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.930
for the work.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:01.150
He set the Ucross
magic in motion,

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:04.750
and supporting writers,
like these amazing writers

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:08.710
that we're honoring today, is
what keeps the magic alive.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.700
So congratulations to all
of this year's PEN/Hemingway

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.780
honorees.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.790
We hope to see you in
Wyoming one day soon.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:17.290
Thank you.

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.713
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.430
HILLARY JUSTICE: Good afternoon.

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:36.340
My name is Dr. Hillary Justice.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.860
I have the honor and
privilege of serving

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.860
as the Ernest Hemingway
Collection's Hemingway scholar

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:44.680
in residence, a position
that literally would not

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.650
exist if it weren't for
Patrick and Carol Hemingway.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.490
So as everyone else has,
Patrick and Carol, we miss you,

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:55.210
and we wish you were
here with us today.

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.150
In 1976, Ernest
Hemingway's widow, Mary,

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.730
established the
PEN/Hemingway Award

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:02.680
to raise awareness
of and support

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.940
for beginning writers working
in the genre of fiction.

00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.430
In 1980, when the
Hemingway Collection

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:12.760
was dedicated by Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis and Patrick

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.570
Hemingway, it was a great
day for the John F. Kennedy

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:17.920
Library.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:22.550
10 years later, at the
10th birthday celebration,

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:25.720
if you will, of the
Hemingway Collection,

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.060
the International Hemingway
Foundation and Society

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:32.650
held its conference here, and
they brought in Mrs. Kennedy--

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.930
then Mrs. Onassis, forgive me--

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.820
as a guest of honor.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.340
And a very dear friend
of mine, and my mentor

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:42.130
in Hemingway studies,
Dr. Susan Beegel,

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:43.990
had the honor of
sitting with her

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:47.680
at dinner when she got an idea.

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:52.720
So if you'll allow me to share
with you a once upon a time--

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.750
once upon a time at a gala in
the pavilion here at the JFK

00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:00.880
Library, the president's widow,
Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:05.620
Onassis, was there in a yellow
raw silk suit and her signature

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.872
pearls enjoying birthday cake.

00:51:09.872 --> 00:51:11.830
And she looked around
and she said, wouldn't it

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.830
be great if we had the
PEN/Hemingway Award here

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:18.390
at the JFK Library every year.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:22.170
And Susan Beagle informs me that
she said it in that first lady

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:23.460
way of, make it so.

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:29.110
And so it was done.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:34.330
The PEN/Hemingway Award
has been given here

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.270
at the John F. Kennedy
Library and Museum every year

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.770
ever since.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.310
And until ill health
prevented her from attending,

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:46.480
Mrs. Kennedy Onassis would
come and warmly congratulate

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.260
the winners.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.110
And I'm sure that in
spirit she's congratulating

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.910
our honorees today as well.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:58.510

Foundation, the Asian Cultural

could basically keep

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:11.250
reading for the next. hour.

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:14.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.220
But instead, please join me in
welcoming our keynote speaker,

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.450
Dr. Viet Thanh Nguyen.

00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:21.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:31.870
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Thank you.

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.440
Thank you, Dr. Justice, for that
incredibly long introduction.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.720
I almost fell asleep myself.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.830
Thank you to the JFK Library
and to the Ernest Hemingway

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:44.410
Collection for hosting
the PEN/Hemingway Awards.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.010
Good afternoon, Boston.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.670
It is so good to be back here on
the occasion of congratulating

00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:55.630
Tommy Orange on his
fabulous novel, There There.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:56:00.160
For those of you who haven't
read it, shame on you.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:01.720
It's terrific.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.580
You won't regret it.

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:08.460
Last summer, I had the pleasure
of meeting Tommy in Paris.

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.960
That's actually the
entire anecdote.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.060
I just wanted to say we
saw each other in Paris.

00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.200
I think we should all
have the opportunity

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.575
at one point in
our lives to say,

00:56:14.575 --> 00:56:17.010
we saw each other in Paris.

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:19.600
It's like something that
Ernest Hemingway would say--

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:26.810
saw Spot, Gertrude, Alice,
on the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:28.560
I'm taking adult French
classes right now,

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.100
just want to show that off.

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.910
Hemingway has certainly been
on my mind for a long time.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:35.430
I remember when I was 18.

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:39.240
I was a college freshman,
wanted to be a writer.

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.640
Told my college
freshman roommate,

00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.530
I'm going to be a writer.

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.330
And thinking of
Hemingway, I told him,

00:56:45.330 --> 00:56:49.650
I'm going to publish my
first novel when I'm 25.

00:56:49.650 --> 00:56:52.560
Got to 25, be another
19 years before I

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.900
published my first novel, so
clearly I am no Hemingway.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.390
What I am is a refugee.

00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:01.950
And it may seem a
little odd for me

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:03.450
to say that in
the present tense,

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:05.790
because if you look at
me, it's clearly the case

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:09.630
that I made the transition
from refugee to bourgeoisie

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:10.410
a long time ago.

00:57:10.410 --> 00:57:13.763
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.380
From camps to clubs.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.900
Very exclusive clubs, such as
the JFK Presidential Library.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.150
Such an honor to be here.

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.140
And when I realized this event
would be hosted at the JFK

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.840
Presidential Library, I
remembered that I had actually

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.980
quoted John F. Kennedy earlier
this semester in my class

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:36.590
on the American War in Vietnam,
so on the airplane flight

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:41.120
over, I looked up my PowerPoint
slide to that quotation.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.600
John F. Kennedy was a
senator at the time in 1957,

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.980
and of course, Indochina,
as it was called--

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:48.800
Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam--

00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:51.920
were on the American radar.

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:54.920
And speaking of Indochina,
John F. Kennedy said,

00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.760
"This is our offspring."

00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:03.750
So as one of JFK's offspring,
I would like to say, dad,

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:04.320
I'm home.

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:07.792
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:11.205 --> 00:58:12.830
Coming to United
States was not exactly

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:14.000
like coming home for me.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.470
I was a refugee, as I mentioned.

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:18.680
I was born in 1971, came
here in 1975 at four

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:23.508
years of age along with 130,000
other Vietnamese refugees.

00:58:23.508 --> 00:58:25.550
And we ended up in one of
four refugee camps that

00:58:25.550 --> 00:58:28.070
were set up to take care of us.

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:30.472
Ours was Fort Indiantown
Gap in Pennsylvania.

00:58:30.472 --> 00:58:32.180
And in order to leave
one of these camps,

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:35.990
a refugee had to have
a sponsor to guarantee

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:39.110
that they wouldn't be a
drain on the American state.

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.480
The problem for
my family of four

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.990
was that there was not a sponsor
who would take all four of us.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:46.790
So one sponsor took my parents.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.680
One sponsor took my
10-year-old brother.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.170
One sponsor took
four-year-old me.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:53.840
And that's where
my memories began,

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:58.070
being taken away from my
parents howling and screaming.

00:58:58.070 --> 00:59:00.362
And I'm a father now of a
five and a half year-old son,

00:59:00.362 --> 00:59:02.487
and when he turned four,
it was the occasion for me

00:59:02.487 --> 00:59:04.040
to look back on
this time in my life

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.730
that I had tried to suppress,
it had been so painful.

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:09.770
And I realized that I
had not forgotten it,

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:11.810
that it had been
an invisible brand

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:15.050
stamped between my shoulder
blades for decades.

00:59:15.050 --> 00:59:18.493
But also as an
adult, as a parent,

00:59:18.493 --> 00:59:19.910
I could look at
my parents and see

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:22.940
what they must have felt
having their sons taken away

00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.800
from them.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.480
And we were taken away from
them for a good reason, which

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.480
was to help my parents find the
time to get back on their feet.

00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.000
That's not the case in
terms of what's happening

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.530
at our southern border.

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:37.440
When I think about what happened
to myself and my brother,

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.540
I empathize deeply
with what's happening

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.210
with families that are having
their children separated

00:59:42.210 --> 00:59:42.720
from them.

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:46.020
I know that it is wrong
and it is inhumane

00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:47.790
what we are doing at
our southern border

00:59:47.790 --> 00:59:49.588
with the families
that are coming here.

00:59:49.588 --> 00:59:53.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:58.442 --> 01:00:00.400
Those families, the
parents and their children,

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:03.940
will be scarred for life if my
experience is any indication.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.410
And I was comparatively lucky.

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:07.660
I was only taken away from
my family for three months.

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:09.880
My brother, who is
seven years older,

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.160
didn't come home for two years.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.930
And that's why he
likes to say to me,

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:18.370
mom and dad love you more.

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:23.145
Don't feel too bad for him.

01:00:23.145 --> 01:00:25.520
Seven years after coming to
this country with no English,

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.428
he went to Harvard.

01:00:27.428 --> 01:00:28.970
And then, just to
rub it in because I

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:31.190
went to my last
choice college, he

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:33.290
went to Stanford
Medical School, which

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:35.510
is what you're supposed
to do when you're Asian.

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:38.835
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:44.460
So clearly being a
refugee is not all bad,

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.260
and that was the
case for me as well.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.885
I did get some good
things out of being

01:00:47.885 --> 01:00:51.682
a refugee, such as the
requisite emotional damage

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:52.890
necessary to become a writer.

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:56.790
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.700
And as a father, I've done my
best to pass on that legacy

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.270
to my son.

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:03.285
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.660
Five and a half
years old, like I

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:07.550
said, like most five and a
half year-olds, he loves LEGOs.

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.310
Always asking for LEGOs.

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:12.040
And if you're a parent, you
know you cannot always say yes

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.600
to what your children want.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.970
So sometimes I have to say,
no, you cannot get these LEGOs.

01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:19.300
And I ask him, you
know why you're not

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.130
going to get these LEGOs?

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:22.830
And he thinks about
it for a while,

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:24.755
and he says, because
you're a refugee.

01:01:24.755 --> 01:01:28.044
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:31.537 --> 01:01:32.680
I say, that's right.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.030
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.850
I want him to remember that
both of his parents are refugees

01:01:36.850 --> 01:01:39.310
and that all four of his
grandparents are refugees.

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:42.850
And it seems crucial to
remind a young boy of this

01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:45.010
at this time in
our history, when

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:48.160
we were undergoing the worst
refugee crisis in world history

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.830
since World War II.

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.510
The United Nations says
approximately 68 million people

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:55.120
are displaced, 22 million
of whom are officially

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.250
classified as refugees.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:59.110
And I am certain that
many of the people who

01:01:59.110 --> 01:02:00.700
are coming to our
southern border

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.270
are refugees, whether the United
Nations calls them that or not,

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:06.715
whether we call
them that or not.

01:02:06.715 --> 01:02:08.590
Of course, the President
of the United States

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.160
calls these refugees animals.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.370
And as a refugee, I object
to this characterization.

01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.680
And I object because I
myself have experienced

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.770
some of the sting
of dehumanization,

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.660
beginning with when my
family moved from Harrisburg,

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.230
Pennsylvania to San
Jose, California in 1978,

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:29.170
and my parents opened perhaps
the second Vietnamese grocery

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:30.850
store in San Jose,
which is what you're

01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:33.573
supposed to do when you're
a refugee or an immigrant

01:02:33.573 --> 01:02:34.240
to this country.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.432
You're supposed to pursue
the American dream.

01:02:36.432 --> 01:02:38.890
So it was kind of a shock when
I walk down the street, when

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:40.630
I was around 10 or
11 years old, and saw

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:44.800
a sign in another window that
said, another American driven

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.570
out of business
by the Vietnamese.

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.680
And I thought, does
this person know

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.820
that my parents work 12
to 14 hour days every day

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.620
in this shop?

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.890
Does this person know
that my parents were shot

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:05.010
in the store on Christmas Eve?

01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:10.780
Does this person know anything
about who my parents are

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:14.900
and what they've had to go
through to get to this country

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.200
and to open this door?

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.510
And of course, that
person did not know that,

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.090
did not care to know
anything about my parents,

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:25.890
saw them as less than human.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:31.370
The saddest thing about this was
that I internalized that sign.

01:03:31.370 --> 01:03:34.850
I remember going to high school,
to the most elite high school

01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.670
in San Jose, California, a
primarily white high school,

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:40.287
but there were a handful of
us who were of Asian descent.

01:03:40.287 --> 01:03:41.870
And we knew we were
different, we just

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:44.017
had a hard time
putting into words.

01:03:44.017 --> 01:03:45.600
So every day at
lunch, we would gather

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.750
in a corner of the campus,
and we would call ourselves

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.140
the Asian Invasion.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.336
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:54.483 --> 01:03:56.900
Funny thing is, I went back
to my campus a couple of years

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.480
ago to give a speech, and
we really have taken over.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.952
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:06.920
Where do we get this idea
of the Asian invasion from?

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.400
At least partly from movies,
from American popular culture

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.390
that we had absorbed.

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:13.310
For me, it was all of
the American movies

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:14.810
about the Vietnam
War that Hollywood

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.880
was putting forth in
the '70s and the '80s,

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.940
but very particularly
Apocalypse Now.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:22.880
I remember watching that when
I was 10 or 11 years old, much

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:26.030
too young of an age,
way too precocious.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.655
And I was someone who
loved American war movies.

01:04:28.655 --> 01:04:31.407
I identified with American
soldiers, John Wayne and so on.

01:04:31.407 --> 01:04:32.990
And so when I was
watching this movie,

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:35.030
I was identifying
with American soldiers

01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:38.630
up until the point they
killed Vietnamese civilians.

01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:41.180
And then I was split in two.

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.610
Was I the American
doing the killing,

01:04:43.610 --> 01:04:46.310
or was I the Vietnamese
being killed?

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:50.270
Well, that experience convinced
me of the power of stories.

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.700
I was already in love with
stories as a young refugee

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:55.580
because I found so much comfort
and solace from the refugee

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.230
life in stories.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:01.250
But watching Apocalypse Now and
movies like it also crushed me

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:03.080
and convinced me of
the power of stories

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.080
to destroy us as
well as save us.

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.940
And I think that was
the moment that I

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:12.290
began hoping to be a
writer because I thought,

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:16.070
one day, one day I will
take revenge on Hollywood.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:17.730
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:21.740
Which is exactly what
happened in The Sympathizer.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.710
But I was yearning
for representation,

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.820
although that was not the
word I would have used.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:28.487
And I think I shared
something in common

01:05:28.487 --> 01:05:30.200
with so many of us
who have suffered

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.800
from a lack of representation,
from misrepresentation,

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.960
from under representation.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.940
We know that not having enough
representation is dangerous.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:44.600
Not having enough representation
can actually destroy lives.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.030
Not having enough representation
can psychically destroy lives.

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.730
So there's a great urgency
to the task of representation

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:56.030
that so many of us as writers
and storytellers and artists

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.710
feel.

01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:58.820
And so it's difficult
for me to say

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:01.820
that as much as
representations matter,

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.450
as much as we need more stories
and voices and representatives,

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:09.532
perhaps it's
actually not enough.

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:11.990
I'll give you the example of
the publishing industry, which

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.670
seems very relevant today.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:17.900
The publishing
industry is 87% white.

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:22.220
And in 1955, James Baldwin, in
his book Notes of a Native Son,

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.780
could write, "The world
is white no longer,

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.000
and it will never
be white again."

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.260
But a publishing industry
that lionizes James Baldwin

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:39.490
and yet is still 87% white,
is still quite white.

01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:43.080
So we have a lot of work
to do, because insomuch

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.510
as we have representation and
representatives in figures

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:48.030
like James Baldwin, and Toni
Morrison, and Ta-Nehisi Coates,

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.830
and so on and so forth,
so many great writers,

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:53.160
there is still nevertheless
the persistence

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.300
of racial and economic
inequality in our civilization.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:01.110
And for me, what that
means is not simply

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:04.740
that there's inequality but
that there is the persistence

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:07.290
of colonization.

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:11.370
Now, some of you in the room
are thinking, what colonization?

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:14.220
Well, the United
States is an example

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.117
of successful colonization.

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:17.700
Usually when we think
of colonization,

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:20.490
we think of France in
Indochina, for example,

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:23.220
which colonized Indochina
for 80 or so years

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:27.090
and then was defeated
and kicked out.

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:29.400
Successful
colonization, however,

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:34.050
is successful at renaming
itself so that it is not

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.420
called colonization.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.030
In the United States,
successful colonization

01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:42.560
is called the American dream.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.440
Successful colonization is
never called colonization

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.290
for the same reason that
successful treason is never

01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:50.240
called treason,
for the same reason

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.937
that successful war crimes
are never called war crimes.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:56.270
If we look back upon our
history at the founding moments

01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:59.030
of our country, which is
what Tommy Orange's novel,

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:01.640
There There, does in
its first 20 pages.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.440
And if you read the
first 20 pages--

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.857
and this my
interpretation, Tommy.

01:08:04.857 --> 01:08:05.990
You may disagree with me.

01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.530
I'm used to that.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:07.760
I'm a professor and a scholar.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.177
Writers are always
saying, I don't

01:08:09.177 --> 01:08:10.710
know what you're talking about.

01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:13.190
But when I read the first
20 pages of Tommy Orange's

01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:15.220
There There, I
can't help but think

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.859
that would be very hard to deny
that this country was built

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:22.729
on the foundation of genocide,
and not just genocide,

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:29.750
but slavery, occupation,
war, and racism as well.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:33.560
The United States is a
successful colonizing country,

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.950
and if we need further evidence
of that it is that whenever

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.920
the United States has had
the choice between choosing

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.890
the sides of the colonized
or the colonizer,

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:46.250
it has almost always chosen the
side of the colonizer, which

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:50.620
is what happened in the
1940s and 1950s in Indochina.

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.700
The United States had
the opportunity to side

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:54.830
with Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.620
Instead, it chose
willingly to take over

01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.990
the war from the French.

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:03.870
Now I said this in my
novel, The Sympathizer,

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.729
and something
interesting happened

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:07.100
after that novel came out.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:09.100
In the first major
review of the novel,

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:11.430
in the second or third
line, the reviewer said,

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:15.750
"Viet is the voice
for the voiceless."

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.330
And I was like, no, have
you ever actually met

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:21.109
any Vietnamese people?

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:24.990
We're really, really loud.

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:28.920
The problem is not that
we don't have voices.

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.540
The problem is that
we're not heard.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.120
Now this phrase, the
voice for the voiceless,

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.680
I'm sure you've heard it before.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.930
Maybe you've used it yourself.

01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:40.880
It's a dangerous
sentiment, even though it

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:43.399
sounds like a compliment.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.069
And the reason why it's
a dangerous sentiment,

01:09:46.069 --> 01:09:48.950
because what it implies is
that people would much rather

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:56.270
hear one voice, rather than
a chorus, or a cacophony,

01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:58.080
or a community.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:01.860
The desire to hear the
voice for the voiceless

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:05.730
is itself a symptom
of colonization.

01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:09.090
If we would rather hear
a voice of the voiceless

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:12.960
than abolish the conditions
of voicelessness, then

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.510
we've resigned ourselves
to, or agree with,

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:19.400
colonization's persistence.

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:21.390
So representation matters.

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:24.840
We need writers,
but it's not enough.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.712
What we need is decolonization.

01:10:28.712 --> 01:10:29.295
Colonization--

01:10:29.295 --> 01:10:31.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.100
Thank you.

01:10:34.977 --> 01:10:35.810
I must be in Boston.

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:39.310
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:44.450
Colonization has resulted in
a massive transfer of wealth

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:48.020
to the colonized and
their descendants.

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.150
So what would we need to do?

01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:54.990
Greater taxation,
redistribution,

01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:58.920
universal health care,
child care, education,

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.870
abolishing the prison-industrial
complex, demilitarization,

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:08.540
reparations, and
yes, representation.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.890
So on this list, you can
clearly see that representation

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:13.530
is the easiest
task, which is why

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:15.990
we tend to focus
on it, especially

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.270
in the world of literature.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:21.570
Now, novels themselves
cannot decolonize.

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:24.600
But novels can
depict colonization,

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.070
can depict the processes and
the dreams of decolonization.

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:30.810
I can think of
many books that do.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:32.820
I'll give you a few
here to show you

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:36.670
that it's not actually
impossible to have

01:11:36.670 --> 01:11:38.620
a literature of decolonization.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:41.890
Books that I have found striking
in recent years have included--

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:45.790
Han Kang's Human Acts, which
is about the Korean military

01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:48.970
dictatorship's suppression
of a democratic uprising

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:53.298
in Guangzhou in 1980 in Korea;
António Lobo Antunes' The Land

01:11:53.298 --> 01:11:55.840
at the End of the World, which
was a touchstone for me when I

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.750
was writing The Sympathizer,
which is about the Portuguese

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:02.110
Colonial War in Angola from
the perspective of a reluctant

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:05.840
soldier; Laila Lalami's
The Moor's Account,

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.470
which is the account of
the first black slave taken

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:12.070
by Spanish conquistadors to
the Americas; and, of course,

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:15.550
Tommy Orange's
There There as well.

01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:17.230
The problem that in
the United States

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.410
our dominant literature, in
contemporary American fiction

01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:24.010
at the very least,
tends to be apolitical.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:26.500
Decolonization is
beyond the horizon

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:30.100
of most of our contemporary
American writers.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.290
That doesn't mean it should
be beyond our imagination.

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:35.200
Now, even for those of
us who are committed

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.570
to decolonization, who
imagine ourselves working

01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:39.340
not just in the
solitude of our rooms

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.980
but in the solidarity of
social and political movements

01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:46.480
that transform the landscape,
those of us who are doing

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:49.210
this work or imagine
ourselves doing this work

01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:53.260
should not call ourselves
the voices for the voiceless.

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.100
We should imagine ourselves
as one voice among many,

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.290
among the many social and
political movements that

01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:04.960
are committed to abolishing
the conditions of voicelessness

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.750
that make it so easy to
privilege us as writers.

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:15.230
So looking back to my teenage
self, proto-Asian Invasion,

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:20.360
I realize now that I was living
in conditions of voicelessness.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.420
I was living in conditions
of narrative scarcity.

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.330
And what that means is that when
you live in narrative scarcity,

01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:29.150
almost none of the
stories are about you.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:31.100
So any story that
comes out about you

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.550
takes on tremendous weight.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:34.940
It's an unfair burden
of representation

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.432
put on these few voices or
these few representatives.

01:13:38.432 --> 01:13:39.890
So when Crazy Rich
Asians came out,

01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:41.890
all the Asians freaked
out, like, oh my god!

01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:43.077
There's a movie about us!

01:13:43.077 --> 01:13:44.660
Too bad it's a bad
movie, but it's OK.

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.859
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:48.542 --> 01:13:49.250
I'm just kidding.

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:51.780
I actually haven't
seen Crazy Rich Asians.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.377
I'm a bad Asian.

01:13:53.377 --> 01:13:54.710
I did listen to the book though.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.790
The opposite of
narrative scarcity

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.320
is narrative plenitude.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.560
That's when almost all of
the stories are about you.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.990
That's how you know
you have privilege,

01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:10.890
when you can take it for granted
that almost all of the stories

01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:12.030
are about you.

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.310
Abolishing the conditions
of voicelessness

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:15.900
is about achieving
narrative plenitude

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.010
for everyone in our society,
not just for the majority

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:22.920
or the wealthy or
the privileged.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.380
So looking back on my
teenage self, the self

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.070
so desperately in need of
more voices, more stories,

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:34.370
it's clear that one of the
causes for that condition

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:39.590
was structural racism,
structural inequality.

01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:43.500
But there was one
other major factor.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.300
I'm going to leave you with
that as a parting public service

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:51.860
announcement, one last
factor for why there

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:55.130
are so few stories by Vietnamese
and Asian-Americans out there.

01:14:55.130 --> 01:14:57.730
Do you know what it is?

01:14:57.730 --> 01:14:59.310
Asian parents.

01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:01.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:01.450 --> 01:15:02.215
Asian parents.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:08.440
Asian parents out
there, or you who

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:12.800
will one day be Asian parents
or parents of Asian children,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.470
do not crush the
hopes and dreams

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:18.380
of your artistic children.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:23.300
Nourish them, nurture
them, help them grow,

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:26.850
until one day they
too can become

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:30.660
writers writing scathing
autobiographies featuring you.

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:34.060
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:34.850
Boston, thank you.

01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:35.600
You've been great.

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.842
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:11.710
ALAN PRICE: In a
moment, I hope you

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:14.210
will be able to join us in
the pavilion, where we'll

01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:16.220
be able to shake hands,
greet each other,

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.980
and celebrate these
marvelous writers.

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:21.260
Again, as we exit,
I would ask you

01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.510
to join me for one
more round of applause

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:25.925
for all you have done
to enrich the world.

01:16:25.925 --> 01:16:29.390
[APPLAUSE]

01:16:31.370 --> 01:16:33.230
Thank you for being
with us this afternoon.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:36.580
[APPLAUSE]
