We're here with Harpinder Singh,
a partner at Innovation Endeavors, and

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.050
the CEO of Slice.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.140
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Amir,
it's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.510
&gt;&gt; So
how did you become an entrepreneur?

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.650
&gt;&gt; So, my journey's a little bit
different from most other entrepreneurs.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.510
I met my co-founders at
Stanford Business School back in 2000,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.270
and we were working together on
a business plan before we graduated and

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.860
that idea did not pan out.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.340
But we really enjoyed working
together as a team, so

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.330
we were essentially
a team before an idea.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.820
And we all decided to commit six months,
we decided to say no to the jobs.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.680
And we invested some of our own money,
and

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.320
went through a structured search
process for about six months.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.940
We looked at a few different spaces,
several different ideas, and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.770
our benchmark was can we get
excited about something ourselves?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.415
And do we want to spend the next six or
seven years doing it?

00:00:55.415 --> 00:00:57.830
So that's what we did,
we created a company called FiberTower.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.160
It was a wireless infrastructure
company which we built and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.410
sold after six or seven years.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.880
And, we took some time off, and
the same thing came together.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.330
And, we did the same exact process,
looked at a few different spaces,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.460
few different ideas, and
created Slice out of it.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.540
And the common theme was we,
at that time,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.290
felt that wireless was growing a lot and
e-commerce receipts were growing, and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.410
we felt that data would
be very valuable.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.790
So, that's what we've
done two times now.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.440
&gt;&gt; So how do I determine that my idea

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.350
is the right idea to
build a business around?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.549
&gt;&gt; As an investor and as a founder,
the answer may be somewhat different.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.300
As an investor,
I'm definitely trying to see is this

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.700
potentially a big market,
a high growth market?

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.550
Does it give you enough room for
exploration and for errors?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.180
So, that's one thing that's important.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.390
And then the second is do you have
some defensibility, at least for

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.620
a few years until you create room for
yourself.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.520
And as a founder, there's a couple of
other factors that become important.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.750
I mean, as a founder it's not
always clear from the beginning,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.930
is it a big market,
is this like a mega-market, and so on?

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.990
So you generally want pick big markets,
but

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.990
you're picking problems that
you can relate to personally.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.626
And, I like to pick problems that
have some kind of defensibility

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:33.140
around technology, or
around the data component.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.439
So, you want to create
some barrier that the guy

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.490
across the street just
can't do over night.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.540
&gt;&gt; So should an entrepreneur find a
small niche or think big from the start?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.880
&gt;&gt; It depends on how you define niche.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.370
Snapchat is niche, Instagram is niche,
but these are big companies.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.170
I think there's couple of
different ways to think about it.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.684
I have friends who have
acquired small companies,

00:03:01.684 --> 00:03:07.370
$10 million revenue companies, and
grown them to $30, $50 million revenues,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.060
and grown the EBITDAs, and they've
created a lot of shareholder value.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.240
I think the traditional Silicon Valley
would look at that and say,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.860
that's not big.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.200
So if you're thinking technology,
if you're thinking Silicon Valley,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.420
especially if you're thinking
about raising venture capital,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.000
then I think the bar is different.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.870
People are looking for
billion dollar plus outcomes.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.350
And there, by definition,
you're looking for

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.760
big markets, ability to accumulate
large user bases and so on.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.980
So it really depends on
what your strengths are.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.240
Are you more of an operator
that wants to optimize?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.370
Are you more of an innovator that
wants to sort of create magic and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.810
have this thing that can just sort of
grow to be something unimaginable?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.020
And there are trade-offs.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.970
It depends on how much
capital do you want to raise.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.710
It depends on what kind of employees
will you attract, how much ownership

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.840
will you retain, and, really, what is
the core competence of the business?

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.775
Is it design and product,
is it operations, is it sales?

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.529
So I think there is no
one answer to this.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.220
People have created a lot
of shareholder value

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.764
from what might seem small
versus what seem like megahits.
