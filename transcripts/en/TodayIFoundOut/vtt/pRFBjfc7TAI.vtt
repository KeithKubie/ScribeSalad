00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:28.090
you’ve been subjected to watching The Notebook
with your spouse, you might have experienced

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.420
an uncomfortable lump in your throat.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.630
As you attempt to breath heavy and avoid crying
like a little kid who has just skinned her

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.480
knee, you might wonder, what causes the feeling
of a lump in your throat?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.610
For that matter, why do we cry when we’re
sad?

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.820
The lump in your throat has a rather easy
explanation compared to crying when emotionally

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.820
upset.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.620
Known as the globus sensation, the feeling
is the result of a battle between the opposing

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.350
forces of muscles attached to your glottis
(the opening between your vocal cords).

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.150
It tends to present itself when sad, or when
you swallow or hold your breath to avoid crying.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.800
There are only two autonomic nervous systems
in the body, sympathetic and parasympathetic-

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.890
sympathetic being your fight or flight nervous
system, and the opposing parasympathetic being

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.570
stimulated by resting and relaxing (your feed
or breed nervous system).

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.340
When you begin feeling upset, or have any
stressful experience, your body stimulates

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.080
its sympathetic nervous system via the HPA
axis.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.380
This axis involves a connection between your
hypothalamus, pituitary gland and your adrenal

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.380
glands.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.740
It will release hormones in to your blood
stream causing things like increased heart

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.800
rate, blood pressure, and metabolism.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.670
It will then sense it needs more oxygen to
maintain that experience.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.909
It’s your sympathetic nervous system at
work when you try to avoid breaking down and

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.300
it feels like you’ve swallowed a golf ball.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.370
Your body responds to this sympathetic drive
by opening your glottis via the posterior

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.390
crioaryteniod and thyroarytenoid muscles.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.479
The result gives a larger opening for oxygen
to enter your lungs.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.600
When you attempt to swallow, or hold your
breath to avoid sobbing, your lateral cricoarytenoid,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.470
aryepiglottic, and thyroepiglottic muscles
constrict, struggling to close off your glottis.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.600
These opposing forces cause the sensation
of a giant lump in your throat.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.220
lacrimal-glandCrying, or more specifically
shedding tears, in response to an emotional

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.520
stimulus is a much more complex issue.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.190
To begin with, tears are produced by the almond
shaped lacrimal glands situated on the outside

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.360
portion of your orbit.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.880
Depending on the type of stimulus, the glands
will produce three different tears.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.920
The first kind are basal tears.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.060
They get released every time you blink, serving
to lubricate the eye and keep it free from

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.030
dust or drying out.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.670
The second type are reflex tears.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.850
They get released in response to an irritant,
such as can be introduced when cutting onions.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.010
(see:Why Does Cutting Onions Make Your Eyes
Water?)

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.460
These two types of tears are composed of pretty
much the same stuff- things like water, salt,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.349
potassium, lipids, and the antibacterial lysozyme.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.450
Emotional tears are another thing altogether.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.390
There doesn’t seem to be a consensus among
researchers as to exactly why they spring

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.390
up.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.709
Their make-up does, however, provide some
clues to their origin.

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.490
For instance, they contain hormones like ACTH
(adrenocorticotropin hormone) and prolactin,

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.260
20-25% more protein groups, and 30 times more
manganese than normal tears.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.239
ACTH is the hormone released by your HPA axis
when your sympathetic nervous system is in

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:35.370
charge.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.290
Prolactin is also elevated in response to
stress.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.849
Manganese has long been known to help regulate
your mood, and those who are constantly depressed

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.069
will usually have higher levels in their blood
stream.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.860
Emotional tears also contain leucine enkephalin.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.940
This is an opioid peptide giving you the same
pain-killing effects morphine does.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.120
On that note, some posit that crying in response
to having your sympathetic nervous system

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.819
stimulated by an emotional event has evolutionary
benefits in that it’s a way humans can signal

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.010
the need for help during those trying times.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.430
(Or signal empathy for someone like in the
case of sympathizing with James Garners’

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.750
character, Noah, when his children ask him
to come home as his wife, and their mother,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.560
doesn’t recognize him or know he’s there
anyway.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.389
In response, he says, “Look, guys, that’s
my sweetheart in there.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:19.900
I’m not leaving her.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.459
This is my home now.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.400
Your mother is my home…” *sniffle*)

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.800
If this is true, then the presence of ACTH
and prolactin could account for that.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.059
Women generally have higher levels of prolactin
in their bodies, so this could also be the

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:36.659
reason why women cry on average five times
more than men.

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:40.560
Chronically depressed people seem to cry more
often, and they also tend to have higher levels

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.470
of manganese in their system.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.620
Others point out the healing benefits of the
act as the main reason why we cry.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.909
First off, there is the aforementioned presence
of leucine enkephalin, giving you the mood-lifting

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.949
feelings any opiate would.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.060
Secondly, there are plenty of studies showing
the calming effects of crying, leading many

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.559
to argue it’s an involuntary way our bodies
can calm down from a stressful event.

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:08.110
This theory is furthered by other studies
showing that if you disable nerves that stimulate

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.319
the sympathetic nervous system, you will cry
more.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.301
Should you damage the important nerves involved
with the parasympathetic nervous system, you

00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:16.669
will cry less.

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.879
This would lead one to conclude that it’s
not the stressful event that triggers the

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.669
crying, but the need for our ancestors to
calm down after a stressful event, helping

00:05:25.669 --> 00:07:32.539
to make sure they don’t die of a heart attack
from the continual fight or flight response.
