00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.989
You and me? We've got some
stuff in common.

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.080
More in common than, say, you and
my dogs Lemon and Abby here.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.750
For starters, you and I are
probably the same species.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.800
And Lemon and Abby are dogs,
which is a different species.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.710
As you may have guessed by now,
this video is going to

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.180
be about species!
But at the very end,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.130
we're going to talk about dogs.
So hang in there,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.130
because the puppies are coming.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.550
Before we bust out the puppies,
let's talk about people.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.050
Our species, Homo Sapiens, is the
single remaining member of

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.309
the genus Homo.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.399
Our buddies Homo Erectus
and Homo Habilis

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.550
and Homo Neanderthalensis

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.410
bought the farm a long time ago.
So these days, all us Homo sapiens

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.859
are pretty different from even our
closest living relatives in the

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.820
animal Kingdom,
the chimps and bonobos.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.510
Humans are a species, a specific
type of organism that's different

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.969
from all the other types
of organisms out there.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.210
But what is it that makes us human?
Well, we're a specific type of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.739
animal called a primate.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.079
Monkeys, apes, lemurs,
and tarsiers are also primates.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.699
Unless you're Sacha Baron Cohen
or something, most of us are

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.740
lacking significant body hair.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.060
We're bipedal, meaning we stand
on two feet, and we've got these

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.780
huge-normous brains, that allow us
to do all kinds of stuff like

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.189
talk real good,
solve complicated problems,

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.250
write bad poetry during
adolescence, and figure out how

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.840
little we can get away with
tipping a mediocre waiter at a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.860
restaurant without seeming
like a total prick.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.799
THAT, my friends, is something
that giraffes rarely have

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:27.630
to deal with.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.909
But being a species is more than
having a bunch of stuff in common.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.070
Instead we describe a species as
a group of organisms that can

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.210
interbreed and produce
fertile offspring.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.780
Seems pretty simple, right?
Two of the same species that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.640
can produce blah blah blah...

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.100
HEY! Pay attention! That last part
is important! The two organisms

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.759
need to be able to
produce fertile offspring.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.390
It seems like it would be enough
for organisms of the same species

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.610
to be able to make babies,
but those babies need to

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.500
be able to make babies, too.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.110
Now it turns out, two animals of a
different species can sometimes

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.180
technically have a baby.
Take, for instance,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.180
the noble liger, Napoleon
Dynamite's favorite animal,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.920
which I know because I had the very
best Napoleon Dynamite costume in

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.210
the United States for
Halloween in 2005.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.950
But, I didn't just bring
ligers up to brag.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.099
A liger is what happens when a
male lion and a female tiger

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.989
have a little cub.

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.640
Only, it's not very little because
a liger is generally larger than

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.910
both of its parents.
And ligers are sterile.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.290
Which leads us to our understanding
of what makes a species: lions and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.629
tigers are different species
because they don't produce

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.230
fertile offspring together.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.150
We call animals like ligers
hybrids, the offspring resulting

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.050
from the cross-breeding of
two distinct species.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.330
And even though hybridization
between two animals is a dead end

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.319
when it comes to creating
a new species, we know that

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.510
through evolution, or the change
in the heritable characteristics

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.739
of a species across generations,
new species have formed

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.260
in the past, and they continue
to develop all the time.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.500
It's tough to nail down every
single way this process we call

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.930
speciation can happen, but we know
of at least a couple ways that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.000
species evolve into other species.
And they both involve

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.930
one requirement: reproductive
isolation, meaning two populations

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.280
of the same species can no
longer mate together successfully.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.200
Note that I said successfully.
One way populations can become

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.879
isolated from each other is that
they can mate, but their offspring

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.140
aren't fertile or viable.
Ligers are a good example of this.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.920
So are mules, they're the product
of a male donkey and

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.599
a female horse.
Unlike lions and tigers,

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.500
donkeys and horses don't even have
the same number of chromosomes,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.480
so even though the donkey sperm
can fertilize the horse egg,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.489
the mule won't have the genetic
instructions it needs to produce

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.670
its own sex cells.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.730
This kind of isolation is call
post-zygotic, because the parents

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.610
can form a zygote together,
but after that it's all

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.780
over for their lineage.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.250
Other examples of post-zygotic
isolation include pairings of

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.959
species that always lead to
miscarriage or no development

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.739
of the embryo at all,
or things like big fetuses

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.220
that kill the mother at birth.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.069
The other type of isolation is
pre-zygotic, meaning the isolation

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.620
happened between groups of the
same species before an egg even

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.040
thought about getting fertilized.
This can include stuff like

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.090
behavioral changes within a
species, like when birds of the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.360
same species start singing two
different songs to attract mates.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.780
Or when one group of a species
that does all its business in the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.709
daytime gradually becomes
nocturnal, so the two groups

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.849
never end up hanging
out at the same time.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.070
Pre-zygotic isolation
can also be geographic,

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.970
meaning simply that the
populations are separated

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.510
by great distances
or physical barriers,

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.160
so that they can no longer
get together to bump uglies.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.220
When one species diverges into
two new species because

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.190
of geographic isolation,
it's called allopatric speciation,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.720
allopatric coming from the
Greek for "different countries."

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.380
The two populations of a species
end up evolving differently

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.680
because conditions are different
on each side of this river here.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.940
It might be colder on one
side of the river,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.500
so the animals on this
side grow thicker,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.400
more luxurious coats because those
guys just do better over there.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.670
They probably also put on
thicker layers of fat,

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.600
and change their behavior,
and accumulate a bunch

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.350
of other possibly random changes.
Meanwhile, on the warm side

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.650
of the river, these animals also
accumulate changes, and lose some

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.750
fur and add a bunch of
sweat glands. Given enough time,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.290
and given a complete lack of gene
flow between the two populations,

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.260
thick-coated animals will
eventually only be able to breed

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.900
with other thick-coated animals,

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.850
and sweaty animals
with sweaty animals.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.490
This propagation of specific
traits based on how kick-ass

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.310
those traits make the animal that
has them is called

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.110
natural selection. And a guy named
Charles Darwin or Chuck Darwin,

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.510
or Chucky D to his friends...

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.690
was the one who let us know what
was up with natural selection

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.580
and how it can lead
to allopatric speciation.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.210
Stop me if you've heard this one
before, but Darwin visited the

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.210
Galapagos Islands in the 1830s.
So Darwin was obsessed

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.050
with barnacles, but that didn't
keep him from noticing the finches,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.990
which were actually misidentified
by him as grosbeaks,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.690
on each island were all pretty
similar to the finches on the

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.490
other islands AND very similar to
the ones on the mainland of

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.720
South America BUT they were also
obviously their own species.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.940
Darwin believed that the process
that led to these finches becoming

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.940
separate species was incredibly
slow, so slow that we couldn't

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.400
actually witness the process,
we just had to take his word for it.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.630
Now, for a long time after Darwin
made these observations,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.870
allopatric speciation was the main
explanation for how species diverge.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.420
But today we know that's not the
whole truth. Now, we've got lots

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.990
of new-fangled DNA testing and
other special gadgetry that tells

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.230
us that one species can diverge
into two without being

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.850
geographically separated,
but instead, when they're

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.590
reproductively isolated in some
other way. This is called

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.940
sympatric speciation, meaning
"same country," and it also means

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.010
that it's time for a
trip to the chair!

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:40.380
So, here's a little biological
love story for all you

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.010
romantics out there.
Peter and Rosemary Grant,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.600
two British evolutionary biologists
(they are, in fact, a married couple)

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.720
have, since the early 1970s,
been spending 6 months of each

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.210
year together on a secluded
island in the Galapagos

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.440
studying Darwin's finches,
trying to catch them in the

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.460
act of evolving. These are,
mind you, the same animals

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.080
that Darwin studied,
and the ones that he

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.930
said were evolving at
an imperceptibly slow pace.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.100
The island in the Galapagos
that the Grants hang out on

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.000
is called Daphne Major, and when
they started their research in 1973,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.120
it was occupied by two
different finch species:

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.980
the medium ground finch
and the cactus finch.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.440
But in 1981, another finch
arrived on Daphne Major

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.500
from a nearby island. It was a
ground finch-cactus finch hybrid,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.970
and it was a whole lot bigger than
either of the local finches.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.330
Its beak was also extra wide,
and its song was like a mashup

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.620
of the jams ground finches sang
on its home island and the ones

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.150
sung on Daphne Major. The newcomer
set to work crooning to the local

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.250
ground finch ladies,
and eventually landed one.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.310
The Grants followed the
descendants of these two

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.180
birds for the next 28 years.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.840
But after about 4 generations,
Daphne Major experienced a

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.770
severe drought which killed
many of the finches.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.130
There were only TWO surviving
descendants of that one

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.490
immigrant finch, sort of like
cousins of each other, basically

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.360
and they mated with each other,
and that seems to have set the

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.060
stage for speciation to occur.
The descendants of these two

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.910
survivors sang a very distinctive
song that was learned from their

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.060
parents and which was
different from the other

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.750
Daphne Major finches.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.740
Gradually as the finch population
on the island rebounded,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.780
the hybrid finches, the great-great-

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.740
great-great-great grandchicks

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.840
of that one bird, began mating
exclusively with each other.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.890
In December 2009, the Grants
announced that, since the drought,

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.940
the lineage of that one immigrant
ground finch has been genetically

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.110
isolated from the other
local finches on the island.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.630
So, that, my friends, is both
super romantic and also an

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.630
example of super-quick
sympatric speciation in action.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.330
Okay, so I promised you puppies,
so I'm gonna give you puppies.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.880
You've probably noticed that,
you know, a corgi looks pretty

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.540
different from a greyhound.
They were bred to be different.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.050
Corgis were bred to herd animals
and guard farm houses,

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.040
while greyhounds were bred
mostly to run.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.240
Dog breeding kind of takes the
"natural" out of natural selection,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.550
in fact, it's what we call
artificial selection,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.460
but it's still a kind of selection.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.370
You've probably wondered what it
would be like if a corgi and a

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.530
greyhound had puppies together?
Because they CAN

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.430
have puppies together.
Even though that's really weird.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.330
What's that, Lemon?
You're both girls?

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.010
Oh, well- anyways..

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.170
My point here is that they're the
same species, meaning that

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.660
these dogs, even differenter dogs,
like an Irish wolfhound

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.060
and a chihuahua, could have
fertile offspring together.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:20.400
Like, how? How... How?
Would- HOW!?

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.930
Various dog breeds are similar
enough that post-zygotic

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.290
isolation isn't an issue.
But in a natural setting,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:28.070
a chihuahua-wolfhound pairing
would be extremely rare

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.870
because of the difficulties
involved in the

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.140
gettin' it on process.
Or "pre-zygotic obstacles."

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.210
So, think about it like this,
if you were to put a bunch of

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.200
chihuahuas and a bunch of
wolfhounds on an island somewhere

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.330
they probably wouldn't breed
together and if they did,

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.170
the birthing process, at least for
the chihuahua mommies would be...

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:45.750
Gah!

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.910
Oh god.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.210
But what this means is that the
gene flow between the two groups

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.300
would stop, and they would
become reproductively isolated.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.640
Over time, they could become
different enough that they could

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.730
no longer successfully breed
together at all, and thus become

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.340
different species.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.730
