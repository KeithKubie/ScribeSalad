00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.570
We learned in the last several
videos, that if I had a linear

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.400
differential equation with
constant coefficients in a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.570
homogeneous one, that had the
form A times the second

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.520
derivative plus B times the
first derivative plus C

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.750
times-- you could say the
function, or the 0

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.910
derivative-- equal to 0.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.240
If that's our differential
equation that the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.380
characteristic equation of that
is Ar squared plus Br

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.910
plus C is equal to 0.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.930
And if the roots of this
characteristic equation are

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.550
real-- let's say we have
two real roots.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.540
Let me write that down.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.710
So the real scenario where the
two solutions are going to be

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.450
r1 and r2, where these
are real numbers.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.710
Then the general solution of
this differential equation--

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.730
and watch the previous videos if
you don't remember this or

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.100
if you don't feel like it's
suitably proven to you-- the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.650
general solution is y is equal
to some constant times e to

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.570
the first root x plus some other
constant times e to the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.620
second root times x.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.570
And we did that in the
last several videos.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.200
We even did some examples.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.840
Now my question to you is, what
if the characteristic

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.110
equation does not
have real roots,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.980
what if they are complex?

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.090
And just a little bit
of review, what

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.980
do I mean by that?

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.380
Well, if I wanted to figure out
the roots of this and if I

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.130
was lazy, and I just want to do
it without having to think,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.640
can I factor it, I would just
immediately use the quadratic

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.050
equation, because that
always works.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.140
I would say, well the roots of
my characteristic equation are

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.770
negative B plus or minus
the square root of B

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.195
squared minus 4AC.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.820
All of that over 2A.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.090
So what do I mean by
non-real roots?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.460
Well, if this expression right
here-- if this B squared minus

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.300
4AC-- if that's a negative
number, then I'm going to have

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.340
to take the square root
of a negative number.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.140
So it will actually be an
imaginary number, and so this

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.450
whole term will actually
become complex.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.930
We'll have a real part and
an imaginary part.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.270
And actually, the two roots are
going to be conjugates of

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.070
each other, right?

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.260
We could rewrite this in the
real and imaginary parts.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.350
We could rewrite this as the
roots are going to be equal to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:44.490
minus B over 2A, plus or minus
the square root of B squared

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.360
minus 4AC over 2A.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.410
And if B squared minus 4AC is
less than 0, this is going to

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.670
be an imaginary number.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.190
So in that case, let's just
think about what the roots

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.980
look like generally and then
we'll actually do some

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.770
problems. So let me
go back up here.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.810
So then the roots aren't
going to be two real

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.610
numbers like that.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.670
The roots, we can write them
as two complex numbers that

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.790
are conjugates of each other.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.610
And I think light blue is a
suitable color for that.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.870
So in that situation, let me
write this, the complex

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.710
roots-- this is a complex roots
scenario-- then the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.385
roots of the characteristic
equation are going to be, I

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:31.710
don't know, some number--
Let's call it lambda.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.250
Let's call it mu, I think that's
the convention that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.300
people use-- actually let me see
what they tend to use, it

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.460
really doesn't matter--
let's say it's lambda.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.830
So this number, some constant
called lambda, and then plus

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.830
or minus some imaginary
number.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.640
And so it's going to be
some constant mu.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.900
That's just some constant, I'm
not trying to be fancy, but

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.150
this is I think the convention
used in most differential

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.100
equations books.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.390
So it's mu times i.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.860
So these are the two
roots, and these

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.720
are true roots, right?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.440
Because we have lambda plus mu
i, and lambda minus mu i.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.130
So these would be the two roots,
if B squared minus 4AC

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.970
is less than 0.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.100
So let's see what happens when
we take these two roots and we

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.630
put them into our general
solution.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.760
So just like we've learned
before, the general solution

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.460
is going to be-- I'll stay in
the light blue-- the general

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.380
solution is going to be y is
equal to c1 times e to the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.220
first root-- let's make that
the plus version-- so

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:49.770
lambda plus mu i.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.920
All of that times x, plus c2
times e to the second root.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.890
So that's going to be lambda
minus mu i times x.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.220
Let's see if we can do some
simplification here, because

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.900
that i there really kind of
makes things kind of crazy.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.600
So let's see if we can do
anything to either get rid of

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.460
it or simplify it, et cetera.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.080
So let's multiply the x out.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.940
Just doing some algebraic
manipulation.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.780
I'm trying to use as much
space as possible.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.730
So we get y is equal to
c1 e to the what?

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:41.450
Lambda x-- just distributing
that x-- plus mu xi, plus c2

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:50.230
times e to the lambda
x minus mu xi.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.960
Just distributed the x's
in both of the terms.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.770
And let's see what we can do.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.550
Well, when you add exponents,
this is the exact same thing

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:12.020
as y is equal to c1 e to
the lambda x, times e

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.490
to the mu xi, right?

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.300
If you have the same base and
you're multiplying, you could

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.750
just add exponents, so this
is the same thing as that.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:33.173
Plus c2 times e to the lambda x,
times e to the minus mu xi.

00:06:33.173 --> 00:06:36.390
Now let's see, we have an e to
the lambda x in both of these

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.150
terms, so we can
factor it out.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.380
So we get y is equal to-- let
me draw a line here, I don't

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.280
want you to get confused with
all this quadratic equation

00:06:45.280 --> 00:07:00.610
stuff-- y is equal to e to the
lambda x times c1 e to the mu

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:11.430
xi-- that's an i-- plus c2 times
e to the minus mu xi.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.540
Now what we can we do?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.240
And this is where it gets fun.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.090
If you watched the calculus
playlist, especially when I

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.160
talk about approximating
functions with series, we came

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.260
up with what I thought was the
most amazing result in

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.070
calculus, just from a-- or in
mathematics-- just from a

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.040
metaphysical point of view.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.180
And now we will actually use it
for something that you'll

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.680
hopefully see is
vaguely useful.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.490
So here we have two terms that
have something times e to the

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:42.960
something times i.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.410
And we learned before,
Euler's formula.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.340
And what was Euler's formula?

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.160
I'll write that in purple.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:58.110
That e to the i theta, or we
could write e to the ix, is

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:06.070
equal to cosine of x
plus i sine of x.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.610
And what's amazing about that
is, if you put negative 1 in

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:15.120
here, then you get e to the-- oh
no, actually if you put pi

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:20.210
in here-- so e to the i pi is
equal to negative 1, right?

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.070
If you substituted this because
sine of pi is 0.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.700
So I thought that was amazing,
where you could write e to the

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.000
i 2 pi is equal to 1.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.660
That's pretty amazing as well.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.750
And in one equation you have all
of the fundamental numbers

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.700
of mathematics.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.059
That's amazing, but let's
get back down to

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.080
earth and get practical.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.010
So let's see if we can use this
to simplify Euler's--

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.570
This is actually a definition,
and the definition makes a lot

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.680
of sense, because when you
do the power series

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.410
approximation, or the
Maclaurin series

00:08:51.410 --> 00:09:01.150
approximation, of e to the x, it
really looks like cosine of

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.970
x plus i times the power series
approximation of x.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.470
But anyway, we won't
go into that now.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.360
I have like six or seven
videos on it.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.110
But let's use this to simplify
this up here.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:22.640
So we can rewrite that as y is
equal to e to the lambda x

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.990
times-- let's do the
first one-- c1.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:31.285
It's e to the mu xi,
so instead of an x

00:09:31.285 --> 00:09:32.130
we have a mu x.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:37.890
That will be equal to cosine of
whatever is in front of the

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:48.760
i, so cosine of mu x plus
i sine of mu x.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:55.710
And then plus c2 times what?

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:12.355
Times cosine of minus mu x plus
i sine of minus mu x.

00:10:12.355 --> 00:10:15.380
And let's see if we can
simplify this further.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.140
So one thing that you might--
So let's distribute the c's.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.860
So now we get-- I'll do it in
a different color-- actually

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.430
I'm running out of time,
so I'll continue

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.200
this in the next video.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.760
See you soon.
