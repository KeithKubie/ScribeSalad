00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.950
Determine the
number of solutions

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.320
for each of these
equations, and they give us

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.270
three equations right over here.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.730
And before I deal with these
equations in particular,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.070
let's just remind
ourselves about when

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.640
we might have one or
infinite or no solutions.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.200
You're going to
have one solution

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.290
if you can, by
solving the equation,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.050
come up with something like
x is equal to some number.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.600
Let's say x is
equal to-- if I want

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.460
to say the abstract--
x is equal to a.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.060
Or if we actually
were to solve it,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.285
we'd get something like x
equals 5 or 10 or negative pi--

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:33.160
whatever it might be.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.860
But if you could actually
solve for a specific x,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.730
then you have one solution.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.470
So this is one solution,
just like that.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.380
Now if you go and you try to
manipulate these equations

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.400
in completely legitimate
ways, but you end up

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.380
with something crazy
like 3 equals 5,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.470
then you have no solutions.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.320
And if you just think
about it reasonably,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.770
all of these equations
are about finding

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.617
an x that satisfies this.

00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:04.450
And if you were to just
keep simplifying it,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.030
and you were to get
something like 3 equals 5,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.950
and you were to ask
yourself the question

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.210
is there any x that can somehow
magically make 3 equal 5, no.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.900
No x can magically
make 3 equal 5,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.240
so there's no way that you could
make this thing be actually

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.762
true, no matter
which x you pick.

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.720
So if you get something
very strange like this,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.490
this means there's no solution.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.779
On the other hand, if you get
something like 5 equals 5--

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:30.320
and I'm just over
using the number 5.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.736
It didn't have to
be the number 5.

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:34.802
It could be 7 or 10
or 113, whatever.

00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:36.260
And actually let
me just not use 5,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.886
just to make sure that you
don't think it's only for 5.

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:40.510
If I just get something,
that something

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.350
is equal to itself,
which is just

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.980
going to be true no matter what
x you pick, any x you pick,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.340
this would be true for.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.690
Well, then you have
an infinite solutions.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.660
So with that as a
little bit of a primer,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.890
let's try to tackle
these three equations.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.130
So over here, let's see.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.500
Maybe we could subtract.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.090
If we want to get rid of this
2 here on the left hand side,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.080
we could subtract
2 from both sides.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.741
If we subtract 2
from both sides,

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.699
we are going to be left
with-- on the left hand

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.864
side we're going to be
left with negative 7x.

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:15.280
And on the right
hand side, you're

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.270
going to be left with 2x.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.410
This is going to
cancel minus 9x.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.730
2x minus 9x, If we simplify
that, that's negative 7x.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.220
You get negative 7x is
equal to negative 7x.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.060
And you probably see
where this is going.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.380
This is already true
for any x that you pick.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.620
Negative 7 times that x is going
to be equal to negative 7 times

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.740
that x.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.120
So we already are going
into this scenario.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.330
But you're like hey, so
I don't see 13 equals 13.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.880
Well, what if you did
something like you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.812
divide both sides by negative 7.

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:51.020
At this point, what I'm
doing is kind of unnecessary.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.353
You already understand that
negative 7 times some number

00:02:53.353 --> 00:02:55.910
is always going to be
negative 7 times that number.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.610
But if we were to do this,
we would get x is equal to x,

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.410
and then we could subtract
x from both sides.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.420
And then you would
get zero equals

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.010
zero, which is true for
any x that you pick.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.880
Zero is always going
to be equal to zero.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.379
So any of these
statements are going

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:13.850
to be true for any x you pick.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.360
So for this equation
right over here,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.850
we have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.520
Let's think about this one
right over here in the middle.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.144
So once again, let's try it.

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:27.560
I'll do it a little
bit different.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.080
I'll add this 2x and this
negative 9x right over there.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:40.760
So we will get negative 7x
plus 3 is equal to negative 7x.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.860
So 2x plus 9x is
negative 7x plus 2.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.730
Well, let's add-- why don't we
do that in that green color.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.400
Let's do that in
that green color.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.090
Plus 2, this is 2.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.830
Now let's add 7x to both sides.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.907
Well if you add 7x to
the left hand side,

00:03:58.907 --> 00:04:00.740
you're just going to
be left with a 3 there.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.764
And if you add 7x to
the right hand side,

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.430
this is going to go
away and you're just

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.763
going to be left with a 2 there.

00:04:05.763 --> 00:04:08.810
So all I did is I added 7x.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.660
I added 7x to both
sides of that equation.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.750
And now we've got
something nonsensical.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.320
I don't care what x you pick,
how magical that x might be.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.320
There's no way that that x is
going to make 3 equal to 2.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.100
So in this scenario right over
here, we have no solutions.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.630
There's no x in the universe
that can satisfy this equation.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.300
Now let's try this
third scenario.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.200
So once again, maybe we'll
subtract 3 from both sides,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.390
just to get rid of
this constant term.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.910
So we're going to get negative
7x on the left hand side.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.883
On the right hand side, we're
going to have 2x minus 1.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.870
And now we can subtract
2x from both sides.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.930
To subtract 2x from
both sides, you're

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.280
going to get-- so
subtracting 2x,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.320
you're going to get negative
9x is equal to negative 1.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.970
Now you can divide both
sides by negative 9.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.320
And you are left with
x is equal to 1/9.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.270
So we're in this
scenario right over here.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.625
We very explicitly
were able to find an x,

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:21.220
x equals 1/9, that
satisfies this equation.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.920
So this right over here
has exactly one solution.
