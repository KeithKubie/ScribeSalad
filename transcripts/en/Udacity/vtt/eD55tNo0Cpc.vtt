00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.210
So now it's your turn to run the Hello

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.050
World Endpoints application. Go ahead and import the Hello

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.310
World Endpoints project into Eclipse. And then you run

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.780
your app on localhost. Then try your app in

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.220
the web UI. And remember, you get to it

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.210
by going to localhost: and then your port number.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.700
Also go ahead and try your app in the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.688
APIs Explorer. And remember, you get to that by going

00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:29.809
to localhost:8080 or whatever your port number

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:34.131
is, _ah/api/explorer. We've tested it out on localhost,

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:38.080
then go ahead and run it on appspot. Go to your app on appspot you

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.900
go to your-app-id.appspot.com. When you've done all

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.100
those things and your app's running on appspot,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.080
go ahead and enter your app ID here so that you can check that it's running.
