00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.370
GORAN K. HANSSON: The Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.030
has today decided to award
the Sveriges Riksbank

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.350
Prize in Economic Sciences
in Memory of Alfred Nobel

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.990
to Angus Deaton, for his
analysis of consumption,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.640
poverty, and welfare.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.790
ANGUS DEATON:
Looking back on it,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.480
it seems like a sort of golden
fairytale adventure, in which

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.700
it's really hard to
believe it was real,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.190
even from the first phone
call, when they said what

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.910
they were giving it to me for.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.930
And I'd always sort
of thought that I

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.050
had relatively low
chance of getting it,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.160
because they like to say
they're giving it for one big,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.280
deep thing.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.330
They sort of saw a theme
in this, in terms of it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.860
all being about welfare
and measurement.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.980
There is a theme of that sort,
and that theme has been there

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.080
for a very long time.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.500
CHRISTOPHER L. EISGRUBER: I
myself first met Angus shortly

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.950
after I joined the Woodrow
Wilson School faculty,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.970
and was immediately
impressed with his leadership

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.920
in the school and
his willingness

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.040
to tackle important questions.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.880
I am thrilled that this
year's Nobel Prize was awarded

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.480
to someone who is
both a great economist

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.680
and a great Princetonian.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.500
CECILIA ROUSE: I believe that
Angus Deaton's work and Angus

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.010
Deaton is motivated by
public policy in everything

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.470
that he does, whether it's
looking at consumption, income

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.570
inequality, poverty, that he is
motivated to better understand

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.180
the world to make
it a better place.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.700
ANNE CASE: He brings This
curiosity to the question,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.930
and has never lost that.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
His sense of wonder
about the world

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.650
is, I would say, second to none.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.900
HENRY FARBER: He is one of
the few economists I really

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.050
want to emulate,
because he's what I

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.380
would call a true intellectual.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.050
He reads voluminously.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.060
He reads everything he
can get his hands on.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.320
So he always has a broad view
of the problem he is working on.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.810
JANET CURRIE: I think
Angus is one of the people

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.040
that best embodies a traditional
notion that both data

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.400
and theory are very important.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.250
ILYANA KUZIEMKO: Angus' style
of research I think of as

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.570
incredibly liberating, to me
as a young assistant professor,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.110
when I came to Princeton.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.700
Both Angus and Anne
just made me feel

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.100
like I didn't have to
work on one idea, which I

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.670
think is very much Angus' work.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.540
And I think that's sort of
indicative of the way the Nobel

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.130
Prize gave Angus an
award for being Angus.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.920
CHRISTINA PAXSON: Angus
approaches problems

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.620
in a very distinctive way.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.570
And I guess I would say
he almost approaches them

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.300
like a detective.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
He comes up with a
very interesting,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.320
important question.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.620
He wants to find out
the answer to it.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.910
He doesn't have any
preconceived notions about what

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.150
that answer might be,
and he's as likely

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.850
to find something that is
unexpected as something that's

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.200
expected.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.790
GORAN K. HANSSON: Dear
Professor Deaton, you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.120
are an optimist, a
skeptic, and a humanist.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.480
And above all, you are an
empiricist, always determined

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.750
to confront what we believe
with what we can know, just

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.400
like Alfred Nobel.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.050
It is an honor and
a privilege for me

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.060
to convey to you, on
behalf of the Royal Swedish

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.080
Academy of Sciences, our
warmest congratulations.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.470
May I now please ask you to step
forward and receive your prize

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.250
from His Majesty, the King.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.680

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.750
ANGUS DEATON: One of my greatest
pleasures in recent years

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.880
has been seeing the
subject matter of economics

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.690
broaden and expand.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.150
It has not given up its core
themes, its measurement,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.820
or its mathematics, but it
has re-embraced its origins

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.660
in history, in psychology,
and political science,

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.260
in sociology,
and in philosophy.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.370
It has become a richer
and more humane subject.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.520
ORLEY ASHENFELTER: What
probably makes him exceptional--

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.450
and I think maybe the Nobel
committee appreciated--

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.170 position:67%
is that he doesn't leave it
at perfecting or improving economic theory.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.680
He tries to take
that to some data

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.480
and use it to explore
the details of what

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.520
he's discovered.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.750
ANNE CASE: Angus came
to Princeton in 1983.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.590
And starting with
that Class of 1983,

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.480
he has left an indelible print
on a generation of students who

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.690
have come through Princeton.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.880
He is a terrific lecturer.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.110
He is crystal clear, and he is
really excited about the work.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.610
And he makes other people
excited about the work.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.550
JANET CURRIE: Angus was one of
my first teachers at Princeton.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.490
So I actually still
remember having

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.620
him walk into the classroom.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.270
And I don't know exactly what
I expected, maybe some little

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.190
wiry Scotsman.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.230
And this great, huge
bear of a man walked in.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.310
He was taller than
the blackboard.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.400
I was really impressed.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.190
And then of course when
he started to talk,

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.500
I was even more impressed.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.230
He gave an absolutely beautiful
course on econometrics.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.010
He was one of my advisers
for my dissertation.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.290
I have known Angus
for a long time.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.330
One characteristic that
stands out, he's very funny.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.750
He's very knowledgeable
about many subjects.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.960
If you had to pick one person to
have dinner with and be certain

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.530
that you would not be bored,
he would be a very good person

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.580
to pick.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.190
ILYANA KUZIEMKO:
Angus the man, well--

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.720
How would I describe Angus?

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.730
Probably best not to
talk to him after a game

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.730
in which the Yankees lost
in a close situation.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.440
HENRY FARBER: Angus
is completely human.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.290
I mean, he doesn't hide much.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.650
So he lets it all hang out.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.960
And so that makes
him a good friend,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.410
and just a good person
to be around because

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.460
for a person of
his accomplishment

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:25.530
to be as natural as he is, to me
is a gift to me, if not to him.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.990
CHRISTINA PAXSON:
I should tell you

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.790
that I came to Princeton
University because

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.720
of Angus Deaton.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.720
I was a labor economist looking
to turn into a development

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.630
economist, and he
was an econometrician

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.920
who hadn't been at Princeton
long who wanted to become

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.200
a development economist.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.440
And Angus' offer to me
was, come to Princeton,

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.350
I'm putting together
a group, and we

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.960
can do this, become development
economists, together.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.180
And the span of my
collaboration with Angus

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.910
lasted literally decades.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.470
And over that period, we
wrote many papers together,

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.000
some of the papers that I
think are the most fun papers

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.890
I ever worked on.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.500
And so he was a colleague,
and he has been a teacher,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.320
and he's been just
a tremendous friend.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.610
CECILIA ROUSE: One of the great
things about Angus Deaton

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.780
is that he is a great
colleague, he's a great mentor,

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.330
he's a good friend.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.370
He's just an overall
wonderful person,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.640
so we couldn't be more thrilled
that the world has finally

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.850
recognized, or at least the
Nobel Prize committee has

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.960
finally recognized, not only
his contributions to economics,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.600
but that this is really
a wonderful scholar who's

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.980
contributed to all of our
intellectual thinking,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.480
and to all of us as a community.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.830
