&gt;&gt; ROSEN: Hi. My name is Carl Rosen [PH].
I am a software engineer working on Android.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.340
I work on the application framework and the
lock screen. One of the things I love about

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.920
Android is the gesture-based unlock screen.
When you turn your screen on, you press "menu"

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.119
to get to your unlock screen in which you
draw a pattern to get passed it. In this case,

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.669
I have a simple pattern set. But if I want
to just create a more complex pattern, I could

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.839
easily go to my security settings, change
the lock pattern, confirm my existing one,

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:40.200
and now I'll choose something a little bit
more tricky. Confirm that. Done. Now, when

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.350
I turn off the screen, I will be required
to draw my new, more complex pattern.
