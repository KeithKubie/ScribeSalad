00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.049
This is how it usually plays out: You’re
on date #4 with that cute guy Craig from Bumble,

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.799
and it seems to be going really well.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.850
Then he casually slips in a comment about
your ovarian future:

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.900
“That’s a great salad.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.020
So are you at that age where you’re thinking
about freezing your eggs?”

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.060
That look on my face is a mix of horror and
realization, and both are linked to Craig’s

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.940
f*cked-up idea that I and I alone carry the
burden of healthy fertility with an aging body.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.800
And that idea is rooted in the ever-dreaded
“biological clock.”

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.740
The biological clock is a phrase that's had
a few different meanings over time, but it's

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.679
typically used to refer to how female fertility
specifically declines with age.

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.760
Hey guys, I’m Sana, and this Sunday we’re
going to talk about the history of the biological

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.820
clock – and how capitalism has a lot to
say about my eggs.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.780

it.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.770
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.420
The actual phrase “biological clock” wasn’t
always used to refer to how long women had

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.300
until their reproduction ability plummeted.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.040
It used to refer to the human body’s circadian
rhythm: how you sleep, when you sleep,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.160
when you wake up. That sort of stuff.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.260
Moira Weigel, author and scholar of gender
and sexuality, notes that that phrase came

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.960
to mean something very different in the 1970s.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.300
The phrase “biological clock,” in the
sense that we use it now, enters the popular

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.479
imagination, the popular lexicon, in a very
particular moment in American history.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.130
It's the late 1970s, it's sort of after this
period of real flourishing and advancement

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.710
for the feminist movement and the women's
movement.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.740
In fact, Weigel even pinpoints the day it
enters the popular imagination:

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.470
March 16, 1978.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.770
That’s when Washington Post columnist Richard
Cohen wrote a piece in the Metro section called

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.940
“The Clock Is Ticking for Career Women”
about how, even though the career women seem

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.020
to have it all, they’re still not fulfilled
until they can have a baby.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.540
To a certain extent, the biological clock
is naming that real phenomenon, but I think

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.720
that the purchase that it gains in culture
generally cannot be separated from changes like the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.830
entrance of large numbers of middle-class,
college-educated women into parts of the workforce

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.360
that they had historically been excluded from,
women using contraception

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.890
and abortion to delay motherhood.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.920
So it’s no big coincidence that the year
Cohen used the term “biological clock”

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.700
to refer to women’s declining fertility
is also the same year that we see the first so-called

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.740
“test-tube baby” conceived through in
vitro fertilization.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.400
So at the same time that you have this increasingly
widespread discourse in the American media

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.140
about declining female fertility and anxiety
about the biological clock, there are major

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.020
advances taking place in assisted reproductive
technology and in vitro fertilization.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.940
And we’ll talk about the fertility industry
and IVF in just a moment, so hold on.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.980
Now, the idea of a woman’s fertility competing
with her ambitions in life continued to develop

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.200
in the media and pop culture throughout
the ’80s …

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.360
“You’re 31 years old--”

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.800
“And the clock is ticking.”

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.420
“No, the clock doesn’t really start to
tick until you’re 36."

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.280
… the ’90s …

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.200
“The daughter of my sister is getting married. My biological clock is ticking like this!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.500
And the way this case is going, I ain’t
never getting married.”

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.520
… and the 2000s.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.540
“A lot of women today, for whatever
reason, are starting their family a little later.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.080
So they want to know: How much time do I have?”

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.650
And there's something very chiding, something
very scolding, I would say, about this discourse

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.360
– saying that women who thought that they
could have it all, who thought that they could

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.120
have education, have careers and still
have families, are taking a serious risk

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.020
of ending up alone.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.980
Now, Dr. Lynn Westphal of Stanford Medical
School does note that the focus on women’s

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.760
reproductive aging is fair when we compare
women’s fertility to men’s.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:54.980
The focus on fertility has to focus primarily
on women, because all women will eventually

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.810
become infertile if they live long enough.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.320
There's no way to prevent menopause.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.010
Eventually, all the eggs will be depleted
from the ovaries, and that usually happens

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.590
around age 50.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.570
And at that point there are no more eggs and
a woman cannot get pregnant naturally.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.340
While there’s a chance that men can reproduce
in their 80s or 90s, that doesn’t necessarily

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.920
mean that their sperm is in great health.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.680
People are not as efficient at reproducing
as a lot of people think.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.380
We know that a normal, fertile couple in their
twenties has probably 20,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.070
maybe 25 percent chance of getting pregnant each month on their own.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.980
By age 40, that falls to about a 5 percent.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.120
We have focused a lot on the health of the
woman, but the health of the male is very important, too.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.620
Research from 2012 found that male reproductive
aging mattered for the mental health of the

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.100
child, specifically increasing the risk for
schizophrenia and autism.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.460
Relatedly, but not connected to aging, research
from 2017 found that between 1973 and 2011,

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.080
sperm count in men from 50 different Western
countries had fallen between 50 and 60 percent.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.600
Studies have shown a decline in sperm counts
around the world.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.440
The decline in sperm count is not a problem
with our technologies – so we can overcome that.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.930
The aging of the egg and decreasing quality
of the egg, we don't have a way to correct at this point.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.160
And while Dr. Westphal makes the point that
the focus on women’s reproductive aging

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.610
is warranted because we do have an end date
– aka menopause – it’s worth exploring

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.960
when and why that became such focus in the
media.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.160
The emergence of the biological clock as something
that specifically refers to women’s fertility

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.889
came about in the context of the women’s
rights movements making significant gains

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.210
in the ’60s and ’70s.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.610
We’re talking about the Equal Pay Act of
1963, Roe v. Wade in 1973 and the Pregnancy

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.650
Discrimination Act of 1978.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.310
American women, especially white American
women, not only had the opportunity to control

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.660
their reproductive future, but also enter
the workforce in greater numbers than ever before.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.130
In her seminal book “Backlash,” Pulitzer
Prize–winning journalist Susan Faludi describes

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.500
the era of Ronald Reagan’s presidency as
an undeclared war against American women.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.240
One of the problems threatening the American
family, and therefore the fabric of society,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.060
was that women were having children at later
ages.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.860
According to the Centers for Disease Control,
between 1970 and 2000, the median age of a

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.680
first-time mother rose from about 22 to almost
25.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.020
And the national birth rate had been falling
for almost two decades.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.940
In 1957, the average American woman had three
and a half children; by 1976, that number

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.120
had fallen to one and a half.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.760
While women in the United States, in particular,
were and are still choosing to have children later

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.420
in life, the conversation has focused on that
being the result of this competition between

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.750
motherhood and ambition.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.670
And that’s very much still the case.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.631
Take, for example, Anne-Marie Slaughter’s
viral Atlantic piece “Why Women Still Can’t

00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:53.340
Have It All,” and Sheryl Sandberg’s book
“Lean In.”

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.169
But recent research indicates that women who
are delaying motherhood might not be doing

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.620
it because of their careers.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.760
Medical anthropologist Marcia Inhorn found
in a recent study, women who are freezing

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.060
their eggs aren’t doing it out of career
ambitions, but because they can’t find the right partner.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.240
And if they are delaying motherhood because
of their career, that’s because corporate

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.610
America by design was meant for men – not
for women – as Weigel points out.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.550
The idea, again, that we see again and again
throughout the history of this biological

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:25.200
clock conversation, is that if women are having
trouble balancing work and life,

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.700
or fitting the patterns of their lives – their personal
and biological lives – to a corporate system

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.700
that was not designed to accommodate women,
the solution is not paid leave,

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.360
more generous childcare benefits.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:45.620
The solution is an expensive technological
fix – and that is beyond reach for many people.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.600
That technological fix has given birth (no
pun intended) to an entire industry that ultimately

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.700
works off the fears of college-educated working
women.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.540
OK, pun intended.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.150
I mentioned earlier the first IVF baby was
born around the same time that the biological

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.784
clock metaphor entered the American imagination.

00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:04.320
And it was a huge deal, by the way.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.900
Women who previously were unable to bear children
because of blocked fallopian tubes, fertility

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.430
issues or even survivors of ovarian cancer
were able to finally have kids!

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:19.010
Today, thanks to other technological advances
like egg freezing, fertility is a huge industry

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.220
estimated to hit $4 billion in 2018.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.900
But while the fertility industry is growing,
it’s also been criticized for overselling.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.490
While IVF and egg freezing are presented as
part of the solution for career-oriented women

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.180
who want it all, their success rates do decline
with age.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.820
Around 40% of IVF cycles result in babies
for women aged 32 and younger.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.639
Not even 10 years later, for women aged 40,
that success rate is cut in half, to less than 20%.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.040
And even then, these treatments are financially
out of reach for many, if not most women.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.580
Freezing your eggs can cost around $11,000
for a single round of retrieval.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.540
Plus there’s the storage fees to keep your
eggs safely frozen,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.260
anywhere from $250 to $1,500 annually.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.020
Then there’s IVF, which can cost around $12,000
per round,

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.990
plus $3,000 to $5,000 for the necessary hormonal drugs.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.600
70% of women who get fertility treatments
actually go into debt.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.780
And while sperm freezing and storing – different
from sperm banks – is becoming a thing among men,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.560
due to concerns about sperm count and
aging, it’s nowhere near the same industry

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.749
as it is for women.

00:09:22.749 --> 00:09:24.579
So is this really a solution?

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:27.420
And is there really a competition between
ambition and motherhood?

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.939
And is the biological clock real?

00:09:28.939 --> 00:09:31.009
Sana, can you just say yes or no?

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:32.180
Well, it’s complicated.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.589
Because women do have an expiration date on their
fertility.

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:38.649
But as Weigel points out, we can’t divorce
the way we talk about the biological clock

00:09:38.649 --> 00:09:40.910
in this country from the history of women’s
labor.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.329
This idea that professional women, educated
women, are going about their lives wrong and

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:49.560
that they're organizing their lives the wrong
way, prioritizing the wrong things, not setting

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:55.560
enough stock in traditional ways of doing
things, is yet another expression of this

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.839
cultural anxiety that we see throughout the
history of dating, about people of all genders,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.320
but women in particular, getting more control
over

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.180
their personal, professional, intimate reproductive lives.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.560
So have any of you guys actually had any kind
of sperm freezing or egg freezing ads targeted

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.580
towards you on social media or anywhere?
