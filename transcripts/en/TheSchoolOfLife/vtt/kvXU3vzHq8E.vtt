00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.360
George Orwell

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.560
was an English intellectual who died in 1950

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.540
and used literature for the only reason it ultimately really exists -

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.420
to try to change the world for the better.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.680
He was, in the deeper sense, a political writer,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.980
someone who wanted art to help us grow kinder, fairer, wiser.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.640
In 1946, a year after the publication of

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.820
his momentously popular fable, 'Animal Farm',

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.720
he wrote an essay titled, 'Why I Write',

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.060
which laid out his approach with a characteristic clarity.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.320
What I wanted to do throughout the past ten years

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.340
is to make political writing into an art.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.200
My starting point is always a feeling of partisanship. A sense of injustice.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.460
When I sit down to write a book, I don't say to myself, "I'm going to produce a work of art."

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.420
"I write it because there is some lie I want to expose, some fact to which I want to draw attention,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.280
and my initial concern is to get a hearing."

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.880
To understand why Orwell matters,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.240
we therefore have to understand what this most political of writers loved,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.020
and what he hated.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.480
What he was in rebellion against, and what he championed.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.000
This is what will give us the keys to understanding his remarkable work,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.720
and painful yet deeply fulfilled life.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.380
George Orwell always hated the social group of which he was, despite everything,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.020
an exemplary member: Intellectuals.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.380
From an early age, he had wanted to be a writer.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.980
But George Orwell excelled at never quite belonging.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.600
He was born in 1903 in India,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.360
which was then part of the British Empire,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.500
to economically fragile civil servant parents,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.800
who fought for him to have a classic upper middle class English upbringing.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.640
And then hoped he might become a doctor, or a lawyer.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.600
They sent him to what turned out to be a crippling, mean spirited English prep school at the age of eight.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.720
From where he won a scholarship to Eton.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.280
But he turned against the values and spirit of the English public school system.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.700
He never went to university, and after a stint as an imperial policeman in Burma,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.560
he settled into the life of the odd-jobbing literary intellectual.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.180
Working in a Hamstard book shop, reviewing other people's books,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.780
and eventually, writing some of his own.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.080
Nevertheless, Orwell's disdain of intellectuals was a constant.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.940
He accused them of a range of sins, a lack of patriotism, resentment of money,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040
and physical vigor. Concealed sexual frustraion, pretension, and dishonesty.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.800
He knew it all form the inside, but Orwell's greatness emerge from the rye determination

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.660
with which he recognized and came to triumph against such tendencies in himself.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.500
"The really important fact about the English intelligentsia," he once wrote, "is their severance

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740
from the common culture of the country.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.040
In left wing circles, it's always felt that there's something slightly  disgraceful in being an Englishman,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.380
and that it's a duty to snigger at every English institution from horse racing to suet puddings.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.800
Orwell's generation of intellectuals, which had witnessed the First World War and the Great Depression,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.460
was obsessed with airy, abstract, large schemes to redeem human kind.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.880
Some were fanatical communists, others staunch defenders of radical capitalism, a few admired the new

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.840
authoritarian regimes of Italy, Spain, and Germany, and wanted something similar

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.240
to take hold in the anglophone sphere.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.320
Orwell listened, and was for a time, a little seduced.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.600
But he came gradually to champion something far more radical:

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.360
The tastes, opinions, needs and outlook of someone he called "the ordinary person".

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.060
A knowledge of ordinary life

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.100
came rather late to Orwell.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.260
As a typical product of an English public school,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.780
he was a little exposed in anyone below his own social class.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.460
A tendency compounded by a naturally aloof, bookish and different manner.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.520
A friend described him in age 25 as,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.380
"remarkably muff eaten for one his age"

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.580
But Orwell set out to make up for his lack of knowledge

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760
and gradually came to be the great defender

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.200
of what he repeatedly called ordinary life.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.060
Life of people, not especially blessed with material goods,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.880
but people who work on ordinary jobs

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.380
who don't have much of education,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.980
who won't achieve greatness

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.860
and yet, nevertheless, love, care for others,

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.520
work, have fun, raise children, and have large thoughts about the deepest questions,

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.760
in ways that Orwell thought especially admirable.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.580
Orwell's journey into ordinary life,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.740
began in the spring of 1928.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.040
When he left the privileges of his class behind, and went to work in series of menial service jobs

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.880
in the French and English capitals

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.500
experiences he was to recount in his book,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.260
"Down and Out in Paris and London" published in 1933.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.400
The book is filled with affection and portraits of life behind stairs in hotels and restaurants

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.420
and revels and camaraderie, humor and warmth.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.800
of an assortment of cleaners or shoe rubbers, waiters, chefs

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800
and the occasional prostitute tramp.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.440
It was a side of life Orwell was further to investigate.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.620
In a book chronicling his journeys around the industrial coal mining of Northern England

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.360
In a 1937 book titled,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.540
The Road to Wigan Pier

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.780
again, without sentimentality or reverse snobbery,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.540
Orwell casts the generous complex eye

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.620
over the people he met, and concluded that the average pulp in a coal mining village.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.820
contain more intelligence, wisdom

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.240
than the British cabinet or the high table of an Oxbridge College.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.000
Orwell especially liked the lack of prudishness and hypocrisy

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
among the ordinary people he met.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.900
One thing one notices when he writes, if he looks directly at the common people

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.540
especially in the big towns,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.540
is that they are not puritanical.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.500
They are in veteran gamblers, drink as much as their wages will permit,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.680
and devoted to boardy jokes and use, probably, the foulest language in the world.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.760
Then, as now, there was plenty of information in the news about ordinary people.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.380
But Orwell understood that these news tended to turn people into abstractions.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.260
And he saw it as the role in his craft, literary journalism,

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.540
to flesh out the human beings behind the statistics.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.040
And so, correct the prejudice and casual racism that circulated all around.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.880
In an essay written on a trip to Marrakech

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.780
Orwell wrote sarcastically are the typically neo-colonial attitude of travelers

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.780
towards the local inhabitants.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The people here have brown faces

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.020
"There are so many of them, are they really the same flesh as yourself?"

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.780
"Do they even have names?

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.640
or they merely a kind of undifferentiated brown stuff?"

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.300
about as an individual as bees or coral insects.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.540
All people who work with their hands are partly invisible.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.840
And the more important work that they do,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.840
the less visible they are.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.540
Orwell's love of the ordinary inspired his curiosity

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.680
about a range of themes not often considered in literature.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.980
He thought about and wrote in praise of comics and country walks

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.680
dancing and flowers.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.080
He wrote bravely in defense of English cooking

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.300
kippers, Yorkshire pudding, Devon shire cream, muffins and crumpets he wrote.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.420
And then asked, where else other than  English cooking

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.300
do you see potatoes roasted under the joint?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.600
which is far in a way the best way of cooking them.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.900
Orwell wrote tenderly in defense of Charles Dickens

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.580
at the time when this great writer

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.960
was considered low brow and too popular to win the esteemed intellectuals.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.040
In a great essay of 1946,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.880
Politics and the English Language,

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.460
Orwell stood up against the pros typical of intellectuals

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.440
high blown and full of long fancy words

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.680
and defended a simple, almost naive way of writing.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.180
He outlined the list of rules for how to write well,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.020
which included a complete ban

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.260
on fancy words like phenomenon,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.540
categorical,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.800
utilize,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.620
inexorable and veritable.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.500
Orwell revealed a hatred of foreign words like

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.400
status quo and deus ex machina.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.340
And concluded,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:04.360
There is really no need for any of the hundreds of foreign phrases now current in English.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.560
George Orwell is today extremely famous for two books which played a very small part in his life.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.420
if measured simply in terms of years

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.640
he wrote Animal Farm in 1945

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.840
when he was 42 and he published Nineteen Eighty-four

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.400
in 1949 when he was 45.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.820
but he was dead in January 1950

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.820
at the age of only 46.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.880
In other words, he had just four short years

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.440
being the Orwell we know today.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.920
Nevertheless, these two books are anchored in deep thinking

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.180
that Orwell had done all his adult life

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.400
about how literature should be written in an age of movies and mass communication.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.100
In short, he knew that the task of a writer

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.900
was to ensure that the most serious ideas should achieve mass popularity.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.200
A double act, which required particular skill and intelligence.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.140
Animal farm is a political trapped about how revolutions fall prey to counter-revolutions.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.340
and turn their backs on their own original ideas.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.200
It fairly maps out the progress of French Revolution.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.820
the European Revolutions of 1848 and the Russian Revolution of 1917.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.320
But, described like this, no one outside of the few academics

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.920
would ever bother to read it.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.080
Orwell's genius was to hit upon of form the fable

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.180
which would carry his story to a mass audience and could be understood as he put it

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.180
by more or less, anyone.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.220
So Orwell did what Aesop, Walt Disney, La Fontaine and Beatrix Potter

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.220
among many others have done.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.880
Which is to tell a story about humans via animals.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.600
In the process, Orwell revealed, the sins of the revolutionaries

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.520
are not limited to people involved in actual revolutions.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.700
Indeed, that it's a permanent human possibility to believe when he's guided by  high ideals

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.640
and then go on to betray them all.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.900
Every time a revolution now goes wrong, people bring up Animal Farm.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.400
And declare it to be ahead of its time.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.720
So prescient.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.700
This is the genius of Orwell's fable.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.080
By cutting out all contemporary human references,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.440
Orwell found a way to tell us about ourselves

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.660
for all time even for the future.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.620
Having successfully reinvented the fable,

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.340
Orwell, in an astonishing burst of creativity,

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.920
then reinvented the science fiction novel.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.100
As a boy, he'd loved the novels of H.G. Wells.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.320
Especially, the Time Machine and The War of the Worlds.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.720
Like Wells, Orwell seized upon trends in his own time

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.520
and try to imagine how they might develop over the long term.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.960
His science fiction novel is set in Airstrip One.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.280
A place once known as Great Britain,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.380
but now a province of the super state of Oceania.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.580
And locked in perpetual ideological conflict with two other blocks,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.440
Eurasia

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.540
and East Asia.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.980
Like all great dystopian novels,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.000
Orwell's book was an attempt to warn his own society

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.460
about its own alarming trends.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.920
For example, he could see that what can terrorize a country

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.240
is not so much outright torture or clumsy covert restrictions on free speech,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.560
but a lulling of the citizenry

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.900
through sophisticated entertainment and empty-headed news reports.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.500
all wrapped up in a constant reference to freedom.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:25.200
So, In 1984, society is full of intriguing new machines

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.120
omnipresent screens which both addicted,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.100
and at the same time watch over their citizens.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.120
Julia, the leading female figure in the novel,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.300
works in the department of government known as "Mini  True"

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:42.180
which systematically distorts access to information in highly subtle ways.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.740
To blind the citizenry to their enslavement,

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.080
Julia operates a machine that turns out porn novels.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.460
alongside, films oozing with sex,

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.520
rubbishing newspapers containing almost nothing but sport, crime and astrology.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.900
The people, however, don't feel they are enslaved.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.900
As Orwell so well understood,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.520
the really clever and scary regimes of the modern world

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.960
aren't the obviously dictatorial ones.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.960
they are, the apparently, democratic ones

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.680
that give their citizens the distinct feeling that they are free.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.920
Well in fact, blinding them

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.280
with constant sexual titillation, and sentimental distractions.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.360
George Orwell had the wisdom to make himself remarkably future-proof.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.760
He was weary of economic and political abstractions.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.180
He start close to the truth of ordinary life.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.680
The realities of sex, food, money, love and pleasure.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.740
and he wrote with total clarity

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.740
about enduring eternal themes on human nature.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.420
He is, perhaps, the most successful serious English-language writer of the 20th century.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.120
and gives us the tools to continue to imagine

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.820
what writing should be in our own time.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.240
Ultimately, Orwell's message

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.800
is the same as the plea that he discerned in all of Charles Dickens' books.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.560
in the essay he wrote on him

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.820
namely, that human beings should behave better.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.360
This, as he pointed out, is either a terrific cliche

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.180
or just about the most important instruction in the hole of life.

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.560
It was Orwell's genius to remind as that it is, of course,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.840
very much, the latter.
