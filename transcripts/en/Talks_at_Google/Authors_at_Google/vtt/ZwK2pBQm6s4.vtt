[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:08.690
SPEAKER 1: Good morning.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.731
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:12.220
It's great to see such
a full room today.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.780
I'm delighted to
welcome Dianna Staaf.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.130
Dianna Staaf fell in love with
cephalopods at the age of 10.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.160
She began to keep them as
pets in a home aquarium

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.620
and learned to scuba dive in
order to meet more of them

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.320
in the wild.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.770
She went on to study pygmy
octopuses in Santa Barbara,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.760
cuttlefish in Australia,
reef squid in Bermuda,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.280
and finally
completed her PhD on,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
quote, "Reproduction and Early
Life of the Humboldt Squid,"

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.770
or, quote, "Squid Sex
and Babies," at Stanford.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.610
Her first book titled "Squid
Empire: the Rise and Fall

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.010
of the Cephalopods,"
has been named

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.260
one of the best science books
of 2017 by NPR Science Friday.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.720
She lives in San Jose
in the physical world

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.930
and at cephalopodiatrist.com
online.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.240
Please join me in welcoming
to Google Dianna Staaf.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:15.100
DIANNA STAAF: Thank you so much.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.230
It's really
wonderful to be here.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.880
I know it was probably hard to
take time away from your work

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.980
to come, and I
appreciate that everybody

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.110
was able to do that to be here.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.059
And for anybody watching it
remotely or in the future,

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:32.350
thank you for taking time
out of whatever else you were

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.780
going to be doing to see this.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.390
I am here to talk to
you about cephalopods,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.020
which is a difficult word
to say all by itself.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.810
And so we can just call
them squid, and octopus,

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.920
and relatives.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.700
And in particular, the story
that I want to tell about them

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560
is a story that parallels
the history of dinosaurs.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.540
And the reason that
this particular story

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.030
about cephalopods has caught
my attention to the point

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.710
that I wrote a
whole book about it

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.280
is that I started to realize
that the deep, evolutionary

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.700
history of squid and
octopuses was even more

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.720
fascinating than
the famous dinosaurs

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.480
that we all know and love
from the age of three or four,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.860
and yet nobody knows
anything about it.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.160
So I'm going to tell you
today why cephalopods

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.410
are even better than dinosaurs.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.020
And in particular,
trying to spark something

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.380
that I like to call the
Cephalopod Renaissance.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.930
This is a reference to
something called the Dinosaur

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.250
Renaissance that happened
in the latter part

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.090
of the last century.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.300
We often don't even
realize it today,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.520
but dinosaurs used to be seen as
really slow, and really stupid,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.870
and really boring.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.980
And that was this view up here.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.320
This drawing was done
in the late 1800s,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.970
but the view persisted
into the early 1900s

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.870
as well that dinosaurs were
too heavy to even walk around.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.520
They had to live in swamps.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.070
They were too stupid to survive,
and so they were already

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.640
doomed by the time an asteroid
hit and ended their reign.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.280
And so no one was actually
that interested in their lives

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.060
and behavior until
a scientist named

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.590
Bob Bakker in the '60s
started to describe dinosaurs,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.040
and in particular one famous
dinosaur named deinonychus,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.110
and realized that it moved
quickly, it was very active,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.630
it was very energetic.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.810
And this actually became
the whole view of dinosaurs

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.740
that we now know.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.030
As complex creatures with
social lives and behaviors,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.089
and all their relationships
with birds, and the feathers,

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.130
and the warm bloodedness.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.560
And all of this stuff is
called the Dinosaur Renaissance

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.140
and gives us this
beautiful view of

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.219
the delightfully ferocious,
warm blooded, cuddly dinosaurs

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.010
that we know today.

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.330
And, of course, this
Dinosaur Renaissance

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.420
happened in the scientific
literature championed

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.950
by scientists, but it quickly
seeped out into popular culture

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.200
giving us all of these.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.900
This is why we have Jurassic
Park and all of its sequels.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.840
This is why we have
so many sticker

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.720
books full of dinosaurs and
video games full of dinosaurs.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.540
Its because there was this
shift in scientific thinking

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.140
about dinosaurs realizing
how complex and interesting

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.936
their lives really were.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:18.589
So I'm here to show you
the same thing happening

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.990
with cephalopods, except
they're even better.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.520
And one of the ways in
which they're even better

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.630
is that they have so many
representatives around today

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.794
that we can learn from.

00:04:30.794 --> 00:04:32.210
Of course, we have
representatives

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.500
of dinosaurs today.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
We have birds.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.400
And similarly to that,
we can think about

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.160
what do we have the squid and
the octopus that we have today,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.010
and what makes
them what they are?

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.510
A lot of the things
that we think of

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.090
are tentacles, camouflage.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.270
There's actually a cuttlefish
here hiding in the sand.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.100
It's little arms are
coming down there

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.960
and it has two
little black eyes.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.409
The amazing camouflage abilities
of these animals are legendary.

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.950
And, of course, they can also
squirt ink if that doesn't work

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.510
and they have to
get away quickly.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.630
And it's all connected
to their intelligence.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.100
Their very large brains.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.450
Their ability to coordinate.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.630
The camouflage, the behavior,
to coordinate all of those arms

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.520
and tentacles moving together.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.340
It all has to be done by a very
complex central nervous system.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.580
And these are all the
things that we know and love

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.960
about cephalopods today.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.690
About squid and octopus.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.490
And one of the things that
is most fascinating to me

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.140
about their evolutionary history
is that none of these things

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.140
originally made the
first cephalopod.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.990
The very first cephalopod
was made by a shell.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.400
A buoyant shell.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.490
And that was what separated
the early cephalopods from all

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.070
of the other snails,
and mollusks,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.740
and other clams and things that
were living on the sea floor.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.570
And to understand
how this happened,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.020
we have to go way, way, way
back in time because cephalopods

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.520
are twice as old as dinosaurs.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.030
So we have to go before
humans, obviously,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.970
but also way back
before the dinosaurs,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.830
and way back before there
was anything on land.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.060
So we're now talking
500 million years ago.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.200
Land is completely
barren, except for algae.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.157
Are there any phycologist
in the audience?

00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:15.740
You don't even know
what phycology is.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.291
It's great.

00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:17.290
It's the study of algae.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.970
And I always feel bad saying
that there's nothing on land

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.550
because technically there
were some little cells

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.217
of algae smooshing
around here and there.

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:27.050
But there was nothing
large and interesting.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.600
Everything large and
interesting was in the ocean,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.570
and this is what it looked like.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.070
Trilobites mostly.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.830
And more algae, but
larger algae this time.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.690
All these big plants here.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.040
And almost everything
was on the sea floor.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.600
So even under water, there
weren't any large animals

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.800
swimming around.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.920
This is way before
fish and sharks.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.300
No marine reptiles,
no marine mammals.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.980
And so anything
that was swimming

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.110
was just kind of a
little shrimpy thing.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.010
And most of the large animals
were crawling on, or burrowing

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.487
in, or scrabbling around
over the sea floor

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.320
because that was the
interesting place where

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.090
all of the interactions
were taking place.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.020
And one little fellow who was
doing this along with everybody

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.500
else is this little
snail-like creature

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.630
that's thought to be one
of the first cephalopods

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.120
or the first ancestors
of cephalopods.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.460
And the shell of
this little fellow

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.290
shows us how they became
the wondrous creatures

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.690
that they turned into.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.880
And it happened because--

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.304
this is diagrams.

00:07:29.304 --> 00:07:30.470
Cross-sections of the shell.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.870
So here's our little friend
still smooshing around

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.100
on the sea floor.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.410
But you can see that
inside the shell

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.730
there are some little chambers.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.190
The chambers filled
with the yellow color

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.790
are sectioned off, separated
from the rest of the animal,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.070
and they're filled
with buoyant gas.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.070
And once enough of
those chambers formed,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.770
the gas in them was able to
offset the weight of the shell

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.190
and the weight of the animal and
lift it right up into the water

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.755
column.

00:07:55.755 --> 00:07:57.380
So that's what you
see at the top there

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.020
is the first real,
true cephalopod that

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.270
had a chambered shell
with buoyant gas

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.410
inside the chambers.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.840
It was able to move
around in the water column

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.020
and they were some of the first
animals to really be swimmers.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.350
And not only were they swimmers,
but they could get enormous.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.490
Because once the shell
is no longer heavy,

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.030
now the shell carries
its own buoyancy with it,

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.430
it can get arbitrarily large.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.460
And so cephalopods literally
rose above the competition.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.920
I like to say this is a
very authentic drawing

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.500
of the early Ordovician seas,
except for the scuba diver

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.200
who's sort of out of place.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.990
But she's just there to
show scale to show you

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.039
how incredibly large
these animals got.

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:46.790
The straight shelled cephalopods
are going off of the screen.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.850
They were large enough that
the shells would have reached

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.590
the entire length of this room.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:53.900
And then we don't
even know if they

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.120
had tentacles, how many
tentacles they had,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.310
how long those tentacles
might have been.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.910
So they really were some
of the first sea monsters,

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.450
the first sea monsters
in the whole ocean, which

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:08.000
meant in the whole world
because there was still

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.310
nothing large on land.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.990
And so on top here--

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.280
again, this time with a
snappily dressed men for scale--

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.310
we have [? cameraseris, ?] one
of those really long shelled,

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.700
straight shelled
early cephalopods.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.710
And then this curl shelled
cephalopod down here

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.810
is a type of cephalopod
called an ammonite that

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.460
lived much later.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.830
That one actually lived in
the oceans at the same time

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.610
as dinosaurs were
living on land.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.019
Icthyosaurs were
swimming around.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:35.810
If they were big enough,
they were probably

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:36.851
trying to eat these guys.

00:09:36.851 --> 00:09:38.857
Mosasaurs were
probably eating them.

00:09:38.857 --> 00:09:40.940
And you could see that the
shells got large enough

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.850
that a person could climb
inside of that shell.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.970
They were really tremendous
throughout the hundreds

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.400
of millions of years that
they lived in the ocean.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.200
And for most of
this time, they all

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.220
had these big shells that
carried their own buoyancy

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:56.400
around with them.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.220
And so they were
sort of freed up

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.370
to move wherever they wanted,
to be as large as they

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.130
could possibly evolve to be.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.590
And they were living
there, doing all this

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:07.730
at the same time--

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.910
both long before and also at
the same time as the dinosaurs

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.830
were doing all of their
crazy things on land.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.380
And then what
really blows my mind

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:19.130
is that they faced
extinction at the same time.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.220
At the end of the Cretaceous
when an asteroid smashed

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.160
into the planet and all
of the non-avian dinosaurs

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.760
went extinct, so did
most of the cephalopods.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.130
It was a very bad day.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.830
They don't know
exactly what happened.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.040
We do know that the
asteroid hit, that it

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.840
changed the global climate.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.080
It probably acidified the
surface areas of the oceans

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.820
tremendously.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.550
There were probably lots of
fires all over the place.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.490
It's still a matter
of active research

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:54.560
why this really bad day caused
such specific extinctions.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.780
Because remember, not
everything went extinct.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.349
It was not a really
bad day for everybody.

00:11:00.349 --> 00:11:01.640
We still have all of our birds.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.320
All of our avian dinosaurs.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.790
And we still have
all of our squid,

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.550
and octopus, and
nautilus, and cuttlefish

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:08.944
that we talked about.

00:11:08.944 --> 00:11:10.610
And so it is a very
interesting question

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.602
about why some of
these animals survived

00:11:13.602 --> 00:11:15.060
one of the worst
days on the planet

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.000
and so many others went extinct.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.190
And it makes it very
interesting to study

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.620
both of these
large famous groups

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.790
that faced extinction-- the
dinosaurs and the cephalopods.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.160
Now, I have to
wonder-- so cephalopods

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.450
were huge, ancient monsters,
they lived before the dinosaurs

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.220
and through the time
of the dinosaurs,

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.510
and they had a horrible,
massive murder mystery

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.200
extinction at the same time.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.107
So why aren't they as cool?

00:11:42.107 --> 00:11:43.190
Why don't we know as much?

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.420
I mean, they are as
cool, but why don't we

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.336
think they're as cool?

00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:47.460
Why don't we know
as much about them?

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.040
And the interesting
thing is the sort

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.840
of fossils they
leave are extremely

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.330
different from the sort of
fossils that a dinosaur leaves.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.950
A dinosaur leaves--
interestingly,

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.440
cephalopod fossils are
actually way more abundant.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.160
So this is just a picture
here of a single rock

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.890
that's crammed with
these coiled ammonites.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.890
These are ancient
cephalopods that

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.840
lived at around the same
time as the dinosaurs

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.340
with these coiled shells.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.780
And they're just
fossilized everywhere.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.960
This is a single
dinosaur thighbone, which

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.400
is always a very exciting find.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.610
To find even one bone
from a dinosaur skeleton.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.560
And you would think
that if their fossils

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.710
are more abundant, that we
would know more about them.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.420
But the abundance
of their fossils

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.900
caused an interesting
situation for many, many years.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.260
Their fossils are so
abundant that geologists just

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.180
used them as time stamps.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.990
This is a picture of sort of
a cross-section through rocks

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.630
showing you how rocks
get deposited in layers

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.700
and then the layers get eroded.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.220
So if you go out digging for
fossils in different places,

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.803
you might dig through
different layers

00:12:47.803 --> 00:12:48.980
and find different fossils.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.800
And in this case, these
fossils are showing you

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.150
that even if you dig in very
different places in the world,

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.550
you might find the same
fossils from place to place.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.940
And that can help you
know the age of the rocks

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.320
that you're digging in.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.810
And those fossils that
are reliable enough

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.850
to tell you the age of
the rocks are digging in,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.710
those are called index fossils.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.030
And many, many index fossils
are cephalopods or ammonites

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.540
and the relatives of squid
because they're so abundant,

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.180
they're so diverse, and
they're so easily recognized.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.150
A single shell can be
identified to species

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.800
quite easily by counting the
ribs and figuring out various--

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.900
just taking morphometrics.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.025
Basically doing little
measurements and saying it's

00:13:31.025 --> 00:13:34.270
wider than it is tall, or
it's fatter than it is tall,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.235
and all of these things
will give you the species.

00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:39.110
And so for a long time,
geologists were like,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.250
these are super useful rocks.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.310
They're the most useful
rocks in the world,

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.500
but they're not animals.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.530
Nobody was thinking about
what were these things doing

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.760
when they were alive.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.650
Ecologically
speaking, why did they

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.850
evolve these crazy shapes
and these intricate lines?

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.460
And some of them were spiky,
and some of them were tiny,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.870
and some of them were big.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.828
And nobody really thought
about those questions

00:14:01.828 --> 00:14:04.760
because they were just
so useful as time stamps.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.840
And then this book was published
in 2001 called "Ammonites."

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.060
It's a really little book.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.080
It was published by
a couple of people

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.320
at the Natural History
Museum in London.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.550
And they just asked a
very simple question.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:20.210
What might these ammonites,
these ancient cephalopods,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.090
have looked like
when they were alive?

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.470
And more importantly,
what were they doing?

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.580
What were they eating?

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.900
And who was eating them?

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.500
And this was kind of a first
step towards creating dioramas

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.290
like fourth graders
everywhere do with dinosaurs.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:35.480
And you have the t-rex
jumping on the triceratops

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.920
and taking large bites of it.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.680
And after this
book was published,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.540
people started
publishing illustrations

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.550
like this in their
scientific papers.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.267
Actually trying to recreate
the animals and think,

00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:47.600
what would they have been doing?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:53.510
This particular animal up
here is a kind of ammonite

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.930
that grows a recurved shell
sort of like a paperclip.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.550
And it's been
puzzling scientists

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.700
for a really long time
thinking, what did they do?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.950
Why would they bend
their shell back again?

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.230
It seems like it would be
really awkward for swimming.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.210
And then this crazy Russian
scientist named [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.972
was like, well, maybe they
just used it like a paperclip.

00:15:13.972 --> 00:15:15.680
If it's shaped like
a paperclip, maybe it

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.804
works like a paperclip.

00:15:16.804 --> 00:15:18.470
And why didn't they
just hook themselves

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.786
on to some kelp or some
underwater driftwood

00:15:21.786 --> 00:15:22.410
and live there?

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.450
Live a very sedentary life.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.270
And so he drew this picture
and that got published,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.470
and then other scientists
published angry diatribes

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.450
showing why that couldn't
possibly be the case.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.652
It was great because
science has been proceeding

00:15:35.652 --> 00:15:37.610
by leaps and bounds
because people are actually

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.010
thinking, talking about
it, building models

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:43.400
to see what can happen.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.960
And so the other thing that is
helping to move this forward

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.732
is not just the
shift in perspective

00:15:49.732 --> 00:15:52.190
that people are finally thinking
about what they would have

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.710
looked like, what the cephalopod
dioramas of the deep sea

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.900
should look like, but
there are new ways

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.030
to look at the fossils.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.530
So technology has
proceeded to the point

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.330
where we can get
more information out

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.700
of those old fossils.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.650
And all of these fossils
that I showed you

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.390
are all well and good.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.380
They're beautiful.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.880
It's easy to count ribs
and things like that,

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.820
but it doesn't tell you
very much about what

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.140
the animal was like.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.390
If you look at an
articulated skeleton

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.680
of a t-rex or a brontosaurus,
you can drape flesh onto it

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.370
pretty easily.

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.720
You see where the neck was.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.670
You see how many legs it had.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.350
You see how long its tail was.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.960
But all of the soft
parts of the cephalopod

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.930
are totally missing from
this kind of fossil.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:34.370
They're just gone.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.950
And we have no idea
where their mouth was

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.860
or what number of tentacles
they might have had.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:44.530
But now paleontologists
are making friends

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.550
with medical imagery
technicians and putting rocks

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.089
into CT scanners, which
I'm told is, like,

00:16:51.089 --> 00:16:53.380
everybody's favorite thing
when they go to the hospital

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.110
and find that there are fossils
being run through the CT

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.710
scanner and everybody gathers
around to see what's going on.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.210
Because the great
thing is if you

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.580
look inside these
kinds of fossils,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.829
you can actually start
to get information

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.349
about the soft parts
that's missing.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:11.170
And in this case,
this particular fossil

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.630
was a straight
shelled cephalopod.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.900
And the CT scanner
is not yet finding

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.569
how many tentacles it had,
but it is finding the mouth.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.560
And there are some pretty
stunning images coming out.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:29.280
This is straight out of a
paper in science, which is--

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.290
science papers are
incredibly condensed.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.840
So I'm sorry to show you this
image that's like, ugh, too

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.630
much information.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.850
But basically, A, on top, that's
a picture of the straight shell

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:41.082
that was put in the CT scanner.

00:17:41.082 --> 00:17:45.690
B shows you a sort of
cross-sectional view of what

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.130
sort of the beginning
of the mouth

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.770
might have looked like
inside that shell.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.280
And then these shapes
here that you're seeing

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.680
are the tongue of the animal.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.190
Cephalopods, squid, and octopus,
and all of their cousins

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.220
have these really complex
tongues with a lot of teeth

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.780
on them called radula.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.650
And these tongues of
these ancient cephalopods

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.760
seem to have been
really, really complex.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.060
They were these sort
of folded up origami

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.430
shapes with little
tongues all over them

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.970
that look like they could
have been unfolded and used

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.600
almost like a spider's
web to catch plankton,

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.090
to catch little particles
and little animals

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:26.460
and things in the open ocean.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.810
So this tells us--

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.920
and this here is sort
of a 3D reconstruction

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.450
of how that might have--

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:35.560
this colorful part up
there is the radula.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.400
That tongue being unfolded
slowly from kind of a base, jaw

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.140
base where it would have
sat inside the animal.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.520
And so this is really abstract
for most of us to look at.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.230
But fortunately,
there are artists

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.550
who work with scientists to then
make reconstructions like this,

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.040
which doesn't show you
the radula unfortunately,

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.310
but it is showing you
this beak out of which

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.290
the radula would have unfolded.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.050
And the whole
structure of the animal

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.900
is based around that
knowledge of it being

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.790
something that eats plankton.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.850
A lot of other reconstructions
think of these ancient animals

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.560
as being active predators.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.050
Carnivores, like squid
and octopus are today.

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.750
But this discovery of
that complicated radula

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.510
that would have just filtered
plankton out of the water

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.230
has helped a new interpretation
arise thinking, like, OK.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.150
They didn't have
really long arms that

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:29.580
were muscular for
grabbing food, they just

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:32.160
had this little
web of arms maybe.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.210
And then this beak that
could open up and sort

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:38.446
of slurp up all of the
little yummy bits and pieces.

00:19:38.446 --> 00:19:40.320
And they probably-- this
[INAUDIBLE] at least

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.986
would not have been
a very good swimmer.

00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:44.850
It would have just sort of
gently drifted here and there

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.460
picking up food, which is
a different thing that none

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:48.960
of the living cephalopods do.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.440
There aren't really any plankton
feeding squid or octopus.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.560
They tend to be mostly
active predators.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.060
And so in a way it's
sort of like looking

00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.690
at ancient dinosaurs
and being like,

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.470
well, we don't really
have any t-rexes anymore.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.990
But if you can imagine a
chicken getting that big

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.720
and being carnivorous,
and what would it be like?

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.350
So this sort of nuanced ability
to interpret the fossils

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:18.010
is really growing,
creating, what seems to me,

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.680
to be a wonderful time for
a Cephalopod Renaissance

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.510
for the extinct cephalopods.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.240
And these are more
artist reconstructions

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.430
that are a little
bit more fantastical.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.740
But again, like
dinosaurs, we don't really

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.720
have any idea what
color they were.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.500
So paleo artists can just
kind of go wild with it.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.130
And all of these shapes
are completely realistic.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.860
There are ancient
cephalopod fossils

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.530
that grew in
corkscrews with spikes

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.240
that had these weird
recurved-- this

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.910
is sort of a cousin of the
paperclip one over here

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.070
that just were super
irregular knots.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.570
And we're still
trying to figure out

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.970
why they had all these
super weird shapes.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.420
And while paleontologists are
working on this to figure out

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.890
what was going on, it's kind of
a perfect time for the public

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.290
to become excited
about cephalopods

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.960
because all of our
modern cephalopods--

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.510
squid and octopus
around us today--

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.680
are going through boom times.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.930
There is what's been referred
to as a global proliferation

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.430
of cephalopods.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.640
And these figures here
are from a paper that

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.430
was published in 2016
that was kind of a review

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.730
paper gathering
data from fisheries

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:32.710
and from scientific
surveys from octopuses,

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.640
cuttlefish, squid, ones
that live close to the shore

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.710
and ones that live
further out in the deep,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.290
and showing that all of
them averaged together

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.030
are trending up.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.300
And we are living in a very--

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.430
we're very bullish on
cephalopods in the oceans

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.400
these days.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.790
And the reason seems to be
that all of these animals

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:57.910
have evolved away
from that heavy shell.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.940
They don't have a big
external shell anymore.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.780
And it's created an extremely
flexible group of animals

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.040
because they can grow quickly.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.260
They don't have to
build a heavy shell.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.990
They have a lot of babies
that can adapt very quickly

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.490
to their changing environment.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.470
And that adaptability
and flexibility

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.200
seems to be a lot of
what's driving this boom.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.910
That and the fact
that humans have

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.070
been fishing a lot of their
main predators out of the ocean.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.060
And so they're sort
of like, thanks

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.130
for removing all of
the fish, and now we

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.720
will go wild, situation.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.330
And, of course,
there are t-shirts

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.820
that you can buy
celebrating this dominance

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.930
of the cephalopods.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.090
I forgot to wear mine today,
but you can look them up online.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:43.010
However, there are
always some exceptions

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.850
to this sort of optimistic
view of the cephalopod future.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.240
And I have to mention that there
are a few species that are not

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.750
doing especially well that are
actually listed as endangered.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.720
And they are deep
sea octopuses that

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.660
live in the deep,
cold waters where

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:02.580
they take a very
long time to grow

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.790
and they reproduce
only a few eggs.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.640
And worst of all, they
happen to have neighbors

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.055
that are very delicious.

00:23:09.055 --> 00:23:11.180
So even though you've
probably never heard of these

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.880
octopuses-- they don't have
common names because nobody

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.760
talks about them commonly--

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.890
but they live on
seamounts in the deep sea

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.880
where orange roughy fish
and scampi shrimp also live.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.560
And people like to
eat those things.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.735
And when people throw down
nets into the deep sea

00:23:26.735 --> 00:23:29.180
to get the shrimp and
the fish, they also

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.680
catch these octopuses.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.719
And that's why these
particular species

00:23:32.719 --> 00:23:34.760
are considered endangered
is because many of them

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.370
have been accidentally
brought up in these nets

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.740
and the populations
are suffering.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.630
And even the squid that are
booming throughout the oceans

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.341
and doing really
well have some risks.

00:23:48.341 --> 00:23:50.090
These are a couple of
papers that came out

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.990
showing that there are
problems with ocean

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.010
acidification affecting the
early development of squid.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.860
So even though right now they
seem to be doing really well,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.562
the oceans are changing.

00:24:02.562 --> 00:24:04.520
They're getting warmer
and warmer and the water

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.320
is getting more and more acidic.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:09.140
And those things might,
in the near future,

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.740
cause that boom trajectory
to flatten out or even

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.710
get depressed a little bit
depending on how things change,

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.440
how much we decide to
change things or not

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.000
let them go on as normal.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.580
And then, of course, we
still have one cephalopod

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.880
with an external shell--

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.870
nautilus.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.270
So how are they doing?

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:32.600
Well, I think of nautiluses
as sort of a cautionary tale

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.100
because they're so beautiful.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.840
They still have
that external shell.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.290
They're the last cephalopod
with an external shell.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.120
And they have these
beautiful tiger stripes.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.590
And you can buy them
anywhere, it turns out.

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.020
They're not even
very expensive, which

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.740
is a problem because if
you can buy them anywhere

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.170
and people will pull them out
of the ocean more and more

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.050
to make money, and then
there won't be any nautiluses

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:58.070
anymore.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.840
And this has become
enough of a problem

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.570
that in 2017, CITES, which is
the international treaty that

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:09.170
regulates all the big endangered
species like rhinoceros horn

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.930
and elephant tusks has
decided to start regulating

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.390
the trade of nautilus
shells as well, which

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.420
is very encouraging.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.550
And it's being considered for
being listed on the Endangered

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.340
Species Act here in the
US, which would also

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.640
cause more protections to be
put in place so fewer of them

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.870
could be imported.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.340
And it would hopefully
lead to a longer survival

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.430
time for this lineage
of shelled cephalopods.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.020
The last ones with
that buoyant shell.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.290
And this listing
or this possibility

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:42.550
of listing cephalopods here
is open for public comment.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.822
And I went and read all
of the public comments

00:25:44.822 --> 00:25:47.030
that people had posted, and
one of them in particular

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:47.894
struck me.

00:25:47.894 --> 00:25:49.310
I thought I would
bring it to you.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.450
This as neuroethologist
named Heike Neumeister.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.790
So neuroethologist means she
studies brain and behavior

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.710
and how those things
are connected.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:01.010
And she commented that,
"Nautilus represents a window

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:02.330
to the past.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.790
A unique opportunity
to understand

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.840
the evolution of the brain,
including its vulnerability.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.480
It's protection is not
only important for us,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.260
but indeed is a moral
imperative for mankind."

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.710
So she was of the opinion that
she was presenting this idea

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.460
that because we have
nautiluses still around today

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.300
and because their history
goes back 500 million years

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.540
before the dinosaurs, they
are really a one of a kind

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.350
opportunity to understand
how this incredible brain

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:35.930
that we see in
octopus and squid,

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.340
how it evolved in contrast to
other members of the species.

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.090
And so I think this is
a really beautiful way

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.600
to connect the study of
the ancient cephalopods

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.990
and my mission to get everybody
to find them to be just as

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.960
cool as dinosaurs with
what's going on currently

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.330
with the living cephalopods
that we have here today.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:59.790
It's a really deep lineage here.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:04.130
This is the history going all
the way back to the Cambrian

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.930
500 million years ago.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:10.250
Here's our old buddy with the
very first little chambers

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.010
in its shell, all the way
through the really long

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.000
straight shelled ones.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.740
This is not exactly
to scale because I

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:20.020
didn't have just sort of
infinite room to go off here.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.120
And then in the early
coiled cephalopods,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.140
all these super weird shapes
of ammonoids that proliferated

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.930
and then went extinct at
the end of the Cretaceous.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:32.840
And you'll see over here
that the nautilus has

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.430
been just chugging along from
its ancestors all the way back

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.210
here towards really
the root of the tree.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:46.180
And it's still a lot of open
questions, a lot of mystery.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.070
Have they changed in a way that
we can't tell from the fossils?

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.680
Are they really these
unchanged, living fossils?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.730
There's a lot of interesting
work to be done there.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.200
And meanwhile, all of
the other cephalopods,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.810
the octopuses, the
squid, the cuttlefish,

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.906
are doing all of
their own things.

00:28:01.906 --> 00:28:04.280
A beautiful proliferation that
we're seeing in the oceans

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.150
today.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.360
And by comparing all of this
stuff, all of the deep time

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.150
history with all of
the modern diversity,

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:12.770
we're really in
a beautiful place

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.900
to understand this
group like never before.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.950
And it's a group that
is uniquely suited

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:21.650
to sort of shedding light
on all of life on Earth,

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:26.330
because it's really the
farthest group from us primates

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.030
that has developed
intelligence, and curiosity,

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:30.830
and problem solving skills.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.440
And by comparing the way we
do those things with the way

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.420
cephalopods do those
things, we can really

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.550
get a holistic understanding.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.660
So I just wanted to thank
you all finally for coming,

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.447
and take some questions.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.360
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.850
Thanks a lot for the great talk.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:53.840
I had a question.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.122
How hard would it be to
breed and farm nautilus?

00:28:58.122 --> 00:29:00.080
DIANNA STAAF: The question
is how hard would it

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.010
be to breed nautilus?

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.250
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.725
Because you're saying that
the shells are so beautiful

00:29:03.725 --> 00:29:10.470
and people start importing
them and [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.020
I'm thinking as
an alternative, we

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.420
could maybe start farming
them for the shells.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.370
DIANNA STAAF: Yeah.

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.920
Aquaculture is often
seen as a solution

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.340
if we want more of something
but the wild harvest

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.150
isn't available.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.100
Can we make them ourselves?

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.837
Nautilus are a really
interesting group

00:29:27.837 --> 00:29:29.420
in that regard, an
interesting species

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.620
because they've only just
successfully been bred at all.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:36.440
Like, although people have
been keeping the animals

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.540
in aquariums for
a long time, they

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.210
haven't been successfully
breeding and laying eggs.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:44.480
And just in the last year or two
at the Monterey Bay Aquarium,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.570
they've been keeping them and
they've actually laid the eggs

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.370
and the eggs have
actually hatched,

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.680
which are two separate
challenges that

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.300
both had to be overcome.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.580
But there's still a huge gap
in having hatchlings and having

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.860
those grow up to
be breeding adults.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.120
So I think it's possible.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:06.864
I hope that it happens
because, for many reasons.

00:30:06.864 --> 00:30:08.780
One is that it would
just be very interesting.

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.170
But it seems like they're
a very finicky species,

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.560
and they're just very specific
about the water requirements

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.670
and the food requirements.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:19.766
And so I believe right now the
aquarists at the Monterey Bay

00:30:19.766 --> 00:30:21.140
Aquarium are trying
to figure out

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.230
what to feed the babies to
get them to grow up healthy.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:29.010
And it takes a long time because
even with good conditions,

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:33.350
it takes them up to 20
years to reach maturity.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.300
So that's getting to
be several aquarists

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.680
lifetimes of practice.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.730
But I think it will get there.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.250
I think it will be very cool.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.160
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.735
My question is, you
said these creatures are

00:30:46.735 --> 00:30:48.516
found in deep sea?

00:30:48.516 --> 00:30:49.640
DIANNA STAAF: Many of them.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.140
Yeah.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.742
Not all.

00:30:52.742 --> 00:30:54.200
AUDIENCE: And how
have they adapted

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.394
to-- because there's a lot of
water pressure that is deep.

00:30:57.394 --> 00:30:58.810
Can you talk
something about that?

00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.150
DIANNA STAAF: Yeah.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:00.410
It's a great question.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:02.900
Are you more interested
in the living ones,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.330
or the extinct ones, or both?

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:04.730
AUDIENCE: All of it.

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.070
DIANNA STAAF: OK.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:05.570
Yeah.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.940
So it's a great question.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.330
The forms that
have buoyant shells

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.269
are, of course, always
somewhat limited

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:14.810
because they have
gas in their shell.

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.750
And so if they go too
deep, that can implode.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.620
So even modern nautiluses
and modern cuttlefish

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.600
which have an
internal shell that

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.150
still has gas chambers in
it are limited by depth.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:29.120
So cuttlefish, because
their internal shell

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.780
has quite weak walls, they
can't go much deeper than 100

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.780
or maybe 200 feet.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.770
They're quite shallow
because of that.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.570
Well, shallow for an open
ocean animal, not for us.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:42.080
Nautilus can go a
little bit deeper.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.190
They can get to about
800 feet for most ones,

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:50.840
and that's because the
shell is much, much thicker.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.850
And the limits of
the extinct ones

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.440
are, of course,
hard to calculate.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.600
And it's always a
little bit tricky

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.740
to know where they lived because
the shells sometimes move

00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.840
around before being fossilized.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.650
And so if the fossilized
shells are found in sediment,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.697
that shows that it
was in the deep sea.

00:32:11.697 --> 00:32:14.030
Well, does it mean that the
animal lived in the deep sea

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:16.280
or does it mean the animal
lived above the deep sea?

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.320
But they're thought,
many of them

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.200
especially-- let me see
if I can go back here.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.570
This is an interesting--

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.820
where are my ammonoids?

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:26.780
There.

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.190
These guys.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.780
In particular, many of
these ammonites had--

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.280
sorry.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.500
I probably wasn't
supposed to touch that--

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.560
had these really complicated
walls between the chambers.

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.800
So all of the squiggles
that you see here

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.720
are like if each
chamber's wall between was

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.870
made of sort of tissue paper
and you just crumpled it up.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.510
And it's still sealed
between the chambers

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.530
and held the gas
from place to place,

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.910
but it had this
incredibly complex line.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.940
And it's thought that that
might have sort of somehow

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.170
spread out the pressure and
allowed them to go even deeper.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.804
And so there's some
paleontologists

00:33:05.804 --> 00:33:07.220
actually working
right now on kind

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.232
of reconstructing
these as models

00:33:09.232 --> 00:33:10.940
and figuring out what
pressure they might

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.249
have been able to survive at.

00:33:13.249 --> 00:33:18.782
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:18.782 --> 00:33:19.990
DIANNA STAAF: I don't think--

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.210
let's see.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.720
I don't think any of them have
been estimated to live deeper

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.370
than about 1,000 feet.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.250
So I don't think any of
the shelled cephalopods

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.110
could have lived
in what we think

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:33.020
of as the real abyssal deep sea.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.460
The first cephalopods
to colonize

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.360
that area would have been
the ones that lost the shell.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.680
And, in fact, it's thought
that the ancestors of squid,

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.970
who had evolved away from having
an external shell-- and even

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.700
their internal shell doesn't
have gas chambers anymore.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.940
It's just like this sort of
thin, stiff rod that gives them

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:53.180
a little bit of structure.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:55.510
So they are basically
insensitive to pressure

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:57.460
because they're incompressible.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.512
There's no gas spaces.

00:33:58.512 --> 00:33:59.470
There's no gas bladder.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.160
There's nothing.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.618
And so it's thought that one
of the reasons they might have

00:34:02.618 --> 00:34:04.510
survived the end of
Cretaceous impact

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:07.201
is that they had a refuge
in the deep sea where

00:34:07.201 --> 00:34:08.409
things didn't change so much.

00:34:08.409 --> 00:34:10.179
And there are still
many squid living

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:11.487
in the very deep sea today.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.340
AUDIENCE: Speaking of squid,
I'm an octopus person,

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.630
but I also love
the Humboldt squid.

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:25.550
I was wondering what drew
you to that for your PhD.

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.260
And can you talk a
little bit about that?

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.620
DIANNA STAAF: I
would be happy to.

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:29.630
It's a lovely question.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.170
So the Humboldt squid was
the subject of my PhD.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:36.290
And it was somewhat
accidental because I

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:41.179
went into looking for graduate
programs and PhD advisors just

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.860
being kind of a
huge cephalopod nut.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.090
I was like, I'll
work on anything.

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:45.080
Are you doing bobtail squid?

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.489
Are you doing pygmy octopuses?

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.750
Whatever it is.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:51.170
And in Monterey,
there's a marine station

00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:53.094
that is affiliated with
Stanford University.

00:34:53.094 --> 00:34:54.510
Some of you may
already know this.

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.343
It's right next to the
Monterey Bay Aquarium

00:34:56.343 --> 00:34:58.010
and it's called
Hopkins Marine Station.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:59.540
And there's a squid lab there.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.630
And the scientist who
runs that lab, Bill Gilly,

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.270
was starting up a whole
research program on Humboldt

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.130
squid at about the
same time that I was

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.640
applying to graduate school.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.294
And so I met with him
and he talked to me a bit

00:35:11.294 --> 00:35:11.960
about the squid.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.293
And I was like, I have never
heard of these guys before,

00:35:14.293 --> 00:35:15.830
but they sound really cool.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.480
And it was also--

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.910
they were just starting
to expand their range,

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.600
so it was a really interesting
time to be working on them.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.086
It was a, it's a large species.

00:35:25.086 --> 00:35:26.460
It still is a very
large species.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.700
The adults can get
about as big as me.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.370
And it's also the biggest squid
fishery in the whole world.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.310
So of all of the
different species of squid

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.530
that people eat,
little calamari,

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.420
these big squid steaks
that are on Humboldt

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:42.170
squid, it's fished by
the million tons a year.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.180
And most of that is in South
America, Central America,

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.190
and Mexico.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.100
But in the early
2000s, we were starting

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.194
to find them on the California
coast and even up into Alaska.

00:35:54.194 --> 00:35:55.610
They are getting
really far north.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:58.580
And so it was a really fun time
to be a scientist studying them

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.590
because we would get
calls from people,

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.340
just, like, fishermen,
we caught a huge squid.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:05.390
Is it a giant squid?

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:06.440
What is it?

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.190
Can you eat it?

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.840
Can I sell it?

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.600
What can I do with it?

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.122
And so it was just
a really neat time.

00:36:12.122 --> 00:36:14.330
And we were trying to figure
out why they were there,

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.205
what they were doing.

00:36:15.205 --> 00:36:18.350
I ended up working a lot with
the babies and reproduction.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.520
And my main question
there was thinking, OK.

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.460
We know that there
are adults coming

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.490
up north into California, which
is very cold water for them.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.020
They're used to the warmer
water in the Gulf of California.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.550
Can they have babies up here?

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.720
Basically, are we going
to get a reproducing

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.130
population establishing itself
as the range is expanding?

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.740
And interestingly,
at the same time

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.644
as I was figuring out that the
little babies needed warm water

00:36:42.644 --> 00:36:44.810
and they were actually very
finicky-- they're teeny.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:45.680
This is the hilarious thing.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.210
So you have a grown
up as big as me,

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:50.084
and when their babies hatch,
they're like a grain of rice.

00:36:50.084 --> 00:36:52.250
And they're quite finicky,
and they need warm water,

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:53.600
and they need very special food.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.000
And it's kind of the
nautilus problem.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.361
We couldn't feed them anything.

00:36:57.361 --> 00:36:59.360
We would give them
everything we would think of,

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.440
and they would just
starve in the lab.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.097
All right.

00:37:02.097 --> 00:37:03.680
Go back to the ocean
and find whatever

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.150
you were meant to find.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.090
And it seems
interesting that while I

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:12.320
was finding that they had this
very particular need as babies,

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.100
the invasion, as everyone
was calling it, of California

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:17.420
just kind of slowed down.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:20.850
And eventually, now
fishermen off California

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.420
and further north hardly
ever find Humboldt squid.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:25.790
They're pretty much
all retreated back

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.500
to their native range in Mexico.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.710
And even there, they've
gotten a lot smaller.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.370
So it's been fun
to see in practice

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.236
the sort of flexibility
that I talked about

00:37:36.236 --> 00:37:37.610
because this
species, as a whole,

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:41.150
is still doing really well,
but you can see them responding

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.357
year by year and
even season by season

00:37:43.357 --> 00:37:44.565
to the way the ocean changes.

00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:49.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.480
Thanks for the awesome talk.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.540
So this is a strange
question, but given

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.230
the absence of preserved
soft body features,

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.710
how do we know that extinct
cephalopods even had tentacles?

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:02.140
DIANNA STAAF: That's
a great question!

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.650
How do we even know
that they had tentacles?

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:08.430
I'm going to go to the
short answer is, we don't.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:10.710
Maybe they didn't
have tentacles at all.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:17.040
And in particular, these
guys, these really early ones,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.830
I mean, I think that in a
way, the only reason people

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.330
draw them with
tentacles is to show

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.270
that we know they're cephalopods
because that's the defining

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:25.200
feature.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.210
But they might not have
had tentacles at all.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.640
Interestingly, by
this point here,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:32.520
which is the
branching point where

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.539
you get the lineage
of the nautiluses

00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:37.080
and then the lineage going to
all of your modern cephalopods,

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.246
we're pretty sure that they
would have had tentacles

00:38:39.246 --> 00:38:42.520
by then because tentacles--

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.640
and the tentacles
come from the foot.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.130
So the ancestral
cephalopod was related

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.980
to a snail, which has a big
foot that it oozes around on.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.780
And so we know because
of studying the way

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.730
they develop in the
egg that what happens

00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:55.920
is that foot splits
into tentacles quite

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.180
early on in development.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:03.030
And that happens in embryonic
nautilus and in embryonic squid

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.000
at the same time and
with the same number.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.070
So it's always 10 to begin with.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.440
Even with a nautilus
that eventually gets up

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.240
to 60 or 90 tentacles.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.930
And because that trait
seems to be so conserved,

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.320
it's thought that it probably
goes way back to this split.

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.420
That there's an ancestral
cephalopod trait

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.720
of having a foot that
divides into 10 tentacles.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.440
And then that evolved in
nautiluses at some point

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.170
to be just this, like,
plethora of tentacles.

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.770
And in squid, two of those--

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.820
and they were all
equal length as well.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.420
Because you do get a few
fossils up or over here

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.430
that have these 10
equal length tentacles.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.180
And so two of them in squid
became much longer and elastic.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.502
Two of them in
octopuses disappeared.

00:39:47.502 --> 00:39:48.960
But even in octopuses,
we know that

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.766
the ancestral characteristic
was to have 10.

00:39:51.766 --> 00:39:53.140
And so that's sort
of the answer.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.348
So we're pretty sure that
by here they had tentacles,

00:39:55.348 --> 00:39:58.660
and some point in
here probably evolved.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:00.780
It would have been useful
if you think about being

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.860
a snail up in the water.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.380
How do you get your food?

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.660
Or maybe you just have
a really flexible foot.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the amazing talk.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.180
Question about chromatophores
and when they evolved,

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:18.490
and if there is a way to
tell whether they evolved.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.280
And then the second part of
the question, the radula,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.121
is that just a mollusk
trait and that's

00:40:23.121 --> 00:40:25.120
how they know that that's
what the tongue looked

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:27.430
like when they were going
back and creating imagery?

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:28.727
Or how do they tell?

00:40:28.727 --> 00:40:29.560
DIANNA STAAF: Right.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.680
So two different traits.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.430
The chromatophores, the
color changing ability,

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.140
and the radula.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:37.450
So I'll take the radula
first since there's

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.460
more physical evidence for it.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.290
The radula is a molluscan trait.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:43.160
So you'll see radulas
in snails, even

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:46.090
in clams, all kinds
of different mollusks.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.450
And, in fact, all the
different snail radulas

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.590
are useful because snails eat
in a lot of different ways.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.080
And I don't mean just
garden snails at this point.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.790
There are a lot
of marine snails.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:00.224
And there are marine snails
that scrape food off rocks,

00:41:00.224 --> 00:41:02.140
and there are marine
snails that are predators

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.480
that eat other fish, and there
are marine snails that float,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.646
actually float through the
water and catch plankton.

00:41:06.646 --> 00:41:09.040
And so looking at all of
those different radulas

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.190
is the main way that
the paleontologists

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.880
have begun to look at ammonite
radulas, cephalopod radulas.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.010
Kind of say, what would
it have been good for?

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.200
Does it look more like the
snail that eats plankton,

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.910
or the snail that eats
algae, or these things?

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:27.370
And so the radula itself
is usually not preserved

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.160
independently as a fossil
because it's quite delicate

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.820
and it probably
just falls apart.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:35.800
And so if I'm remembering
right, the only real radulas

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.480
that are found are when
they're inside a shell.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.270
And so either the shell
has to be physically broken

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.584
and then it's sort of just
luck whether you actually

00:41:45.584 --> 00:41:47.500
find the radula or whether
you've destroyed it

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.890
by breaking the shell, or you
see it by doing essentially,

00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:54.820
like, an electronic
dissection with a CT scan.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.590
And then for the chromatophore,
that's a very good question.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.190
We think that probably
that amazing skin,

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.420
that amazing color changing skin
evolved around the same time

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.450
that the shell, shell,
shell, shell went

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.900
internal, which is in this
lineage called the colioids.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.989
And this is one
of these fun facts

00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.280
that I only learned when I
started researching my book.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.080
A PhD did not teach me this.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.115
But when you're doing all
this etymological research

00:42:20.115 --> 00:42:21.490
because people
ask you questions,

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:23.320
colioid means scabbard.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.380
So this whole group is named
because their bodies became

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.360
like the scabbards
for their shell.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.790
It was internalized
and covered up.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:33.620
And so once the
shell goes internal,

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.710
which is this little
light colored thing,

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.470
it's still chambered,
it's still buoyant,

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.080
it was still quite
substantial for a long time,

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.212
but it was no longer
something you could hide in.

00:42:44.212 --> 00:42:45.670
And so at that
point, it would have

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.790
been extremely
advantageous for the skin

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.761
to develop some
method of protection.

00:42:51.761 --> 00:42:53.260
And so we think
that that's probably

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.810
when both camouflage
and ink sacks are

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:58.120
likely to have
evolved, but there's

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.384
precious little in the fossil
record about either one.

00:43:05.024 --> 00:43:08.360
AUDIENCE: So putting on
my third grader hat here,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.834
do we call them tentacles
because there are 10 of them?

00:43:10.834 --> 00:43:12.750
DIANNA STAAF: Oh, that's
such a good question!

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:22.320
It is technically wrong to
call them all tentacles.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.270
Trying to find a gentler
word [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.550
It's wrong.

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:27.820
They're all arms really.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:31.870
And the word tentacles is
best to reserve for those two

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:33.770
really elastic ones.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:36.990
So a squid or a cuttlefish,
if you ever maybe seen

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.880
a video of them catching prey,
or you can go home and look one

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.900
up, they have
their arms that are

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.900
just always the same
length and maybe they might

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.904
grab slow moving prey with it.

00:43:45.904 --> 00:43:48.070
But if they need to catch
a fish or something that's

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.200
really fast, they have
these elastic tentacles

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.540
that go zoom, and catch
it, and bring it back in.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.800
It's like milliseconds.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.030
It's really, really fast.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.450
And those are the tentacles.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.600
So squid have them,
cuttlefish have them,

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.945
octopuses do not have them.

00:44:00.945 --> 00:44:02.320
Technically, squid
and cuttlefish

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.480
are the only ones
with true tentacles.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.630
But you can remember them
not because of the 10 part,

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:12.040
but because the word tentacle
is longer than the word arm.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.870
And tentacles are
longer than arms.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.240
AUDIENCE: I have
one more if it's OK.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.340
So since the seas
are acidifying,

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.809
I had a question
about the shells.

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:25.850
Because you're saying that
the [INAUDIBLE] squids

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.160
and octopuses are
having a problem.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.720
Are they a calcium
carbonate shell,

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.290
or are they silica based?

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:33.500
DIANNA STAAF: They're
calcium carbonate.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.460
Even the cuttle bone, which
is the internal shell.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:42.366
And the squid, for the most
part, is not even calcified.

00:44:42.366 --> 00:44:43.990
So that's one of the
reasons that squid

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:47.360
seem to be a bit more resilient
to ocean acidification is

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.970
they don't have very much
that's actually calcified.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.750
But the Nautilus shell and the
cuttlefish shell are calcium.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:56.450
Interestingly, there
is one other place

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:59.750
that all of the cephalopods
have a bit of calcium carbonate

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.760
that's very sensitive
to acidification,

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.950
and it's these little
bones in their ears.

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.110
Teeny little bones
called statelates that

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.310
help them tell up from down.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.460
We actually have similar
little teeny tiny bones

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.830
in our ear that rock
around and they're

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:14.457
what make you sick
on merry go rounds

00:45:14.457 --> 00:45:16.040
and how you know
when you're facing up

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.248
and when you're pointed down.

00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:20.480
And the development of
those teeny little bones

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.230
in cephalopods seems to be quite
affected by acidified waters.

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.500
And so there's some risk
that we might end up

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.680
with oceans full of sort
of disoriented, lost,

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:37.185
squid that can't figure out
which way is up and down.

00:45:37.185 --> 00:45:38.685
We haven't gotten
there yet, though.

00:45:38.685 --> 00:45:41.672
So fingers crossed.

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.130
SPEAKER 1: Well,
Thank you, Dianna.

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:44.463
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

00:45:44.463 --> 00:45:46.840
Let's give one more
round of applause.
