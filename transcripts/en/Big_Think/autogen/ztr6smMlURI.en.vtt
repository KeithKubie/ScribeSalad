so there's two main parts to the
University there's the research

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069
University there's the research
 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:08.930
University there's the research
enterprise and there's the educational

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
enterprise and there's the educational
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.400
enterprise and there's the educational
enterprise and I definitely see both

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410
enterprise and I definitely see both
 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.959

decade or so so speaking about the

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920
decade or so so speaking about the
 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.029
decade or so so speaking about the
educational Enterprise it's not enough

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039
educational Enterprise it's not enough
 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.010

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959
discipline and there have been some
 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.650
discipline and there have been some
criticisms that academics don't

don't they're too specialized the
reality is if you're going to be the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730
reality is if you're going to be the
 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.180
reality is if you're going to be the
absolute best you have to be very

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190
absolute best you have to be very
 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.979
absolute best you have to be very
specialized but that doesn't preclude

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989
specialized but that doesn't preclude

specialized but that doesn't preclude
you from understanding how to

you from understanding how to
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.729
you from understanding how to
communicate with others that can take

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
communicate with others that can take
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.300
communicate with others that can take
your idea and make it into something

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
your idea and make it into something
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.610
your idea and make it into something
really impactful so it's sort of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
really impactful so it's sort of
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.770
really impactful so it's sort of
bridging that gap by making both the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780
bridging that gap by making both the
 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.570
bridging that gap by making both the
academics aware and then of course we'd

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
academics aware and then of course we'd
 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.940
academics aware and then of course we'd
like to focus on the the business

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950
like to focus on the the business
 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.410

worked so hard to collect and then and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
worked so hard to collect and then and

you need to motivate faculty to be

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780
you need to motivate faculty to be

and so that's that will be an

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660
and so that's that will be an
 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.320
and so that's that will be an
interesting thing to see also digital

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330
