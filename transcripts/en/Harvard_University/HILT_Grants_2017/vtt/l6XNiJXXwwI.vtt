00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:08.140
Created accessible,
engaging learning materials

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.140
for public health
professionals out in the field

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.970
that they could fit
in around their busy

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.930
lives to build their
skills in public health

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.610
social marketing and
ethical programming

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.737
to address childhood
obesity and weight stigma.

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:25.320
With the Strategic
Training Initiative

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.840
for the Prevention
of Eating Disorders,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.390
we have a case method
creation program

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.180
where we develop
curriculum materials that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.630
can be used in public health
classrooms around the country

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.310
or around the globe to bring
in topical, cutting edge issues

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.490
and eating disorders prevention
into public health classrooms.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.010
We'd created, I think,
eight teaching cases

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.440
for traditional
in-person classrooms.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.445
Very excited about that.

00:00:50.445 --> 00:00:51.570
We're a great body of work.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.800
Never been done before,
anything like that.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.270
And then we realized, how many
people can we possibly reach

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.730
if we stay limited to
traditional in-person

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.730
implementation, teaching
in a traditional classroom?

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.920
How many people who are
public health practitioners

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.675
can get back into a college
or university classroom?

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:11.550
They don't have time.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.758
They're working on the field.

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:14.488
They need the education
to come to them.

00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:16.530
They need training
opportunities to come to them,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.190
to meet them where they're at.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.670
Whether they're working
on this before work,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.950
after work, on
weekends, on vacations,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.590
we need to give them something
that they can really integrate

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.770
into their busy working lives.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.050
Some of the key design elements
that we need to figure out

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.200
is, how do we capture the
experimentation and the energy

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.140
of case method teaching
and active learning

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.737
in an in-person classroom where
you can see your classmates

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:40.320
work together?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.190
You can build off
each other's energy.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.810
How do we capture that and bring
that into a digital platform

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.785
where they are not face-to-face
in a literal sense?

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.160
They're not in
the same classroom

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.460
with their classmates on this.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.900
But we still want to capture
that energy, that engagement,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.870
and that spirit of
experimentation.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.350
And to being able to work
really collaboratively together,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.990
even though they're not sitting
in the same room together.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.190
That was the
overarching challenge,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.548
because we were very committed
to the case method teaching

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:10.840
and active learning principles.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.330
Because we know
the evidence shows

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.980
this is the strongest
way to ensure people

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.890
understand the material, can
internalize the material,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.530
and most importantly,
translate it to apply it out

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.260
in field settings after
they're out of the classroom.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.240
We want to change the way
public health practice is done.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.670
They need to have
all those steps

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.170
to be able to translate it into
their work out in the field.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.800
So we needed to keep the energy
and the real evidence base

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.070
core of active learning
and case method teaching

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.390
but be able to deliver that in
a really very different format,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.580
working in digital communities.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.830
And what was really
helpful with that was that,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.990
working across the different
teams, the partners

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.430
that we worked with.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.030
Dr. Chris Dede with the Harvard
Graduate School of Education,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.520
who has a huge
amount of experience

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.560
with teaching and with
case method teaching,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.150
and as well with just
really transformative

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.610
technological thinking around,
how do you do this well?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.180
And then two other partners,
Adrienne Phelps-Coco

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.253
and Carina Lin.

00:03:13.253 --> 00:03:14.670
And they're both
with the Division

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.935
of Continuing Education.

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:17.310
And they have a
lot of experience

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.230
with enhancing engagement
in online classrooms.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.520
How do you bring that
energy and that connection?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.040
And so we worked with them to
think through some strategies

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.780
for how to do that well.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.110
How to bring in certain
activities or certain ways

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.730
of integrating communications
within the online course

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.703
to bring that sense of community
engagement to the course.

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.120
Because that was
really important.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.760
There's a lot of
times when people

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.260
talk about online
education, there's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.140
that lack that you don't
get when you don't have

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.520
the face-to-face interaction.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.990
And then how do
you maintain-- how

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.365
do you get to know your students
over the course of time?

00:03:54.365 --> 00:03:57.360
How do you do effective
evaluations of courses

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.680
in the online courses?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.482
How do you balance the learning?

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:01.440
There's different ways.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.760
So we really worked
closely with them.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.800
We've benefited so much
from their knowledge.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.530
And they were
responsive and engaged.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.750
And it was just a
really nice meeting

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.977
of the minds, a
trans-disciplinary

00:04:12.977 --> 00:04:15.060
collaboration across
different schools at Harvard.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.310
So it's a good opportunity.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.720
Our team is just phenomenal.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.579
And then also, we brought
in Megan Kipp, who

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.121
is a graduate of
the Harvard Graduate

00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.110
School of Education TIE,
the Technology, Innovation,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.123
and Education program.

00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:28.540
She's been working in the field
for a number of years now.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.110
But she brings that
training from Harvard,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.850
working out in the
field at universities

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.440
on digital education.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.340
How do we create online courses
to keep the students involved,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.800
teaching a whole range
of types of topics?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.340
She came on working with
our team in that way.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.890
And she brought in a lot of
really specialized knowledge

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.460
of, how do we operationalize
a discussion when it's online?

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.080
It's very different than
leading a discussion in person.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.223
How do we handle
sensitive topics online?

00:04:58.223 --> 00:05:00.390
And then Carina and Adrienne
were especially helpful

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.200
around that, too.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.420
Because one of
the topic areas we

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.980
were dealing with was weight
stigma and discrimination.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.360
And there's an enormous
amount of weight shame

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.250
that even our learners
may experience.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.710
That's coming into
our virtual classroom,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.020
just like it would in
an in-person classroom.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.100
So there's a lot of kinds
of issues to think through,

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.790
some that might be generic, in
a sense, that any online course

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:24.690
needs to handle.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.460
And some courses
that are dealing

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.580
with really critical public
health issues or mental health

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.440
issues have to be
especially sensitive about.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.620
We provided materials
in different formats.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.670
So we did have the
traditional printout, or PDF

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.890
that they could do online,
of the full case that they

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.810
would read, that was
extensive and had the story.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.162
We also built in an
interactive case.

00:05:48.162 --> 00:05:49.620
So where they'd
almost walk through

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.700
it online, and they'd experience
it in a different way.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.030
So that was one way to
bring that case to life

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.870
for people versus just
reading it on the platform.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.410
We certainly built in a lot of
work with the discussion boards

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.960
and learned a lot
from that experience

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.788
in terms of how to evolve
that process going forward.

00:06:09.788 --> 00:06:11.580
But there's a lot of
opportunity for people

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.690
to interact and respond to each
other's projects or comments.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.880
And then there were
group projects as well.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.128
So thinking through, how would
we bring these smaller groups

00:06:21.128 --> 00:06:22.920
together so they can
learn from each other,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.450
to have discussions
with each other?

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.400
Setting up a
conference call line

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.340
so they can schedule times to
actually have a conversation

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.010
and begin building
relationships and then

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.200
begin building these
projects so that you

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.700
could bring the intimacy
into this larger classroom,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.947
or online approach to learning.

00:06:40.947 --> 00:06:43.530
Proud of, because I was involved
with it from start to finish,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.160
was the workshop we ran
as part of this grant.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.770
So we were able to
convene a variety

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.610
of instructional designers,
professors, program developers,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.070
course designers from
across Harvard, people

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.740
who were interested in
bringing case method learning

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.208
to the online space.

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:01.500
Some of them had been doing it.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.510
Some of them were
interested in doing it

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.310
at all different
levels of experience.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.910
And they came from
across Harvard,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.000
and one person
even came from MIT,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.550
and convened for a
half-day workshop.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.130
And Chris Dede was a speaker.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.480
We had several speakers.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.208
And they talked about a
variety of very applicable--

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:20.500
we talked about lessons
learned from their experiences.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.042
We talked about specific tools
that were used for evaluation,

00:07:23.042 --> 00:07:26.160
for using peer evaluation,
ongoing evaluation that

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160
talked about experience
and smaller goals.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.430
These were tools that people
were just dying to have.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.150
And then we had a mini
hackathon at the very end,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.730
where we had people
work in small teams

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.350
and develop an
instructional design

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.440
plan for one of
STRIPED's new cases

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.440
that we're hoping also to
do the same with, bring it

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.480
into the online space
and be able to pilot

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.320
it and take that
to the next phase.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.642
So everyone came out with
a deliverable of sorts.

00:07:53.642 --> 00:07:56.100
And so they were able to present
their ideas to the broader

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.150
workshop.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.940
And they walked away
with that experience

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.710
to be able to connect
with other people.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.210
The greatest value,
I think, of that

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.070
was what the feedback
was across the board.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.925
We are so grateful to have had
this opportunity to connect

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:10.050
with others across Harvard.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.200
We do not get this
opportunity enough.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.810
There are so many resources here
that we can share and continue

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.620
to connect with each other.
