00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Well, I'd like to talk a little bit about baseball, and in particular, I have two numbers.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.120
714

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.280
and 715.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.080
Now, one reason I think many mathematicians

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.500
really love baseball is because it's,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.200
at the base of it, when you watch it on television,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.060
it's a fairly boring game.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.120
It's slow-moving and it's filled with numbers!

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.020
The sports casters always talk about batting averages.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.980
They talk about on-base percentages.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.300
They talk about records, like the most home runs someone has ever hit.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.320
In their career or in a particular year or whatever.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.560
Babe Ruth, who is one of the greatest baseball players of all time,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.840
he played for the Boston Red Sox,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.700
and then very famously, or infamously, was traded to the New York Yankees.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.520
Over his career, he hit 714 home runs.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.500
This was a gigantic record who towered over everybody else,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.820
and, it was thought that this record would never be beat.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.040
Fast-forward to, you know, later in the 20th century

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.340
1960s and 70s

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.840
and we have Hank Aaron, who played for the Atlanta Braves,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.720
who was closing in on Babe Ruth's record.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.720
It really captured the nation's attention and, in fact, there were lots of overtones involved with this.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.860
Babe Ruth played for baseball at a time when baseball was segregated.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.600
All of the players were white.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.660
After World War II, baseball became integrated.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.920
Hank Aaron was African-American.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.380
He was met with many racist attacks for trying to beat the record of the white baseball player,

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.280
Babe Ruth.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.920
And through all of these really ridiculous and stupid and vicious attacks, he kept his dignity and kept his cool.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
And he just, you know, kept on doing what he does best, which is play baseball.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.280
And so, it transcended just the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.500
the-the sports...moment.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.080
And-and in fact,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.720
the numbers 714 and 715

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.180
carried a weight with them, that anybody

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.720
in the US at that time would know what those numbers were referring to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.480
without even mentioning, Ruth, Aaron or baseball.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.480
So I'm a mathematician, I'm watching the game,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.920
715 is hit, there's a ceremony on the field, the game is stopped for the ceremony,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.240
and it's a wonderful moment, and then I'm thinking,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.060
"Okay, these are numbers. I'm a number theorist. What can I tell you about the numbers 714 and 715?"

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.040
So the first thing I try, is I try to factor them.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.620
They're not hard to factor.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.040
714, its prime factorization is 2 times 3 times 7 times 17.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.480
715, that's also easy to factor.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.000
715 is 5 times 11 times 13.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.540
And what do we notice but, for these primes that are involved?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.420
They are all of the primes up to some point.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.020
So in other words, if I multiply 714 times 715

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.760
and factor that into primes, I get every single prime appearing up to 17.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.360
Isn't that interesting?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.160
Two consecutive numbers. Their product is the product of all of the primes up to some point.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.360
Now, you can ask

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240
"How special is this property?"

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.560
"Does it ever happen again, or does it happen for smaller numbers?"

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.480
Well, you can see that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.220
it does happen for smaller numbers. For example, 5 and 6 work.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.200
14 and 15 work. You start searching for larger examples than 714 and 715, good luck!

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.180
You are likely not to find it and

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.580
it's not known if there are any larger examples, but we can't, we can't prove it,

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.700
but we strongly think there are no larger examples.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.600
Brady: "How? Has that been like a search of note? Has someone put these into a computer and let it run for a few weeks or...?"

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.480
Well we tried this at, I was a professor then at the University of Georgia

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.330
and we tried this. I and a few colleagues

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.459
and I don't remember how far we got, but,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.360
it, the num- when you take a product of consecutive primes,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.140
up to some level and multiply them together, these numb- these products grow exponentially.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.500
In fact, I believe it's a consequence of the ABC conjecture,

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.780
that, there should only be finitely many examples.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.580
Anyway, the next day, when I went into work,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.220
I spoke to a colleague, and I said

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.900
"Can you find an interesting property of 714 and 715?"

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.720
And, he,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.000
after a few minutes, found the same property that I did, but then he went into his class and asked his class

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.260
"Can anybody in this class find an interesting property of 714 and 715?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.300
and one of the students found another property that's also amazing.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.300
What if I change these times signs into plus signs?

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.500
For-  you know, that's perverse, but let's do it!

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.460
So we add 2 plus 3 plus 7 plus 17. That adds up to

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.420
29.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.360
And, if I do it for 715 and add them together,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.920
that also adds up to 29.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.560
And here, we were able to find more examples,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.820
probably infinitely many examples of this, although, although rare.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.880
We wrote an article for a non-serious

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.780
mathematical journal. To give you an idea of how non-serious it is, the name of the journal is,

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.760
'The Journal of Recreational Mathematics'.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.160
In this article, we had lots of jokes,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.340
and we may, you know, had fun with all of these interesting properties of 714 and 715.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.600
We also had a conjecture, and the conjecture was that, these pairs of two consecutive numbers,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.360
whose primes add up to the same thing,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.480
this is a 'Ruth-Aaron' pair,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.120
and we conjectured, they thin out. The technical name is 'have density zero'.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.940
Anyway, it turns out that this whole thing, which started as a joke,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.240
this article was read by Paul Erdős

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.400
who is one of the most famous mathematicians from the 20th century ..

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.940
He wrote a letter to me saying that he can prove

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.720
that the 'Ruth-Aaron pairs' thin out.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.120
And he wanted to come to Georgia to discuss it with me.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.220
This is incredible!

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:16.040
Here I am, a young beginning professor, writing a joke article for the 'Journal of Recreational Math',

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.420
and then one of the greatest mathematicians of the century should write me a letter saying he wants to come and discuss it.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.540
So he did! He came. He discussed it with me. We wrote a joint paper.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.680
I started learning the tricks of his trade,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:36.100
and he mentored me, and we ended up writing over 20 joint papers before he passed away in the 90's.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.500
It completely changed my career. And the funny finale for this story is that

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.180
in 1995 I believe,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.900
Emory University in Atlanta gave Paul Erdős an honorary degree.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.560
Erdős invited my wife and I for the party before, the evening before,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.000
to celebrate the recipients of the Honorary degree,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.960
and it turns out that there was another person there also getting an honorary degree, at the same time.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.080
This was Hank Aaron.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.240
When I got there, I just couldn't believe that Hank Aaron,

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:16.100
who is the reason, for some sense, that I met Paul Erdős  in the first place, was, was there in the same room with Paul Erdős.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.120
So, I went up to Aaron and introduced myself and I said that his baseball feat

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.860
completely changed my career, as a mathematician.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.920
Well, he looked at me in a very puzzled way,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.060
like maybe he had just met a crazy person.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:37.400
As usual with him, he was very magnanimous and calm and pleasant, and I introduced him to

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.980
Erdős and they had a nice conversation,

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.760
and there's a photograph of them sitting at a table together.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.920
One of the Emory professors who was there, knew that Aaron was coming and

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.640
had brought some baseballs for Aaron

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:58.140
to sign, which is sort of a customary thing to do, to have a great star athlete sign a baseball as a memento.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.560
So he gave me one of these baseballs

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.700
and I had Aaron sign it, and then I had Erdős sign it.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.880
And, you know, people have Erdős #1 if they have a joint paper with Erdős.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.080
Well, I argue that, Aaron should have Erdős #1. He doesn't have a joint paper, but he does have a joint baseball.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.260
Brady: "What happened to the baseball? Where is it?"

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.180
Well, one of my students gave me a little plastic box to put it in, so preserve it,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:27.840
however, not ever having had people sign baseballs before, I had- they signed it with a felt-tip pen,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.480
and within about a year or two the signatures had faded,

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.120
and now, maybe if you were a great forensic expert, you could maybe find

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.700
those signatures on the baseball, but, I -they're essentially invisible.

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.080
It just looks like a new baseball.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.640
publish in this area, would you like to review for us?

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.880
And Peck said, sure.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.540
So Peck started reviewing papers, and he reviewed one of Kleinman's papers,

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.540
which was a little incestuous.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:06.380
P was again, George Purdy, of Cincinatti, I'm the G, C was Chung, Fan Chung, K was Kleiman, E was Erdős. It was good to have a vowel.
