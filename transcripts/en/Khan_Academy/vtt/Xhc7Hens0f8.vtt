00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:01.812
- [Voiceover] So we have the function

00:00:01.812 --> 00:00:04.014
g of x is equal to x
squared times the natural

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:05.229
log of x.

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:06.513
And what I wanna do in this video is see

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.723
if you can figure out the absolute extrema

00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:10.873
for g of x.

00:00:10.873 --> 00:00:14.113
So are there x values where
g takes on an absolute

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:17.754
maximum value, or an
absolute minimum value.

00:00:17.754 --> 00:00:19.839
Sometimes you might call
them a global maximum,

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.574
or a global minimum.

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:23.829
So the first thing I like
to think about is well,

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.588
what's the domain for which
g is actually defined?

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:31.123
And we know that in the natural log of x

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:35.290
the input into natural log, it
has to be greater than zero.

00:00:36.497 --> 00:00:39.132
So the domain, the domain
is all real numbers

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:40.685
greater than zero.

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:43.037
So x has to be greater than zero.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:46.212
Anything lateral log
of zero is not defined,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.100
there is no power that you could take e to

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.030
to get to zero, and natural
log of negative numbers

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.964
is not defined.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:55.594
So that is the domain.

00:00:55.594 --> 00:00:57.692
The domain is all real numbers such that

00:00:57.692 --> 00:01:02.050
all real numbers access so
that x is greater than zero.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.217
So our absolute extrema have
to be within that domain.

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:08.796
So to find these, let's
see if we can find some

00:01:08.796 --> 00:01:11.904
local extrema and see if any
of them are good candidates

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.654
for absolute extrema.

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:15.824
And we could find our local extrema

00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:19.800
by looking at critical
points, or critical values.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.725
So let's take the derivative of g.

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:26.770
So g prime, using a new
color just for kicks.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.511
All right, so g prime of x is equal to,

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:32.303
we could use the product rule here.

00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:34.989
So derivative of x squared which is two x

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.156
times the natural log of x

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:40.807
plus x squared times the derivative

00:01:40.807 --> 00:01:43.774
of natural log of x,
so that is one over x,

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:44.992
and I can just rewrite that.

00:01:44.992 --> 00:01:47.553
X squared times one over x.

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.661
And we're gonna assume that x is positive.

00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:52.578
So that is going to be,

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:55.561
that is going to be just,

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:57.033
and actually I didn't even
have to make that assumption

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.053
for what I'm about to do,

00:01:58.053 --> 00:02:01.917
x squared divided by x
is just going to be x.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:02.982
All right.

00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:04.899
And so that is g prime.

00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.535
So now let's think about
the critical points.

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:10.256
Critical points are where the derivative

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:12.430
they're points in the domain,

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.381
so they're gonna have to
satisfy x is greater than zero,

00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:18.464
such that g prime is either undefined

00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.101
or it is equal to zero.

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:25.854
So let's first think about
when g prime is equal to zero.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.591
So let's set it equal to zero.

00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:31.758
Two x natural log of x
plus x is equal to zero.

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:37.319
Well we can subtract, we could
subtract x from both sides

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.236
of that and so we get
two x natural log of x

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:44.863
is equal to negative x.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:48.976
See, if we divide both sides by x

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.285
and we can do that, we
know x isn't gonna be zero,

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:54.402
our domain is x is greater than zero.

00:02:54.402 --> 00:02:56.738
So this is going to be,
actually let's divide

00:02:56.738 --> 00:02:58.181
both sides by two x.

00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:01.497
So that we get the natural
log of x is equal to

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:02.997
negative one half.

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:06.523
Negative x divided by two
x is negative one half.

00:03:06.523 --> 00:03:08.398
Or we could say that x is equal to

00:03:08.398 --> 00:03:10.080
e to the negative one half

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.989
is equal to x.

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.422
Remember, natural log is just log base e.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:16.058
So e to the negative one half,

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:17.598
which we could also write like that,

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:19.768
e to the negative one half,

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:21.698
or one over the square root of e.

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:24.115
So that's a point at which g,

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:27.497
at which our derivative I should say

00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:30.939
is equal to zero, it is a
critical point or critical value

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.657
for our original function g.

00:03:33.657 --> 00:03:37.184
So and that's the only place
where g prime is equal to zero.

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:41.496
Are there any other points
where g prime is undefined?

00:03:41.496 --> 00:03:43.666
And they're have to be
points within the domain.

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:45.319
So let's see, what would
make this undefined?

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.291
The two x and the x, that
you can evaluate for any x.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:52.011
Natural log of x, once again,
is only going to be defined

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:54.772
for x greater than zero.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.548
But that's, we've already
restricted ourselves

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:58.945
to that domain, so within the domain

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:01.184
any point in the domain our derivative

00:04:01.184 --> 00:04:03.715
is actually going to be defined.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:08.043
So given that let's see what's
happening on either side

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:10.774
of this critical point.

00:04:10.774 --> 00:04:12.748
On either side of this critical point.

00:04:12.748 --> 00:04:14.314
And I could draw a little
number line here to

00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:17.281
really help us visualize this.

00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:20.781
So, if this is negative one, this is zero,

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:26.987
this is let's see, e to
the, this is gonna be like

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:29.392
one over, oh boy this is,

00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:33.309
this is going to be a
little bit less than one,

00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:38.296
so let's see, why don't we plot one here,

00:04:38.296 --> 00:04:41.681
and then two here, and so
we have a critical point

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.066
at one over the square root of e,

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.562
and we'll put it right over there.

00:04:45.562 --> 00:04:48.041
One over the square root of e.

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.547
And we know that we're only defined from,

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:53.233
for all x's greater than zero.

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:55.330
So let's think about the interval between

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.533
zero and this critical point.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:04:58.987
Right over here.

00:04:58.987 --> 00:05:01.803
So the open interval,
from zero to one over

00:05:01.803 --> 00:05:04.221
the square root of e,
let's think about whether

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:06.326
g prime is positive or negative there.

00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:09.076
And then let's think about it for

00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:13.412
x greater than one over
the square root of e.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:15.917
So that's the interval from
one over square root of e

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:16.917
to infinity.

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:20.888
So over that yellow interval,
we let's just try out

00:05:20.888 --> 00:05:22.971
a value that is in there.

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:27.704
So let's just try g
prime of, I don't know,

00:05:27.704 --> 00:05:29.787
let's try g prime of 0.1.

00:05:31.304 --> 00:05:34.412
G prime of 0.1 is definitely
going to be in this interval.

00:05:34.412 --> 00:05:36.693
And so it's going to
be equal to two point,

00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:38.860
two times 0.1 is equal to,

00:05:41.722 --> 00:05:45.889
is equal to 0.2 times the
natural log of 0.1 plus 0.1.

00:05:51.565 --> 00:05:52.398
And let's see.

00:05:52.398 --> 00:05:56.297
This right over here, this is
going to be a negative value,

00:05:56.297 --> 00:05:58.662
in fact it's going to be quite,

00:05:58.662 --> 00:06:02.080
it's definitely going to be
greater than negative one.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.082
Cuz e to the negative
one only gets you to,

00:06:06.082 --> 00:06:09.933
let's see, e to the
negative one is one over e

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:14.100
so that's one over 2.7, so
one over 2.7 is going to be,

00:06:17.155 --> 00:06:20.572
so this is going to be around 0.3 or 0.4.

00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:25.091
So in order to get point one,

00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:28.525
so this'll be around 0.3 to 0.4.

00:06:28.525 --> 00:06:32.008
So in order to get to 0.1 you
have to be even more negative.

00:06:32.008 --> 00:06:36.175
So this is going to be, I could
say less than negative one.

00:06:37.356 --> 00:06:39.167
So if this is less than negative one,

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:41.097
and I'm multiplying it times 0.2,

00:06:41.097 --> 00:06:44.234
I'm gonna get a negative
value that is less than,

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:49.062
less than negative 0.2, and
if I'm adding 0.1 to it,

00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:51.764
well, I'm still going
to get a negative value.

00:06:51.764 --> 00:06:55.931
So for this yellow interval, g
prime of x is less than zero.

00:06:56.778 --> 00:06:58.570
And it would be, I should
have gotten a calculator,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.997
or I could have gotten a calculator out,

00:06:59.997 --> 00:07:02.211
I could have just evaluated a lot easier.

00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:04.661
So g prime of x is less
than zero in this interval.

00:07:04.661 --> 00:07:07.250
Now let's see in this blue
interval what's going on.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.818
And this'll be easier,
we could just try out

00:07:08.818 --> 00:07:10.554
the value one.

00:07:10.554 --> 00:07:14.552
So g prime of one is equal
to two times the natural log

00:07:14.552 --> 00:07:15.885
of one plus one.

00:07:16.852 --> 00:07:18.855
Natural log of one is just zero.

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.956
So all of this just simplifies to one.

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:23.346
So over this blue interval,
I sampled a point there,

00:07:23.346 --> 00:07:26.429
g prime of x is greater than zero.

00:07:27.746 --> 00:07:32.574
So it looks like our
function is decreasing from

00:07:32.574 --> 00:07:35.122
zero to one over square root of e,

00:07:35.122 --> 00:07:37.560
and then we increase after that.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.611
And we increase for all
x's that are greater than

00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.499
one over the square root of e.

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:45.158
And so our function is going to hit,

00:07:45.158 --> 00:07:46.894
if we're decreasing into that and then

00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:50.453
increasing after that, we're
hitting a global minimum point,

00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:53.379
or a absolute minimum
point at x equals one

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.730
over the square root of e.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.272
So let me write this down.

00:07:57.272 --> 00:08:00.189
We hit a, we hit a absolute minimum

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.373
at x equals one over

00:08:08.373 --> 00:08:11.395
the square root of e, and
there is no absolute maximum.

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:13.427
As we get above one over
the square root of e

00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:14.884
we are just going to think about

00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:16.237
what's going to be happening here.

00:08:16.237 --> 00:08:17.306
We're just going to one,

00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:18.968
we know that our function
just keeps on increasing

00:08:18.968 --> 00:08:21.198
and increasing and increasing forever.

00:08:21.198 --> 00:08:22.499
And you could look at even this,

00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:25.441
x squared is just gonna get
unbounded towards infinity,

00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:28.086
and natural log of x is gonna
grow slower than x squared,

00:08:28.086 --> 00:08:30.324
but it's still gonna go
unbounded towards infinity.

00:08:30.324 --> 00:08:34.663
So there's no global,
or no absolute maximum.

00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:36.830
No absolute maximum point.

00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:40.911
And now let's look at the graph of this

00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:43.402
to feel good about what
we just did analytically,

00:08:43.402 --> 00:08:45.320
without looking at it graphically.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.701
And I looked at it ahead of time.

00:08:47.701 --> 00:08:49.393
So let me copy and paste it.

00:08:49.393 --> 00:08:53.121
And so this is the graph of our function.

00:08:53.121 --> 00:08:56.954
So as can see when this
point right over here,

00:08:58.598 --> 00:09:02.765
this is when, this is one
over the square root of e,

00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:05.495
it's not obvious from looking at it

00:09:05.495 --> 00:09:06.900
that it's that point.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.815
X equals one over the square root of e.

00:09:08.815 --> 00:09:12.914
And we can see that it is
indeed an absolute minimum point

00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:16.820
