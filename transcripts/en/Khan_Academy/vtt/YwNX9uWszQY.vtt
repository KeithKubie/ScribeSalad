00:00:00.712 --> 00:00:04.034
- [Voiceover] Which circles
are divided into fourths?

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:06.266
Select all that apply.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.033
Well to be divided into fourths,

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:12.233
that means we have to be divided
into four equal sections.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:16.300
Cause a fourth is gonna be one
of the four equal sections.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.866
So all of these are
divided into four sections

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.833
but not all of them are divided
into four equal sections.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:26.167
For example this one is
divided into four sections

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:27.900
but this section right over here

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.167
is bigger than this
section right over here.

00:00:30.167 --> 00:00:31.666
and its bigger than
this section over here.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.966
So this isn't four equal sections.

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.565
But these top three, it looks
like four equal sections.

00:00:36.565 --> 00:00:38.809
It looks like each of these
four sections are equal.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.301
Each of these four sections are equal,

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:42.308
each of these four sections are equal.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:46.733
So all of these up here
are divided into fourths

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.334
and this one isn't so I
wont click on that one.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:51.130
Let's keep going, this is fun.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.533
Which squares are divided into fourths?

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.066
Select all that apply.

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.200
Well same idea.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.300
We have to be divided
into four equal sections.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.567
So all of these are
divided into four sections.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:02.966
One, two, three, four,

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:04.834
one, two, three, four.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:08.233
But not all of them are divided
into four equal sections.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:12.243
For example, this one right
over here, this section,

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:15.466
this little triangle is much
smaller than this section.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.840
So these aren't equal sections.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.548
But for the other three they
are four equal sections.

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:23.600
Each of these triangles that
this squares divided into,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.034
these are all equal.

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:27.367
They all have the same area.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:29.767
So that's four equal sections.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:32.000
Each of these smaller squares,
they all have the same area.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.033
So that's four equal sections.

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.534
And then each of these four rectangles

00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:36.565
are all the same size.

00:01:36.565 --> 00:01:38.233
They all have the same area.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:40.366
So that's for equal sections.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.409
Let's keep going.

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.813
I'm having a lot of fun.

00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:45.858
Alright, which circles
are divided into thirds?

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:47.663
Well if your to divide to thirds,

00:01:47.663 --> 00:01:51.000
you have to be dividing
into three equal sections.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.400
So this one is divided
into four equal sections.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.533
So this is divided into fourths.

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:56.848
So it's not thirds.

00:01:56.848 --> 00:01:59.497
This is divided into three
sections but they're not equal.

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:00.715
This section right over here

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:03.843
is smaller than this
section right over here.

00:02:03.843 --> 00:02:05.801
This one is divided into three sections

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:06.866
and they're all equal.

00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:08.533
This section has the same
area as this section,

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.666
has the same area as that section.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:12.231
So I'll check that one.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.934
This one is three sections

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.968
but they're not equal just like this one.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.967
This section is much
smaller than this section.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:22.630
So this is the only one that
is really divided into thirds.

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:25.650
Which circles are divided into thirds?

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.176
Same idea.

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:28.400
This is divided into fourths.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.566
These are aren't equal sections.

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:30.884
Not equal sections.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.853
This one is divided into thirds.

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.825
Let's do one more.

00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:37.168
Which rectangles are divided into fourths?

00:02:37.168 --> 00:02:39.548
Remember fourths, it needs
to be four equal sections.

00:02:39.573 --> 00:02:41.446
This looks like four equal sections.

00:02:41.471 --> 00:02:43.004
This is two equal sections.

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.009
This is divided into halves not fourths.

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:48.800
This is four equal sections.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.034
This is divided into six equal sections.

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:52.733
So it's equal sections but not fourths.

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:54.300
Six equal sections.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.166
So this right here is divided into sixths.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.907
So our two rectangles that
are divided into fourths,

00:02:59.907 --> 00:03:01.113
are this one and that one.

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.758
Four equal sections.
