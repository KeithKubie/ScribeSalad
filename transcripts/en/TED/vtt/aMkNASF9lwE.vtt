00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:21.059
I am an immigrant from Uganda
living in the United States

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.744
while waiting for my asylum application

00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:24.954
to go through.

00:00:25.723 --> 00:00:28.991
Migrants do not enjoy
much freedom of movement

00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:30.439
in our world today.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:33.973
This certainly applies to those
who are desperate enough

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:37.015
to navigate choppy
and stormy seas in boats.

00:00:37.352 --> 00:00:42.124
These are the risks my cousins
from West Africa and North Africa face

00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:44.450
while trying to cross over to Europe.

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:48.301
Indeed, it is a rare
but fortunate opportunity

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:51.482
for a migrant to address
a gathering like this.

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.406
But this also signifies
what often is missing

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.104
in the global debate over refugees,

00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:00.486
migrants and immigrants,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.479
voices of the disenfranchised.

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:05.466
Citizens of many host countries,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.405
even those that previously
welcomed newcomers,

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:11.711
are uneasy about the rising
numbers of individuals

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.953
coming into their countries.

00:01:13.977 --> 00:01:17.972
The immediate criticism
is that the newcomers upend the stability

00:01:17.996 --> 00:01:21.153
of social welfare and employment
in their countries.

00:01:21.177 --> 00:01:24.895
Uncertain and skeptical citizens
look towards politicians

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:29.707
who are competing against each other
to see who can claim the prize

00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:33.442
of the loudest voice
of populism and nationalism.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:38.330
It is a contest of who
is the toughest on migrants,

00:01:38.354 --> 00:01:40.585
the most willing to impose travel bans

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.397
and the most eager to propose
projects in building walls.

00:01:44.782 --> 00:01:48.443
All these restrictions simply address
symptoms of the problem,

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:49.888
not the causes.

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:51.493
Why are they coming?

00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.926
Migrants can share perspectives,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.180
if only politicians
would be willing to listen.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.758
In Dubai, I chronicled injustices
and inequalities inflicted regularly

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:03.666
on the migrant labor force.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.757
As a result, pressures
from the governments

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:08.244
of the respective countries

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:12.938
led to me being forced out of my career
as a journalist in the Middle East.

00:02:13.747 --> 00:02:15.250
I was deported to Uganda,

00:02:15.274 --> 00:02:19.931
where economic deprivation
puts everyone at the risk of starvation.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.622
I fled Uganda to come to the United States

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:26.756
in the hope of sustaining a voice
for my brothers and sisters

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.153
who experience a more
serious plight as migrants.

00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:34.365
My father told me he was not happy
about me writing a book

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:38.117
that risked deportation and unemployment.

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:41.615
He had been diabetic for many years
when I still worked in Dubai,

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.218
and my salary was always sufficient
to pay for his treatments.

00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:47.624
After I was expelled,

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:50.516
I could not afford
to sustain his treatment,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.284
and even in the last days of his life,

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:55.793
I could not afford
to take him to a hospital.

00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.683
As I carried his body in my hands
to lay it in the ground

00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:02.344
in June of last year,

00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:05.802
I realized I had paid a profound price

00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:07.626
for amplifying my voice.

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:15.633
The act of speaking up against injustices
that are multilayered is never easy,

00:03:16.257 --> 00:03:20.141
because the problems require
more than just rhetoric.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:26.822
So long as gold mines, oilfields and large
farms in Africa continue to be owned

00:03:26.846 --> 00:03:28.594
by foreign investors

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:32.164
and those vital resources
are shipped to the West,

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:36.910
the stream of African migrants
will flow continuously.

00:03:37.423 --> 00:03:42.052
There are no restrictions
that could ever be so rigorous

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:47.585
to stop the wave of migration
that has determined our human history.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.474
Before border controls can be tightened

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:53.462
and new visa restrictions imposed,

00:03:53.486 --> 00:03:56.031
countries that have long received migrants

00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:59.373
should engage in a more open discussion.

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:04.273
That is the only practical start
for reconciling, finally,

00:04:05.217 --> 00:04:07.563
a legacy of exploitation,

00:04:08.713 --> 00:04:10.229
slavery,

00:04:10.253 --> 00:04:11.653
colonialism

00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:13.457
and imperialism,

00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:19.093
so that together, we can move forward
in creating a more just global economy

00:04:19.752 --> 00:04:21.539
in the 21st century --

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:24.920
one that benefits all.
