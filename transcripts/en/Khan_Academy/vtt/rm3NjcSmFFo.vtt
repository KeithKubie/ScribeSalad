00:00:00.871 --> 00:00:04.928
- Mrs. Grange's second grade
class has 45 tennis balls.

00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:06.489
Whenever I do a word problem like this

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:07.657
I just like to write down

00:00:07.657 --> 00:00:09.100
the information that they're giving me.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.169
So we're gonna start with 45 tennis balls.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.253
They then tell us that 19 tennis balls,

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:20.077
so she starts with 45 tennis
balls to play with at recess.

00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:22.414
They then tell us that 19 tennis balls

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:25.179
get thrown over the fence

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.831
and 6 tennis balls just disappear.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:32.604
How many tennis balls does
Mrs. Grange's class have left?

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.150
So what I'd like to do, when I do

00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:35.235
these type of word
problems, let's say, okay,

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.091
first of all where am I starting from?

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:39.664
Well, I'm starting from 45 tennis balls

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:40.519
and then whats happening?

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.528
Am I gaining tennis balls
or am I losing tennis balls?

00:00:44.017 --> 00:00:45.428
Well I started with 45 or

00:00:45.428 --> 00:00:47.943
Mrs. Grange's class started with 45

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:50.504
then 19 tennis balls get
thrown over the fence

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:52.331
so they're losing the balls.

00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:54.149
And then another 6 tennis balls disappear,

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.244
so both of these are losing tennis balls.

00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:57.844
And since I'm losing something,

00:00:57.844 --> 00:00:59.302
since I'm losing the tennis balls,

00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:01.511
or some of the tennis
balls that I started with

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:03.063
I should subtract here.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.925
Another clue that subtraction
might be interesting

00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:07.763
is because it says how many tennis balls

00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:10.961
does Mrs. Grange's class have
left, which implies that,

00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:12.843
well, she doesn't have
all the tennis balls

00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:14.232
that she started with so we're probably

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:15.303
going to subtract some balls.

00:01:15.303 --> 00:01:16.541
But it comes straight
out of the word problem.

00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:20.384
19 tennis balls get thrown
over the fence, she loses them,

00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:22.758
so we should subtract that
from the original amount.

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.773
And then another 6 just
disappear, so we should then

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:28.178
subtract that on top of
the 19, so let's do that.

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:30.535
So let's first subtract the 19.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.322
So we start with 45 tennis balls,

00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:37.851
and then 19 balls get
thrown over the fence, so

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:40.611
19 get thrown over the fence
so we're subtracting them.

00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:44.239
They lose those balls, so
what is this going to be?

00:01:44.345 --> 00:01:45.761
Well if we look in the ones place

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:47.645
we have 5 ones minus 9 ones.

00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:51.280
Well, since 5 is less than 9
we want to do some regrouping.

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:53.150
So let's go to the tens place.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.444
Instead of 4 tens, lets
try that as 3 tens,

00:01:55.444 --> 00:01:57.797
and then take that 10 , turn it into ones

00:01:57.797 --> 00:01:59.355
so it's gonna be 10 ones.

00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:02.652
10 ones plus 5 ones is 15.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.125
Now we're ready to subtract.

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:10.255
15 minus 9, well that's gonna
be 6 because 9 plus 6 is 15.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.649
And then 3 tens minus 1 ten
is going to be 2 tens, so 26.

00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:18.572
But are we done? No.

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.851
This is just the number
of balls we have left

00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.346
after the 19 get thrown over the fence

00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:27.096
but before we count the
6 that just disappeared.

00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:28.969
So we also have to take away 6

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:30.516
for the 6 balls that disappeared.

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:31.846
So let's do that.

00:02:31.847 --> 00:02:34.663
So after 19, so we started with 45,

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:39.179
19 get thrown over the fence,
we have 26 at that point.

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:42.893
Then, 6 balls just disappear
so we have, once again

00:02:42.893 --> 00:02:46.353
they disappear, they're not,
you know, magically appearing.

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:48.784
Since they're disappearing we subtract.

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:52.845
So we, they're disappearing,
so we want to subtract those.

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:55.034
So how many do we have left?

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:59.231
Well, 6 ones minus 6 ones is 0 ones.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.478
2 tens minus, well nothing here,

00:03:02.478 --> 00:03:04.039
that's just going to be 2 tens.

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:06.241
So how many do we have left?

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.755
Well, or how many does Mrs. Grange's

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:11.702
second grade class have left?

00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:13.365
Well you see it right here.

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:18.365
They have 20 tennis balls,
20 tennis balls left.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.915
Started with 45, 19 get
thrown over the fence

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:23.947
so they lose them,
that's why we subtracted.

00:03:23.947 --> 00:03:26.845
That gets us to 26,
then 6 of them disappear

00:03:26.845 --> 00:03:31.448
so we take the 6 away
from the 26 to get to 20.
