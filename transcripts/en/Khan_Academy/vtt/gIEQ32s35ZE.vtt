00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:01.574
- [Voiceover] Hey, it's Becca,

00:00:01.574 --> 00:00:04.720
and this is Temperance, Part Two.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.636
And in this video, I'll be talking more

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.069
about how exactly over the course

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:11.986
of the 1830s until mostly the 1860s

00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:17.856
the temperance movement
took root in America

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:21.093
and how it became this
national phenomenon.

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:23.641
So, a lot of it had to do
with temperance societies.

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.546
So, in the last video,

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:27.131
I mentioned that the
American Temperance Society

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:30.131
was founded in 1826, so that's 1826.

00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:33.899
But the American Temperance
Society really was this group

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.030
of upper-class Northern
white dudes saying,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.816
"Oh, well, we should probably make sure

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:41.060
"that people don't drink as much."

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.227
But this idea didn't take off
until the rise of teetotalism.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.182
So, teetotalism is very
different than temperance.

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.182
Teetotalism.

00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:52.864
And so, teetotalism is the idea

00:00:52.864 --> 00:00:55.745
that people should not temper
their alcohol consumption,

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:57.916
that they should drink no alcohol.

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:01.126
So, the origin of this word
is debated among historians

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:03.310
and there's kinda two funny stories.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.649
One is the idea that when
you would sign a pledge,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.333
so let's say I was going to pledge

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.370
that I would drink no alcohol

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.808
and join the American
Temperance Society, right here,

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:16.609
I would have to sign my name like that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.760
and write my name, Becca.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.860
Or the other idea is that there
was this temperance activist

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.457
and he was trying to convince people

00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:26.261
to stop drinking alcohol.

00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:28.563
And he said, "You don't have
to stop drinking hard alcohol,

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:31.768
"you have to-to-to-to totally abstain,"

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:34.919
and that's where teetotalism
came from, his stutter.

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:38.348
Just kind of a fun little
factoid about teetotalism.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.087
But this idea of signing a
pledge to drink no alcohol

00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:45.015
was really popular among
these different societies

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:46.353
that started popping up.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.584
So, the American Temperance Society

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:50.617
was not quite as effective.

00:01:50.617 --> 00:01:53.028
But the Washingtonian Temperance Society

00:01:53.028 --> 00:01:56.281
started in the 1840s, in 1840, actually,

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.901
the Washington Temperance Society.

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.070
And the Washington Temperance Society

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.390
was different than the
American Temperance Society

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.153
because it kind of looked
a little bit more like

00:02:07.153 --> 00:02:10.800
the 19th century version
of Alcoholics Anonymous.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.691
People would come together
and talk about their problem.

00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:15.729
There wasn't really a treatment aspect,

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.539
it wasn't super effective
in stopping people

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:21.176
from drinking alcohol because
a pledge, people realized,

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:24.802
wasn't actually going to stop
alcoholics from drinking.

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:27.081
However, the Washingtonian
Temperance Society

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.626
was more this group of middle class men

00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:31.160
and they would all come together

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.242
and try and curb their consumption.

00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:36.563
So, during this time, there were also lots

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:40.288
of prohibitory laws being
passed by the states.

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:42.521
So, different states at different times

00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:45.421
during the early-1800s started to try

00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:49.209
and curb consumption by enacting laws.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.846
They realized that the pledges,

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:52.856
you know, me signing my name like this,

00:02:52.856 --> 00:02:55.085
didn't actually help that much,

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:57.678
and so they needed to
do something legally.

00:02:57.678 --> 00:03:01.845
The first temperance law was
passed by Maine in 1838, Maine,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.825
and this law just outlawed
the sale of hard liquor.

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:09.060
But slowly, states across the country

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.433
started banning alcohol
consumption altogether.

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.397
So, this was kinda happening
all throughout here

00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:17.564
and 12-15 states had some sort
of regulatory law on alcohol.

00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:23.141
So, over this time period,
from the 1830s to the 1860s,

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:27.157
Americans were not just taking pledges

00:03:27.157 --> 00:03:30.983
like they were up here with
the American Temperance Society

00:03:30.983 --> 00:03:32.938
and the Washingtonian Temperance Society,

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:36.641
but they were actually enacting laws.

00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:38.588
Temperance went really mainstream.

00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:39.751
It wasn't just this idea

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:41.079
that you were going to sign a pledge

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.646
to stop drinking hard alcohol,
there were gonna be laws

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:46.613
that would bind you to drink no alcohol.

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:49.010
So, on top of this legal transition,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.958
there was also a big
social and media campaign

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.359
about the terrors and evils of alcohol.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.590
So, right over here is
The Drunkard's Progress.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.333
So, this is really famous lithograph

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.169
created by Nathaniel Currier.

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.044
This was in 1846, so Drunkard's
Progress, right over here.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:08.038
And The Drunkard's
Progress, as you can see,

00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:11.623
shows the kind of cyclic
nature of the alcoholic.

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:13.385
First, he's just drinking at home,

00:04:13.385 --> 00:04:15.548
then he's drinking with friends.

00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:19.256
And then, oh, what is going on there?

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:22.660
He is not going to be going
to the factory today for work.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.659
So, the drunk started not as a drunk

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.574
but as your average guy just
having a drink here or there.

00:04:27.574 --> 00:04:30.697
Then you would see them go
through each of these steps,

00:04:30.697 --> 00:04:32.666
you see Step 2, Step 3, Step 4.

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:35.051
Over here, Step 5 seems
like he's just hanging out

00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.669
with his buddies, having a good time,

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.883
but then it really slowly deteriorated

00:04:39.883 --> 00:04:42.954
into something that Americans didn't want.

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:47.121
So then, in 1853, I guess
that's kind of in here, 1853,

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:50.086
this media campaign just took off

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:54.165
with Ten Nights in a Bar-Room,
so Ten Nights in a Bar-Room.

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:56.660
Here it is, Ten Nights in a Bar-Room.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.920
This is one of the pictures in the book.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.561
This really had just
huge mainstream reach;

00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.230
almost everyone read it.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.056
And then they started
putting on plays of it,

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.968
depicting just how drunk people got

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:12.233
and how terrible that was
for everyone involved.

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:14.980
Ten Night in a Bar-Room had
this really national reach

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.829
and it was similar to that
of Harriet Beecher Stowe

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:21.422
and Uncle Tom's Cabin in
the abolition movement.

00:05:21.422 --> 00:05:22.833
So, this was this rhetoric

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:25.622
that made the temperance
movement take off.

00:05:25.622 --> 00:05:27.881
So, you're probably wondering, then what?

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:29.465
What happened to temperance?

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:33.632
Why did prohibition not happen until 1920?

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:36.335
And so, this has a lot to do
with the abolition movement.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.066
So, the abolition movement was taking off

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.435
right around here, abolition.

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:42.405
And the abolition movement was the idea

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:46.238
that slavery had to be
ended right now, today.

00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:50.109
Abolition was the focus
of the American people

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:54.900
come the mid-1800s, and this
really put temperance on hold.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.827
And so, temperance would
come back after the Civil War

00:05:58.827 --> 00:06:00.952
and after slavery was abolished.

00:06:00.952 --> 00:06:03.875
So, you can learn more
about postbellum temperance,

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:07.448
postbellum, that means
after the Civil War,

00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:10.811
postbellum temperance and prohibition

00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:15.008
in the Khan Academy
article titled Prohibition.

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:16.672
You can check that out and
learn a little bit more

00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:18.365
about how this whole crazy story ended.
