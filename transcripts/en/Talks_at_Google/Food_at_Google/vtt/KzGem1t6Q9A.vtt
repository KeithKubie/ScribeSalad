00:00:04.346 --> 00:00:05.346
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:08.750
Well, thanks for joining us for
another Talks at Google event.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.619
We're joined today
by chef Adam Sobel.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.160
He's the owner of
the Cinnamon Snail.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.936
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.936 --> 00:00:15.144
ADAM SOBEL: Thanks, you guys.

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:16.852
MALE SPEAKER: Everyone
already knows you.

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:20.200
It's a four time Vendy award
winning vegan food truck.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.495
He's appeared on the
Food Network and PBS.

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:23.870
And he's written
about vegan food

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.250
for "The Vegetarian Times."

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.790
You also teach vegan
cooking at the Institute

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.170
for Culinary Education.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.580
And Adam's here today to
talk about his new cookbook

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.960
and sort of storybook, "Street
Vegan: Recipes and Dispatches

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.624
from the Cinnamon
Snail Food Truck."

00:00:39.624 --> 00:00:41.040
So thank you for
joining us today.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.950
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, thanks for
having me here, you guys.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.661
MALE SPEAKER: So let's go back
to the beginning of the story.

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.452
Your grandmother was
an inspiration to you.

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:52.080
You talk about her quite often.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.785
Was she the reason you got
into food to begin with?

00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.590
ADAM SOBEL: Well, I grew up
in a house with a lot of food.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.500
My mom is a literary agent
primarily for cookbook authors.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.730
So there were always people
testing recipes in our home

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.140
and even doing photo shoots for
their cookbooks in our home.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.870
And I definitely
started learning cooking

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.830
from my mom and
grandma, but really

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.220
what got me into preparing
food professionally

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.720
was when I met and fell
in love with the woman who

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.040
would become my wife, and
who I've had kids with,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.770
in my late teens.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.170
And when I met
her, she was really

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.030
one of the first vegan
people I'd gotten close with,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.790
but ate this diet of like
French fries, and canned soup,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.540
and the worst devoid of
nutrition kind of food.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.910
And I wasn't vegan
or vegetarian,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.800
but I really agreed
with the ethics

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.980
behind her decision to eat
that way and live that way.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.500
And I really wanted to learn
how to make yummy food so

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.870
that I can make great
things for all the time.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.160
And I started just going to
Barnes &amp; Noble's and trying

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.669
to copy recipes out of
books and veganize things.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.810
And I started working at
restaurants really just

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.020
to start picking up more
tricks to play around with.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.800
And then working
in restaurants, I

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.280
myself became vegetarian
and then vegan.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.480
People would come
into the restaurants,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.410
trying to veganize
things or vegetarian

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.180
things that were on the menu.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.250
And the other cooks
would scoff about it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.080
and give them a hard time.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.440
And I kept finding myself
standing up for these people

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.690
because I agreed with
the ethics behind it.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.950
And eventually,
somebody was like why

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.210
aren't you vegetarian yet?

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.180
And at that point, I
had no excuses left.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.650
And I was like, yeah,
you're probably right.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.030
And then I got really,
really into it.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.950
MALE SPEAKER: OK, so you start
cooking professionally then

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.340
to learn how to cook.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.640
You figured might as
well get paid for it.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.490
I waited tables for
a few weeks terribly.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.300
So I know the restaurant
business is a difficult life.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.630
Did you know going into it
how challenging it would be?

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.230
The hours?

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.530
That sort of thing, or?

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.488
ADAM SOBEL: Well, yeah.

00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:23.410
I mean, my first
restaurant gig was

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.320
at a restaurant on the
Upper West Side West,

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.880
which is one of Tom
Valenti's restaurants.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.400
And I was working
like six days a week,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.780
and I was baking cakes
for people on the side.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.200
And I would have to get on
this 4:00 in the morning bus

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.780
from New Jersey,
where I was living,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.140
and drop off cakes I was
delivering on my way to work.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.930
And I worked this
horrendous, long day,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.580
and I would get like 2/3
of my sleep on the bus

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.430
to and from the city.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.620
And it was the worst paying job.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.380
I probably wasn't getting even
paid minimum wage or something.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.810
But for me, that was
always way more attractive

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.420
than paying to go
to culinary school.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.170
I always really
hated school myself.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.110
And now my kids, we
homeschool our kids.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.370
Because it's just not a
fun way for me to learn.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.350
I'd rather get paid very
little and work long days

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.170
to learn that way.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.050
It's more fun for me.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.564
MALE SPEAKER: So you
were in the middle

00:04:24.564 --> 00:04:25.980
of the professional
cooking world.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.080
You were a talented chef.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.500
So maybe it's easier
for you to become vegan

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.250
because you can prepare
food for yourself.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.650
I know a lot of people say,
oh, I could never be a vegan.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.160
I could never be a vegetarian.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.304
What do you say to people
that feel that way?

00:04:39.304 --> 00:04:40.720
ADAM SOBEL: Well,
I mean certainly

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.860
when I chose to become a
vegetarian and then vegan,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.060
I wasn't a talented
chef at that point.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.470
I made plenty of
things that sucked.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.870
And to be honest, I still
throw out a terrible meal

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:55.760
every once in awhile.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.720
It happens.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.100
That's part of trying to
get great at something.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.550
You have to be willing
to fail at it miserably

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.070
for years and years.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.950
But for me, the reasons
for my becoming vegan

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.200
were always very
ethically based.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.650
I think the people
who struggle with it

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.850
are choosing to be vegan
maybe for health reasons

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.370
or some other dietary concern.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.890
For me, I became really
aware of the suffering

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.250
that animals endured to be part
of the food production system.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.160
And it just didn't feel like
it was worth it anymore.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.040
I hesitated becoming vegan
for quite awhile feeling

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.730
like it would be
encroaching upon my freedom

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.915
to live however I wanted.

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.850
And it's really not the case.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.430
Once I became very aware
of how animals are treated

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.200
and what they have
to go through-- I

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.550
could still eat
animals if I wanted.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.110
I'm perfectly free to do that.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.670
I just don't want to
harm creatures anymore.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.760
So that's made it very
easy to never look back.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.080
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.200
So you weren't a talented
chef when you started,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.790
you're saying?

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.498
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:14.200
No, I sucked.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.550
MALE SPEAKER: But I think the
lines of the Cinnamon Snail

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.570
tell a different story
at least these days.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.930
So as a talented
chef who now has

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.297
experience in the food
industry, when you're not

00:06:26.297 --> 00:06:27.880
eating the food that
you or your staff

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.260
is cooking, what are your
favorite vegan meals?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.050
Maybe around the city, or
around the country, or world?

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.240
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, I mean,
what really attracts

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.270
me the most in people's
cooking is really

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.490
kind of feeling the love
that they've put in it.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.300
Not to sound really
cliche about it,

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.130
but I think it's really evident
in some people's cooking style.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.680
Somebody makes
you a family meal,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.709
and it's their
grandmother's recipe,

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.500
and they're making it
feel like they really

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.840
care about you--
you just feel such

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.610
a different energy in the food.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.270
And for me, it almost
becomes immaterial

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.320
what the actual food is.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.110
It's really like
you're being sustained

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.250
by their nurturing energy.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.547
I think there's really very
few restaurants in the city

00:07:18.547 --> 00:07:19.630
that you can feel that at.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.050
Actually, one of my
favorites that was like that

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:25.920
just closed like last week.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.500
It was the Lan
Vegetarian Restaurant

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.650
on Sixth street, which was a
Vietnamese family run business.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.170
You could hear the mom and
dad in the kitchen listening

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.540
to Buddhist hymns on loop,
and the son was their waiter.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.230
And it was a really sweet place,
and you felt like you were just

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.790
eating in their home.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.160
So I mean, traveling
around, that's what

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.630
I gravitate towards when
I travel in India or Asia.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.880
Eating street food
made by somebody

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.760
who really cares about
what they're doing,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.850
that's more exciting to me than
eating at the fanciest, most

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.957
refined kind of restaurant.

00:08:02.957 --> 00:08:03.790
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.060
So food with love.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.700
And you said you got
into the vegan cooking

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:15.430
to help rescue your future wife
from french fry and canned soup

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.010
vegetarianism.

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.350
But we all have these
guilty food pleasures.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.460
What would you say yours is?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.218
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, I'll
fuck up some fried food.

00:08:24.218 --> 00:08:26.510
No question about it.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.500
And I really try not to eat that
way regularly because I also

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.900
practice a lot of yoga.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.429
And I also really
want-- because I'm

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.539
a vegan person who's
semi in the spotlight,

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.630
I really want to show people,
look, you can feel great,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.190
and be really healthy,
and have a balanced diet,

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.240
and be out there kicking
ass on a vegan diet.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.160
So I don't want to
be way overweight

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.370
and not feeling incredible.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.740
But yeah, any kind of potato
product, french fries,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.240
samosas--

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.490
MALE SPEAKER: So French fries?

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.740
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, I mean
exactly what I've set out

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.500
to not have my wife eating.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.180
She's right.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.629
Pirogis are dope.

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:05.420
Don't get me wrong.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.770
There's a good pirogi
recipe in the book too.

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.720
There's a truffled
pirogi recipe.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.670
That's my Achilles Heel.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.710
MALE SPEAKER: So
why then did you

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.810
decide to pursue a food
truck instead of a more

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.490
traditional restaurant?

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.955
ADAM SOBEL: So after the
first restaurant where

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:29.190
I'd been working, which was
not a vegetarian restaurant--

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.560
I started working in all
these vegetarian and vegan

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:39.060
restaurants-- I always felt
like the clientele was largely

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.210
people who were already
vegan or accepting of it.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.430
And I felt like culturally
we have such a stigma

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.420
against vegan and
vegetarian food,

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.270
partially because it was
terrible in the '80s and '90s

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.730
what most people experienced.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.830
You know, like
macrobiotic-y type food,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.970
and then there was this era
of very, very processed vegan

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.720
food, all the fake
meat made in Taiwan.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.150
It's just two
extremes that were not

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:12.650
very good that became the
public's consensus of what

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.530
vegan food was about.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.230
And I really wanted to be
able to bring vegan food out

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.780
into the world where people
who would never be caught dead

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.600
going to a vegan restaurant
would see this huge, long line

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.440
down the street.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.190
And there's this display
case of all these

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:29.300
really tempting
looking doughnuts.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.180
And they'd be like lured
into the dark side.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.775
So that was always
my intention with it.

00:10:35.775 --> 00:10:38.760
And in my experience,
that's really

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.850
what we accomplished with it.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.870
I think, predominantly,
we served

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.700
people who really didn't
give a shit about veganism

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.785
and were just excited that
it was really yummy food

00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:54.370
and available to them right
in front of their office.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:59.820
And to me, that's the
biggest part of our success.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.830
It's that we've
been able to help

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.820
dispel some people's
misconceptions about it

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.257
as a culinary form.

00:11:07.257 --> 00:11:08.090
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.870
So it was bringing food out
on the street to the masses,

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.820
like the street food that
you like in Southeast Asia

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.335
and in that same vein.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.090
Suppose I wanted to
open a food truck.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.070
What should I expect in
terms of what's ahead for me?

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.430
I mean, there's this perception
maybe that opening a food truck

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.930
is easy whereas opening a
restaurant is difficult.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:36.680
ADAM SOBEL: Right.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.900
So for years, I would
get a couple people

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:45.230
calling me or emailing me a week
asking me for advice about them

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.110
opening a food truck.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.730
And I used to be
all like, aw yeah.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:49.610
You should go do it.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.980
It's the most fun
thing you ever did.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.020
It's so gratifying.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.290
People come up to
you all day, and they

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.077
get really, really
happy in front of you,

00:11:58.077 --> 00:11:58.910
and then they leave.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.310
And it's really fun
in that capacity.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:08.170
But it's kind of the ultimate
food service nightmare too.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.720
It's every problem
that a restaurant has,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.600
because especially in the kind
of complex way we did our food,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.280
we had to have a huge
kitchen facility where

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.990
we prepped everything at also.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.450
So we have all the
same different types

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.219
of things break, all the
same kind of staffing issues

00:12:25.219 --> 00:12:25.760
and problems.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.530
MALE SPEAKER: How many people
worked behind the scenes there?

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:28.860
ADAM SOBEL: Quite
a lot of people.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:29.410
MALE SPEAKER: A lot.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.368
ADAM SOBEL: By the time
we had a couple trucks,

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:33.860
there was dozens of people.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.150
I mean, it's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.760
We gave them Razor scooters
to get around the kitchen.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.385
But it wasn't--

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:42.760
MALE SPEAKER: You
started with two people.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.093
ADAM SOBEL: It wasn't this dope.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.990
But yeah, it's extremely
prone to disaster.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.320
In addition to all the
things restaurants deal with,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.570
then there's you breaking down,
and there's parking tickets,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.640
and people have this really
confrontational thing

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.460
with food trucks.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:06.450
Like, the pizza
place up the block

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.330
feels like you're
unfair competition,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.110
and they'll call
the police on you.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.450
And then especially
in New York City,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.860
the laws are very different
city to city, but in New York,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.880
it's ridiculous.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.290
Essentially, food
trucks are more or less

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.610
illegal in the city.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.300
There's this illegal black
market, which is the only way

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.600
to obtain the permits for them.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.670
And then once you even get all
the permits, and insurance,

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.600
and everybody's
got workers' comp,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.060
and everything's as legit
as you can possibly make it,

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.800
they've made it
as of a few years

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.590
ago so that you're not legally
even allowed to serve food

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.570
if you're at a metered
location, which

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.900
is every single commercial
space in Manhattan.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.080
So you could be in
a busy lunch rush,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.130
and police just come
and say you guys

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.200
aren't allowed to operate
in front of a meter.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.180
You've got to go.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.250
So yeah, it's like every
nightmare of a restaurant

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.310
but multiplied.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.730
It became almost like a
joke between me and my wife.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:16.960
Every day, there's always
some absurd thing happening.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.690
It's fun.

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.330
And for me, it was
really worth it

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.610
because I was
motivated by trying

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.470
to change our
culture a little bit

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.490
and trying to get the mainstream
to think a little bit more

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:27.340
compassionately.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.640
So as far as I'm concerned,
enduring all these

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.270
like hurdles and
issues, it's sort

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.010
of a matter of life and
death for the animals

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.820
who people ended up not eating.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.070
So it was very, very worth it.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:44.340
But yeah, most
people who just want

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.990
to run whatever
kind of-- they want

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.030
to do a waffle truck because
it's trendy right now.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.620
Now I just tell them you could
save yourself so many headaches

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.830
by doing it as a restaurant
and not a food truck.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.920
MALE SPEAKER: So you mentioned
this shady black market

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.107
of permitting.

00:15:05.107 --> 00:15:06.190
So I'm curious about this.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.500
Without implicating
me, making me

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.030
a conspirator in any
way, what can you tell me

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.050
about these shady permits that
people-- not you, I'm sure--

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:16.430
are acquiring out there.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:17.180
ADAM SOBEL: Right.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.000
So yeah, as of the early
'80s in New York City,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.530
this cap was placed on the
number of vending permits

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.640
both for trucks and carts
it's the same permit.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:35.490
And when they went in
place, anyone who had them

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.420
was able to keep
renewing them for about

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.160
the cost of $100 a year.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.450
So they realized now
there's this heavy demand

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.340
for these permits, and they
can keep holding on to them

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.930
and renewing them and
renting them out illegally

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:55.180
from more than 100 times
what they look they're worth.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.720
And there's no other way.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.290
You can't get on a waiting
list because nobody's

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.190
going to let theirs expiring
go back into the system.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.920
So it's amazing in
New York City, which

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.960
you feel is like hyper
controlled environment

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.410
where there's police everywhere.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.910
But still so many things are
regulated in this shady fashion

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.940
in New York.

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.820
It's the same for
taxicab medallions,

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.340
and liquor licenses, and
a variety of other things.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.030
So that actually prevented
us from opening up initially

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.880
in New York City because we
just couldn't even find one.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.180
It took a couple years before
we are able to obtain one,

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.060
and it was the shadiest thing
I've ever had to deal with.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:42.764
I bought drugs when I was a kid
on the street in New York City.

00:16:42.764 --> 00:16:46.600
This was way, way
more shady than that.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.450
And it's large sums
of money in cash

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.240
you're handling some guy in
an industrial area of Queens

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.665
in a paper bag.

00:16:54.665 --> 00:16:55.910
It's horrendous.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.345
I don't recommend having to
do that to run your business.

00:16:58.345 --> 00:17:00.825
MALE SPEAKER: That's exactly
out of the movies basically.

00:17:00.825 --> 00:17:01.550
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:06.630
I regularly had to deal with the
cast of the Sopranos and stuff.

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.569
MALE SPEAKER: So while we're
on the subject of bureaucracy,

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.905
what are the health regulations
and health inspections

00:17:13.905 --> 00:17:14.780
like for food trucks?

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.279
Are they different
from restaurants?

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:18.829
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, actually
it's another really big

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.970
misconception people
have about food trucks.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.920
Because I guess 20
or 30 years ago,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:32.340
they were this completely
unregulated outlaw thing.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:38.220
I mean, now a food truck gets
way more meticulously health

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.112
inspected and way
more frequently

00:17:40.112 --> 00:17:42.320
because they're going to
all different neighborhoods.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.000
So they'll jump on the
truck at your busiest time

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.630
ever and be looking with a
flashlight at the underside

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.070
of the corner of the
counters for any--

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.510
it's really very difficult.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.280
So food trucks really have
to be up on their game

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.050
because the fines are enormous.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.040
And they can shut
you down completely.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.580
So just like a restaurant
has, food trucks

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.970
have to have all the same
working hand washing facilities

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.940
and all this type of stuff,
which is a huge challenge.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.280
Your restaurant parks outside in
the winter, and all your pipes

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.160
want to freeze
every night, and it

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.920
becomes this whole
other dimension of crap

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:29.040
to have to worry about to be
able to be up to health code.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.980
But it's doable.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.857
It's just hard.

00:18:31.857 --> 00:18:32.690
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.440
So it seems like the
bureaucrats, the policemen,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.760
they can either be your best
friend or your worst nightmare.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.820
In "Street Vegan," you
tell an interesting story

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:44.880
about an experience
you had in Hoboken

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.261
with a police officer
who gave you a hard time.

00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:49.260
Can you talk about that?

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:49.968
ADAM SOBEL: Sure.

00:18:49.968 --> 00:18:53.850
So Hoboken, like I was saying,
all the towns and cities

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:59.140
have their own unique
ordinances about vending.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.340
And Hoboken's one
was really weird.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.730
It was that you had
to move your food

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.250
truck after every single sale.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.280
You know in the suburbs, like
the roving ice cream trucks?

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:16.620
They'll throw you an ice cream
out the window type of thing?

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.930
It can only work for
pre-packaged junk food type

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:21.790
products, you know?

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.120
If you're setting up an official
kitchen on the street, that

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.030
takes at least 45 minutes
to just get everything

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:32.890
settled, and the grills
lit, and all this stuff.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.190
So like it is in
New York where you

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.620
have to find this
balance of where to park,

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.880
where nobody's going to
call the police on you,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.250
and these types of
things, in Hoboken, it

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.730
was like you had to find a
spot where you could stay,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.490
and had good enough
foot traffic,

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.190
and nobody was going to
bother you-- somewhere

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.570
on the outskirts of town.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.590
MALE SPEAKER: Where you
might do a cash deal.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:02.240
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, it was very
typical of food truck world.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.580
So in the first week or
two I was operating, still

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:10.230
really learning the ropes of
how all this stuff worked.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:16.380
We opened on Valentine's Day of
2010, and it was freezing cold.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.000
The first day we were
shoveling feet of snow

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.980
off the roof of our truck
when we were opening.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:26.866
And it was so slow on
this one waterfront block

00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:28.740
that I had found that
was kind of safe that I

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:33.190
started venturing deeper into
the downtown area of Hoboken.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.000
And this one morning I set up,
and after making a couple sales

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.130
this cop came in
full Gestapo leather.

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.982
He's the policeman from
hell type of character.

00:20:47.982 --> 00:20:48.940
And he's like, oh yeah.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.720
You've got to move right now.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.720
So it was early on
a Sunday morning.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.010
I saw there was a spot across
the block, so I went over there

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:58.010
and I opened up.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:01.070
And I sold somebody
in order of pancakes,

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.580
and immediately
the guy was back.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.490
He was like, I'm going to keep
following you around all today.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:08.370
You gotta keep moving.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.600
And I didn't really get it.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.410
And I was packing up slowly so
he came back and immediately

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.950
issued me $500 in tickets.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.680
He made it clear he was going
to just make my day hell.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:31.480
And I had a whole truck full
of freshly made doughnuts

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.630
and all this stuff that was
just going to go to waste.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.880
And I knew I had to just pack
up for the day at that point.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.790
And thinking about it,
just driving out of town

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.325
I stopped at the
police precinct.

00:21:45.325 --> 00:21:46.560
And I was like, OK.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.950
Here's all the doughnuts
I have, you guys.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.090
I don't even know what to
expect tomorrow when I come back

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.850
to operate in this town.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:02.610
And I came back the next
day, and I felt bad.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:06.140
The guy had been so mad
at me, this policeman.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.580
So I went to the police
station and I asked for him

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.990
by name, the police officer.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.360
And I introduced myself.

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.240
And I was like, look.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.430
I'm really not
trying to be a dick.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.464
I just want to make
vegetarian food for people.

00:22:21.464 --> 00:22:25.470
And immediately just because
I had talked to him about it,

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.610
he was a little bit nicer.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.250
And a week later, I was serving
again food on the waterfront

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.910
and I saw this
police car pull up.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.355
And I'm on the phone with my
wife because it's real slow.

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:38.990
And I'm like, oh shit.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.410
The police are here.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.530
I've gotta go.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:42.860
And it's the policeman.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.150
He comes out, and he
orders all this food.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.980
And there's a couple
people waiting on food.

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.440
And he's giving
them rave reviews,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.290
telling them which
doughnuts to get.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.420
He started bringing
other cops there,

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.000
and they'd get tofu
sandwiches and stuff.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.990
So yeah, if you're ever harassed
by the police, it's true.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:07.242
You just have to feed them
truckloads of doughnuts

00:23:07.242 --> 00:23:08.670
and it fixes all your problems.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.030
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.071
And that just works, huh?

00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:11.590
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.750
MALE SPEAKER: So I guess
speaking of the food,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.100
let's start talking more
about the food instead

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.940
of the bureaucracy, as
interesting as all that is.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.130
You mentioned how every
once and a while, you'll

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.560
have to throw out a meal that
you made that's just no good.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.890
You're constantly
experimenting with dishes

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.370
and that sort of stuff.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.644
What are your current
most exciting experiments?

00:23:33.644 --> 00:23:34.810
Can't you share any with us?

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:38.305
Or do they stay top secret
until they see the light of day?

00:23:38.305 --> 00:23:38.930
ADAM SOBEL: No.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.680
I mean, there's so much stuff.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.920
I'm always experimenting,
especially at home

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.480
with my wife who does
a lot of pastry stuff.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:50.815
So we're constantly tweaking
and perfecting new things.

00:23:50.815 --> 00:23:53.270
And there are
things too that I'll

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.050
come to be great at
making, and I always

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:57.710
feel like I can
get better at it.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.730
I mean, a perfect example
are the doughnuts we make,

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.010
which there's a very
comprehensive chapter

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:06.670
for in the book.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.700
It's something
that I'm constantly

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.860
playing with and tweaking
different methods

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.920
for exactly how they're glazed.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.290
And if you glaze the doughnuts
while the doughnuts themselves

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.480
are still warm, it has
a very different effect

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.690
than if you glaze
them after they've

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.290
cooled, because the
warmth of the doughnut

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.725
makes the glaze drip
down in a thinner way.

00:24:27.725 --> 00:24:30.110
And there's constantly
stuff like that.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.790
Another thing which you guys
had in the cafeteria today

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.050
are the [? bo ?]
buns, which there's

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.210
a few recipes for in the book.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.820
It's like a Chinese
style steam bun.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.060
And I'm really tweaking
the method I do that with,

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:48.840
because I have this great idea
about doing vegan hamburgers

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.330
on Chinese style steam buttons.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.870
So to make it work out
as a real burger bun

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.020
it takes some tweaking so
that's still soft and wonderful

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.360
but can be substantial.

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.690
MALE SPEAKER: So
I'd imagine that one

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.401
of the challenges for this
book is taking recipes

00:25:08.401 --> 00:25:10.400
that you normally make
for hundreds of thousands

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.480
and making it so that I can
make five at home or something

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.560
like that.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.560
What was the process you
went through in terms

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.870
of picking recipes and then
coming up with measurements

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.170
that a home cook could follow?

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.690
And how do you know that the
recipes come out good in a home

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:26.440
kitchen?

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.530
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.130
Really, all the
recipes had to be

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.070
recreated from the ground up.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.750
We do them in such large volumes
and use industrial equipment

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.890
for making them that it
really only made sense

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.420
to figure out instead of
doing the math of dividing

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:51.005
the recipe we have by
2000, figuring it out fresh

00:25:51.005 --> 00:25:54.370
and really approximating
the taste perfectly.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:59.060
And then I had a great
collection of different recipe

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.290
testers I worked with.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:04.180
And I really tried to have
both people who are really

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.420
novice cooks and people who
were more professional so

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.290
that the people who
really knew about cooking

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.430
could point out the
stupid mistakes I've made,

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.550
and the people who were
terrible at cooking

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.350
would ask me the
dumb questions that I

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.400
assumed people might know.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.550
So that really helped
me hone things.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:25.460
But the thing about doing the
book for me that was really fun

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.850
is that on the truck
itself we're really

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:31.110
limited in the kind of equipment
we have for serving food.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.950
We really just have a flat
top griddle on the truck.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.750
So doing the book
really allowed me

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.390
to start having recipes
available to people for things

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.380
that I wish we could offer--
dumplings on the truck,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.710
and there's all these really
hooked up entrees in the truck

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.090
as well.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.727
So that was really
a fun opportunity.

00:26:50.727 --> 00:26:52.560
MALE SPEAKER: So there's
recipes in the book

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.113
that people have
never seen if they've

00:26:54.113 --> 00:26:55.130
been to the Cinnamon Snail?

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.004
ADAM SOBEL: For sure.

00:26:56.004 --> 00:26:58.100
Some of it are things
that we've always

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.300
offered for catering and stuff.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.410
The entrees, it's kind of funny.

00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:05.910
A lot of them we did used
to have on the truck.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.840
Because when I first
opened the truck,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.030
I thought it'd be
this great idea

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.780
to not have any sandwiches
whatsoever on our truck, which

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.500
has become synonymous
with what we do.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.560
But I just wanted to have all
these architectural, beautiful

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.430
entrees all stacked up with
beautiful fried garnishes

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.960
on them and stuff.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.620
And so when I opened, I had
like 13 different entrees

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.290
on the truck and maybe like
a sandwich or something.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:38.830
And it's a completely
absurd impractical idea

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.130
I had that people
would be willing to eat

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:46.360
that on a paper plate in their
lap during their lunch time.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.680
So that's why the food
we do on the truck

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.910
gravitated so much towards
it being like almost a whole

00:27:52.910 --> 00:27:55.220
entree in between
two pieces of bread.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.350
Some of the things
we serve on the truck

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:00.450
are really complex like that.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.740
MALE SPEAKER: And so you have
some very complex recipes.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.430
And in the book, you helpfully
go through all the ingredients

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.450
you'll see later in the
book and what they are.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:12.970
So there are a lot
of ingredients,

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.500
and some folks here,
especially in Manhattan,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:17.230
don't have gigantic kitchens.

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.830
What are the must haves
for a good vegan kitchen?

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.177
ADAM SOBEL: Well, I mean,
I guess everybody's tastes

00:28:23.177 --> 00:28:23.760
are different.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.590
But definitely one
of my desert island,

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.680
I get to bring one
seasoning ingredient with me

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.340
to the desert island, is plum
vinegar, the umeboshi plum

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.290
vinegar.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.540
It's kind of in an
embarrassing number of things

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.170
I make because I
love it so much.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.890
It really has this
very bright umame kind

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:46.790
of salty, tangy flavor.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:51.040
You would think plum vinegar
sounds so sweet and fruity,

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.700
but it's this really tangy--
really brings things to life.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.660
It's great in all kinds of
dressings, and marinades,

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.170
and sauces.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.820
I use it even in soups.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.550
But yeah, it's really
a great seasoning.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.027
That's definitely
one of my go-to.

00:29:09.027 --> 00:29:11.110
MALE SPEAKER: That's a
must have for your kitchen?

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.060
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, I mean,
there are so many things

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.360
that we use on the truck
that we rely on it,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.690
and it allows us to do a very
simple preparation with it

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:24.510
that's versatile.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.570
So for instance in the book,
which we use on the truck,

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.640
there's a recipe for just
very simply marinaded

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.690
kale that is just
massaged with plum

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.680
vinegar and extra virgin
olive oil, some black pepper,

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.010
and thyme.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.840
And it's a very simple,
easy to make recipe,

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.050
and it makes the greens
really easily digestible

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.520
because the acidity
of the vinegar

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.340
penetrates the cells of the
greens and makes it soft,

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.540
almost like sauteed greens.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.680
But it doesn't impart a very
specific flavor profile on it,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.770
so we'll use that
same marinaded kale

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.280
in a variety of different
things on the truck.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.490
It's in our Korean
barbecue seitan,

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.250
and it's also on the
Thanksgiving style sandwich

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:09.750
we do.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.040
And it works easily for both.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.290
MALE SPEAKER: And
so greens, that's

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:21.190
a dish that people are
comfortable making vegan.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.030
You're known for doughnuts
and pastries, which

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.290
are dishes that people probably
don't know how to make vegan

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:31.240
or that non-vegans
are surprised to taste

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.570
and there's no animal
products in them.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.280
So how do you veganize pastries?

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.070
Is it all your wife?

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.315
Has she got the secret
recipes for that?

00:30:41.315 --> 00:30:45.410
ADAM SOBEL: She is magical,
but it's taken a lot of us

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.430
both tweaking the recipes.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.730
And I mean, to be
honest, I think

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.880
most people wouldn't
know how to make a not

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.220
vegan doughnut either.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:57.580
It's not something that
a lot of people do.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:02.370
And to be honest,
it's a pastry art form

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.760
that I feel was
almost completely lost

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.290
during the '70s
through the '90s.

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:15.380
Really, this industrialized
model of doughnut production

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.200
started proliferating,
stuff like Krispy Kreme,

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.190
and Dunkin' Donuts,
and Tim Horton's.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.770
And really, the
kind of mom and pop

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.270
handmade doughnut tradition
was almost completely

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:34.410
lost because it was something as
a culinary form that was never

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:36.040
really very well documented.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.660
There's only a
couple very-- I mean,

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.100
there's not many books about it.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.220
Most resources online
about doughnut making start

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:49.920
with a can of Pillsbury
muffin mix or whatever.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:53.640
And it's something that
learning to do vegan,

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.000
we really had to
start with nothing

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.910
and just start making
stuff up and trying things.

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.690
And writing a doughnut
chapter for the book

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.562
was a really
interesting challenge

00:32:05.562 --> 00:32:07.520
because it's not the type
of thing you can just

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.560
hand somebody a recipe for
and expect them to pull it off

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.260
with finesse.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.710
There's kind of a
lot of variables that

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:17.642
can really make or break it.

00:32:17.642 --> 00:32:19.990
We created these
doughnut recipes,

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.060
and that we would figure one
day would come out amazing,

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.650
and the next day
they'd be horrible

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.150
and had soaked up all this oil.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.610
And we would start noticing
the exact amount of time

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:36.230
that the doughnut sit before
you actually form them

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.770
into doughnuts, the dough sits
so that the liquids really

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.230
hydrate the cells of the flour.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.820
It really matters.

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.270
And you know exactly
how frequently

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.420
you filter the oil if
you're frying doughnuts

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:54.790
every day if you're not
throwing out the entire $700

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:58.740
fryer worth of
doughnut oil every day.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.380
You have to filter it very
frequently because the oil

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.230
starts transforming.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:07.570
So in writing that
chapter, I had

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.110
to lay down a little
bit of a primer

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:14.210
on exactly some of
those variables,

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:17.295
exactly how long you want
to mix the dough for,

00:33:17.295 --> 00:33:19.990
and how to proof the
doughnuts if you don't have

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.620
a commercial proofing oven.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.840
So yeah, it forced me
to get really creative

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.020
and think of all these things.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.020
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:31.240
So both you and your wife
have the cooking skills.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.050
Who does most of
the cooking at home?

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.290
ADAM SOBEL: I do most
of the cooking at home

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.230
just because I'm a lot
faster than she is.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.252
MALE SPEAKER: No one
has time to wait for--

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:41.210
ADAM SOBEL: Well, yeah.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:45.786
I mean, we've got two kids
who always want to eat 24/7.

00:33:45.786 --> 00:33:47.910
MALE SPEAKER: What are
their most requested dishes?

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:48.410
What do the kids want?

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:50.130
ADAM SOBEL: Well,
my six year-old

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:55.810
would eat burritos three
times a day if I let her.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:59.120
But what are the real big
hits in our household?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.690
The blintzes I make
are really a big hit,

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.040
and there's a really
great, solid recipe

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.930
for that in our book, which is
based off of my grandmother's

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:09.949
method for it.

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.230
It's filled with kasha
and fried onions.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.050
And there's the method for
making really good quality

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.909
homemade applesauce and tofu
sour cream and stuff with it.

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:23.330
There's also a soup
that's in the book

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.150
that I make a lot at home
that's a coconut curry super

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.790
with chickpeas and Thai basil.

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.210
My wife and kids
went to Thailand

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.310
about a year or so
ago, and they're

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.940
so addicted to Thai food now.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.639
So I've had to get
really, really legit.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.840
Because at the beginning, I
would make stuff for them,

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.520
and they'd be like, oh,
this is good Thai good.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.353
And then they went to
Thailand, and I really

00:34:44.353 --> 00:34:46.000
had to step up my game.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.115
MALE SPEAKER: And they knew you
had been lying the whole time.

00:34:47.115 --> 00:34:47.823
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah.

00:34:47.823 --> 00:34:51.469
It was like, aw, I was trying
to pass off Cambodian food

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:53.409
and then they found out.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:54.917
So--

00:34:54.917 --> 00:34:55.750
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.630
So a lot of Thai food
around the Sobel household.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:02.030
ADAM SOBEL: Well, at
home, we eat pretty simply

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.780
for the most part.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.290
We eat a lot of really
vegetable-based meals.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:11.420
We try to have-- especially
because we have two kids we've

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.070
been raising since
birth vegan, I really

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.280
put a lot of extra
effort into making

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.350
sure they have a very
well rounded diet

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.620
and they get a lot of
dark greens in their diet

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.830
so they're really thriving.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:30.012
MALE SPEAKER: So due to all this
permitting hassle and the food

00:35:30.012 --> 00:35:31.970
truck life getting to
you, the Cinnamon Snail's

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.950
recently retired its daily
lunch service here in New York.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:39.321
Where can we get all this
food you're talking about?

00:35:39.321 --> 00:35:40.320
ADAM SOBEL: I mean, how?

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.874
You can buy it in
your own kitchen.

00:35:41.874 --> 00:35:42.540
It's in my book.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:42.790
MALE SPEAKER: That's
just what you would say.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:43.789
You should buy the book.

00:35:43.789 --> 00:35:45.620
Cook it at home.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.390
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, we're running
the truck here and there

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.670
at events in New York.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:56.240
There's the monthly vegan shop
up events that are in Brooklyn.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.570
There's the seed market
that's by the Altman

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:03.340
building on 18th Street that
we'll be doing once a month.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.180
And then outside of
New York in New Jersey,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.450
our New York City permit
nightmares don't apply there.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.890
So we'll be operating at the
Red Bank New Jersey Farmers'

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:17.850
Market and hopefully the Jersey
City Farmers' Market as well.

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.380
But yeah, we're doing a
little bit of catering.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.340
I'm conspiring my
next, big, crazy thing.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:25.340
MALE SPEAKER: What's the
next, big, crazy thing?

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.006
You can tell us.

00:36:26.006 --> 00:36:28.300
It's just between
me, you, and YouTube.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.095
ADAM SOBEL: No.

00:36:29.095 --> 00:36:30.990
MALE SPEAKER: You really can't?

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.073
ADAM SOBEL: I'm going to
have to keep you waiting.

00:36:33.073 --> 00:36:36.090
But there's some fun
thing brewing in my brain,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.500
and then I'm also doing
consulting for a couple

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.590
different brands to help them
develop vegan lines of what

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:44.505
it is that they do.

00:36:44.505 --> 00:36:46.130
MALE SPEAKER: And
there's always as you

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.320
mentioned the catering custom
cakes and that sort of stuff.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.950
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, my wife makes
really beautiful wedding cakes

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:52.825
and stuff for people.

00:36:52.825 --> 00:36:54.783
MALE SPEAKER: And the
rest of us will just have

00:36:54.783 --> 00:36:56.076
to wait to find out where the--

00:36:56.076 --> 00:36:57.450
ADAM SOBEL: You
guys have to hope

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.590
to get invited to a wedding,
and then you can eat her cakes.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.090
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
that's incentive

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.670
to get married too if anyone's
been holding out on that.

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.350
So I think we've got
a great conversation,

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.775
but I'd imagine people
have questions for you.

00:37:12.775 --> 00:37:15.110
If anyone has questions,
if you could make your way

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:16.520
to one of the two mics, and--

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.820
ADAM SOBEL: Just be warned
I can't see you guys at all.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.890
We're blinded up here.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:23.287
But ask me questions.

00:37:23.287 --> 00:37:24.120
AUDIENCE: Hey, Adam.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.580
Thanks for coming.

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.750
I live in downtown
Jersey City, and I'm

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.620
looking forward to you hopefully
being at the farmers' market.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.752
I wanted to ask you.

00:37:31.752 --> 00:37:32.960
I don't know if you're aware.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.040
The owner of Two Boots Pizza
has mobilized a coalition

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.597
of other-- Do you
know where I'm?

00:37:39.597 --> 00:37:40.555
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:40.555 --> 00:37:42.596
AUDIENCE: He mobilized a
coalition of restaurants

00:37:42.596 --> 00:37:45.880
that they're basically
trying to push out

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.280
the food trucks and
the prepared meals

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.210
at the farmers' market,
which really pisses me off.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:56.480
What do you think we as
residents of Jersey City

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.552
can do to counteract that?

00:38:00.552 --> 00:38:02.010
ADAM SOBEL: That's
a good question.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.390
I know the Jersey
City Farmers' Market

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.850
is curated by the downtown
historic improvement district

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:14.440
there, which is a good thing
as far as our being there

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.530
is concerned, because
they're sort of the city

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:21.570
government-oriented branch.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.860
It's the cause for a
lot of the headaches

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.770
we have dealt with
in the city too.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.620
There's a lot of
businesses who just

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.790
feel that food trucks are an
unfair form of competition

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.650
and want them out.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.700
And unfortunately, because
they pay the property

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.410
taxes in that town and we
don't, they have a lot more

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.500
say than we do about it.

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:49.065
But if you're a resident there,
you also have some say in it.

00:38:49.065 --> 00:38:52.370
So I don't know if there are
council meetings or hearings

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:54.580
about these issues
that you can attend,

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:59.320
but certainly speaking up for
food trucks in that capacity

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.570
would be helpful.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.440
I don't really know exactly
how it's going there.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.100
AUDIENCE: I went to the meeting
where the Two Boots guys,

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.860
he made a very passionate,
well practiced speech.

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:12.710
And I didn't speak.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:14.510
I didn't sign up ahead of time.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:19.060
But it's effective, because
now in the Grove Square,

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.950
the food trucks
aren't there anymore.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.630
And I know at lunchtime
they have issues

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:24.880
that they keep having to move.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.030
And I think it's
detrimental to the people,

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.890
ultimately, in terms of choice.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.090
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.889
it's the council member Steve
Fulop there is kind of--

00:39:35.889 --> 00:39:36.930
AUDIENCE: He's the mayor.

00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:38.200
ADAM SOBEL: Is he the mayor now?

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:38.825
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:38.825 --> 00:39:40.410
ADAM SOBEL: OK, when
I was in Hoboken,

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:41.784
and he was just
a council member.

00:39:41.784 --> 00:39:44.380
AUDIENCE: Former councilman.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.777
ADAM SOBEL: I mean, he doesn't
like food trucks either.

00:39:48.777 --> 00:39:50.360
He wears the big
pants in Jersey City.

00:39:52.975 --> 00:39:56.220
But Two Boots guy,
if you're listening,

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.960
I challenge you to a
rap battle or something.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.250
We can sort it out.

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:07.000
I think that folks who really
take issue with food trucks

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.810
have this like absurd, outdated
mentality about business.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.690
And they don't really
understand how much

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:20.560
foot traffic we bring to the
neighborhoods that we visit.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.485
And I hope he comes, and
we'll do the rap battle.

00:40:23.485 --> 00:40:24.485
We'll get it sorted out.

00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:24.930
AUDIENCE: Looking forward to it.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:25.430
Thank you.

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:28.013
MALE SPEAKER: The truckload of
doughnuts worked with the cops.

00:40:28.013 --> 00:40:29.750
Is it possible
that that would be

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.310
a lobbying technique for you?

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.600
ADAM SOBEL: Well, if it's
pizza guys I'm up against,

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.140
they already eat
mad dough products.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.990
MALE SPEAKER: I say go straight
to the straight to the mayor

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.630
though.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.870
I mean, ultimately,
the Two Boots guy--

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:44.000
ADAM SOBEL: You know, the
problem is for food trucks

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.020
that no matter where
we operate, there's

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.960
always many forms of
opposition to face.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.590
And all over the
country, there's

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.360
been these food truck
coalitions starting up.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.660
In New York City, there's
the Street Vendor Project

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.860
and the New York City
Food Truck Association,

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.160
which both try to fight
for vendors' rights.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.350
But we're the smallest
type of small businesses

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.680
versus every
Starbucks in New York

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.331
City who has lobbying
power and all this stuff.

00:41:14.331 --> 00:41:16.080
AUDIENCE: I wonder if,
just on that topic,

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.496
I wonder if there's
an opportunity

00:41:17.496 --> 00:41:21.390
to offer your goods for sale
within Two Boots, right?

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.140
Prepare the food.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:22.848
Bring it to them.

00:41:22.848 --> 00:41:23.610
Let them sell it.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:26.880
That will bring way more foot
traffic into their store.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.370
Maybe they'll get on
your side that way.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:30.140
I would go there.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:30.940
I also live in Jersey City.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:31.439
Hi.

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.360
Thank you so much for coming.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.980
We bring in some
of the luminaries

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.130
of the world in terms
of genius scientists

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.320
and interesting people
in the tech world

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.290
to give talks like these.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.670
But you know all the
most exciting people

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.364
that, for me
personally, you're it.

00:41:50.364 --> 00:41:51.030
ADAM SOBEL: Aww!

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:55.970
AUDIENCE: I tried to start
eating vegan three years ago.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:59.540
I had very serious health
issues that I couldn't get over,

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.480
and switching to
vegan really fixed it.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.870
And the first time
I had Cinnamon Snail

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:07.319
in Jersey City, that was
when I switched from saying

00:42:07.319 --> 00:42:09.860
"eating vegan really sucks, but
it's making me healthy so I'm

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.351
going to do it" to "this
is freaking awesome.

00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:14.100
I've never had anything
like this before."

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.670
So thanks so much for doing that
and then also bringing it here

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.709
to work after the
truck went away,

00:42:19.709 --> 00:42:22.250
which was the most depressing
time in my time in Jersey City.

00:42:24.997 --> 00:42:26.580
I wanted to tell you
that so you know.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:30.570
But what I really wanted to
ask about is the word vegan.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.860
I feel like there's
such a stigma associated

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.650
with the word for really
no good reason, right?

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.530
I mentioned that
your food is here

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.980
today to some of my colleagues,
and that it's really, really

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.740
amazing and they should take
the trip to the 8th floor

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.990
make it happen.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:51.430
And they said, yeah, I'm a
meat and potatoes kind of guy.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:53.100
I'm not that adventurous.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.010
And there's really
nothing adventurous

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:57.310
about not eating
animal products,

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.830
like having some vegetables or
tofu or something like that.

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.980
But that's the attitude
about the word vegan.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.990
And before I became vegan
or start eating vegan food,

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.227
my mother-in-law used
that word all the time.

00:43:10.227 --> 00:43:12.560
And as somebody who was not
someone who ate in that way,

00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.643
I found it very offensive.

00:43:13.643 --> 00:43:15.350
Like, you think
you're better than me?

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.590
You make vegan food?

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.360
You're some fancy vegan?

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.800
I'm just wondering that given
that it has such a stigma,

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.630
and vegetarian has much less of
a stigma because it sounds more

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.110
like the word
vegetable, I guess,

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.640
is there a way to
maybe-- I think

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.710
there is a movement towards more
people believing that the vegan

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.720
eating is a more sustainable
way to run the planet

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.210
and it's healthier for people
and people generally like it,

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:42.170
but people also generally
dislike the word.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.590
I wonder if there's a way to
come up with a new marketing

00:43:44.590 --> 00:43:49.770
campaign like "eat for
life" or "pro-animal."

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.440
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, I mean, people
are calling it plant-based.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.420
There's all these different
words that have been coined.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.080
But I mean, I think
what our culture

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:04.390
is dealing with is more
deeply psychological, right?

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.430
The excuse that people
are afraid that's

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.020
not going to be yummy or that
it's not going to make them

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.490
feel great-- there's all
these different excuses,

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:21.700
but I think more
fundamentally it's

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:27.410
because it's an ethical
attempt to really try to limit

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.970
the violence we cause, right?

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:33.030
It forces people
to observe the way

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:37.300
they've lived their whole life
and that's very painful when

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.380
you realize you've been
living in such a way

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.820
your whole life
that's indirectly

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.370
caused a lot of suffering.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.690
And it's something
that a lot of people

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.410
would rather keep out of
sight and out of mind.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:54.480
So people get really
defensive about it

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.470
and will become very
offensive towards veganism

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:03.390
because it challenges
their moral ideology.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:05.660
Not to get real
philosophical about it,

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.790
but I think that's a really
big part of our culture's

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.430
opposition towards
it, not to say

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.860
that it's even a perfect
model in and of itself.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:15.940
I mean, there's a
lot of varieties

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.870
of ways people can eat
in a vegan way that are

00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.210
more or less nonviolent, right?

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.010
But I think that's really
what a lot of folks

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:26.250
struggle with about it.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.320
I don't think it needs to
be marketed differently.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.220
I think our culture
just needs to take

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.430
a little more time with it
before it really can accept it

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.240
and comprehended
it in its fullest.

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:38.702
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:39.326
Thanks so much.

00:45:41.936 --> 00:45:42.649
ADAM SOBEL: Hey.

00:45:42.649 --> 00:45:43.440
AUDIENCE: Hi, Adam.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:45.522
Thank you so much for coming.

00:45:45.522 --> 00:45:48.950
I have one and a half questions.

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.507
The first is, what you're
drinking looks really yummy.

00:45:51.507 --> 00:45:52.840
I was just wondering what it is.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.530
ADAM SOBEL: It's the best!

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.400
This is yerba mate.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:03.720
It's a tea from
Argentina and Uruguay.

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.210
The straw is called
a bombilla, which

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.260
has this strainer at
the bottom, and it's

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.400
a lot of very thick herbs.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.730
It's really tasty,
in my opinion,

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.570
but it's one of these things
that people love or hate.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.760
It's almost got a
tobacco-y quality

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.240
in some weird way, a very
all around your mouth palette

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.870
experience.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:29.800
But it's sort of great for you.

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.290
I think it's probably
like 90% what

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:35.940
I'm made out of because
I consume a lot of it.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:38.640
But yeah, it's like a
multivitamin in some ways.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.080
It's got a ton of amino
acids and minerals,

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.561
lots of B vitamins, magnesium.

00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:44.310
That's what it is.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.435
AUDIENCE: That's very cool.

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:46.660
I like tea a lot.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.320
My actual question is I'm
curious where the name Cinnamon

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.410
Snail originated.

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.890
ADAM SOBEL: Well, I get
asked this question a lot,

00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:59.190
and honestly, I wish I
had a cooler background

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.335
story because then I
would have this cool story

00:47:01.335 --> 00:47:02.210
to tell all the time.

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.110
But really it just sounds cute.

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:08.200
It's another name for cinnamon
buns, which my wife and I were

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:10.800
making for our local
farmers' market

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.860
before we launched the truck.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:19.210
And really the
translation in Danish,

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.970
I believe it's
kanelsnegle, is what

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.980
you call a cinnamon
bun, which directly

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:26.380
translates to cinnamon snail.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:32.247
But yeah, really it
just sounds cute.

00:47:32.247 --> 00:47:33.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.930
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah.

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.430
Hey.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.013
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:47:36.013 --> 00:47:37.450
Thanks so much for coming.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.460
I one time stopped
by the Cinnamon Snail

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.440
immediately before a bus
back home to Virginia.

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.660
And now my folks expect
a donut every time

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.690
I come back so
you've really helped

00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:52.210
me raise the expectations
for me as a son.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.290
So I have a question.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.860
There's a part that's of
personal interest to me,

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.400
and then something that other
people might find interesting.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.050
My landlord shut off my
gas like a month ago,

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:05.090
and there's no word on
when that's coming back.

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:08.230
And so I guess the more
microquestion is do you

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:11.160
have any good recipes that only
use a slow cooker and a rice

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:11.660
cooker?

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.880
ADAM SOBEL: What you need to
get is an induction burner,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.700
like an electric
induction burner.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:23.192
Then you could cook a
lot of things with that.

00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:29.590
Yeah, there's not too many Easy
Bake Oven recipes in my book.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:31.420
Yeah, get yourself
an induction burner.

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.120
But get your
landlord in trouble.

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.850
That's not right.

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:35.141
You gotta get some gas back on.

00:48:35.141 --> 00:48:36.830
AUDIENCE: I'm working on it.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:39.060
OK, and then I guess my
more interesting question

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.760
is sort of related to that.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.610
I take it that
cooking in the truck

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:46.590
and then cooking in
like a real kitchen--

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:49.170
not that your truck doesn't
have a real kitchen,

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.280
but a more traditional
kitchen is very different.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.720
And do you find that the
constrained environment

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:59.050
of the truck has led you to be
more creative with your recipes

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.710
in any way?

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:03.650
ADAM SOBEL: That's an
interesting question.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.450
Well, the format of
the truck and the fact

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:10.070
that we became this
astronomically busy food

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.680
truck that has-- it's
a very limited space

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.640
you have in a truck, and you can
only fit so many people in it

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.510
to be preparing the food.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.990
So more than anything what it
really causing me to rethink

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.770
is ways we could prepare
this food as quickly

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:32.440
as humanly possible without it
diminishing from the complexity

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.680
and the freshness of it.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.380
I don't know how much that's
reflected in the book,

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.960
because the book doesn't
have those same constraints.

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:49.270
But what it did is force
me to also plan ways

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:52.040
we could prepare the different
components of the food

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.410
so it was really just the very
quick reheating and assembly

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.460
of things on the truck.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:50:02.440
We have this 5,000 square foot
production kitchen in Brooklyn

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.940
where we make all the different
sauces and things like that.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.280
But yeah, it was a
really fun challenge,

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.240
and that's something
that's really always been

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:15.870
attractive to me
creatively-- forcing myself

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:21.380
to deal with these irrational
types of challenges as a cook

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.620
or in any creative capacity.

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.120
That's one of the things
that's been fun for me to learn

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.757
how to make vegan food like.

00:50:29.757 --> 00:50:31.340
At first, it almost
seemed like you're

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.730
cooking with one hand
tied behind your back.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.880
And then how you're
going to prepare food

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:39.350
for some guest who
comes who's paleo

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.130
and you want it to be vegan too.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:42.480
I love that type of stuff.

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.930
Or be on some show
and you've gotta

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:47.930
make this huge ass meal
in 30 minutes or whatever?

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:49.310
That stuff's really fun to me.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.680
So that always gets
me excited creatively.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.380
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:55.600
Well, Kitchen Stadium is
right across the street,

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:57.474
and so I hope to see
you there sometime soon.

00:50:57.474 --> 00:50:59.240
ADAM SOBEL: Yeah, I'd
like to throw down.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:01.860
ADAM SOBEL: Hey, Adam.

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.220
Really quick question.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:05.430
Kickstarter-- can you walk
you through your decision

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.530
to try to raise
money on Kickstarter

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.334
and whether you think that's a
good platform for food trucks

00:51:10.334 --> 00:51:11.500
or restaurants specifically?

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.770
ADAM SOBEL: Right, so
so we did a Kickstarter

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:19.010
for our second truck, which
became the most successful food

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:22.600
truck-related Kickstarter ever.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.990
And it was really
out of necessity.

00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:30.120
Without getting too
deeply back into all

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.080
the permit-related
stuff, we were

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.050
waiting on a permit
renewal for our one truck,

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.530
and it was going to take months.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.090
Because with the
black market we were

00:51:40.090 --> 00:51:43.920
going to have to fly the
permit holder back in Pakistan

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.436
to be there for it.

00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:52.450
And anyway, the easiest way
to be back open in business

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:56.090
immediately was to buy
somebody else's fully already

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:00.230
outfitted food truck that
had a permit on it already.

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:05.320
And it was really expensive
to do that, and largely

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.110
at the expense of that was
because of the permit that

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:12.580
was-- this sticker
that was on the truck.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:16.770
We got really screwed
in that transaction

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.790
in that when we bought the food
truck from its previous owners,

00:52:21.790 --> 00:52:26.490
the permittee who saw that the
food truck was changing hands

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:30.010
and who had already been paid
in full for the next two years

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:32.540
of the rental of
his permit decided

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.110
that he could rent
that permit to somebody

00:52:35.110 --> 00:52:37.030
else at the same time.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.550
So he reported that one stolen.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.427
So he went and got a
new copy of his permit

00:52:42.427 --> 00:52:44.010
and rented it out
to some other truck.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:46.650
And then a couple months down
the road, we got inspected

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.370
and they were like your
permit's reported stolen.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.970
You're fucked.

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.830
Not to say that that's going
to happen to everybody.

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.070
It's a difficult thing.

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:00.500
I think some food
trucks have initially

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.630
gotten their start
on Kickstarter,

00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:06.220
but it's hard for most people
to do that if they don't already

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:10.645
have this huge social media
following, and reputation,

00:53:10.645 --> 00:53:13.910
and stuff.

00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:16.850
There's probably millions
of people throughout America

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:20.260
who want somebody to buy them
a food truck because they think

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.390
they're great cook or whatever.

00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:26.010
So I don't know if it's
the way into food truck

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.770
heaven for everybody,
but it got us back up

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.072
and running in a few weeks
and was very helpful.

00:53:31.072 --> 00:53:31.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:31.860
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:32.943
We have time for one more.

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.120
ADAM SOBEL: OK, let's do it.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.050
AUDIENCE: Hi, Adam.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:36.880
I miss your food
truck in New York.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.095
ADAM SOBEL: Aw, I do too.

00:53:39.095 --> 00:53:41.470
AUDIENCE: Correct me if I'm
wrong if I'm remembering this

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.920
wrong, but your truck
had a policy where

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.130
if anyone who was basically
looked like they're

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:51.640
homeless or pretty poor,
they'd just be given

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:52.990
free food and free coffee.

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.656
ADAM SOBEL: Mhm.

00:53:53.656 --> 00:53:55.840
AUDIENCE: How did you
decide that would just

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.330
be a policy you do even
though you were a very

00:53:58.330 --> 00:53:59.740
large business at that point?

00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.400
Did it start small and
just become your policy?

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.950
I just also wanted to comment
that that was amazing.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.696
I just saw it happen
one day, and then

00:54:06.696 --> 00:54:08.070
I actually looked
at your website

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:09.945
and it said something
about that this is just

00:54:09.945 --> 00:54:11.080
your policy or whatnot.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.380
So how did that come about
that that just became

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.830
what happened at your truck?

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:17.500
ADAM SOBEL: Right.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:24.030
I guess about 10 years ago or
so, I traveled to South India

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.640
for the first time.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:32.180
And for some reason I
had all these bananas

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:34.740
that somebody gave me the
week before I went to India.

00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:37.080
So I made like a
shitload of banana bread,

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:40.160
and I brought it to the
city with me on my way

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:42.200
to the plane to India.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:45.790
And I was going to give out the
banana bread to homeless people

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:46.340
or whatever.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.910
And I had one piece left
that I hadn't found somebody

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:54.956
to give it to, and I just
brought it with me to India.

00:54:54.956 --> 00:54:57.470
And I figure, aw, I'll just
give it to somebody in India.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:58.770
This'll be cool.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:06.520
And my first day in
South India immediately

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:10.450
from leaving my hotel
room there was this alley.

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:13.020
And this kid crawled
out of the alley

00:55:13.020 --> 00:55:17.280
who looked to be the same
age as my daughter did,

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.950
probably like two
years old or so.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:24.240
And she was missing
her arms and stuff,

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:29.550
and she was living in
garbage in this alley.

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:33.870
And I gave her my banana
bread, and I was like, wow,

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.920
this is going to be such
a heavy kind of trip

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.220
here in South India.

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.500
And on that trip,
you know, there's

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:43.820
such desperation throughout
a lot of India and Southeast

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:46.220
Asia, such severe poverty.

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:50.990
And it's so easy to help people
in a third world country where

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:54.750
you could buy them a whole
for the equivalent of $0.20,

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:55.370
you know?

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:57.250
Or bring somebody
to the hospital

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:02.630
for the equivalent of $20
for a life changing surgery.

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:08.620
And on that trip, I just
decided I could never

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.440
say no to somebody
again who's in need.

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:16.060
So that really shaped
my business practices,

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:19.620
and even just how I live.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.760
I could never not
give somebody money

00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.370
who's asking for money
and stuff like that.

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:26.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.120

much for joining us today.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.340

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.916
MALE SPEAKER: Buy
"Street Vegan."

00:56:30.916 --> 00:56:32.040
Cook the doughnuts at home.

00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.590
Thank you.
