&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.370
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: Hi, my
name is Matthew Barton.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.120
I am the Curator of Recorded
Sound at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.360
It is a wonderful job,
and I have to do it.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.680
Most of the time I am
down at the Packard Campus

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.340
for Audiovisual Conservation
in Culpepper, Virginia,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.590
about 70 miles southwest of here
on the way to Charlottesville.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.580
And once upon a time, though,
I did work in this building.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.580
I can't really see you now,
but there's probably somebody

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.030
out there I used to work with.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
And in the Packard Campus for
Audiovisual Conservation --

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.010
it's a mouthful, sorry
-- there are three --

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.860
approximately 3 1/2
million sound recordings.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.880
That's not every sound
recording that's ever been,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.520
and obviously there are
millions more yet to be made.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.530
However, we're always
filling in gaps.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.430
But today when I pulled together
the display you saw outside,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.380
I was very pleased to find

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.510
that we had every Firesign
Theater album and every solo album.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.920
[ Applause ]

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
So obviously, my predecessors
were doing something right.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.050
And one of those albums,
"Don't Crush that Dwarf,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.290
Hand Me the Pliers," in 2005
was added to the Library

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.510
of Congress' National
Recording Registry.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.410
I think at that time
there was only a couple

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.900
of hundred other items
on the registry.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.810
We're now closing in on 500, but
it's still a very select group

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.430
of recordings that are
historically, aesthetically,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.860
and technically significant,
exceptional, lasting,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.460
as the Firesign Theater is.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.330
And I don't want to go on too long,
because I know why you're here.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.910
So I think I'll just cut to the
chase and say thank you so much

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.820
for joining us here at
the Library of Congress.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.470
If it's your first time, I hope
it's the first of many times.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.230
I hope all of you come back.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.710
It's really a wonderful place,
and it is here for you to use --

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.760
for all Americans to use.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.330
So with that, I will just say
that it's an honor for me to stand

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.870
on this stage and introduce to you
two of the four or five crazy guys,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.270
to the most recently DOA-approved
schoolbooks, we've been told

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.100
that the very first wireless
transmission was invented

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.030
by Spaghettini [assumed

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.580
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Now let's
see, I think it's some sort

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.910
of a street slang, you know,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.760
a [inaudible], a sort
of a bell jargon.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.550
Oh, dash it all, this is tough.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.200
I just have to say
it's about dis and dot!

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.890
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well, it was.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.650
It was indeed about dis and dot.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.780
And just what did dis dot wrought?

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.840
It wrought the next step
on the path of progress!

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.450
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Hello, inventor

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.370
of the phone company,
Alexander Bell Jar here.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.510
Oh, it's Mr. Watson, I presume?

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.810
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.110
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What
can I do for you?

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.410
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: I -- I've stumbled

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.160
across the most frightful
conspiracy.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.030
It's a plot -- a plot to ensnare
the world in wires and poles,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:45.290
to fill the homes of the poor with
ringing noises, to allow naked men

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.720
to talk to naked women
without them knowing it.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.650
And worst of all, to
charge great sums

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.990
of money while cutting off service

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.030
to pathetic pensioners
while they bake or freeze

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.730
to death in their own homes.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.510
Holmes! Do you hear me, Holmes?

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.870
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I'm
horrendously sorry, old fellow,

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.300
but you've got the wrong number.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.600
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh!

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.010
[Dial tone sounding] Well,
while naked people all

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.650
over the world paired up
to talk to one another,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:21.250
the brilliant German scientist
Heinrich Megahertz, alone,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:25.290
on his own, in his home in Cologne,

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:32.600
was sniffing the all-pervasive
ether, and he had a vision,

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.150
[bell ringing] a strange vision.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.770
A vision of electric waves
undulating along limpid,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.320
invisible molecular
highways, oscillating,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.300
shimmering, electromagnetic fields.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:50.670
But he also saw dragons,
little guys in melty hats,

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.950
and the last three episodes
of "Time Out for Beaver."

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.280
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Soon news of his
discovery spread far and wide,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.030
and the images of surfing

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:06.330
on undulating electromagnetic
waves had a peculiar appeal --

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.000
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh, to
the Beach Boys, sure.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.300
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Good vibrations.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.600
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Ha ha.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.900
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Right.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.040
And also to a sandy-haired Yaley
[assumed spelling] named Tree

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.670
D'Forest, which would
lead him to really suck it

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.270
up when he invented
the vacuum cleaner.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.570
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Phil, Phil.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:25.290
D'Forest invented the
tube -- the vacuum tube.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.980
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh, perhaps.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:28.800
Or was it the tube-powered
vacuum cleaner?

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.100
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.400
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You can
see the infomercials.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.700
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.460
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Anyway, he knew
what it was and what to do with it.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.530
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And not a moment
too soon, because we needed it

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.130
to light up a sign that said --

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:41.430
&gt;&gt; D and Phil Proctor: On the air!

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.970
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: [Static
sounds] Hello, America.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:51.120
This is Jenson Lee, the
honey-sweet voice of station CWKW

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.530
in Shraptalese [assumed
spelling], New Jersey.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.490
From [inaudible] studio

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.120
we bring you the tender
tenors of the Bell Jar Boys --

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.380
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: When
Irish eyes are smiling,

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.040
sure, it is like a balmy day.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.340
And when Irish bombs are blasting,

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:27.880 position:56%
it will blow your pub [bomb falling]
awake, awake, awake, awake --

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.380
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And so
America was on the air.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.510
But there was only one
problem, you see with --

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.810
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: The bomb.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.780
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: -- being on the
air, once you're on the radio,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.890 position:56%
you know, you're -- you got stay on.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.190
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: And on.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.830
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And on, and on,
you know, hour after hour and day

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:48.520
after day, week after week, month
after month, year after year,

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.950
decade after decade [crying].

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.150
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Dave, it's okay.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:54.450
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: What?

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:55.750
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: It's okay, Dave.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.590
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, well, but
don't you see, it was all lies.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.890
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What?

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.190
Lies? What -- what?

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.530
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: No, I meant
live -- it was all live.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:04.830
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Live
-- it was live!

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.440
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: It was all
on the air live, yeah, yeah.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.740
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Right, right.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.040
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: That's right.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.340
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: No, Dave.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.640
I think you meant lies.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.940
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
I did, actually.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.240
Well, maybe.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.760
But back then there was no such
thing as a leak or fake news.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.060
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: No, no.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.520
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Not
even a fake President.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.510
What can you do?

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.800
[ Applause ]

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.310
You're on, Mr. Roosevelt.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.360
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Good
evening, my fellow Americans.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:38.190 position:56%
Before I read to you from the funny
papers on our evening fireside chat,

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.770
let me make one thing
perfectly clear --

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.470
I didn't know Roosevelt
was from the South.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.790
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well,
it's a new voice for you.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.740
I understand.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.270
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Let me make
one thing perfectly clear.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.570
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Clear.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.870
There we go.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.550
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: All
we have to fear is me!

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.440
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We interrupt
this socialistic screed --

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.740
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Things
haven't changed, have they?

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:01.590
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: -- for
an important broadcast.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.940
Live from the Pisgarten [assumed
spelling] Olympic Auditorium

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.080 position:56%
in Forsample [assumed spelling],
Bavaria, we present a live broadcast

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.010
of the Herring-Schmelling
[assumed spelling] --

00:14:09.010 --> 00:15:19.070
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I'm in back
of this great, giant auditorium

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.380
where the great, big white
man, Herring, and the great,

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:32.010
big black man, Schmelling, are
trading a tremendous series

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.310
of punches [static sounds].

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.550
Well, it's a lot easier to see
the white man than the black man,

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.410
but now the white man, pummeled

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:45.140
by the black man's smoking ham-like
fists, is turning red as a beet,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.740
illuminated by the flickering
glow of tiki torches waved

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.040
by his all-white supporters,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.710
some of whom I assume are
good people [crowd sounds].

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.010
Oh! And Herring's down!

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.310
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: He's down!

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.180
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: The white man is
down, and the brown shirts are up,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.740
embracing the black man in a kind
of a beer hug, and lifting him

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.040
into the air, they throw
him out of the ring!

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.340
And now they're propping up the
white man, lifting up his arm.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.030
And yes, it looks like the bloody
red Herring has been declared the

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.330
unconscious new world champion!

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.630
What an upset!

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.930
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: [Static
sounds] And now we take you

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.230
to the Naval Gasbag Landing Field

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:12.530
in Lakehurts [assumed
spelling], New Jersey.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.830
It's 1937, and we're taking
you there because we can.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.130
[Wind blowing] I can see the
great ship Hindenburg now,

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.430
the majestic hulk, hovering
here over the mooring pylon.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.730
And there's still a
hint of rain in the air.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.030
Uh-oh, uh-oh!

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.330
The wind seems to be coming up a
bit, and there's the ground crew

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:21.630
like ants running out
to man the ropes.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.930
And the huge ship is only
about 100 feet overhead,

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.230
and I can see tiny people
waving through the windows.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.530
Oh, wait a minute!

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:26.830
Oh, my God!

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.130
The ship is heaving
over to the left.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.430
There's a big gust of wind.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.730
There's a spark there
-- and it rights itself,

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.030
and it's come around now.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.330
And oh, the last of the
ropes are being secured.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.630
Wow, here come the passengers.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:35.930
There's Judge Crater.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.230
And look, Amelia Earhart,
there she is.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.530
Jimmy Hoffa, how about that?

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.830 position:56%
Well, a few of the other
passengers, you know, goose-stepping

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.130
to get the circulation
back in their legs

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.430
after that long trans-Atlantic
flight,

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.730
but that is the story
her from Lakehurts.

[ Applause ]

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.330
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yes, yes,
the news may have kept America

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.630
on their seats, but it
was the art of radio

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.930
that really glued them down.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:54.120
Simple-minded but addictive
radio series that led to decades

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.710
of addictive television in the
years to come, shows like --

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.190
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Is It a Hit
[hands slapping] or a Miss?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.490
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What?

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.040
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.670
The makers of Luke's Blood present
the Aboriginal Amateur Hour,

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:13.660

Major Arcana [assumed spelling].

and round I go.

Hey, hey, babe.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:19.840
We're on the wheel again.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:24.430
But first, here is a word for you
poor sufferers of blood sludge,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.580
from the wealthy folks at Dremel.

End of song.

timeless story of the little people,

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.910
striving to make a pie pond
of tranquility in a dirty,

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.080
backstabbing, self-conscious hamlet

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.720
that accepts neither,
but rejects both.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:52.830
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Brie, Brie, Brie!

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.260
Clean, clean, clean!

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.460
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Cleaner
than anything.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.750
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: End of song!

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.260
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: As
you remember, Cookie,

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.160
ejected from Dr. Dog's Insane
Asylum, had just been driven

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.290
out to the scene of the
fire in Aubrey's stolen car.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:12.040
Only a few minutes
before, the carrots

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.890
and the squirrels had
formed a committee

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:16.660
to flood the Mixville Breadworks
before nightfall [inaudible] court,

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.950
nor avoids to unlock
the pent-up riddle

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:26.150
of Blessed Father Urpo [assumed
spelling] before we all reach --

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:30.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: -- the end of so --

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.950
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Dit-dit,
dit, dit-dit, dit, dit --

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:35.910
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Headquarters,
headquarters, moon 40 Taurus.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.210
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Roger.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:38.540
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Sun 29 Pisces.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.840
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Roger, Roger.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.140
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What?

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.440
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: This
one looks serious, Roger.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.740
Cancer is rising.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:45.040
We'd better call --

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.570
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Captain Equifax!

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:48.870
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes!

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.470
Captain Equifax, the
deadliest foe of those

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.740 position:56%
who would test our island democracy.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.520
By day, Adolph Tree, a
mild-mannered college professor.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.280
But by night, KiKi, a
mini-skirted [inaudible]

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.330
of Hollywood's star-struck
Sunset Strip.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:11.450
But twice a year, he's --

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.680
&gt;&gt; D and Phil Proctor:
Captain Equifax!

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.000
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Today's dumb
story, Spies Over Broadway.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.300
But first --

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.380
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: [Siren
blaring] Police State.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.680
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Police State.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.980
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Police State.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.280
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Help!

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.580
It's the police!

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.800
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Police
men, real police men.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.100
Its policemen will become --

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.400
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Who's number one?

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.700
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: -- peace men.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:37.330
Yes, we're peace men,
even though we wear a gun.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.960
&gt;&gt; D and Phil Proctor:
It's all in fun.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.070
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes, Police State,

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.890
where green rookies become
hardened men in blue,

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.580
where danger earns a diploma,

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.330
and crime gets taught a
civil lesson it deserves.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.820
Listen now as the Federal Bureau
of Marijuana, in cooperation

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:59.260
with Crime Lord magazine,
presents Challenge Number 13,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.290
Roach Patrol on Police State.

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.950
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: [Laughter]
Do pigs live in trees?

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.930
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Do
pigs live in trees?

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.100
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What?

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.400
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: If --

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.700
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.000
If you lived where I live,
and I lived where you lived,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.300
then we'd live where
pigs live, in trees.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.740
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes, yes, yes.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.390
We all live in trees
like big, fat pigs.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.840
And it's time again to play What?

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.350
The old family fun game
that stumps the experts.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:34.880
Well, yeah, that was it.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.400
That was the state of the art
of radio back then, 1940s.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.280
Or was it just the
art of selling soap

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.020 position:56%
and cigarettes to a gullible public?

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.260
Well, we can thank
our Lucky Strikes --

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:49.420
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: No, that's
stars -- our lucky stars.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.780
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Ah, lucky stars,
right, yeah -- for the thoughtful,

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:56.820
concerned dramatists, the real
artists, the poets of the media.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:00.030
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Big
men like Awesome Whales

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:04.180
who scared the pants off of us.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.410
But maybe the greatest writer
of them all was the man

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.120
who transformed the great American
art of selling into the art

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.170
of selling us a great America,

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.170
legendary radio dramatist
Normal Corwin,

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.960
who singlehandedly
yanked radio in the 1940s

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.410
by its patriotic ears
[bomb exploding].

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.060
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And radio --
we love Norman, by the way,

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.030
so don't take that seriously
-- we love Norman Corwin --

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.500
radio went off to the ward.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.770
There was nothing to stop it.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:42.160 position:56%
And when it came back, we discovered
another casualty rather closer

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.460
to home.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.340
We found that suddenly [buzzing
sounds] we couldn't hear D'Forest

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.720
because of the bees.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.380
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You see,
a swarm of bees had buzzed

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.110
into Philo Farnsworth's head, their
little bodies forming a picture,

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.730
a vision [inaudible] and soon,

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.350
he replaced D'Forest's
bulky vacuum tube

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.970
with the new-fangled
catheter ray tube.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.940
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: That's
[inaudible] ray tube.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.240
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Ow!

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.040
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well, then -- gee.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.040
Well, then it was the '50s and,
well, bees were everywhere by then.

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.240
And there were B movies, B girls --

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.650
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Be my love, for
no one else can end this yearning.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:30.190
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And
"Time Out for Beaver."

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.260
Well, America was really
bewitched by TV,

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.950
and everybody was bothered
and bewildered.

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:43.470
And radio was left to
you kids, late at night,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.680
tucked in your beds
[snoring sounds] listening

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:54.420
to dangerous broadcasts
like -- Los Angeles.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.510
He walks again by night.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:02.960
[ Applause ]

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:08.800
Out of the fog [whistling], into
the smog, relentlessly, ruthlessly.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.100
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I
wonder where Ruth is?

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Doggedly [barking],

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:14.030
toward his weekly meeting
with the unknown.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.240 position:56%
At Fourth and Drucker he turns left.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.550
At Drucker and Fourth
he turns right.

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:23.530
He crosses McArthur Park and walks
into a great sandstone building.

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.770
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: [Smacking
sound] Oh, my nose!

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.030
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Groping for
the door, he steps inside.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.330
He's ready for mystery.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.640
He's ready for excitement.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.750
He's ready for anything.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:39.510
He's Nick Danger, America's
only detective.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:45.140
[ Applause ]

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.430
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: As played
so memorably by our late,

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.510
great partner Phil Austin.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:58.590
[ Applause ]

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:00.330
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well,
there will always be a Nick,

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.260 position:56%
and there will always be a Bradshaw.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.510
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Let's
hear it for Peter Bergman!

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:13.500
[ Applause ]

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:15.290
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: They're
here with us tonight,

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.220
you can be assured of that.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.780
Well -- oh, yes, yes.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.080
That's right.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.380
There's Rocky Rococo.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.680
I forgot about him, and --

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.520
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Let's
hear it for me.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.930
You stupid fools.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.540
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And, of course,
there's always Nancy, so --

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.840
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What?

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.140
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: What?

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.010
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: [Snapping] Hello,
Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia,

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:46.160
Fresno, Denver, and all you
sweet people in Foggy Bottom.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.100
And say, it's here.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.690
D.C.'s favorite brew, Here Beer.

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:55.290
I drink it because it's here.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.790
So if you're legal, drink Here.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.840
And if you ain't, drink Near Here.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.880
Let's hear it for Here Beer.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:14.230
And stay tuned for all the hits,
all the time, all the same!

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.400
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, that
was the way it was, wasn't it?

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.750
Well, what happened
to those crazy kids?

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.850
All you listening to that
stuff back in the 1950s --

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.620
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: '60s
-- in the '60s, they --

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:29.780
well, they became Boomers listening
to AM in the a.m., FM in the p.m.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.400
on brand new stations like --

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.700
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: This is WBAI,

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:40.820
listener-suppressed radio
at 98.6 in No Work City.

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:46.080 position:56%
And that, of course, was William
Malloch's Bowel Movement in B Minus,

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.690
as performed right here
in the Coolidge Auditorium

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:55.040 position:56%
by the Unpronounceable Wind Symphony
Orchestra, under the direction

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.230
of Sir Muffled Foreign Name.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.260
And this concludes the
two hours we've been able

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.700
to keep the transmitter on today.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:07.900
So now if you're game,
stay stoned -- stay --

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.380
listen to the long-running
BBC classic "War

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.590
for the Throne of the Orphan King."

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.890
Here it goes.

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:21.140
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: As a tiny tot,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.670
my frosty foster mother told
me not to cross the moat.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:30.890
And then the monk, he did bespeak
me cast the mote from mine own eye.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:35.520 position:56%
And so confused, I crossed my eyes
and double-crossed the monk who fell

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.520
into the moat [splashing sound].

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:42.170
And then my naughty, nubile
niece Marie did bid me warning

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.340
that I play no longer by
myself, it would make me blind.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:51.690
But I was blind to her entreaties,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.350
and so I leapt into
her burning bush.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.680
And lo, although consumed by fire,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.820
I rose again to bite another
apple on yet another eve!

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.950
Are we not me?

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:09.150
If we fall, can we
not but rise again?

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.450
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh!

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:11.750
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Hot-headed,
flushed with blood,

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.700
we will not take it lying down.

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:20.130
We'll pop a pill and
get it any way we can!

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:21.470
Oh, listeners!

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.770
Save me!

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.660
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh,
anything you want to.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.960
And they did.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.260
And they did.

00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.570
They did save radio, and
they still do, I guess.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.010
But what about you, okay?

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.320
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah,
you are in dark,

You think he's going to make it?

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.350
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: I don't know, man.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.260
He looks pretty sick to me.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.560
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Ooh!

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.070
Hey! I think he's coming around.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.710

coming around, folks.

in the old fridge here.

nothing to laugh at there.

mind off of eating by turning

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:10.310
on the all-night talk show
for some food for thought.

Honorable Chester Cadaver.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:42.550
Sure, understanding today's complex
word of the future is a little

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:46.380
like having bees [buzzing
sounds] live in your head.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.150
But what does this mean?

poop about this,

morning, centrally-located

scone's throw from the tomb

over here in the far left wing.

Bureau of Western Mythology.

Veterans' Tap Dance Administration.

There it goes.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.170
There it goes up to the
Secretary of Leftovers --

that's the Department of
Redundancy Department.

rounds the Department of Spies.

that's shoes for industry.

they're right here, son.

listens to the radio, you know.

history of radio.

is it the beginning?

Come down, fellows, come down.

guess that's our story.

You know, the Firesign Theater, all
four of us, we did what we could.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.570
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah, we took
that old art off the radio,

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:40.160
and we mashed it up with Stan
Freeburg and "Mad Magazine,"

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.350
Bob Newhart, Bob and
Ray, and Sergeant Pepper.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:47.870 position:56%

head of the needle on our first LPs,

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:52.090
and escaped just in the nick of
time, diving through the hole

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.390
in the center of the record.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.130

know, we did a lot of big costumed

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:01.320
and propped shows in our younger
days, we ended up standing next

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:05.500
to each other, recreating with
just our voices characters

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.620
that we've lived with
for over 50 years.

standing here now to thank you all

thank the Library of Congress

Beatles of Comedy.

have to prepare them.

thought we were going

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:54.090
to go offstage and drink, but okay.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.390

we roll our things off --

We're surrounded by rock-and-rollers

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:39.380
We ourselves are a rock band, they
think, because they don't know.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.820
You know, they're just
a record company.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:43.120
What do they know?

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.720

I think we look a little like --

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.370
sort of like The Beatles in this.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.010
that 16-track recording really
makes a visual difference,

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.360
doesn't it [laughter]?

effects in this thing, I tell you.

brewed, you know.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.880

&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: That's a young man.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.410

yeah, long hair, too.

awfully dark in the studio.

&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Here
is everything --

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.800
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: It helped
us, the mood, you know.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.100
Ah, but --

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.490
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Everything was,
of course, recorded in 16-track.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:37.220
This was our first album that
allowed us to use 16-track.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:41.640
And the -- for anybody who
knows about this kind of thing,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.260
there is a lot of accumulated
noise [static sounds]

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.910
on those open tracks.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.990
So what are we going to
do about all this noise?

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:53.280
Well, we got something
called Dolby back here.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.820
We'll roll them in.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:58.280
And so that was the very first
album that incorporated Dolbys

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:00.770
in to suppress the tracks.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.180
We always had the same engineer.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.790
You'll see him frequently.

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:07.140
These are people we
probably still know.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:08.440
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: And actually,

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.850
the Firesign Theater gave Mr. Dolby
his lifetime achievement award --

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:16.310
or his Dolby Award, anyway, for
creating it, invention award.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.420
All right, let's see
what' going on here now.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.720
What's that?

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.020
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh, just
current news headlines.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:29.800
There's a lot of spare time in
the studio, as you can tell.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.510
That's That Warrick who
did the music for "Dwarf."

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.070
David Grimm was our organist
on the "Nick Danger" album.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.960
And he passed away very
unexpectedly shortly

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.390
after that album was released,
or he would have been with us --

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.690
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Had
rheumatic heart --

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:45.990

&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Ah,
yes, there we are.

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:53.100
That's the control board
[inaudible] from "Star Trek."

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.550

&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: That little
clock on the wall, that's right.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.960
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We don't
know what he's saying.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.810
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: But we
weren't listening anyway.

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:08.650
Anyway, this was an
old radio studio.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:11.070
All of the studios that we
worked in those early days

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:15.650
at Columbia Square were radio
studios in the '40s and '50s.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.630
And they still stood there,

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.340
and that's where we
did our first albums.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.730
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, they -- it
still had the old director's booth

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:28.830
up the wall that he could -- and
"Suspense" was done in this studio.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:32.770
I think many other
CBS shows of the time.

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.200
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Shows you
how much space you needed

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.220
to do radio properly.

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.520
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, right.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.980
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah, we liked
to do things as live as we could

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:42.970
in those days, so we spread out.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:44.270
We got a big studio.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:45.880
Now these are some of
the ladies who are going

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.400

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:04.330
I believe that Matt has
told me there is going

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:08.580
to be not only an archives
room, but an ex-wives room

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:12.020 position:56%

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.320
Right, Matt?

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.620

yes, we have an opening

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.080
for a three-dimensional curator.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.380

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.980
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: I just do sound.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.280
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Good,
there I am warming up.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:24.310
Now you notice that we've got
these very large headphones

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.570
in those days, earphones.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:30.150
They were actually called
hair phones in those days,

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.690
because everybody had so much
hair, they had to be especially big

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:37.770 position:56%
and loud to get through to our ears.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.700
It's true technologically.

of a ghost in the machine there.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.600
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yes, yes.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.030
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: The CBS door.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.330
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yes,
the CBS door which,

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.510
with some other sound effects
-- oh, the concrete hand job.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:54.610
I forgot about that.

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:58.230
It was a special service
of CBS in those days.

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.530
Yes, there it is.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.860
Right, yes, scary.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.160
I know, I know.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.930
Anyway, we found a lot of
these sound effects units

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:06.230
down in the basement.

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:09.610
They were going to throw them
out, and I brought them all up,

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:11.890
and one of them was
this wonderful door,

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.650
which we used in so many records.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:18.950
And then finally, Stan Freeburg
inherited the door from Fred Jones,

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:22.700
one of our long-lasting
engineers, wonderful engineer.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.550 position:56%
And he, I think, has it to this day.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:27.650
Well, he -- no, he doesn't have
it to this day because he's gone.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.860
But the door remains.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:31.660
That's art for you.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.960
Okay, so --

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.670
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: So really there
are no barriers in this studio.

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:39.660
They're just widely-separated,
wonderful RCA mics

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.410
that were invented
in 1938 just for us.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.910
And of course, we had
to go find them.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.200
"Are there any other microphones
than these that we could use?"

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.980
"Oh, I think there's a
big cabinet over there."

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:55.030
You open it up and there's
thousands of dollars' worth

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.920
of classic, beautiful microphones.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.720
These are the -- and you'll see --

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.020
at the end of this,
you'll see the whole --

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.460
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You'll
actually hear them singing.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.760
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: --
Porgy Tirebiter song.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.310
But these are the girls singing it.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.650
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Do you have
a collection of microphones?

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:08.950
I imagine you do.

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.250
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: We do.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.550
That's why I've been
trying to lure you

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:12.850
down to Culpepper, show off our --

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:14.150
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh, they're
in Culpepper, are they?

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.450
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: Yes,
show off our collection.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.750
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Well,
take some pictures.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:18.050
Show off your what?

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.010
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: Show off --

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.310
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Never mind.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:24.670
Some things are better left unsaid.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:25.980
There they go, yes.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.670
They were all singing, but the
Dolby system silenced them all.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:33.570
Really sad.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:34.870
Very sad.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:36.170
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton:
That's some filter.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.470
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yes, it is.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:40.560
It was a micronite
filter, I believe.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:43.290
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Our
archivist, Taylor Jessen,

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.610
who for some reason
is not here tonight --

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.910
you're not here, are you Taylor?

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.210
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: For some reason?

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:49.510
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: He should be here.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:55.170
Taylor has prepared
our really quite big --

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:57.720 position:56%
it's a big archive, let me tell you.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:04.370
And in this piece of film you'll
see he has matched some voices.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:05.890
So you'll see lines coming

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.750
up that are actually
the lines being recorded

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.730
at that moment in the studio.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.030
Clever guy.

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:13.330
That's --

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.500
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Which David
will magically try to recreate.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.470
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes,
I will, I will.

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:21.960
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Twiddling
dials, yes, or pretending to.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.490
That's me pretending to know
what I'm doing, I think.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.480
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We didn't get
to actually mix an album until

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.430
"Giant Rat of Sumatra,"
which we did at RCA.

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.430
And that was the first time we
could actually put our hands

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.730
on that board.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.780
Otherwise, we had to call it
fade [inaudible] fade, so forth.

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.210
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Could
you be -- who's that?

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:44.510
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Stravinsky.

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:45.810
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh, of
course, of course, Stravinsky.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:47.450
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: I don't
know why, but there he is.

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:49.480
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Inspiration.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:50.920
There's Mr. Bergman.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:56.840
He does not have the same hair
problem that the rest of us had.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:02.940
Politics of pain, ah, yes.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.230
Bill Dremel wearing
an engineer's cap.

00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:09.240
He was really getting into it.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:13.210
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: He did like
four or five of our albums, Bill.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.400
Always had -- you know, there
was always a second engineer

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:19.450
that was involved with it,
but he was the chief for us.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.750
That look --

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.140
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah, the
whistler, the whistler.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:27.480
Don't you love this record?

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.910
It's "The Organ of the Birds."

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.590
So sweet.

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:33.890
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh, come on, Liz!

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:36.990
Only another hour to go.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.930
We'll be there soon.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:42.140
Ah, Phil Austin.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.430
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh,
that's a Moog synthesizer.

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.710
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: That's the
Moog synthesizer we were using

00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:49.010
on the album.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.350
Just had a little shot of it.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.360
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: What, it's
about this big now, right?

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.810
I've got one on my wrist, right?

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:01.110
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: [Laughter] Right.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.410
Jane was somebody's girlfriend.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.130
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: The
guitar was taking a rest.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.200
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Phil
was dragging it.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.500
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Sound effects.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: He's sound effects.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.100
Yes, sound effects
guy trying to make --

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.890
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I loved creating
sound effects in those days.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.190
Found --

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:14.490
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And you had all
that big studio space to do it in.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.790
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah.

00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:18.980
Don't quite know what that is.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.280
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh --

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.580
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Looks
psychedelic, though.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.880
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: A lot
of time -- there's Nurgi.

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.180
Peter's dog Nurgi.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.480
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh,
Peter's dog Nurgi.

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.780
That's --

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:28.310
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, he was
with us for a long, long time.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:29.940
Very sweet companion.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.870
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Started the
documentary film service, remember?

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.320
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
Nurgi Clockwork Films.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.000
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Nurgi
Clockwork Films.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.300
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, oh, yes.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.600
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: That was him.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.900
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Pete, are
you doing something illegal?

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:41.200
I guess not.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.500
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: No, he was just --

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.800
he was rolling regular
cigarettes, remember?

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.100
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, I see.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:46.400
Okay.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.700
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: That explains it.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.000
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: His
dog was leaving him.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.300
Terrible.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.420
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: He had to smoke
in there because Nurgi had one

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.910
of those very short little
dog intestinal systems,

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.570
constantly making his presence
known [farting sounds], you know.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:00.870
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:04.280
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Peter smoked
to counteract it, right.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.180
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: How long
did these sessions last?

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.100
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh,
about six to eight hours.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:13.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, probably
you're watching three sessions here.

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.930
This is right toward
the end of the album.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:17.620 position:56%
We're recording the courtroom scene.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.450
You'll see it's coming
up -- from "Dwarf."

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:21.070
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Ooh,
more sound effects.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.660
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
six hour -- six hour.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.590
Yeah, we tried to get three
minutes down [laughter].

00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:28.890
&gt;&gt; Matthew Barton: Three --

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:30.190
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
three minutes.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.490
Three produced minutes.

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.790
Are you kidding?

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:34.290
That's fast work.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:35.610
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: The
board there looked

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:39.310
like an old telephone
operator's board, didn't it?

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:42.070
With -- you see all of
the wires and everything.

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:43.780
All gone now.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.680
Wireless. We've become
wireless again.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:51.100
We went from wireless to
wireless, strange continuity.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.000
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Emily just had an
endless time playing the guitar --

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.300
playing the drums.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:56.600
She really liked that.

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.370
There's a lot of time to fill here,

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:01.300
which is part of the
experience of recording.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.610
We're listening back.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:05.210
We're setting up the studio.

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:06.820
We're rewriting the script.

00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:08.190
We're practicing the music.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.510
We're opening and closing
the stupid door.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:16.510
[ Laughter ]

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.750
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: And now
we're hopelessly bored.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.580
The day is nearly over.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.810
Let's take pictures of each other.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.130
Okay, oh, yeah.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.510
Taking pictures of people
taking pictures of you,

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.840
and you taking pictures of us
taking pictures of one another.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.800
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: There's
the script --

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.100
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: --
or something like it.

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.780
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And that
script is here right now

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.660
at the Library of Congress.

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.050
That script.

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:40.350
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Wow.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We felt they
should -- if they've got the record,

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:43.510

&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And that's that.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:59:10.620
[ Applause ]

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:15.220
Yeah, that's actually the way
it was for the first five albums

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:19.020
that we did at Columbia in
that studio with that engineer.

00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:20.320
And -- oh, yes.

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.620
I'm sorry.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:22.920
Microphone, thank you.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:27.510
My real wife, Judith, has
-- is the techie here.

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:32.610
[ Applause ]

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:33.910
But here's what -- I want

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:37.680
to tell you one little story
before we start the Q&amp;A.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.430
Twenty-five years ago -- ha --

00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:42.080
everybody was out on
the road doing their --

00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.640
every rock band was doing
their 25th anniversary show.

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:48.250
We were all out there
doing, you know, 25 years --

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:50.630
one of those historic moments.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:51.930
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah --

00:59:51.930 --> 00:59:53.230
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: So we were
out on the road doing it.

00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:59.290
And at our -- the last performance
of that show in some city

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:03.090
in California -- Northern
California somewhere,

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:12.630 position:56%
I was able to take the last bow
with my very, very young son Preston

01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:16.320
who is 25 years old tonight.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.510
Give him a big hand!

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:22.040
[ Applause ]

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.510
Stand up!

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:31.540
[ Applause ]

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.550
Yes, he heard that first burst of
applause at about three months.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:36.850
It changes your life.

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:39.070
It changes your life.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:43.100
And I've got to introduce Orson,
our other wonderful son, Orson.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:44.900
There he is.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:49.070
[ Applause ]

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.480
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Since
we're acknowledging family,

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.830
I want to acknowledge my
wonderful wife, Melinda Peterson

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:55.050
who helped us direct
this piece tonight.

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:56.350
Wherever you are.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:57.650
I love you, darling!

01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:00.690
Hey, there she is!

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.990
[Applause] Thank you all.

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:09.100
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: So are
there any questions?

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.400
Front row.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:14.040
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Let's see, have
we got a traveling microphone?

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.340
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: There it is.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.640
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Mr. Microphone.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.940
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Pass
that mic along.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:22.610
Matt Stone and Trey
Barker were quoted

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:25.300
in the last year saying they're
really stymied when it comes

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.910
to the Trump Administration because
any satire they do can't come

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:32.610 position:56%
up to the measure of the real thing.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:38.470
And I'm wondering,
those contemporary young

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:44.160
and future humorists who are
following in your footsteps,

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.800
where are they going to go
with what you've started?

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.200
And can they with what
you've started?

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.050
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well, I think
two things have happened.

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:57.970
One is stand-up, which was the
opposite of what we were doing.

01:01:57.970 --> 01:02:01.110
We were the anti-stand-up
when we started.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:07.990
And that's really changed a
lot of the landscape out there.

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:11.230
Television -- when you think
of "Saturday Night Live,"

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:14.140
sketch humor, and it's
direct satire.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.630
What the Firesign Theater
never did was direct.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:19.670
It was always indirect
and somewhat surreal.

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:21.610
You know, all of our
commercials are not --

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:25.570
you know, they were way
over there, you know.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.690
the reason we were never
on "Saturday Night Live" is

01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:30.380
because we were just too
-- we were too crazy.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.720
We were too hot for them.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.300
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah, also, they
really were inspired by a group

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.450
like us to create their
own repertory company.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:41.130
And we were -- you
know, it's hard enough

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.000
to get two guys on television.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.030
And it was really difficult to
get four guys on television.

01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:49.680
But for other reasons -- but one of
the things that's also happening,

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.270
obviously there are some
very powerful comedians

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:56.780
who are doing some great satire
in a time when we need to laugh

01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.320
about the dire situation
that we find ourselves in.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:04.020
And that was never really what
Firesign Theater set out to do.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:08.810
Although, we did break
the President, all right.

01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.110
Yes, we did.

01:03:10.110 --> 01:03:13.150
Four more gears, yeah.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:14.450
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: I think --

01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:17.030
you know, I think it comes from
the news better than it comes

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:18.590
from the comedians, if you ask me.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:22.620
The people who are doing news
kinds of programs are the ones --

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.920
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah, right.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.220
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: -- who are
really having a satiric effect

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.400
on politics right now.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.180
Very, very valuable.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.770
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: But remember
also, one of the main messages

01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:35.870
that we tried to deliver in the
many years that we created comedy

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:37.630
in our own particular way was

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:42.030
that you're responsible
for everything, really.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.700
You know, the tomb

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:46.750
of the unregistered voter is
a classic example of that.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:50.340
You know, we are responsible,
in many ways, for the situations

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.200
that we create in our
society and in our lives.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.160
But the other side of that
message is kind of like,

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:01.110
but don't get too emotionally
or spiritually involved in it,

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:05.070
because much of it is really,
at the bottom line, an illusion.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:08.080
And we always like to reveal
the illusion of things

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.950
that we were all getting
emotionally involved

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:11.790
in so people could sell us things.

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:15.010
People could scare us into
thinking certain ways,

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:17.500
voting certain ways,
acting certain ways.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.860
So you have to maintain
your own inner perspective.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:23.510
And that was, I always felt,
one of the main messages

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:27.550
of Firesign Theater, which is
I'm responsible for my life,

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:28.850
and I'm going to keep it that way.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.450
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Absolutely,
very strong.

01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:33.080
Yeah, he's handing the mic over.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.380
Yep?

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.680
&gt;&gt; Gentlemen, thank you.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.980
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Well,
that's very nice.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:38.280
Thank you.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.580
&gt;&gt; Is this thing on?

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.880
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: It sure is.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.420
&gt;&gt; Jameson Hawkins, Facebook
friend, he told me to shout-out.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.720
I did.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:45.020
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Excellent.

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:48.470
&gt;&gt; Speaking of breaking
precedence, where in the name

01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:55.890 position:56%
of fud did you come up with the idea
in 1970 or '71 to put holograms,

01:04:55.890 --> 01:04:59.850
and clones, and a computer
hacker together for Bozos?

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.830
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well, that
was 1971, and the story is --

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:05.390
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: We went to --

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.560
did everybody go to that
work fair, or was it just me?

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.860
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
we were all there.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:10.160
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Everybody
went -- we went to a work fair,

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.070
I guess doing a little R&amp;D.

01:05:12.070 --> 01:05:14.390
Or was it -- was there
an ulterior motive?

01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:15.730
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: It was just -- I
don't remember why we were there.

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:17.050
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I think it
was just a cultural event.

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:19.130 position:56%
We were at a work fair in Hollywood.

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:21.870
And I came across a thing
called the ELIZA program.

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:23.750
Do any of you know what that is?

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.050
Yes, if you do.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:29.000
The ELIZA program was a very, very
early interactive computer program.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.560
And it was quite crude.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:33.090
You basically would
type a question in,

01:05:33.090 --> 01:05:37.260
and the program was a
psychiatric program.

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.410
You would be talking
to a psychiatrist.

01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:43.090
And the psychiatrist would be
answering you through the machine.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.990
And answer whatever questions --
"How do you feel about that, Phil?"

01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:48.350
You know, things like that.

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:51.100
And I noticed -- and I played it.

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.400
It was fascinating.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.700
You know, other people
were playing it.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.700
But I noticed that all of the
material was printed out on one

01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.290
of those -- the yellow sheets of
paper, like the ticker-type paper

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.340
that used to come out
of all the machines.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.640
You remember?

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.340
And it was going into
a big cardboard barrel.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.080
And I said, "Ooh, this is
too good not to partake of."

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.320
So I dove into the barrel, and
I came out with reams and reams

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:20.440
of this paper and skedaddled
out of the place eventually,

01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:23.120
brought it to our writing
session the next day.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:27.530 position:56%
And what was also interesting was it
had the computer programming printed

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:30.810
out in it as well,
"Unhappy mac nam."

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.110
You know, all this strange --

01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.650
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Uptime 901.

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:34.950
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: DR memory.

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:36.250
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, Dr. Memory.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.550
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Dr. Memory.

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:38.850
Direct readout memory.

01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:40.150
Dr. Memory.

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:43.260
And so it became an integral
part of our investigation

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:49.890
into the inner workings of this
future fair, which is, of course,

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:53.340
a metaphor -- Disney World
basically was telling everybody

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.010
that the future is now, and
it's absolutely wonderful.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:06:59.980
You know, our -- the
government is doing a great job.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.470
Everybody's going to have a job.

01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:02.770
Nothing's changed.

01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:05.560
It's all the same stuff -- all
the same B.S. But basically,

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.040
that was the inspiration for all

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.860
of the computer language
and everything.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.260
One other thing I should
say, I can't demonstrate it,

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:17.280
because I had to turn my
phone off, but if you --

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.670
some of you know this,
some of you don't.

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:21.410
If you have an iPhone
and you ask Siri --

01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:24.470
you say to Siri, "This
is worker speaking.

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:29.260
Hello." She will say to
you, "Hello, Ah-Clem.

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:37.230 position:56%
What function can I perform for you?

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:42.200
LOL." Why, you may
ask, did that happen?

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:46.800
Well, Dave Ossman and I were
both involved in Pixar movies,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.240
and we did "A Bug's Life."

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:50.820
Dave had a major role
in "A Bug's Life."

01:07:50.820 --> 01:07:53.050
You were Phyllis Diller's
right-hand man.

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.370
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes, her consort.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.790
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You were
her consort, that's right.

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:57.090
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:07:57.090 --> 01:07:58.390
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Using that --

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:59.690
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Cornelius.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:00.990
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Using

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:02.290
that wonderful voice
that he was born with.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.590
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Aye, this is how
I end up screwing up this voice.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:04.890
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I've been doing --

01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:06.810
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: The ant costume
was very tough to get into.

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:10.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I've been doing
Pixar and Disney movies for a while.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.780
And Lassiter, who is a
Firesign fan, loved that voice

01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.630
of David's, the [inaudible] voice.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:18.580
And asked me how to
get in touch with him.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:21.980
And so Dave and I were both
involved in that particular movie.

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:26.300
And at the opening cast and crew
party up in San Francisco --

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:27.600
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oakland.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.900
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: In Oakland was it?

01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.200
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, I think
it was the Oakland Paramount.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:32.400
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I met Steve Jobs,

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.440
because he had invested
in the Pixar company.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.600
And he told me he was a big fan.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.140
He was a Fire Head.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.290
And we had inspired him with the
record "I Think We're All Bozos

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:46.180
on this Bus" to move
forward with his --

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.610
to create his computer empire.

01:08:48.610 --> 01:08:51.260
And he put that into
the Siri program

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.970
as an homage to the
Firesign Theater.

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:56.510
Thank you, Steve!

01:08:56.510 --> 01:09:01.690
[ Applause ]

01:09:01.690 --> 01:09:03.910
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And
just to wrap that up,

01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:08.950
the idea of a computer hacker
had never, ever been thought

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:12.320
of until Mr. Proctor walked into --

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:16.470
his character walked into the
future fair and discovered how

01:09:16.470 --> 01:09:21.380
to clone himself, send
the clone back to the --

01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.700
in the mainframe of the
machine and ask it a question

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.000
that couldn't be answered.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.300
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:09:27.300 --> 01:09:29.170
Why does a porridge bird
lay his egg in the air?

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:31.910
Can't be answered by
yes or no, you see.

01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.640
Can't be answered anyway.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.540
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Next question.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.890
The mic -- mic, right there.

01:09:39.890 --> 01:09:42.060
Short -- or there's one over there.

01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.720
Let's have that one.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.020
&gt;&gt; Hola, Philippe.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.860
Como estas?

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.160
&gt;&gt; Muy bien, gracias.

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:50.410
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] out
"Belly of the Beast."

01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:56.170
I was wondering if those other
Beatles ever looked you guys up,

01:09:56.170 --> 01:09:59.620
and whether you ever had
any interactions with them?

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:00.920
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: With who?

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.220
&gt;&gt; The other Beatles.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.520
The --

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.820
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: The other Beatles.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.120 position:56%
The rest of those wonderful Beatles.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.420
&gt;&gt; Well, I met --

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.720
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.910
&gt;&gt; I met John Lennon once
in the Los Filez area.

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:14.790
And I went up to him and told
him what a great admirer I was

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.790
and how he inspired
Firesign Theater, so --

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:22.480
to go our happy, surrealistic way.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.970
He knew who we were.

01:10:23.970 --> 01:10:27.690
And I was wearing a George
Baboon for President --

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:31.210
for Resident, Not Insane
button, and I gave it to him.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:34.320
And you will occasionally
see a picture of him with --

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.660
wearing the Firesign
Theater Not Insane button.

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:39.390
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
there's actually a beautiful,

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:41.740
beautiful picture of John and Yoko,

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.100
and John is wearing
that Not Insane button.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:45.400
It's just priceless.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.700
&gt;&gt; Not Insane.

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.300
But that was the only
interaction other than the fact

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.190
that we would religiously
get together and listen

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:56.710
to the first pressing that
we could get our hands

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:59.170
on of every new Beatles album.

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:00.470
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Oh,
yeah, and we started

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:02.330
when "Radio Free oZ" started.

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:06.790
It was before "Sergeant Pepper,"
and we were playing all of those.

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:08.300
Peter had a wonderful
thing that he worked

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:13.110
out with -- he -- 12 cuts, okay.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.310
And he said, "Oh, this is an
astrological album," his first cut.

01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:19.010
And it's "Revolver," right?

01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:20.980
&gt;&gt; "Revolver."

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.280
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah,
it's "Revolver."

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.260
And Peter had this
whole thing that he made

01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:28.620
up that everybody believed
[laughter].

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:29.920
Everybody believed it.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:33.320
That was Peter's real skill, to
make everybody believe something.

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.620
And of course, when he found

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.390
out that there were actually
eight tracks [inaudible],

01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:40.020
didn't work out that way.

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.690
Yeah, next one?

01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:45.120
&gt;&gt; Is it here or there?

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.420
&gt;&gt; Hi, guys.

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:48.370
The last time I saw you
I was interviewing you

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.900
for "Feast Your Ears,
the Story of WHFS."

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.620
&gt;&gt; Jay, hi, Jay.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.250
Jay Schlossberg, ladies
and gentlemen.

01:11:54.250 --> 01:11:56.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:11:56.510 --> 01:12:00.440
[ Applause ]

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:04.720
I think it's really fitting that
you did the history of radio

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.800
as your thing tonight, since
I'm telling a story about one

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.350
of the greatest radio stations
to grace the airwaves, WHFS.

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:16.700 position:56%
Before I ask the question, though, I
want you to know that two of the DJs

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.100
that played your records
all the time are here.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.820
One is Weasel in the
orange shirt right here.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.870
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Weasel, all right.

01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:25.670
&gt;&gt; Yay!

01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:29.420
[ Applause ]

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.950
You're a sleazy Weasel.

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:33.400
I love you!

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.700
&gt;&gt; Squeeze the Weas.

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:37.300
And then sitting back
here is Adele Abrams --

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.510
&gt;&gt; Hey, Adele.

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:42.070
[ Applause ]

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:46.840
They love you, too,
but in a different way.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.230
&gt;&gt; So the question
I wanted to ask you

01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:52.650
because you did this
radio history was --

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:57.170
it's a question I actually asked
you for the film, and so what I'd

01:12:57.170 --> 01:13:03.110
like to ask is what did freeform
progressive radio do for you?

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:07.300
How did that light the fire
behind those records, because HFS,

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.080 position:56%
and WBAI, and BCN, and all those 30,

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:14.960
40 stations around the country were
the only ones playing your records.

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.450
So maybe you could answer a
little question about that.

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:21.920
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, well, part
of the reason why we were able

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.780
to reach people was
also that FM radio --

01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.820
the FM radio revolution
happened around that time,

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:33.150
and a lot of college stations
were experimenting with it,

01:13:33.150 --> 01:13:36.470
and they could play an
entire side of an album.

01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:42.580
But freeform radio was -- you
know, it was the key to our success

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:48.710
because our albums were
designed to mimic the sound

01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:52.010
of actual radio and television.

01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:56.100
And so people who didn't
know that we were comedians

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.310
or surrealists would
get hooked on that.

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.930
And then, believing
that it was normal,

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:08.620
[laughter] we could
pervert their young minds.

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.660
That's my --

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.960
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah, no.

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.310
We couldn't have done without
progressive radio, obviously.

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:20.860
We did the "Dear Friends" album
which were three-minute cuts

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.610
from our radio program, because we
could only get airplay eventually.

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:28.430
We couldn't get 38
minutes of record on.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.730
&gt;&gt; Short cuts.

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.030
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Could you get
38 minutes of record on now?

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:32.330
No, I don't think so.

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:36.490
So without your station
and stations like yours,

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:41.100
particularly on the East
Coast -- GBH -- ah, yeah.

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.400
&gt;&gt; GBD, yeah, right.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.700
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yep.

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:45.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, see.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.780
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We couldn't
have done it without you.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:48.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you all.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.380
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Really
couldn't have.

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:51.380
&gt;&gt; And David and I did
participate in your documentary,

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:53.870
and it's quite wonderful
and fascinating.

01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:57.060
We're very grateful for
people like yourselves

01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:02.540
to fearlessly play the stuff
that we were doing, which --

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:09.140
pretty far out to an
audience of real people.

01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:10.440
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You
made them surreal.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.740
Thank you.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:13.040
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.340
What else?

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.640
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Oh,
I should also mention

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.720
that Luke Polling is
in the house tonight.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:19.020
I'm polling.

01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.290
I don't know where Luke is,
but Luke is doing a documentary

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:23.650
on the Firesign Theatre and Dave

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:26.900
and I did some interviewing
with him back stage.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:30.760
It's very exciting and he's got
about 70 minutes done right now.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.040 position:56%
So that's another documentary piece.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.640
I got to get you two guys together.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.080
We're looking forward --

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.380
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:41.430
As far as I've -- just before
you get the next question,

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:47.680
we are doing a really
wonderful job of wrapping it up.

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:54.070
So all of the albums, all of the
radio shows, all of the movies,

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:58.280
all of the scripts for
all of the material,

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.840
most of that is out,
coming out very soon.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:04.140
Our two books, mine --

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.440
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Dribs and drabs.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:08.190
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: One is a novel
starring George Tirebiter,

01:16:08.190 --> 01:16:10.470
the flying saucer murder case.

01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:13.670
There's some handouts
around about that.

01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:19.320
And then, after that,
fighting clowns of Hollywood,

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:25.510
which is the story of us to make it
when we didn't have a record label,

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:29.970
righting big, big theatrical shows
and all of those scripts will be

01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:32.220
in there and then there'll
be a third book coming,

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:37.790
which is the unmade film
scripts, the original version

01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:40.470 position:56%
of Zachariah, which is really funny.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.470
And --

01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:43.770
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Saucer.

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.380
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Saucer,
which Phil lost

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.240
and then I wrote right
after Airplane.

01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.090
We were hired to write Saucer with
a tale -- and they never made it.

01:16:54.090 --> 01:16:58.390
And -- but the big one was the
Firesign Theatre's one big movie.

01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:59.690
What are we going to do?

01:16:59.690 --> 01:17:01.840
We're going to make The Odyssey.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.220
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Modernize
the Odyssey.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.520
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: What?

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.170
And so, the script -- all
those scripts will be --

01:17:08.170 --> 01:17:13.320
and all of these books
are from Bear Manor.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:17.760
You could go to their
website and they'll have all

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.290
of our -- all of those books.

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:22.300
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: And then,
in honor of Peter Bergman,

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.670
Peter and I have been
working on a couple

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.780
of projects before he passed away.

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.700
And so, in honor of
him, I completed them.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.080
one is Power, which is the scripts

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:38.670
of a very funny surrealistic
radio series we did for Heat

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:43.410
with John Hockenberry, produced
by our friend Ted Bonnet,

01:17:43.410 --> 01:17:46.420
and my wife Melinda
plays many roles on it.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.180
It's very funny and it
has been available on CD.

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.380 position:56%
But the scripts are very, very funny

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.780
and that's also a Bear
Manor Press project.

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.190
And I'm putting the
finishing touches now

01:17:56.190 --> 01:18:00.150
on the skits behind Americathon.

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:04.370
The skits behind the screenplay
of Americathon, telling the story

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:07.320
of that movie, which had the
potential to be a lot better

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.800
than it was, but is
a cult classic now.

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:13.550
And finally, my own autobiography,

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:17.750
Where Is My Fortune Cookie?,
is just released today.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:22.250 position:56%
You can get it on Amazon and I'll be
doing promotion on shows like Coast

01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:24.550
to Coast soon talking about it.

01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:27.420
Because it's really about
the psychedelic events

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:30.900
that happened during -- that
led me really to become a member

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:34.790
of the Firesign Theatre and to stay
with the group over all the years.

01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:37.510
And I hope you get a
kick out of that as well.

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:44.060
[ Applause ]

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:47.470
&gt;&gt; In the history of a creative
enterprise, whether it's individual

01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:51.720
or collective, there's often a
moment where the participants

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.170
or participant looks in the
mirror, looks at one another,

01:18:55.170 --> 01:18:57.940
look at one another, and
say we could do this.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.800
Is there such a moment
in your experience

01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.920
with the Firesign Theatre
than you can talk about?

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.220
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Instant.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:05.520
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: It was instant.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.340
Here's what happened.

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.190
Peter says let's do
the Oz Film Festival.

01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:14.210 position:56%
We're all filmmakers and we're going
to show the movies on the radio.

01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:16.540
And I was one person
and he was two people

01:19:16.540 --> 01:19:20.260
and Phil Austin was four
people and Peter was the host.

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:22.310
And we got in.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:25.180
We started showing
our movies and the --

01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:29.160
immediately, people believed this.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:34.920
They believed that we were showing
movies in the studio on the radio.

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.980
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Here's
what really sold it for us.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:42.400
Phil Austin was playing Jack Love,
who is a pioneer in adult movies.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.010
And it was Phil Austin.

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:49.440
He did it with a sleazy
British accent and he wanted

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.180
to show excerpts from his latest
movie Blondie Pays the Rent.

01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:56.480
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.060
Something like that.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.620
Yeah.

01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.220
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: So he
sets the projector up

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.380
and he starts to play it.

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.100
And Bergman says stop.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:09.400
No. Stop, stop, stop.

01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:11.680
We can't show a dirty
movie on the radio.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.270
They'll take away my license.

01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:18.850
And the phones lit up.

01:20:18.850 --> 01:20:21.360
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Lit up.

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:22.660
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: People --

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.380
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: KPF-K --
Pacific Radio, if you can imagine.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:26.680
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: KPF-K.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:32.570
How can you censor this
man from showing his movie?

01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:35.550
He's an artist?

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:37.010
That's when we looked at
one another and went --

01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:38.310
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Said uh-huh.

01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:40.680
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: We got
something going here.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:44.680
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: So it was really
our first performance together

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.580
that did it.

01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:47.990
Yeah.

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:50.050
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah.

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:52.850
&gt;&gt; We have a little time.

01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:54.530
One or two.

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:55.950
&gt;&gt; A voice from the darkness.

01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:57.250
Yes.

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:58.550
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all,
thanks for coming.

01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:02.840
I can't say I understood all of it,
but it was well worth the drive.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.140
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: That's right.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.440
&gt;&gt; Well, while I'm
thinking about it.

01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.710 position:56%
Getting back to bozos, why does the
porridge bird lay his egg in the air

01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:11.710
and how or who or where did
you come up with a question

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:13.340
like that or should I even ask?

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:16.230
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: It's another
Phil Proctor story, I'm afraid.

01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:17.530
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah.

01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:18.830
This is what the book is about.

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.130
It's so weird.

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:25.000
The -- I had a girlfriend named
Angel, big beautiful Texas girl,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.190
and she told me a story
of her childhood.

01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:32.130
How when she was a little
girl in Austin, Texas,

01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:36.060
she'd go out into her backyard and
she'd play with the leprechauns.

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.940
And this one -- that's
what she told me.

01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:41.650
And this one day, this leprechaun
came out from behind a stump

01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:46.850 position:56%
or something and said why does the
porridge bird lay his egg in the air

01:21:46.850 --> 01:21:49.360
and then laughed and ran away.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.420
Well, she told me this
story and I thought,

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:53.220
well, that's a good question.

01:21:53.220 --> 01:22:02.410
So I brought it to the table
and it became the virus

01:22:02.410 --> 01:22:04.350
that was planted in the computer.

01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:09.220
Now, I looked into Irish
mythology and I discovered

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:13.900
that there was a king who had
been deposed and who lived

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:18.260
in a cage living on
porridge for years

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.870
until he was -- he
regained the throne.

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:24.240
And well, that's good, you know?

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.650
But basically, the best answer

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:29.160
to why does the porridge bird
lay his eggs in the air is

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:31.590
that we've killed all the trees.

01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:32.890
Right?

01:22:32.890 --> 01:22:34.510
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: That's one.

01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:35.810
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: That's one.

01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:37.110
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: That's possible.

01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:38.410
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: But
it's a Zen question.

01:22:38.410 --> 01:22:39.760
you know? Zen what?

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:43.520
Birdman and Radio Fiazi
[phonetic] created the Oz button,

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:45.300
which had four positions.

01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:46.600
Remember?

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:47.900
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yes.

01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:52.580
It was Oz or you could turn it
one way around and it would be no.

01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:58.540
Or you could turn it the
other way and it would be Zo.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:01.010
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: And you could
turn it the other way and it was --

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:04.870
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Well,
it was Oz, No, Zo --

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.180
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: And what?

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.690
&gt;&gt; On.

01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:08.990
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: On.

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:10.290
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: On.

01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:11.590
Oh, yeah. How could
I forget that one?

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:17.340
On. And along with that in
the love-in kit that he sold,

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:22.990
there was a draft card, Mexican
air force, upon -- what was it?

01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:24.750
Upon delivery, burn it?

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.050
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:28.030
It was Mexican Free Air Force.

01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:31.440
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Mexican Free Air
Force draft card or something.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.740
Anyway.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.040
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.340
Peter had --

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.640
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: He
created the first love-in.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.940
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:39.240 position:56%
The first love-in was Peter Bergman.

01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:40.540
He invented the name.

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:41.840
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: At Elysian Field.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.140
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: The whole thing
was at Elysian Park in Los Angeles

01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:44.440
on Easter Sunday night, 1967.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.740
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Thousands
of people.

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.040
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We were there.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.340
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Thousands
of people.

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:49.640
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: 17,000
people showed up.

01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:50.940
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: It's amazing.

01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.240
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Something
like that.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.540
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.840
He was a power all right

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:56.140
and the best straight man
the world has ever seen.

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:57.440
Any other questions?

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.740
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: One more.

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This one, I
hope I get this right.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.600
It occurred to me coming
here tonight

01:24:02.600 --> 01:24:06.870
that what the heck are you
guys that you are what you are?

01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:10.240
And it dawned on me it's
somewhere between --

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.540
there's nothing in comedy.

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:14.440
I was trying to figure out who is
doing this and I haven't seen it.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.320
It's something more like --
and the word is overused --

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.450
ensemble that you guys
have stock characters,

01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:24.690
but they move into places with
reckless abandon and then --

01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:27.690
and yet, there's a through-line
and you do it as did it.

01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:30.460
I mean, the four of you as a group.

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.370
Where is that now?

01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:34.670
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Well,

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:37.480
I guess Saturday Night
Live is the -- but no.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.760
There's no -- nobody's ever done --

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.060
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: No.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.040
Nobody really did what we did.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:44.340
I mean --

01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.640
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Or has done.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.940
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Or
has done it since.

01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.750
It was the magic, the chemistry.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.110
That was a big part of it.

01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:53.890
The fact that we had the
use of the Columbia studios

01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:57.180
and they didn't censor us
and didn't care what we did.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.480
They just put it out.

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.560
It's another rock and roll record.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:03.280
They didn't know.

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.580
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah.

01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:05.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.180
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: There
were two wonderful things.

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:08.480
First of all, a guy named John
McClure, producer at Columbia,

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:11.330
he was the one that signed
us to a spoken arts contract

01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:13.120
after they were going to dump us.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.530
Because he said these guys
are creating something new

01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:16.830
and wonderful.

01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:20.340
And that gave us unlimited
studio time for a reduced royalty

01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:25.530
and it was well worth it because
we could do all this complex work

01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:29.670
together and write and go into
the study and then go write again.

01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:31.890
And that was one thing and then --

01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.210
what was the other
thing you mentioned?

01:25:33.210 --> 01:25:36.900
There's another factor in it.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.870
Well, first of all, we
were our own producers.

01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:40.170
Oh, I know what it was.

01:25:40.170 --> 01:25:42.760
Records were basically uncensored.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.860
I mean, you were playing
a record like ours --

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.160
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And
that was the point.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.820
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You play it in
the privacy of your own home.

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.180
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We were
talking directly to you.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.480
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Yeah.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: We were uncensored.

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.080
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: You
played it at home.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:57.970
We weren't writing it for a media
platform, for radio or television

01:25:57.970 --> 01:26:03.810 position:56%
or -- it was a private platform
that you could carry into your home,

01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:07.680
share with other friends if you
liked it, and that was, I think,

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.190
the reason why it was -- we were
called underground comedians.

01:26:11.190 --> 01:26:13.400
It was slightly subversive
in that regard.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:17.260
But we were free to write
and speak uncensored.

01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.580
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And no one really
had that opportunity until now,

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.980
where, of course, you don't
have to have a studio.

01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.430
You have it all in your watch.

01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:28.270
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Blog it.

01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:29.570
Watch it.

01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:30.870
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:32.170
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: I'm listening
to something right now.

01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:35.280
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: But as you
could see from that film,

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.350
it was fun, it was genuine work.

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:43.940
We worked really hard and then went
back after that and we wrote more

01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:47.500
and we'd come back in the
studio never quite knowing

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:49.320
where we were going to go with it.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.620
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: That's right.

01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:52.770
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: And part of the
magic of the Firesign Theatre was

01:26:52.770 --> 01:26:54.930
that Phil could come
up with something,

01:26:54.930 --> 01:26:57.770
I could come up with
something, Peter could.

01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:00.040
And it would change everything.

01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.520
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: We got those
chaps together on the radio.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.820
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Yeah.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:06.120
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: On
progressive radio.

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.500
Because we were able to improvise
together freely and we could bring

01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:11.100
in stuff for other people.

01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.320
David brought in Mark
Time [assumed spelling]

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.750
as a little skit for us to do.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:18.600
And we just all dove right in.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.990
We worked with an engineer
named Early Jive who used

01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:23.830
to drop sound effects in on us.

01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:27.850
Unexpected sound effects that
we'd also have to respond to.

01:27:27.850 --> 01:27:30.090
Very unique.

01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:33.000
Nobody else ever had
the opportunities we had

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.680
and that's why I don't
think anybody else was able

01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.050 position:56%
to follow the path that we followed.

01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:42.010
&gt;&gt; David Ossman: Right place,
right time, and we love you.

01:27:42.010 --> 01:27:43.310
Thank you.

01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:45.110
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor: Thank you so much.

01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:48.060
[ Applause ]

01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.650
&gt;&gt; Phil Proctor.

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:55.080
David Ossman, the Firesign Theatre.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.710
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
