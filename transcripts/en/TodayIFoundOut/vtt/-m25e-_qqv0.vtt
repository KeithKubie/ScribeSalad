00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.840
As America gets ready for their upcoming Super
Bowl parties (or Royal Rumble party, if that’s

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.389
your thing), Cheez Whiz – the yellowish-orange,
gooey, bland tasting “cheese” product

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.830
– will surely make an appearance at some
of them.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.830
But what is Cheez Whiz?

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.830
Why did get it invented?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.890
And is there really cheese in Cheez Whiz?

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.550
James L. Kraft was born in 1874 in Stevensville,
Ontario on a dairy farm.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.990
When he was 28 years old, he immigrated to
the United States, where he first chose Buffalo,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.990
New York to settle in.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.990
(Where a little over a half century later
another common Super Bowl snack, the Buffalo

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.990
Wing, was born.)

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.359
Why he chose Buffalo (well over two hundred
miles from his home in Ontario) over Detroit

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.420
(under fifty miles away from Stevenson) isn’t
known.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.439
In fact, there seems to be no real record
at all of why Kraft went to Buffalo.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.620
But most important to this story, while there,
he eventually invested in a small cheese company.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.030
He quickly rose up through the company and
was invited to move to Chicago to run the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.410
cheese company’s branch there.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.420
After moving to Chicago, the company either
went under or the heads of the company pushed

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.010
Kraft out (records are conflicting as to what
exactly happened there).

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.379
Either way, Kraft was left stranded in Chicago,
reportedly with little money (perhaps lending

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.300
credence to the “went under” theory) and
no job.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.960
Using his meager remaining funds, he bought
a horse (named Paddy) and a carriage.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.490
For the next few months before dawn every
day, he would take Paddy and the carriage

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.240
down to the wholesale market on Chicago’s
Water Street and buy blocks of cheese in bulk.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.799
He would then sell it to the shop owners around
town at marked up prices.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.700
His reasoning was that he was doing the hard
part for them- finding and buying the cheese

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.340
and then bringing it directly to the shop
owners- and that was worth the markup.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.709
He was right.

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:28.029
Within five years, Kraft’s business was
successful enough that four of his brothers

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:32.549
from Canada were able to come to Chicago and
help James build his new cheese company.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.200
By 1914, they had incorporated as J.L. Kraft
&amp; Bros Company.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.799
That same year, they opened their first cheese
factory in Stockton, Illinois.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.450
The next year, in 1915, they changed the cheese
game.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.560
While Kraft was the first to receive a US
patent for processed cheese, he wasn’t the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.920
first to invent it.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.799
Walter Gerber and Fritz Stettler of Switzerland
in 1911 experimented with their native Emmentaler

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.219
cheese to see if they could increase the shelf
life of cheese for export purposes.

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.159
Their experiments included shredding, heating
the cheese up to various temperatures, and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.450
mixing it with sodium citrate (still used
as a food additive today) to produce a “homogenous

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.890
product which firmed upon cooling.”

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.790
It is unclear if Kraft knew of these Swiss
gentlemen, but, in 1916, he submitted for

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.739
US Patent 1186524, which was titled “Process
of sterilizing cheese and an improved product

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.659
produced by such process.”

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:33.010
In it, it describes a way, “to convert cheese
of the Cheddar genus into such condition that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.510
it may be kept indefinitely without spoiling,
under conditions which would ordinarily cause

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.200
it to spoil, and to accomplish this result
without substantially impairing the taste

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.310
of the cheese.”

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.730
It goes on to explain the process of slicing,
heating, and stirring cheddar cheese in great

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.730
detail, how it needed to be heated to 175
degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes while being

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.730
whisked continuously.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.970
The patent never mentions the addition of
a sodium additive or “emulsifiers” (be

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.340
it sodium citrate like the Swiss or a more
general sodium phosphate).

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.270
This likely is due to the fact that patents
are, of course, public and whatever Kraft

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.650
added to the mix, he probably wanted to keep
it a secret from the competition, a fairly

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.920
common practice in the food industry.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.420
This was the birth of commercialized processed
cheese.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.540
Kraft’s revolutionary new cheese product
couldn’t have come at a better time for

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.189
him, at least business-wise.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.569
When the United States entered World War I
in 1917, there was a need for food products

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.340
that would last and could be shipped long
distances.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.890
By packing his cheese into 3-1/2 and 7-3/4
ounce tins, Kraft was able to become the cheese

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.879
supplier to the US Army, earning himself a
huge payday and a whole generation of soldiers

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.870
trying out his cheese.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.519
Flash forward about twenty five years, to
1952.

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.480
Kraft Cheese, besides now having changed the
name, was also now the number one cheese seller

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.830
in the United States.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.579
(At the time, they were also selling other
dairy products and even candy.)

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.510
America was in the middle of the post-war
economic boom and at the beginning of the

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.310
“convenience culture,” when products that
made life easier were highly sought after,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.870
which also gave rise to the TV Dinner.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.639
Towards this end, just two years before this,
in 1950, Kraft developed a revolutionary convenience-oriented

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.680
product, pre-sliced, pre-packaged cheese – the
famous “Kraft Single.”

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.400
It was around this time that Kraft Cheese
was doing great business in Britain, thanks

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.250
to having sent processed cheese off to World
War II with the allied soldiers.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.270
This bring us to a popular English dish called
Welsh rarebit, which is basically a hot, melted

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.900
cheddar cheese sauce poured over toasted bread
– think an open-faced grilled cheese.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.090
While delicious, the cheese sauce is actually
rather labor-intensive to make, requiring

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.170
much time and careful stirring.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.720
Kraft, trying to appease their British customers,
asked their team of food scientists led by

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.810
Edwin Traisman (who would later help McDonald’s
flash fry their french fries) to come up with

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.550
a faster alternative for this cheese sauce.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.669
After a year and half of experimentation,
they did.

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.220
Cheez Whiz was introduced in Britain in 1952,
and soon after across the United States.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.190
Given its reputation, it might surprise you
to learn that Cheez Wiz was, in fact, originally

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.540
made with quite a bit of real cheese.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.810
However, very recently, this changed.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.331
In 2013, Michael Moss, a writer for the National
Post (a Canadian national newspaper), spoke

00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:23.690
with Dean Southworth, a member of Traisman’s
team at Kraft in the 1950s that helped develop

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.780
Cheez Whiz.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.410
Southworth, a huge fan of the original Cheez
Whiz, said that the original was, “a nice

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.400
spreadable, with a nice flavor.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.660
And it went well at night with crackers and
a little martini.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.420
It went down very, very nicely, if you wanted
to be civilized.”

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.340
However, in 2001, he settled down for a “civilized”
evening of one of his favorite snacks- crackers,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.180
martini, and Cheez Whiz that he had purchased
from the store that day.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.350
Upon spreading the Whiz onto a cracker and
taking a bite, he said he exclaimed to his

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.349
wife, “My God, this tastes like axle grease!”

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:54.229
Something had radically changed in this jar
of Cheez Whiz from the last he had purchased.

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.629
Indeed, when he looked at the ingredients
list, he saw as you’ll still see today-

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.849
Cheez Whiz sold in the United States does
not explicitly list cheese in the ingredients

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:02.849
anymore.

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.840
Rather, if you look, you’ll see 27 other
ingredients, including whey (a protein byproduct

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.470
of milk, the liquid left after the milk has
been curdled and strained), corn syrup, and

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:13.319
milk protein concentrate (a cheaper alternative
to higher-priced powdered milk).

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:18.580
When Moss and Southworth approached a Kraft
spokeswoman about this in 2013, she told them

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.370
there was actually still cheese in the Whiz,
though much less than there was before.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.180
When asked just how much real cheese was still
included in the product, she declined to comment.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.010
She claimed the reason cheese wasn’t listed
on the ingredients anymore was because the

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.490
label already listed the necessary parts of
processed cheese (i.e. milk, sodium phosphate,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.409
cheese cultures), therefore no need for “cheese”
to be explicitly stated.

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.900
At the end of the conversation, she explained,
“We made adjustments in dairy sourcing that

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.950
resulted in less cheese being used.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.400
However, with any reformulation, we work hard
to ensure that the product continues to deliver

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.419
the taste that our consumers expect.”

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.370
Mr. Southworth, of course, didn’t care for
the new taste.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.360
In the end, the use of some of the ingredients
of cheese, rather than cheese itself, has

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.710
some business benefits.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.819
As Southworth said, “I imagine it’s a
marketing and profit thing.

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:09.349
If you don’t have to use cheese, which has
to be kept in storage for a certain length

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:13.580
of time in order to become usable… then
you’ve eliminated the cost of storage, and

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.319
there is more to the profit center.”
