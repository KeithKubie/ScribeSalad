00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:22.630
[ Silence ]

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.930
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Good morning.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.860
I'm pleased to welcome you
to our panel presentation

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.600
on "Wide Open Spaces: Bringing
the Rest of the West Into DPLA."

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.330
You're going to hear from three
of us today who've been working

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.590 position:56%
with DPLA staff to build out the on
ramp to the National Digital Library

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.790
for Cultural Heritage
Institutions in the West.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.750
We have, first, Adrian Turner here
in the front row are my compadres.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.030
Adrian Turner supports the
operations of the Online Archive

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.470
of California, OAC, and
Calisphere websites maintained

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.680
by the California Digital Library.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.240
These sites provide
broad public access

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.540
to cultural heritage collections
contributed by libraries, archives,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.910
and museums throughout California.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.440 position:56%
Next to him is Jodi Allison Bunnell.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.220
She's the content creation and
dissemination program manager

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.250
at Orbis Cascade Alliance.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.010
Jodi's responsible for
working with partners on unique

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.060
and local content, digital
collections, Archives West,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.130
and archival collection management.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.960
She holds an MA in History and an
MLS from the University of Maryland

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.480 position:56%
at College Park and a BA in English,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.220
summa cum laude, from
Whitman College.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.850
And I'm Sandra McIntyre.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.100
I'm the director of the
Mountain West Digital Library,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.380
a regional digital collaborative
of libraries, archives,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.730
and museums in Utah, Nevada, Idaho,
Wyoming, Montana, and Oregon.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.090
MWDL was one of the initial service
hubs in the DPLA, and we share just

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.620
over a million resources
for harvest.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.500
I have a bachelor's degree
from Swarthmore College,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.850
a Master's in Education
from Georgia State,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.290
and am pursuing an MSLIS
from Drexel University.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.110
And just a little personal note,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.200
on May 2nd I will be starting a
new position with another DPLA hub,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.850
the HathiTrust Digital
Library, as the director

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.190
of services and operations.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.560
Adrian and Jodi and I are
on this panel together

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.460
because we collaborate a lot.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.850
Sorry. I should have had this up.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.150
We collaborate a lot.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.470
Our work overlaps.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.620
We've shared a lot of
work on some initiatives,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.300
and we have similar interests
in building out the on ramp

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.770
for the DPLA in the region.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.350
While our organizations
sometimes overlap in who we serve

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.500
and what we do, we support
each other's work strongly

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.760
and celebrate each
other's successes.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.080
We especially want to welcome
those of you in the audience

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.580
from other DPLA service
hubs and hubs in formation,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.430
and we hope that our
presentation about our challenges

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.980
and successes will spur
discussion at the end

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.460
of the session among the hubs.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.360
The community of service
hubs is an important part

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.680
within the DPLA initiative.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.680
Jodi, Adrian, and I look
forward to hearing your ideas

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.030
for bringing the rest
of the West and the rest

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.350
of the country into DPLA.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.470
So I'm going to give
a quick background.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.770
And this is going to
look a little bit

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.770
like Emily Gore's standard
presentation

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.010
about the DPLA hub's network,
building on ramps for the country.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.840
We think it's a brilliant
plan DPLA's come up with,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.650
a distributed network that
leverages the work that's been done

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.710 position:56%
around the country by different
collaboratives, different consortia,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.200
and different individual
institutions.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.520
DPLA's well known diagram about
how its hub network works shows

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.140
that it has the yellow content
hubs coming directly into DPLA

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.040
and the orange service hubs.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.330
And we're talking today about the
challenges of the service hubs,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.750
those groups that serve other
cultural heritage institutions

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.470 position:56%
in aggregating and bringing in
content so that we represent regions

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.260 position:56%
or states around the country in
sharing our materials with the DPLA.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.300
So it's a very strong network.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.290
It's been able to be very
successful, and I think I'm behind

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.840
about five or six states
here, judging from the one,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.140
the slide that Dan Cohen [assumed
spelling] showed this morning,

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.500
so I know we should be adding
Michigan and Illinois and Wisconsin

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.250
and Pennsylvania to this map.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.800
So congratulations to all

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.990
of you who've been
working on different hubs.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.020
And congratulations
especially to Emily Gore

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.940
as this map gets filled out.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.240
And we're looking forward

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.230
to it being completed
all around the country.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.530
Thanks so much.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.180
Yeah. So we've seen the success

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.550
of many different organizations
around the country.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.730
You'll recognize many of your
friends and colleagues here

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.550 position:56%
in the room and throughout DPLA Fest
from these different organizations.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.390
I've been very pleased to work as
part of the initial set with folks

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.750
from Minnesota and South
Carolina and Georgia and Kentucky,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.850 position:56%
etc. And it's been delightful to
see new ones coming on board and get

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.360
to meet the New York folks in the
last couple of years, for example.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.410
Some fantastic groups.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.790
And these hubs share a
lot of common strengths.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.490
And Emily's been very
wise to take advantage

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.860
of those common strengths
in contributing to DPLA.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.520 position:56%
Many of them are state based
collaboratives, state based funding,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.360 position:56%
and state based resources seem
natural to a lot of different groups

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.060
in reaching out to each
other to work together.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.510 position:56%
Some of them, many of them, are
centrally funded by some combination

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.830
of one or more of these, some LSTA
grants have helped some different

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.010
hubs to get going either
initially or an ongoing basis.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.840
State legislative funds can
come into the picture for those

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.310
who are creative enough to
tap into that kind of support.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.160
And then many major
universities play a chief role.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.110
And from our perspective
in the West,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.560
these are mostly relatively
resource rich states

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.970
that have been successful in coming
on board with larger populations

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.790
in the East, for example.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.920 position:56%
The opportunity to tap into at
least some wealthy cultural heritage

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.540 position:56%
institutions and the ability to work

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.260
with historically quite rich
collaborations and consortia

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.680
who have built up over the years.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.140
This is all contributing
to DPLA's great success,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.290
a wonderful distributed network,
leveraging all the strengths

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.270
of our existing and new
collaborations around the country,

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.580
bringing in libraries, archives,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.510
and museums from every
corner of the country.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.510
Now Jodi is going to
talk to you a little bit

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.780 position:56%
about the Western landscape and how
we're seeing some differences there.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.080
Jodi?

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.440
&gt;&gt; Jodi Allison Bunnell:
Thanks, Sandra.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.420
So I'll follow, as Sandra said,
her introduction to offer a summary

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.730
of the Western landscape
that, it's our intention

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.930
that contrasts a little bit
with what we've seen so far.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.100
We see some strong differences in
geography, culture, and resources.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.400
So geography.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.440
We hear a lot about the
vast spaces of the West.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.810
Even though I work in Oregon,
I am physically located

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.460
in Montana, so Big Sky, right?

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.590
But let's quantify exactly what
that means for each of our groups.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.650 position:56%
Here's the oops well, that is right.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.700
Here's the geographic coverage
of the Orbis Cascade Alliance,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.540
Washington, Oregon, and
a tiny bit of Idaho.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.760 position:56%
So if we drove from our southernmost
member, Oregon Institute

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.620
of Technology, to our
northernmost member,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.210
Western Washington
University, that's 540 miles.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.050
Add a trip to the east
to visit the University

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.290
of Idaho, and that's another 480.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.790
Mountain West Digital Library,
including Utah and Nevada,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.790
southern Idaho, a little
bit of Wyoming.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.760
So if you start in Boise,
Idaho, and drive to Las Vegas,

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.160
Nevada, you've got 630 miles.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.360
You visit the easternmost
partner in Cody, Wyoming,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.520
that's another 400 miles.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.600
And for California Digital Library,
I'm using a slightly different map.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.230
This is the coverage map of the
online archive of California,

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.280
but it's a pretty good
map of the state

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.650
and the cultural heritage
institutions.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.140
So I drive from Eureka to
San Diego is 765 miles.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:14.690
Long distances, of course,
can be overcome by flying

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.500
if you have an airport nearby.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.780
Depending on where you are
in California or Washington,

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.080
you're going to do all right.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.790
There's actually a pretty
good number of major airports.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.220
But Utah and Nevada have
four primary airports.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.050
You're still going to drive.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.170
Whether you're driving or flying,
we have a lot of mountains and,

00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.350
therefore, mountain passes.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.710
The difficulty of winter travel is
very much a factor if you're going

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.880
to go anywhere in the West.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.430
If you're working with
small heritage organizations

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.740
that may have a number of
staff or volunteers over 50,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.240
you'll quickly find that those
mountain passes are a huge barrier.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.200
If you're going to have an
in person meeting or deliver

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.310
in person training, you have
six months a year to do it.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.610
Second, culture.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.950
So we've got a number of things

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.840
that we would argue are
special to the West.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.800
And you can argue up against these
in the Q and A if you want to.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.370
So we've got a big divide
between urban and rural areas.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.520
And we know it has a potent
effect on western politics.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.070
We see this in the composition of
our legislatures, for instance.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.820
We have some really big differences
between the sectors of libraries,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.010
archives, museums,
historical societies,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.140
with their own distinct crowds
and professional meetings.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.100
We have a lot of tribal
organizations,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.460 position:56%
a whole lot of tribal organizations,

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:35.600
with active cultural
heritage programs.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.690
And there are some big
complications there

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.660
that are a presentation
in themselves.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.080
Closely related, there are a number
of events in either the distance

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.240
or the recent past on which there
are really many perspectives

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.050
and a great sensitivity about how
those perspectives are handled.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.030
And up last, the place of
religious organizations

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.670
in the history of the West.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.090
One of my board members recently
commented in the northwest,

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.570
at least, we're practical utopians.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:07.340
And, good heavens, what
am I doing with my slides?

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.160
Okay. Last, resources.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.740
LSTA allocations, as we've heard,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.520
have been a big source
of DPLA hub's funding.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.490
LSTA is distributed
with a base amount

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.540
of $680,000 per state plus
an additional amount based

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.840
on population.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.790
So that means that the less
populous Western states are

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.760
at a distinct disadvantage.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.530
If we use the first letters of
states as a highly scientific way

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.730
of comparing across states, we
see big differences east to west.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:41.410
Picture delivering services across
vast distances in Wyoming with less

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.610
than the funds allotted to tiny
West Virginia, for example.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.250
This is real.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.510
For a number of reasons, our LSTA
priorities at state libraries tend

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.410
to be really focused on very
basic public library needs

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:58.400
like internet access and
multilingual services or services

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.360
to populations that have
no library access at all.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.190
Just as we are dealing with very
basic needs for library services,

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.630
we're dealing with very basic needs
for cultural heritage institutions.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.680
There are places that
don't have a phone,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.590
that close down their building
seasonally without a heat source.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.800
It's hard to redirect such
small resources in the face

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.270
of these types of priorities.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.950
Sorry. I keep going backwards.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.320
Overall, higher education
support is lower

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.630
in many Western states
than it is in the East.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.830
This graph of higher ed support per
capita by state shows that nicely.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.290
Here are Oregon and Washington
in the lower quartile,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.460
with Colorado second
from the bottom.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.060
Utah, Idaho, and Arizona
are in the second tier.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.220
We'll ignore Wyoming with its
highest per capita spending.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.620 position:56%
That's, of course, tied to the
state's vast coal and oil resources.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.620 position:56%
For other examples, the Oregon
University system is now independent

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.140
of state oversight, since it is
also independent of state funding.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.180
And in early 2016 the University of
Montana announced, in my home town,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.400
that it was laying off
205 FTE staff and faculty,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.160
one fifth of its workforce.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.610
In this environment you don't
see a state university stepping

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.490
up to take care of
everyone's digitization needs.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.940
The resources to support the
public good are not there.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.160
They're focused on direct
support for students and faculty.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.370
What this adds up to is a great
need for cross state collaboration.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.030
We don't have enough
population and resources

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.330
to support a merely a
state level collaboration.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.980
We make a lot out of state
borders, but part of what we find

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.540
in cross state work is they're
really not that meaningful.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:40.820
Cross state collaboration also
means a lot more complexity.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:47.220
The great thing about this is
because, to varying extents,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.800
our participating or member
institutions provide our funding,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.130
and that means we don't
have the option

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.770
to make highly centralized
decisions or ones

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.160
that could be termed as by fiat.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.980
We need to listen to our
members or partners very closely

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.380
because they are the ones
who provide the funding.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.460
This is a situation
that demands strong

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:10.270
and consultative and
involved governance.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.230
We can't get away with
anything else.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.980
And this is just a summary of where
our three organizations are funded.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.380
And as you see, there are
differences between us,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.580
a range of member or contributed
funding versus central funding.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.440
The Orbis Cascade Alliance,
my organization,

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.590
receives no central
funding whatsoever.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:30.570
California Digital Library is a
different piece of the spectrum.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.970
So that's the summary of
the Western landscape.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.220
Vast spaces, topographic
variation, a diverse

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.570
and divided population,
and few resources.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.000
All these things mean
that if we're going

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.530
to get anything interesting done,

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.000
we have to create more
complex organizations

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.540
that cross state borders, rely
on more complex funding models,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.300
and that we have to have
really consultative governance

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.600
to be successful.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.990
So I'll move from that.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.860
I'll be the first of the three case
studies our three organizations.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.060
So moving into a quick overview
of the Orbis Cascade Alliance.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.910
Again, here's our geographic
coverage, Washington,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.440
Oregon, and a tiny bit of Idaho.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.700
We're composed of 39
academic libraries.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.860
Here's the facades of 37 of the 39.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:17.850
And our members represent
anything from the small two years

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.470
to the largest universities
in the region.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.910
This graph represents the variation
in FTE across institutions.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.220 position:56%
We have a broad set of core services

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.560
that were built over
the last 21 years.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.920
You see everything from our shared
ILS, physical delivery of things,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:41.190
Archives West, one of the things
that I support, a vast student FTE,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:46.120
the largest, I believe, hosted
aggregation of EAD finding aids

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.540
in the United States, and
a whole lot of databases.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.090
We're headquartered
in Eugene, Oregon.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.550
Our executive director, John
Helmer, likes to use this

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.660
as the picture of the staff.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.480
This is the real picture
of the staff.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.780
There are ten of us.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.310
Now, how do we do all
this work with ten people?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:10.950
I mentioned earlier a
$16.8 million budget.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.590
The thing to understand is
that 11 point, excuse me,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.260
I can't see my notes, $11.8 million
of that is electronic resources,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.290
purchases, and that really all

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.590
but a million is passed
through to vendors.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.880
So this is really how
we get things done.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.140
This is our collaborative
workforce model.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.930
It's composed of the
work that everyone does,

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.450
that a few do for all, known as W2,
and then this little teeny slice,

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.910
see this little teeny slice at
the top of the wedding cake?

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.900
That's the ten of us.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.550 position:56%
That's what is, what few do for all.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.470 position:56%
Some things about how we track that.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.900
So we pay that top little teeny
slice through the consortium.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:16:01.320
Oops. So, so like a good old
coop, we expect our members

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.450
to contribute not only money but
a considerable amount of time.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.770
So that happens, again,
in our W2 space.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.240 position:56%
Now we've always done it this way,
but we have a new level of formality

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.800
about this under our
new strategic agenda.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.930
Another part of this work inherent

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.670
in this model is a great
deal of trust in one another.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:21.470
We have all of the policies and
frameworks that we need to have

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:26.350
in place, but we also have strong
relationships with one another.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.510
We know one another, and we have to
in order to make this all happen.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.910 position:56%
Digital content aggregation was
just approved a month ago by council

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:39.630
as a new offering of our content
creation and dissemination program,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:41.970
which, again, is our
unique materials program.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.080
It will be supported by all
members, and we'll move forward

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.370
with aggregation using our brand
new Dublin Core metadata standards

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.670
next year.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.880
Getting to yes on this
was a big deal.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.200
Depending on how you look at it,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.880
it was either a two year
or a nine year process.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.420
I've been there for
the whole nine years.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.300
There are a lot of factors that go
into that, but one of these speaks

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.680
to the fundamental
character of the alliance.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.910
We decide to do new
things selectively,

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.780
really only when we can be
sure that everyone is committed

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.650
and confident in the initiative.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.600
That means a process to bring
a diverse set of institutions

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.540
to a shared understanding,
which takes some time.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.560
We never worked together
in this arena before.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.270
In the late 1990s and 2000s
when many consortia dove

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.880
into centralized digital
asset management systems,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.180
the alliance didn't.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.220
So while we have a strong
and growing tradition

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.920
of working together
on many other things

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.670
around our purchase content,
this area is really new.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:37.830
Here's a schematic of how
our aggregation will work.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.840
We use an existing harvester
that feeds into our EAD database.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.290
It, that will collect OAI sets.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.560
We'll be extending it so
that it becomes multipurpose.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.840
We'll feed into three
presentation spaces, Archives West,

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.190
as it's relevant, our
Primo Presentation

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.810
on our shared ILS, and DPLA.

00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.970
As part of our approved digital
content aggregation for next year,

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.930
we'll apply to become a DPLA hub.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.730
After some dialogue with the
DPLA staff, we're proceeding

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.710
with the understanding that
we'll initially be a hub just

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:09.590
for alliance members and commit
to a specific point not too far

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.160
in the future when we'll consider
service to non alliance members.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.530
We're well prepared to do
that with no central funding

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.720
and other programs,
including our EAD program,

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.220 position:56%
that serve non alliance members,
we've been making reasonable budgets

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.280
and transparent cost distribution
schemes for many years.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.590
We have a clear model for
how we handle governance.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.600
And so how we do this
isn't a problem.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.640
So why can't we do this now?

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.350
Because our foray into
digital content aggregation

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:36.050
and moving toward hub
status is as much

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.260
as the organization
can consider right now.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.250
With a clear and consultative
governance model that involves all

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.780
of our members, this work takes
time, and it's time well invested.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.300
Here are just a few examples
of who we may be able to add

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.110
as participants in the future.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.400
Not an enormous number of
institutions but enough

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.190
to make the effort worthwhile.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.710
One of these, however,
and which you see

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.650
in the lower right hand
corner, is a catch all.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.230
One of our most exciting
potential partners

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:04.410 position:56%
with whom we're already coordinating
metadata cleanup this year is

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.990 position:56%
Washington Rural Heritage, a program
of the Washington State Library

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.750
that provides digitization
and hosting

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.770
for many small institutions
without Washington.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.090
So if I expanded the
map I already did.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.190
See, you see many other
institutions.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.030
So the building blocks are there

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.980
for a comprehensive
region wide service hub.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.350
Last, we have some
challenges ahead of us.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.110
With no previous tradition
of working together,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:29.910
we know we'll be challenged
to begin the work

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.440 position:56%
on metadata cleanup and aggregation.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.380
As the New York folks talked about,

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.690
original formats, I
thought, ah, yes.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.990
Original formats.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.560
That will be fun.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.170
Because of the way we've set
up Primo in our shared ILS,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.180 position:56%
the presentation of digital
objects in Primo will take some work

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.390 position:56%
on our part and on Ex Libris's part.

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.460
Of course, taking the next
steps on the service hub,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.740
participating in a national
conversation on the future of DPLA

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.220
and how it supports
teaching and research,

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.050
will be challenges
that we all share.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:02.900
We're looking forward to
continuing to being part of that.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.970
And now I'll hand off to Adrian.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.270
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: All right.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:17.860
So I'm going to talk about some
planning work that's actively

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.710
underway within California to
basically define a vision for

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.380
and develop a blueprint for
a service hub for the state,

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.550
basically a collaborative
service hub.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.040
And the working title for
this thing a called CalDiSH,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.200
California DPLA service hub.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.480
So there's a lot of food
photos and stuff in here.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.220
Either it will make you hungry for
lunch or it'll turn your stomach.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.280
So in this map, I think,
is also out of date here,

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.090
but before I get going, you
know, I want to first kind

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:49.970
of paint a picture of, like,
a mile high view of kind

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:51.660
of what's happening in
California right now.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:56.580 position:56%
So within the California state we
basically have a number of services,

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.340
or, sorry, content hubs that
were established early on

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.120
or have recently come on board.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.850
So we've got a lot of
content hub representation.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.990
USC, University of Southern
California was, I think,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.400
one of the first contributing
its own collections.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:12.230 position:56%
It's also taking partner collections
and then passing that on to DPLA.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.860
The Getty Research Institute
is another content hub.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.740
I think it's primarily
just Getty stuff.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.810
The California Digital Library,
we came on board as a content hub,

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.310
what, a year and a
half ago or something.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.960
We're passing on about, I
don't know, 400,000 objects

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.520
up to 480,000 objects now from
about 160 libraries, archives,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.120
and museums in California,
passing that on to DPLA.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.370 position:56%
So we're kind of a weird content hub

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.150
in that we're aggregating
stuff and passing it forward.

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:45.080
And we also have a couple of other
content hubs that are kind of,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.710
well, one is internet archive.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.010
Kind of a macro hub.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:49.880
So, as you know, they're
pulling in stuff from, you know,

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.570
throughout the states and passing
it on to DPLA, and then, of course,

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:56.990
David Rumsey map collection
based in San Francisco.

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.700 position:56%
So we have a number of content hubs,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:02.490
but we don't really have any
service hub in the states.

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.760
So, of course, that's
what we're planning for.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.180
We do, though, have a number of,
and historically we've had a number

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.510
of organizations in the state
that provide some services,

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.220
some degree of services
for libraries, archives,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.550
and museums in California.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:19.180
But the coverage isn't really
comprehensive, and it's kind of,

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.700
you know, they have different
audiences and different kind

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.110
of memberships that they serve.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.150
And they also have different
kind of service emphases.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.530
So I won't go into detail into
all of them, but, you know,

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.000
some are membership
organizations like Califa

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.890
or the Statewide California
Electronic Library Consortium.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.180
And they're doing things like
brokering licenses for, like,

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.300
ebooks and journals for, you
know, for public libraries.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.470
In the case of SCELC it's
primarily academic libraries.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.890
They're doing things
like hosting CONTENTdm.

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:49.700
We have other organizations like
Infopeople that provide training.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.310
It's kind of like Amigos
maybe, you know,

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:57.150
outside of the California region.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.850
We have, you know, a number of
cooperative library systems.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.090
Then we have organizations like the
California Preservation Program,

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.800
which gets LSTA funding to provide
basically preservation training.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.320
They're also doing a lot
of digitization support

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.260
for audio visual collections
right now

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.720
for organizations throughout
the state.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.200
And then we have some
larger public libraries

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.460 position:56%
like San Francisco Public Library
and Los Angeles Public Library that,

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.780
you know, could be really well
positioned to be able, maybe,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.630
to provide things like digitization
services within their local area.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.860
But right now, you know,
none of this stuff,

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.550
these activities are really
coordinated in any way.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.970 position:56%
So, I mean, I think the good news
is it's clear we have a pretty large

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:39.820
cast of characters
that could, you know,

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.570
maybe stitch together services
to, you know, form a service hub.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.860
But there's not really one single
entity out here that, you know,

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.710
could do the whole, you
know, the whole thing.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:54.220 position:56%
So, and I think that situation might
be pretty close to other states.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.780
You know, there's challenges
that we've had.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.270
We don't really, again,
we don't really have a

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.570
statewide infrastructure.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.070
I think the New York model we heard
earlier this morning hopefully many

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.370
of you were there.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:07.270
I mean, that's kind of a nice
model in that there's this kind of,

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:11.410
you know, regional kind of
mini hubs within the state.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.200
And we don't really
have that in California.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.360
So we have a lot of organizations

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.920
that have done a lot
of digitization.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.090
There's places like Los
Angeles County Public Library,

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:24.390
for example, massive collections.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.300
The Huntington Library, for
example, a research library

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.600
with massive collections.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.650
So, you know, these collections
are available to upload online,

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.080
but they're not really
available at the network level.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.080
So, you know, there's
challenges there.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.120
I think the opportunities
are really, again,

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.700
that we have multiple organizations
that, what we're really trying

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.210
to do is kind of form a
collaboration, you know,

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.540
a cooperative of the
willing to try to, you know,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.400
basically stitch our
services together

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.180
and basically provide a
comprehensive set of services

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.380
for libraries, archives,
and museums in the state.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.830
I think we've also really
benefited from the Library Services

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:00.480
and Technology Act
funding that's administered

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.490
through the California
State Library,

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.790
which has been really supportive

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:07.110
of digitization efforts
throughout the state.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.730
So they've supported us,
they've supported, you know,

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.380
a lot of the organizations
that have, you know,

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.350
that I've mentioned earlier.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:22.360
So, and I think the other
opportunity here, as I mentioned,

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.570
I mean, we do have a large
number of digital collections

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.340
that are available, you
know, through local sites,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.830
local CONTENTdm instances,
past perfect instances.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.560 position:56%
I mean, these systems run the gamut.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.980
They're just not aggregated or
available through DPLA right now,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.370
but, I mean, I think we see this
stuff is, like, low hanging fruit.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.170
If we could, you know, just harvest
this stuff, bring it together,

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.670
you know, we could
really make some inroads

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.800
into bringing these
California collections together

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.030
and making them available
at both the statewide

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.440
as well the national level.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.850
So over the past year we've,
maybe past couple of years,

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:56.000
we've had some informal and maybe
more formal planning discussions

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.970
with a number of the
stakeholders that I've mentioned.

00:25:57.970 --> 00:25:59.340
It's not just CDL.

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.800
It's all the organizations that I
was referencing earlier and more.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.490 position:56%
We've had some planning discussions,

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.840
and we've had more
planning discussions.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.770
And I think it was last year,
last summer, we convened a meeting

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:15.830
at the San Francisco
Public Library hosted it,

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.760
and we basically articulated
kind of a collective vision

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.260
for this collaborative service hub.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:23.560
Basically, what happened
at that point,

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.440
is an organization Califa
I mentioned earlier,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.090
spearheaded an LSTA grant proposal,
put it into LSTA, and, boom,

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.990
we got some funding to really,
like, move this thing forward.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.260
So, again, here's LSTA
really helping out.

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:40.920
So there's a steering
committee that's been formed.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.140
And, in fact, some of our steering
committee members are here.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.900
So Luis Herrera at the San
Francisco Public Library back here.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.840
Do we have Matt Gainer?

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.140
Matt's not here.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.440
Okay.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.740
&gt;&gt; His boss is here.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.660
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: Matt's boss
is here, so you can feel free

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.380
to contact us or talk to us,
you know, during the break

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.970
or after about, kind
of, what's going on.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.760
But I just wanted to point out
there's a number of folks here.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.040
We have Robin Chandler back
in the, on the couch there.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.470
That's also helping out in
terms of this CalDiSH planning.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.240
But basically I just wanted to
kind of get our vision up here.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.140
I mean, this is kind
of the initial vision.

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.840
You know, get stuff up online.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.100
You know, make California
Collections as widely discoverable

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.550
as possible through statewide
networks like something

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.780
like Calisphere as well
as, you know, maybe other,

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.100
other regional sites
that are maintained,

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.400
and then also through DPLA.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.700
We want to do this together.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.880
We want to do it in
a sustainable way.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.100
So what we're envisioning is that
there's basically a whole kind

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.180
of suite of ingredients that we'd
provide as far as the services.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.240
Okay. So kind of see them here,
but basically soup to nuts.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.640
So consultation, training, you
know, providing DAMS hosting,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.860
metadata services,
that's the vision.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.890
We're anticipating that
there's going to be some stuff

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.030
that would happen maybe regionally
like onsite digitization support,

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:58.360
this whole "scanebago" [phonetic]
idea we're kicking around.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.470
And then there might be
centralized services.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.160
So like a preservation service.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.460
Maybe an organization like USC
would be really well situated

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.760
to provide that.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.210
And we're also seeing
basically a couple of ways

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.610
that these services
might be bundled.

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.630
So we're imagining kind
of an a la carte approach.

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.290
So there's organizations
like the Huntington

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:19.480
that have a pretty good program,
you know, and they, they,

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.830
they're building digital
collections.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.360
So, you know, what they might want
is basically, like, preservation

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.390
or just the on ramp to DPLA.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:26.690
So they might pick and choose.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.680 position:56%
And then we'll have kind of a
prefix kind of option for, you know,

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.590
organizations that don't
have a lot of capacity,

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.190
don't really have staffing to
get, you know, digitization done.

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.210
We want to design some services to
really, you know, give them kind

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.980
of a soup to nuts solution.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.740
So we've had a lot of
stakeholder meetings.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.030
I think probably dropping
the numbers here,

00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.950
but all of these organizations
probably represent

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:50.660
over 900 libraries, archives, and
museums because they're, in turn,

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.170
working with different
organizations.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.230
So we've really done a lot of
kind of information gathering

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:59.990
to basically validate this
vision and this approach.

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:04.030
Where we're at right now is we're
working on a strawman proposal.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.470
The idea is to get that into
more of like a blueprint

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.850
for actually how this
thing will work.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.560
We're starting to do
some business modelling.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.220
So I think we've been reaching out
to some of the hubs in formation

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.660
to find out what kind of business
models that you've been developing

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.980
as well as existing hubs.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.200
We need to define an organizational
home for this thing to get it up

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.960
and going as soon as we have this
kind of business model together.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.720
And I think our next step is really
to get some pilot initiatives going

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.860
so we can actually, you know,
get some action and move forward.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.340
So I think that's it.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.690
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Okay.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.410
So the Mountain West
Digital Library was one

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.350
of the first six service
hubs in the DPLA.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.420
We're really proud of the work that
we've done together and pleased

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.450
to be able to continue
to offer resources.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.850
We've, we ourselves are
a distributed network,

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.470
as many other hubs are.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:58.030
So we work with 19 different
repositories around the region,

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.840
each of whom or many of
whom host collections

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.220
from other collections
partners, and then we aggregate

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:08.270
into an Ex Libris server
and serve that to DPLA.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.570
You've seen this map earlier.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.810
Remember, repositories are
scattered around the West.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.200
We anticipate, by the way, that
some of these states will spin off

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.340
at some point and become their own
service hub independently of us.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.330
But we've been eager to help
out Emily as she's building

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.610 position:56%
out the network in the West by
providing repositories who are ready

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:29.360
to go with an access to
the on ramp to the DPLA.

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.190
Our core strengths in Utah
and Nevada and some of Idaho.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.670
We have a wonderful
new partner in Wyoming.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.440
But I suspect some of the
Colorado folks will work eventually

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.740
with the Wyoming people,

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:44.700
etc. We have collection
partners in six states currently.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.240
This isn't quite updated,

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.100
but we have over 190
different partners currently.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:55.000 position:56%
We have a portal, so we do try to
serve up a region portal for access,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.480
and it's very popular with
many of our users, historians,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.050
and genealogists among them.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:05.890
And maintaining this in Ex Libris
Primo also takes some effort

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.750
from our staff.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:11.790
We have over a million items
in 825 different collections,

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:15.600
a wide variety of resources, and
we really enjoy coming together

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.080
and bridging that gap as was
done here over 150 years ago.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.890
And we knit it all together through
our interoperability standards.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.520
We love sharing those with
other people, if you're looking

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.310
to get going on some
metadata standards

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.730
for your hub, your
hub and formation.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.030
Let us know.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:36.310
We can give you some advice
about what worked for us.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.720
We have a combination of
metadata kinds of standards,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.450
and our recent best practices
for geospatial metadata creation,

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:44.760
which we're really proud of.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:48.550
We worked closely with Gretchen
Gueguen at DPLA to make sure

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.540
that those would be in line
with DPLA's harvest mechanism.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.820
Our task forces are a big part of
how we operate around the region,

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.160
knitting people together
through virtual meetings,

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.170
task forces year round,
and that helps us

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:05.230
to keep this strong standards based
way of working together going.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:07.420
We've also worked on standard
pricing, and I'll be talking

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.500
about this in another
presentation here at the fest.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.270 position:56%
Our funding began with a combination

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:19.230
of Utah Academic Library Consortium
funding in Utah, and then we were,

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:20.920
have also been assisted
by the University

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.260
of Utah's Marriott Library,

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.000
which has given us a
lot of in kind services.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.580
And, of course, the wonderful
generosity of the DPLA

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.170
in including us in some of those
early digital hubs pilot project

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:34.390
grants made a big difference to
us in our growth and being able

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.220
to reach out to others
around the region.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.900
Our exciting news is about our
long term sustainability program.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.420
I'm very pleased that as part
of the DPLA funding we were able

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.200
to convene an MWDL advisory
committee for six months.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.230
We had digital leaders, 19 digital
leaders from six states to come

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:55.320
up with the recommendations
report after staring really hard

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.440
across the table at each
other about how we were going

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.640
to sustain these functions,
these features, through the MWDL.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:06.190 position:56%
And as a result of that, we put into
place, and it's been very successful

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:10.360
so far, our first membership
program starting this fiscal year.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.020
It's just asking for dues from
the harvested repositories,

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:18.620
those 19 larger institutions that
can afford to maintain a CONTENTdm,

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.710
a DSpace, an ArchivalWare, bepress,
etc. We don't charge directly

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:27.200
to the smaller collections partners
that are supported; however,

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.060
those groups do pay through
their digitization fees,

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.550
they pay to those different
repositories.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.300
We've had good success so far.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.760
We continue to pan for more gold.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.180
As a part of that, is we included
more people in our funding mix.

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.850
We have also turned around and
said we want you more involved

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.720
in governance, and many of
them have really wanted that.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.250
So we're now setting up
our first governing board

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:56.720
with this distribution of different
groups represented on the board.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.390
We also have a very active
digitization committee

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.350 position:56%
which meets as a whole twice a year.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.940
And then the small working
groups, the task forces

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.440
and interest groups work year
round virtually and report

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.870
at those digitization
committee meetings.

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.400
And then we're pleased to
receive faculty support

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.640
at the University of Utah.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.700
Some of the member questions
that we have are how to rightsize

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:23.430
that ungainly kind of lopsided
amoeba looking geographical region

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:24.730
that we serve.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.680
And as new service hubs
emerge around the region,

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.370
we certainly expect that
that mix will change.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.580 position:56%
We want to continue to be responsive
to what DPLA needs in terms

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.270
of bringing new groups
in the West into DPLA.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:41.470 position:56%
But we also want to encourage state
based and other based collaboratives

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:45.230
that are forming to do their
thing and to serve their states

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.600
and regions really effectively.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.390
We have some questions about how

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:51.770
to maintain direct services
in our new funding mix.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.680
For new collection partners we used
to fund some centralized training.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.740 position:56%
We current have no funding for that.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.530
So how are we going to manage that?

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.550
And then how are we going
to manage additional funding

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.740
for other efforts in the future?

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.000
So wrapping us up will be Adrian
talking about a couple of questions

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.870
about bringing the
West to the region.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.740
And with our remaining few
minutes we want to open

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:19.530
up the floor for discussion.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.140
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: So,
again, out of date map here,

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:25.970
but we tried to do some
shading in to show, you know,

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.440
the activity that we talked
about on the West Coast here.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.100
And just to, you know,
basically put this forward.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.420
Maybe those question marks
aren't lining up, but, you know,

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.470
what's going on in
the rest of the West.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.360
And I think there may be
some of you in the room

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.260
who can help us answer
this question.

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.410
I wanted to point out that Texas,

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:49.330
Texas Portal History is a standing
DPLA service hub, so, you know,

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:53.350
this border may be, geography may
be a little bit arbitrary in terms

00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.920
of what we're defining as
the West, but, you know,

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.550
what's going on in Colorado,
Wyoming, New Mexico, the Dakotas,

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:05.180
Nebraska, Kansas, how can we
get service hubs or, you know,

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.560
that activity off the ground there.

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.080
So we just wanted to
conclude with a few questions.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.980
And, you know, basically if you
represent a DPLA service hub,

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.520 position:56%
do you have any advice for us as far
as overcoming some of the challenges

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:19.310
that Jodi articulated at
the beginning of the talk?

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:21.720 position:56%
And one thing I think we're all kind
of wondering about is, you know,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.020
what steps have you taken

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.730
to implement a sustainable
service model for your hub.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:29.370 position:56%
And if you're at a library or
archive or museum and you're looking

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.380
for an on ramp to DPLA,
so you're in a state

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.490 position:56%
that doesn't really have a hub, it'd
be great to hear from you, you know,

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.730
what do you perceive as some of
the biggest barriers to be able

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:40.000
to get your stuff to DPLA and
what do you think, you know,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.840
what could we be, how
could it be overcome?

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.300
And if you could let us know if
there's hub ish [phonetic] things

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.530
that are happening in your state.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.020
So, yeah. And if you
have any questions,

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.460
feel free to ask them as well, so.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:58.180
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: So we're
throwing it open for questions now

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:03.660
or answers to some of these
questions, if you have some.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.710
Yeah?

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:15.990
&gt;&gt; So I'm Mark [inaudible] the
libraries of the University

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:31.520
of North Texas, that's
the center of Texas hub.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Oh, great, Mark.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.670
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] we work
really hard in Texas to,

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:47.480
you know, do this kind of thing.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:57.740 position:56%
And we're trying to broaden it out
to other parts of Texas that are not

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:03.880
on the portal, other institution

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.790
with the [inaudible]
planning meeting.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:10.820
We just had a meeting in Austin
of the Texas Visual Library.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.650
Our directors are on it
and [inaudible] in Texas.

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.800 position:56%
And I guess I don't have any great,
you know, insights beyond the things

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:25.680
that you've already said other
than, you know, it takes a lot

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.570
of hard work and conversation
[inaudible] and, you know,

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:38.680
due diligence kind of stuff
to arrange all those things.

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.790
And also I applaud
your efforts to think

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.200
through the sustainability
in advance.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Thank you, Mark.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.890
I appreciate that.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.920
I appreciate everything
you folks are doing.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.480
Texas has got big size
problems, too,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.680
but you guys are doing a great job.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.330
And I'm glad to hear your update

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:09.740
on how things are coming
together there.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:11.040
That's great.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.340
Emily?

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:13.900
&gt;&gt; So I was going to, hub ish
activities happening in the West.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.200
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Yay.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:16.500
&gt;&gt; So Oklahoma, I don't know if
anybody is here from Oklahoma.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:17.800
If you are, awesome.

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.100
If not, [inaudible].

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.400
Oklahoma is very close to
submitting an application.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.700
We've been working for them for
over a year in conversation.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.000
And the Dakotas have
been talking very closely

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.300
with the Minnesota folks.

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:25.600
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Excellent.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.900
&gt;&gt; So I think that hopefully there
will be some activity there soon.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.200
So, and I think there's
some conversations on this,

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.500
some folks are here from Colorado.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.800
There's been some conversation
going on at the statewide rate

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.100
and other places about Colorado.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.400 position:56%
So I think there are some little
activities happening here and there.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.700
But Oklahoma, I know, is actually
about to submit an application

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.000
to be, to have [inaudible].

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.300
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre:
That's fantastic.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.600
Would the person from
Colorado right, oh, good.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.900
Lee, is that right?

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.200
Okay. Great.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.500
Oh, good. Go ahead.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.800
&gt;&gt; We are just in our initial
sort of planning [inaudible]

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.100 position:56%
of a Colorado, possibly Wyoming, hub
coming together from different parts

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.400
of the Colorado state and Wyoming.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.700
We started talking
about it [inaudible].

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.000
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre:
That's wonderful.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.300
Fantastic.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.600
Best of luck to you on that.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.900
Good. Other comments?

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.200
Yeah.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.500
&gt;&gt; So the sustainability plan.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.800
What is that going to fund?

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.100
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: So our
central staff you're talking

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.400
about for the Mountain
West Digital Library?

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.700
It will help fund our
core staff of 2.75 FTE,

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.000
our share of the aggregator annual
fee, which comes to about $15,000,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.300
and then just minor things
like some contribution to some

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.490 position:56%
of our really distant partners to
offset their travel to our meetings,

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.410
our own professional development
travel, things like that.

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:16.350
Yeah, the bulk of our
budget is in staffing costs

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.280
and then some technology costs.

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.230
And then we're also
obligated to start working

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:24.040
to reimburse our host
institution, the University

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.310
of Utah Marriott Library, for
many of the in kind services

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.420
that are provided for
technology, financial management,

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.190 position:56%
human resources, etc. So we're going

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.440
to be creating a cost center
starting in the next fiscal year

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.730
to phase in reimbursement
for that support.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:43.690
&gt;&gt; Could you share the
membership fees right now?

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:44.990
&gt;&gt; Sandy McIntyre: Sure.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.290
Sure. No. That's fine.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.590
I'm happy to say right now.

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:48.890
We started out with a discount.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:51.190
Join now before it's
too late and it goes up.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:55.020
So we started out with
yeah so we started

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.280
out with $5,000 per repository.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:58.930
And we decided to do
it as a flat rate.

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.320
So it doesn't matter
what size repository

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.520
or how many collection partners
are supported on that repository.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.010
It's a flat $5,000
for the first year,

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.250
and then it goes up $7,500 a year.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.900
So we're about to send out
our second round of invoices,

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.460 position:56%
and we'll see how many people renew.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.040 position:56%
We have pretty good support, though.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.390
We did have a large
majority, a supermajority

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.690
of people to come on board.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:26.290
We did lose a few repositories
either because they couldn't,

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.620
in the short term, request
the funding quickly enough.

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.730
We gave them about, only about six
months, and some organizations,

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.960
state based organizations
particularly need a lot longer

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.500
on their budget cycle.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.670
Or because they are, as
Jodi was pointing out,

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.130
not resource rich enough
to be able to sustain it.

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:48.860 position:56%
So we hope to get to the point where
we could offer sort of a scholarship

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.450
or an offset to some smaller
organizations, but I don't know

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.750
that we will be able to do

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.620
that because we're pretty
cut to the bone as it is.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:56.920
Yeah.

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.560
&gt;&gt; Do you guys also
charge setup fees?

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:00.860
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: We do.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:03.610
We have a one time setup fee,
acknowledging that much of the work

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.670
from our staff is involved in
setting up that aggregation

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.560
in the first place,
making the mapping work,

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.150
checking the metadata really
thoroughly, going back

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:13.670
and forth multiple times
typically over a couple

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:16.200
of months, to get that going.

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.500
Yeah.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.040
&gt;&gt; Jodi Allison Bunnell:
She had a question.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.340
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Oh, there.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:21.640
Thanks.

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:28.140
&gt;&gt; Like, so you're only, so it's
only 19 institutions right now

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.740
that are paying your fee?

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:33.040
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: That's correct.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.550
The smaller institutions
that are supported

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:39.410 position:56%
on those repositories don't pay
Mountain West Digital Library a fee;

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:43.800
however, on a project by
project digitization basis,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.700
they have to pay the
digitization center

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:50.960
for the digitization processing.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.260
Yeah. Which typically they get from

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:58.890
&gt;&gt; If an individual
institution is hosting now,

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.970
they pay the same $5,000?

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.270
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Right.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.570
And I think what we came down to

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.450
around that difficult
discussion table

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.110
when our different partners were
saying how are we going to do this

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.800
and everybody was pointing to
somebody else and saying, well,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:17.380
your rich university can do it, or
your state agency ought to do it,

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.970
or, well, why has nobody got
the legislature in hand yet.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.610
You know, that kind of discussion.

00:43:22.610 --> 00:43:28.190
What we came down to was that if
the organization's large enough

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.320
to support, financially sound
enough to support a repository,

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.100 position:56%
they're probably going to be one of
the more sound institutions fiscally

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.950
to be able to help
support this effort.

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.250
Yeah.

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.550
&gt;&gt; One more question.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.850
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Sure.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:47.870
&gt;&gt; So what you said, what you also
said was, some of you recognize

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:54.080
that some of your states may go
out and set up their own hubs.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.190
How many states are you
supporting right now?

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.880
Arizona, Montana?

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: So we
currently have records from Arizona,

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.420 position:56%
but no one in Arizona has joined us.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.700
So I think they'll
probably do their own thing.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:15.610
But I anticipate we'll be retaining
the 19 in Utah, Nevada, Idaho,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:21.810 position:56%
Montana, one in Wyoming, and one in,
two, I guess, actually, in Oregon.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:24.990
But I think there are obvious
places for different groups

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:28.120
to have their loyalties
and alliances over time

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:29.420
to build with other groups.

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.720
Yeah. Yes.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.970
&gt;&gt; As a service hub, what
are your obligations to DPLA?

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.560
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Do one of
you guys want to take that?

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.490
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: Maybe Emily
can lay down the law here.

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.790
&gt;&gt; Jodi Allison Bunnell:

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.690
Let somebody who signed
the agreement answer that.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:48.290
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: Do
you want to go ahead?

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:50.130
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre:
I can take a stab.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.430
Yeah. Do you want to?

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.350
Okay. Well, I mean, I'll start
and you can than correct me.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:45:00.520
To talk to our hubs about data
use and how to share metadata

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:03.380
with the DPLA, that
metadata we don't consider

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:07.890
to have copyright status, but to
the extent that anyone is mistaken

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:11.110
about that and thinks that
it does, they're agreeing

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:14.880
to assign a creative commons
zero license to the metadata.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.250
And then to work hard to assign
all of the required fields

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:21.200
that DPLA has, which actually
are very few that are required,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.710
but there are many
that are recommended.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.560
And for good discoverability,
we really encourage our partners

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.490
to fill that, that complete map out

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:31.550
and to assign good
rights statements.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.780
And that's something that's
such an evolving area.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:38.110
I know in Mountain West Digital
Library we have a huge variety

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:42.150
of junky rights statements and a
long way to go to correct them.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.050
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: I mean,
there's also a formal agreement,

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:47.110
I think it's online, so you
can see kind of the content hub

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:49.430
or service hub, what your
obligations are to DPLA.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.770
I mean, there's, you know, you
know, being able to, responsiveness

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:54.650
and timely manner, you know, if
there's, like, take down stuff

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.420 position:56%
that we need to negotiate with DPLA.

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:59.360
I mean, there's a whole,
you know, agreement.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.100
So, you know.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.520
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: And then
to pass on what we've learned.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.740
I mean, if you become
a hub of the DPLA,

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:07.920
you'll want to share the
good news with others

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.610 position:56%
and help them to come on board, too.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:10.910
Yes, Mark.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:12.210
&gt;&gt; Just a thought.

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.020 position:56%
Would it be useful to have a webinar
with prospective members on the list

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:18.230
and talk through some
of these things?

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:19.530
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: Yeah,
I was thinking that.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:21.970
I mean, we have a, there's an all
hubs list for established hubs,

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:26.200
right, but I think that's kind
of like the nascent hubs form.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.660
We kind of need something like that

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.020
because I think we're all maybe
doing kind of back and forth,

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:31.760
you know, contacting
different, what, you know,

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.510
we just finally reached out to the
Ohio folks that are doing stuff.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:38.540
You know, and, so there's a lot
of activity that's happening.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.880 position:56%
We don't have to reinvent the wheel.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.700
So, but, yeah, I agree.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.640
If there's some webinar, you
know, that we can, you know,

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.520
informally try to host
something or, yeah, but, yeah.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.910
I agree. It would be
nice to have a little.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:51.210
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Mark, do
you want to kick that idea

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:53.140
around a little bit
with some of this?

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.040
Okay. That would be great.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:05.600
&gt;&gt; Emily would be the [inaudible].

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:07.150
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:10.800
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre:
That would be great.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.100
Yeah.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:22.550
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask about
what kind of opportunity you have

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:29.750
in these, talking with all of
these different partners to talk

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.760
about digitization priorities.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.180
You know, how to make our
collections more diverse,

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:42.500
more culturally representative
in ways that they may not be

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:44.890
if we're just, you know,
digitizing here and there.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.720
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: You
want to comment on that?

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.020
&gt;&gt; Adrian Turner: Well,

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.700
there's actually a complementary
project that's happening

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:54.590
where I think we're just trying
to even get a sense of kind

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.620
of the data points, what
collections are out there

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.080
that haven't been digitized.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:02.950
That might then help LSTA start
to target particular funding for,

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.250
you know, scanning efforts.

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.550
And I think this could
start to really dovetail

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.780
with this CalDiSH initiative.

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:11.820
So, and Robin Chandler
over there is coordinating

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:13.120
that particular project.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:16.280
It's what, "Finding
Your California?"

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.790 position:56%
So, you know, I think it's kind of a
broad survey of what collections are

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.410
out there, and I think that's going

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:27.800
to be the starting
point then to identify.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.940 position:56%
It's almost like hidden collections.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.560
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: And then
on a really general level,

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.140
maybe not digging into quite the
level that you were talking about,

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.520
but the wonderful curriculum
that a number of us collaborated

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:44.060
on to create an online curriculum

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:47.060
through the Public Library
Partnerships Project funding

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:53.800
that DPLA received from the Gates
Foundation has a content selection

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:57.860
module to it.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:05.120
So, but that's, of course, a very
general introductory coverage.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:10.220
By the way, that's a great
curriculum, and we'll be talking

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.060
about that also at the fest.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:18.000
Look for that PLPP presentation.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.300
&gt;&gt; Jodi Allison Bunnell:
And although it happens

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:20.600
on an institutional level within my
participating institutions who are

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.410
in Archives West, many of them use
the metrics that I send every month

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:23.880
on their usage of their
finding of retrievals in order

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.180
to drive their digitization
priorities.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.480
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: I'm going
to take one more question.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.780
Lisa [assumed spelling],
did you have your hand up?

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:29.080
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry [inaudible].

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.380
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre: Okay.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:31.680
&gt;&gt; I was just going to give you
my thoughts on the base barrier.

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:32.980
And I say this knowing full well
that you started off talking

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.280
about the travel, but I think
the things that we personally,

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.580
folks that have come
on board [inaudible]

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:36.880
yet would be greatly aided
by us being able to go

00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.180
to their institutions and sit
down and look at their systems.

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:39.480
And also show them kind of
the step by step [inaudible].

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.780 position:56%
I think that one on one would
probably be, if we were able to fund

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.080
that and get that done, it would
probably bring in those laggers

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.380
who are, like, on the edge.

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.680
&gt;&gt; Sandra McIntyre:
Thanks for that tip.

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.980
Thanks for that advice, and I know
Minnesota digital library has done

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.280
that sort of itinerant
outreach to great effect also.

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:48.580
And folks in Digital Commonwealth
in Massachusetts, so, yeah.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.880
Oh, there.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.180
You are the person.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:52.480
All right.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.780
Great. Well, thank you all
for your attention today.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:55.080 position:56%
It's been a pleasure to talk to you.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.380
We'll hang out for a few
minutes afterwards for anyone

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:57.680
who has any other questions.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.980
Thanks.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.280
[ Applause ]

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:01.580
