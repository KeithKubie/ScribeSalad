00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:10.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.100
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Abla Amawi,
I'm so happy to see you here.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.490
I have known you, followed
your career,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.510
and you are an exceptional young
woman who has gone through,

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.740
done her PhD, worked with
international organization,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.720
brought up a lovely young
lady all by herself,

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.950
struggled with numerous obstacles,
and contributed intellectually

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.340
to a lot of the work
that we have on--

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.860
on Jordan and on the
[inaudible] in-- as a whole.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.590 position:56%
But tell me a little bit; where
were you born; where did you grow up

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
and how did you come
to be who you are?

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.230
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Well thank
you first for this interview.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.790
I was-- I grew up in Jordan.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.440
I was born in Jordan to
an Arab- American father

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.410
and Turkish [inaudible] mother, so
I grew up in a bi-cultural house,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.900
and I think the fact that I grew
up in Jordan yet did my high school

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.200
in the states as part

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.610
of the American Field Service
Program made me realize

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.350
that the challenges our
region face since childhood,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.370
I mean going through the
1967 war had affected me

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.680
at the political level that
we have to do something.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.300
And secondly is growing up as
a female in the Arab world,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.940
facing the difficulties
that females face in terms

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.130
of the cultural obstacles, as
well as the norms and traditions.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.940 position:56%
I remember as a child, eight years
old, I decided I'm going to run away

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.930
if my brothers have more
privileges than I do,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.950
and I think that was very
formative for me because it--

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.960
it led me to have the motivation
to say we have to do some changes

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.060
to injustice; I think that's what
motivates me the most is the fight

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.440
for injustice, whether it's gender,
human rights, political freedoms

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.130
for the Palestinians, or any
of the rights of any group

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.220
of people that are deprived.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.870
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
so then you went back

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.830
after high school; you
went back to Jordan?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.920
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes I
went back to Jordan,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.660
finished high school again there
because of the equalization

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.450
of the educational system, and then
I finished my bachelorette studies

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.460
in Jordan, came to Georgetown
to do masters and PhD

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.760
in comparative politics with
the focus in the Arab world.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.300
And being really at the
center for Arab studies

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.040
at Georgetown gave me
the theoretical framework

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.610
in which I can operate, but also
showed me a lot of role models

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.630
that were there in terms of
the professors that were there,

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.200
the activities of the center
and the focus, especially being

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.980
in Washington, you see the
[inaudible] of decision making,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.290
how policies are made, and
the impact on the region.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.200
And for me this was very
important to pursue a career

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.570
that combines policy
making, yet at the same time

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.690
that is rooted in the field.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.130
So after my studies I taught at
Georgetown and then I went back.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.010
I decided to make a
decision to go back.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And you had the
choice of staying because you were--

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.780 position:56%
you had the opportunity, you had the
offers to stay in the United States

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.540
and yet it was a choice
that you made yourself.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.840
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.140
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Because you felt you needed

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.440
to serve your region better.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.740
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.320
I think being in the States gives
you the opportunity really to be

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.840
at the decision making, but
at the same time being away

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.980
from the region makes you very--

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.100
you look at it from a
theoretical academic point of view,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.250
and for me I felt if I want
to serve the region better,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.440
although it would be
difficult I have to be there.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.170
I have to be there to understand
the pulse of the people,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.600
what drives them, what
motivates them,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.560
how do they fight their
own challenges,

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.020
and this is what led
me to go back and say--

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.320
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So with whom did
you work when you first went back?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.570
Did you go teach or did you
work with the U.N. or-- ?

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.670
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: When I went
back I first worked with the--

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.240 position:56%
Her Majesty Queen Noor's
Foundation, a development foundation

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.400
and at the time they had a lot
of projects at the grassroots--

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.770
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
On women isn't it?

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.760
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes they have
projects focusing on women

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.770
but it was more of an integrated
approach to development focusing

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.790
on the human being as such.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.490
So they had more on culture,
they had on gifted education,

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.170
so they had the whole
spectra of work,

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.020
and for me that was the beginning.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.210 position:56%
And from there I worked with the
U.N. -- with UNGP, and the UNGP is--

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.110
our work is mainly development
but with the focus on policy.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.020
But what I have done
throughout, since UNGP I found

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.590 position:56%
that the work is amazing and it gave
me an opportunity to travel and work

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.030
in countries such as Sudan and
conflict Libya, Yemen, Oman,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.060
and a lot of the other
Arab countries

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.810
so that gave me a broader
region of perspective.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.970
But at the same time I have
constantly continued doing my

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.190
academic work, my own
research, my own writing,

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.090
because I feel what the U.N. Gives
me is the grounding in the field,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.310
yet I have to do my own research on
issues that are close to my heart,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.260
which the U.N. in many cases I
cannot be as free such as issues

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.060 position:56%
of democracy, civil society, gender
issues, gender based discrimination,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.960
poverty at the gender level.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.830
So this, for me, the
combination is not easy to do,

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.710
to have full time work
yet full time academia,

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.660
and but at the same time it allows
me the freedom to really explore

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.570
and push the frontiers
of where issues stand.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.400
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And push your
own potential to the fullest.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.320
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes and use your
own potential to the fullest.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.750
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And use your
own potential to the fullest.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.050
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.350
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Absolutely.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.650
What are some of the things you've
been doing in these countries;

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.920
in Oman, in Libya, in many of
the countries you've been there,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.050
what kind of projects
were you involved in?

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.590
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Well in Sudan in
particular, because I was there

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.500
for a year, working on issues
of poverty due to gender

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.860
but mostly post-conflict
and conflict resolution,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.780 position:56%
so that was very very challenging to
me because we worked a lot on trying

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.360
to see how we can come-- bring both
warring parties to the peace table

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.710 position:56%
yet not discuss any political issues
so they can negotiate and discuss

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:37.020 position:56%
on issues of education, development,
but not political resolution.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.620
So this was very critical.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.160 position:56%
Another critical projects are
projects that deal with the displace

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.620
and the transitional
zones, so that was very--

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: In Sudan as well?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.220
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: In Sudan.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.520
In Sudan.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.820
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And it's a
very significant problem, I mean--

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.120
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.420
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: The
problem, the displaced.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.720
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes, it's very--

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.020
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: There are
what, a couple of million people?

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.320
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Well they estimate
them at five million in dispersed.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.620
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.110
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: So, for
me, this was really very--

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.040
it challenges you as a human being.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.330
It challenges your vulnerabilities,
and really it makes you question

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.020
so many of the norms, and it makes
you question what you believe in,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.710
even what you speak about that is
this real, this is a harsh reality,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.860
so for me that was a
good learning experience.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:24.380
In Libya I try to assist in
terms of they had funding

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.250
but they did not have a program

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.010
to tailor vocational
training for women.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:34.280 position:56%
They had very traditional vocational
training and the women were ending

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.000
up unemployed, a useless
waste of time.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.030
So what I helped the government
and UNGP in doing was really try

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.490
to refocus the vocational educate--

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.500
education programs to tailor it

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.960
to more profitable
constructive education.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.800
And in the case of Oman I did the
same thing as assist the government

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.890
and UNICEF in coming up
with a social strategy

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:02.750
that will take issues, gender
issues, at the heart, so.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.060
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So you
put new issues on the table.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.360
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Yes.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.050
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes,
and you focused on rather

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.770
than tradition you
brought in new things

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.540
that you thought would
be more important

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.130
for the women themselves as such.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.640
And how do you coup with-- with
your child, with your family?

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.290 position:56%
How-- how do you do all this and-- ?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.360
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Well I
think my child is a stem

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.820
and I think she's what
motivates me to go forward

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.660
because in a sense I
don't raise her alone,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.460
I mean in the Arab world we
have the nice family support.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.760
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Network of family, yes.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.000
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: So I know
that they are there always.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.210
At the same time, I mean,
I cannot ignore the fact

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.230
that we have a very
civilized divorce.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:47.590
My ex-husband is a professor and
he is a Middle East historian,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.640
so he's also culturally very
aware and very supportive.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:56.150
So in that case, for me,
what matters is that I see

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.030
in my child the motivation to
have a better future for her.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.110
I don't want her to grow
up in a world that is--

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.980
discriminates against
her, in a world that has--

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.740
that does not take equality as
a human right for everybody,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.150
and that it-- this is
not an important concept,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:17.240
that does not take religion
to extremes where it's used,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:20.390
not only Islam, in all religions--

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.690
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: All religions.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.470
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: As an excuse to
really discriminate against others.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.340
So for me she has been
the challenge and the--

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.210
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
you have been the mother.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.060
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: I hope.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.560
And I dedicate all the work to
her usually because in the hope

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.900
that she will have a more
inclusive society to live in,

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.990
whether it's in Jordan or globally.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:43.080
I mean the Arab world is not the
only world that discriminates.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:48.300
We're seeing this in terms of human
rights violation universal issue.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.820
So this what drives me, and
exhausts me at the same time.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.120
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Absolutely.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.420
Absolutely.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.620
But it's in-- in the new generation
anyway that we put our hope

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.780
and is she planning,
is she already thinking

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.670 position:56%
about what he future is going to be?

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.670
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Well she
believes in human rights

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.510
and she has a very strong sense

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.830
of achieving justice,
which is very good.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:18.220 position:56%
I mean taking her with me to poverty
areas, whether in Sudan, in Egypt,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.870
and in Jordan in particular
she's the team leader,

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.750
as she calls herself, of poverty
clubs within the schools is

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:30.090
that she sees that there
is a mission we have to do

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.700
and that's what I keep telling
her; we are brought into life

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.030
for a mission and we are privileged

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.250
that we have the opportunity
to achieve something.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.780
So in that she sees herself
that she has to do some--

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.820
but at the same time I give
her the opportunities to be--

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.770
to grow up as a child, happy,
well fed, well educated,

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:55.130
but most importantly that she has
rights and that her life is her own

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.100
if she enjoys the rights
and responsibilities.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.990
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: I think
that you're a wonderful mother

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:07.520
and her education is-- is
complimented by your experiences

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.730
and by sharing them with you
and talking about them with you

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.280
and going to places and I really
want to thank you for being with us

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.750
and for sharing this with us and
I'm sure that many women will look

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.990
up to you and will see you
as a mother when they have

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.700
to make difficult choices
and-- and when they have to--

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.920
to take stands on issues.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.990
And thank you so much for being--

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.300
for being here and for
making this program possible.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.600
&gt;&gt; Abla Amawi: Thank you very much.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.510
