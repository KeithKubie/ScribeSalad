00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.500
You don't watch silent movies the same way
you watch a sound movie.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.910
Silent movies require a different level of
attention.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.349
I think a different level of involvement.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.600
They solicit your imagination and your participation
in a way that a sound film doesn't.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.390
Something that only lasted about thirty years
in the real world but continues to be with

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.970
us in a very strong, strong way.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.439
Unfortunately, the great majority of silent
films have been lost forever.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.360
They just were not preserved at the time they
were made.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.659
They were not seen as products that needed
to survive beyond their commercial lives.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.159
And by some estimates, about 90% of the silent
cinema has been lost.

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.430
My name is Dave Kehr.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.780
I'm a curator in the Department of Film at
The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.900
And today, we're going to take a look at a silent
film, one that's very close to me because

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.690
I've been working with a team of other people
on restoring it for a number of years now.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.840
This is Ernst Lubitsch's 1923 film “Rosita”
starring Mary Pickford.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.520
“Rosita” is set in a mythical 19th-century
Spain, where a lecherous king has cast his

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.880
eye on a popular street singer played by Mary
Pickford.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.420
And it is Rosita's shtick, her act, to satirically
attack the king in her songs.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.560
He finds this kind of provocative and interesting
and decides he wants to know her a lot better.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.520
The king sends a couple of his henchmen to
try to arrest her.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.600
A handsome young nobleman, played by George
Walsh, tries to help her resist, but they

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.270
both end up in prison.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.380
The King tries to break up this incipient
romance by having the nobleman condemned to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.640
death and sending Rosita away to a rather
nice villa that he's procured for her.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.280
In the meantime, the queen is keeping a wary
eye on all of this and is able to eventually

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.400
adjust the outcome to her own satisfaction,
in very Lubitschian manner.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.780
A silent movie engages your attention the
same way a book does.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.660
You are there to finish that work of art.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.300
It exists, really, between you and the page

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.660
and a silent movie exists between the viewer and the screen.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.700
You have to supply the sound effects.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.810
You have to supply the timbre of the voices.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.750
You have to supply, in many cases, the color.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.000
You have to be able to assemble those shots
into a unified space.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.760
And a good director knows that and takes advantage
of that

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.660
as does Ernst Lubitsch throughout "Rosita."

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.240
It's a constant transaction.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.270
It requires attention and involvement in a
way that maybe digital era films don't solicit

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.700
so much anymore.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:09.370
The cliché "Lubitsch moment" is the closed
door behind which some delights, usually sexual,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.780
are occurring and the audience is asked to
imagine those.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.510
And that's just, you know, it's a funny way
of getting around censorship

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.280
but it's a principle he applied in so many
different ways.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.930
There's a sequence in here where you see Mary
circling around a bowl of fruit.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.860
It's a very long take.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.860
She's hungry.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.860
She hasn't eaten.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.590
She's the poor street singer who suddenly
finds herself in the royal palace.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.200
And here she is confronted with a bowl of
fruit

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.340
and she's just awestruck and a little proud,
a little wary.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.900
She doesn't want to just dive in there and
start pigging out.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.680
She's going to dance around a little bit.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.680
So, we're just watching her

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.340
oh, dives in and steals one

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.180
hopefully, even though she's alone, she doesn't
want anyone else to see her.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.819
She can't resist, goes back for another.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.879
And the way he builds this scene, it gets
funnier and funnier.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:59.210
She keeps going back.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.410
A little guilty look.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.190
Just beautifully timed.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.599
And again, we see so much of her character,
her pride, her desperation.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.080
And now, she's suddenly confronted by the King.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.180
And she has to finish chewing very quickly
so she can speak to him

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.820
and it's a wonderful laugh line.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.419
Suddenly, that sense of embarrassment becomes
a wonderful moment, a wonderful joke.

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.089
The rest of the film kind of follows their
little erotic dance as he tries to seduce

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:33.800
her and she tries to get some advantage for
herself.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.180
This is some footage that was supposedly taken
by Mary Pickford’s brother, Jack

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.900
on the set of “Rosita.”

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.439
And we can see Lubitsch trying out some of
the masks for the carnival scene.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.169
The reason that there are so many children
in this scene is that they would put children

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.650
in the background of the shot in order to
create a sense of false perspective and make

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.080
the depth of the shot look actually longer
than it is.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.879
And he has a lot of fun trying on that mask
and smoking his trademark cigar.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.550
He had been an actor himself at the beginning
of his career

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.169
and you can still see he really enjoys being
in front of the camera.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.380
He enjoys hamming it up.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.439
“Rosita” was the first American film by
Ernst Lubitsch who, in 1923, was the most

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.100
famous director in the world.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.400
Lubitsch started getting offers from Hollywood

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:30.580
and he got an offer from Mary Pickford, who
at that point was probably the biggest movie

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.870
star in the world, certainly the biggest female
star in the world.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:41.680
Very interesting woman who had established
her own production company quite early on had been

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.140
one of the founding members of United Artists with Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W. Griffith.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.660
She very much took charge of her own career,
produced her own films.

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.909
Mary was famous for playing adolescent girls.

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:58.120
She was America's sweetheart.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.980
She was the embodiment of, you know, innocence,
and energy, and grit, and go-get-it spirit.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.200
She was often an orphan who had to find her own way in the world

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.320
or solve various problems facing her family.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.580
Saving the day in the end.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.620
“Rosita” was an opportunity for her to
change the little girl image

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.780
that she had with the public.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.360
A few years later, Mary turned against this
movie for reasons that no one has ever quite

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:28.629
been able to figure out.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:31.639
The reviews were fantastic by all accounts.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.710
It did extremely good business at the box
office.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:41.649
But she allowed "Rosita" both to fall out
of copyright and to decay.

00:06:41.649 --> 00:06:45.819
And again, I do not know why.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:50.610
Suddenly, in the fan magazines, she's referring
to it as a famous failure.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.069
And it wasn't.

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.020
There's just no evidence that it was in any
way.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:01.499
I think she became uneasy with the "Mary becomes
a woman" angle.

00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.090
She immediately went back to playing adolescents
in her next film.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:09.280
She allowed her personal print of Rosita to
dissolve.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.280
It disappeared.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:20.819
Until the 1970s when a nitrate print turned
up in the collection of the Soviet state archives.

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:26.169
It was a print that had probably been bootlegged
by the Soviets in the 1920s.

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.360
The print was in such bad condition that,
basically, no one thought they could do anything

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.089
substantial with it for a long, long time.

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:37.129
It just remained in this kind of dismal state.

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:41.619
So, you really could not get much more compromised
than that film

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:46.050
the next best thing to really not existing
at all.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:51.500
And then a few years ago, with all the new
tools we've got from the digital realm, it

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.210
suddenly became possible to give a very good
restoration to this

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.300
you know, to really get some dramatic improvement
in the image

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.330
to remove a lot of the scratches and dirt
that had been baked in over years and years.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:10.189
And now, we have a "Rosita" that is never
going to look perfect but it looks amazingly

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:13.849
good considering how compromised that material
was to begin with.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:18.219
And now, people can see this film and judge
for themselves.

00:08:18.219 --> 00:08:20.649
Silent films are only primitive in the sense
that they came first.

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:21.969
They were primary.

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.189
Everything else is built upon that.

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:26.960
The levels of sophistication were immense.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.729
This was not a simplistic art form.

00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:35.270
It could contain amazing nuance, subtext, just
the richness of emotion, the richness of expression

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:41.660
is perfectly comparable with the best of literature
and visual arts during that period.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.460
So, those are a few of my thoughts on why
silent films are still important and why we

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:56.370
should try to take care of the ones we have
and keep looking for the ones we can't find.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.380
I would love to hear some of your experiences
with silent movies

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.000
what they mean to you, how you've approached
them, how you first encountered them in your life.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.200
And let us know if there are any other topics
you'd like to see us cover in these videos.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.940
