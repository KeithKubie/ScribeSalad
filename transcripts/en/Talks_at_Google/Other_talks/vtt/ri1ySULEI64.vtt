[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:09.150
JOSH: So today, we're honored
to welcome Christian Picciolini.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.490
He has quite a story.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.890
He's an Emmy award-winning
television producer,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.000
a prolific public speaker,
and reformed extremist.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.970
He's here today to talk about
his work as the co-founder

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.320
of Life After Hate--

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.380
a nonprofit helping people
disengaged from hate

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.540
and violent extremism.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.820
He's also the author
of "Romantic Violence--

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.570
Memoirs of an
American Skinhead."

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.850
Christian's life
purpose is really born

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.450
from an ongoing
and a profound need

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.390
to atone for his grisly past
and to contribute to the greater

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.860
good.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.720
He began the process
of rebuilding his life

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.930
after leaving violent far
right extremist groups

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.360
he was part of during
his youth, and he went on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.550
to earn a degree in
international relations

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.670
from DePaul University and start
his own global entertainment

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.230
company.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.840
He was appointed a member of
the Chicago Grammy Rock Music

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.560
Committee and a board
member of CIMMfest.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.760
I always try to say that,
but I don't get it right--

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.990
Chicago International
Movies and Music Festival.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780
It's pretty awesome.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.480
So Christian's an
appointed United Nations

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.170
affiliated ambassador
IChange Nations

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.700
and was honored with a
National Statesman Award.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.510
He's also an associate for the
USC Pride Homegrown Violent

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.400
Extremism Program
that I think you might

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.980
be going into in your talk.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.070
And most recently, Christian
won an Emmy award for directing

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.220
and producing ExitUSA's "There
Is Life After Hate" PSA,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.959
and he's been nominated for
multiple regional awards.

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.000
And Christian's going to
be sticking around today

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.310
for the talk and after
the talk, and we'll

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.870
have copies of his book
"Romantic Violence"

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.520
available for $10
out in the lobby.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.192
So for Googlers in
the audience, be

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:54.650
sure to think of any questions
you might have for Christian

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.180
during the Q&amp;A. So now, please
give a warm Google welcome

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.180
to Christian Picciolini.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.926
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:07.780
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Hi, everybody.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.770
I remember-- my wife
was sitting over there,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.110
in case you didn't
know, but I remember

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.060
when I used to see--
every person who

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.940
worked at the Chicago office
could fit in this front row

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.140
here.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.700
It's not quite
like that anymore.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.500
Josh, thank you very
much for inviting me.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.140
It's good to be back.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.900
I want to tell you a
little bit about my story.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.970
My journey here started
22 years ago in 1995

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.940
when I left the American
neo-Nazi skinhead movement

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.860
that I helped build.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.860
I was 22 at the time,
but I had already

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.710
spent eight years, every one
of my formative teen years

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.290
from the time I was 14
years old, in America's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.330
first neo-Nazi skinhead gang.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.770
But before that, I was
a pretty normal kid--

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.920
Chachi, I guess, is right.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.820
I came from an Italian
immigrant family

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.260
who came to the United
States in the mid '60s.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.830
I had low self-esteem,
low self-confidence.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.980
I liked to play sports.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.520
I was just a normal teenage kid.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.350
But because my parents
were immigrants,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.980
they had to work
very long hours,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.730
and they were gone at
their small business

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.240
that they started seven
days a week, 14 hours a day.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.730
And I spent a lot
of time on my own.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.610
In fact, I felt very lonely
and felt very abandoned

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.970
at a young age.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.690
I didn't quite fit in
into the Italian community

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.412
where I was growing up.

00:03:36.412 --> 00:03:38.620
And I didn't quite fit in
into the American community

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.100
because my family
really held onto kind

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.280
of the old-world ways, so it
never really crossed over.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.830
So because of
that, I didn't have

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.010
a lot of friends growing up,
and I felt very marginalized.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.440
And just like any
other teenager,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.200
just like any other
human being really,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.210
there were three
fundamental needs

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.310
that I was searching for--

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.180
identity, community,
and a sense of purpose.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.880
And that's something that we
all search for at a young age,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.410
typically.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.640
One day, when I
was 14 years old,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.050
and I was angry at my parents
and angry at the world,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.860
I was standing in an alley
smoking a joint, and a car--

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.350
1968 Firebird-- came
roaring down the alley,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.890
spitting up gravel and rocks,
and it stopped six inches

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.240
from me.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.486
And a man with a shaved head
got out of the car and boots,

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:31.860
and nobody really
in America knew

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.250
what a skinhead was in 1987.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.520
This was before Raldo got
his nose broken with a chair

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.272
and before they were
on Oprah Winfrey.

00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:43.560
But this man came up to me,
and he grabbed the joint

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.580
from my mouth.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.270
And he was 26 years old
at the time, and I was 14.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.492
And he looked me in
the eyes and he said,

00:04:50.492 --> 00:04:52.950
don't you know that that's what
the communists and the Jews

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.380
want you to do to
keep you docile?

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.050
I was 14.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.591
I didn't really know
what a communist

00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:02.000
was except for Ivan Drago in
my favorite "Rocky" movie.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.790
I didn't know if I'd
met a Jewish person.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.420
I wouldn't have
known by that point,

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.340
and I hardly knew what
the word docile meant.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.770
But I was struck with
this man's charisma.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.400
It seemed like he was the only
adult, at that time in my life,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.670
that had given me a real reason
not to do something that would

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.920
harm me, whereas my
parents might say,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.360
don't do that
because it's stupid,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.580
or don't do that because
what will other people think

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:27.550
if they see you doing that?

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.230
Though I didn't understand
his logic because I didn't

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.180
understand politics
at 14 years old,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.440
it seemed like he had an insight
that should be important to me,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.920
and he drew me in into
this community, which

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.620
happened to be America's
first neo-Nazi skinhead

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.960
group, started on the
south side of Chicago.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.570
Most people don't know that.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.780
About two years after
I was recruited,

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.440
that man went to prison for
a series of very violent hate

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.300
crimes, with the last one being
against the female skinhead

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.520
that was part of our crew.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.610
They saw her standing at a
bus stop with a black man,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.520
and they went to her apartment,
and they kicked in her door,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.860
and they pistol
whipped her until they

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.220
thought she was dead.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.150
And then before they left, they
painted a swastika on her wall

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.260
with her own blood.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.780
Luckily, for that,
they were arrested,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.510
and he was sentenced
to 10 years in prison.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.440
Unlucky for me, that left a
void in this organization.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.600
By this time, I
was 16 years old.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.280
I had learned how to recruit.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.430
I had bought into the
ideology, which was very much

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.080
an "us against them" narrative.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.770
It was always about blaming
somebody else for the problems

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.610
that existed in your life
versus taking accountability

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.550
for those problems and blaming
somebody else because it

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.530
was very easy to
blame the other--

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.940
the invisible other person.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.020
And I started to teach
that to other people.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.450
And when he went
to prison, there

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.110
was an opportunity for
me that changed my life.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.780
I essentially stepped into
the role of leadership

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.280
of this group at 16 years old.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.490
And I went from Chachi to this
guy pretty much overnight.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.610
As part of my job to
recruit more young people,

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.460
I had to use fear tactics.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.000
Our way of recruiting
people was to scare them,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.280
to essentially tell them
that people were coming

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.490
into our neighborhoods
to steal, who were black,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.440
who were Latino.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.380
We would say things like
the Jews control the media

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.490
and finance systems
and entertainment.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.010
We would say that immigrants
were coming to our country

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.250
and stealing jobs--

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.350
sound familiar?

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.050
Not much has changed
over the last 30 years,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.827
and I'll get into that.

00:07:48.827 --> 00:07:50.410
But I started to
recruit these people,

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.210
and I started to
affect their lives.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.250
And for the first
time in my life,

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.940
I felt powerful in the
false sense of the word.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.730
But I'd felt powerless my
whole life before that.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.910
So for a 16-year-old kid
or even a 14-year-old kid,

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.470
to now be a part of
this very powerful--

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:15.240
perceived power-- community, it
really kind of changed my life.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.880
And I started to
come out of my shell,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.300
and I started to encourage young
people to go out and commit

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.500
acts of violence.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.500
And what I realize now
that I didn't realize then

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.220
is that I really hated
myself, and what I was doing

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.179
was projecting my own
self-loathing onto other people

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.190
to relieve myself of that pain.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:41.980
Unfortunately, it took me
many years to figure that out.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.620
I had started to become
a regional leader

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.700
around that time.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.400
I merged our small group, which
was the first into a larger

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.030
group called The Hammerskin
Nation, which today is still

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.450
the most violent and deadliest
skinhead organization on earth.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.820
It is now all over the world.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:03.190
And I also started a band
that was a white power band.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.160
My goal with that was
to encourage people

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:11.290
through my lyrics and my
music to join our fight,

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.230
and it was propaganda in the
truest sense of the word.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.980
And it was also our version
of fake news back then.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.740
This was before the internet,
so I started to tell people,

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.930
through my lyrics, to
go out and commit acts

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.420
of violence, which they did.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:30.910
I gave them propaganda as
education, which they learned.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.119
And that kept them in
because what would happen

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:34.660
is they would give
up everything else

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.930
in their life that was important
to them to join this group.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.940
And that was important
for us because we knew,

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.950
then, it was harder
to leave and harder

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:44.020
to go back because
they had abandoned

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.320
their original identity and
their original community,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.440
and we gave that to
them in a new form.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.910
But we also gave
them that purpose

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.960
that they were looking for.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.110
But we would always try
to look for young people

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.390
who were marginalized
or vulnerable

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.622
or who had some sort of
a grievance or trauma

00:10:02.622 --> 00:10:05.080
because they were looking for
answers, and they were angry.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.980
And it was easy for us to
manufacture answers for them,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.340
to spin something
into an answer that

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.590
was more palatable
for them so that they

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.420
would blame other people.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.320
In 1991, the band that I
started to make this music

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.900
was the first band to travel
outside of the United States

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.570
within this genre to play
in a foreign country.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.560
And this was in 1991
in Weimar, Germany.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.500
And Weimar is this
beautiful city

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.480
that is in former East Germany.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.942
It's produced composers and
artists and great thinkers,

00:10:40.942 --> 00:10:42.650
and this was the first
time that I really

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.830
recognized the
consequences of my words

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.640
that I was saying onstage
because, after this concert,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.360
the 4,000 skinheads that came
to the show from all over Europe

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.260
went out into this town, and
they essentially destroyed it.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.930
They broke into shops,
and they broke windows.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.820
They stole beer
from pubs, and they

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.590
went around the town essentially
beating up the townspeople, who

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.030
were white and German.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.980
And I didn't quite understand
why we were doing that.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.750
And I didn't quite
understand how

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.480
it made me feel that they were
doing that based on my words,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.810
and it really allowed me to
have this internal discussion

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.930
with myself to really
try and understand

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.910
what I was accomplishing and
how I was influencing the world.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.720
And I had a really
hard time with that.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.920
And I started to question the
ideology that I was a part of.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.990
I started to see that they were
broken people who were hurting

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.079
other people because
they were broken,

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:46.620
and that's when I
made the connection

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.250
about me feeling broken
and hating myself

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.050
and then projecting
that onto other people.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.560
And then something happened--

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.420
changed my life again.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.300
When I came home from
Germany, I met a girl,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.350
and we fell in love--

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:06.030
not her, somebody else.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.230
And we had our child, and I was
19 years old when we first got

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.690
married and had our
first child and then 21

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.050
when we had our second son.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.460
And it challenged that idea
of identity and community

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:19.690
and purpose.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:25.880
I had gone from a skinhead
leader to a father.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.280
My community priorities
shifted from the one

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:33.630
I had built around me to the
family I was now creating.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.010
And my purpose began to shift.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.350
It was about supporting my
family and keeping them safe

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.740
and providing for
them and not bringing

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.420
in the ideology that
I was a part of,

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.450
and that was an
important key for me

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.520
because I started to
ask myself, if I'm

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.280
passionate about this,
why is it that I'm not

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.080
bringing my family into it?

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.360
And I realized, at that
point, that it was not

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.420
something I wanted them involved
in because it was dangerous.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.810
I had started to
question my ideology,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:09.300
and I'd started to meet people
that challenged my narrative.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.780
So to support my family,
I opened a record store.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.970
I still wasn't ready
or brave enough

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.240
to leave behind that
community and that identity

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.220
because I had really
abandoned everything else,

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.260
and my family was very new.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.480
So I decided the
best way to find

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.420
a middle ground was
to get off the streets

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:29.070
and open a record store.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.017
That way, I could
support my family.

00:13:31.017 --> 00:13:32.850
That way, I could come
home in normal hours,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.262
and I wouldn't be
putting myself in danger.

00:13:35.262 --> 00:13:36.970
But the point of
opening the record store

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.770
was not just to sell music, it
was to sell white power music.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.140
So I began importing CDs--

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.410
this was before the
internet-- from Europe.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.450
And very, very quickly, it
became 75% of my gross revenue

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.380
at the store.

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.290
People were driving in from
California and New York

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.040
to buy this white power music
because I was the only store

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.399
in the US selling it.

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:02.940
Something else
happened at that time.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.690
I became a little bit
greedy as an entrepreneur,

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.510
and I thought to myself,
why should I just take money

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.720
from my brothers and sisters
when I could be taking money

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.730
from the enemy as well?

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.839
So I started to sell punk rock,
and hip hop, and heavy metal.

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:22.380
And when the customers
came in to buy

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:28.310
that who were African-American
or Jewish or gay or Muslim,

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.164
at first, I was a
little standoffish.

00:14:30.164 --> 00:14:32.330
I was happy to take their
money, but I didn't really

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.080
want to talk to them
or engage with them.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.660
But they kept coming back,
and they knew who I was.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:41.922
And I was confused why
they were supporting me.

00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:43.880
And every time they came
back, the conversation

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.950
got to be a little
bit more personal.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.320
And then they would
come back, and then I

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.220
started asking them questions.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.330
And one day, a black
teenager came in,

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.650
and he had told me that his
mother had passed from cancer.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.680
And suddenly, I was able
to relate with this person

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.080
because my mother had been
diagnosed with cancer.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.630
And we connected
on a human level.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.500
And then one day, a gay
couple came in with their son,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.080
and it was obvious how
much they loved him,

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.040
and it was the same love
that I felt for my child.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.370
And I began to realize that
we had more similarities

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.484
than differences, that I
had never in my life-- not

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:30.650
just the eight years that
I was involved-- but never

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:35.090
in my life had a
meaningful conversation

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:39.180
or interaction with
anybody who wasn't like me.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.610
And because of my
store, I was now

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.880
having these meaningful
interactions with the people,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.160
who, in my head, I had a
different vision of who

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.490
they were.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:49.770
I believed the propaganda.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.450
I believed the hate and the
lies and the scapegoating.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.640
And now, suddenly, I
was meeting these people

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.650
for the first time, and
they showed me compassion.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.750
They could have easily gone and
broken my windows at the store.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.780
They could have easily gone and
threatened my family or harmed

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.070
me, but they didn't.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:15.020
Even know they knew who I
was, they kept coming back.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:17.120
And I received compassion
from the people

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.990
that I least deserved it from
when I least deserved it.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.950
And that really allowed me
to humanize them and realize

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:26.870
that we needed
each other, that we

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.260
had the same fundamental
needs of joy and love,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.120
that we had the same emotions
of anger and sadness,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.300
and that we really were
all pieces of a puzzle that

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.900
couldn't be built
without each other.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.810
So I became embarrassed to
sell the white power music,

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:45.760
and I closed the
store, obviously,

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.250
because I couldn't
sustain it anymore

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.650
with it being 75% of my revenue.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.950
And at that same moment,
when I closed my store,

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:57.710
my life fell apart.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.700
I didn't have a job anymore,
so my livelihood was gone.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.920
My wife and my children
left me because I

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.500
hadn't left the
movement quickly enough

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.510
and paid attention to them.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.300
I didn't have a great
relationship with my parents,

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.099
and I had lost my whole
community that I had built.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:17.040
So suddenly, I was without that
identity and that community

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.619
and a purpose.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:22.829
And for the next five years,
I woke up every morning

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:26.310
and I considered taking my
life because I wasn't sure

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.000
how to proceed.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.680
I was treating other
people with respect.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.210
I started to understand
our similarities,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:39.440
but I was still miserable inside
because, for those five years,

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.290
I tried to outrun who I was.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.670
I tried to make new friends,
wasn't very successful at that.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:51.020
I moved, wore long sleeves
to cover my tattoos.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.630
I was doing everything
I could to not face who

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.570
I was because I was afraid
of being judged just like I

00:17:56.570 --> 00:18:00.980
judged other people until, one
day, at the end of that five

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.410
years, a friend of mine
came up to me, and she said,

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.960
you have to do something because
I don't want to lose you.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.710
And I said, OK, well,
what do you suggest?

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.520
And she said, well, I
just started working

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.350
at this company called IBM.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.970
You may have heard of them.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.470
Why don't you apply
for a job there?

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.120
And I said, you're crazy.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.710
I said, I'm like an ex-Nazi.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.250
I'm covered in tattoos.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.450
I went to six high schools.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.890
I get kicked out of all of
them-- one of them twice.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.806
I didn't go to university,
oh, and by the way,

00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:29.580
I don't own a computer or
know how to use a computer.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.350
Why would they hire me?

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:33.570
And she said, just go in
there for an interview.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.360
See what happens, and just tell
them you're good with people.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.240
I was like, yeah, OK, that's
what I'm going to tell them.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.130
But I wrote my resume.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.740
I lied on my resume.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:48.090
And I went in,
and I got the job.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:53.760
And that essentially
changed my life again

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.480
because now I had
found purpose again.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.440
That gave me the ability
to find the confidence

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.800
to approach other people,
to seek forgiveness,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.620
but also to find a way to
forgive myself because I

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.090
had been unable to do that.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.800
And things started
to get better.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.107
And the first day at IBM--

00:19:17.107 --> 00:19:18.940
of course, they have
millions of customers--

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.170
where did they put me?

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.720
Back at my old high school
for a computer rollout--

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.480
the same high school I'd
been kicked out of twice.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.830
That was my first day
at my first job at IBM.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.450
I was terrified,
absolutely terrified.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.860
I was a grown man who
was sweating and shaking,

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:38.120
and I couldn't find the words.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.950
I was scared to walk
into the building

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.366
because I was
afraid that somebody

00:19:41.366 --> 00:19:44.300
was going to say we know him.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.790
He's got to go, and I
would lose that opportunity

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.460
for that first meaningful thing.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.872
And of course, on that
first day, who walks by me

00:19:51.872 --> 00:19:54.330
but the old black security
guard that I got in a fist fight

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.180
with that got me kicked
out for the second time?

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.010
I really didn't know
what to do then,

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.180
but I decided I had
to do something.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.260
I knew I couldn't live in
that fear of being found

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.640
out or recognized and fired.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.152
So I decided I was going to
chase him to the parking lot--

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:11.860
probably not the
smartest thing for a guy

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.193
that I got in a fist fight with.

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:15.932
But when I saw him
getting into his car,

00:20:15.932 --> 00:20:17.140
I tapped him on the shoulder.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.560
And this man, who normally
had this beautiful jolly

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.370
smile, when he turned
around and recognized me,

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.820
he took a step back
because he was afraid.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.410
I couldn't think of what
to say except I'm sorry.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:38.250
And I stuck out my
hand, and he shook it.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:40.660
And we talked.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.072
We embraced, may have
cried just a little bit.

00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:45.030
It was a long time ago.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.840
I'm not really sure.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.630
I'm pretty sure we cried.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.160
But after talking, he
made me make a promise,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.900
and that promise was that I
would tell the world my story,

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.470
not because he thought, oh, kids
are going to become neo-Nazis.

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.460
You should tell them.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.160
But because he recognized,
in my story, the story

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:07.190
of every young person,
who is vulnerable,

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.880
who is marginalized,
who can very easily find

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.902
a destructive path.

00:21:12.902 --> 00:21:17.250
And I didn't really know what
he meant until a couple years

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:22.980
later, and I got a phone call in
2004 in the middle of the night

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.470
that my younger brother
had been shot and killed.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:32.240
And then I knew that I had
to tell my story because he

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.430
was driving in a car
with some friends

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.960
in a neighborhood
he wasn't used to,

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.690
and some kids who are
scared of his skin color

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.140
decided that they were
going to shoot into the car.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.840
And I knew that this wasn't
just something that affected me.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.550
I knew then, at
this time, that I

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.650
wasn't the only one
with this problem,

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.500
that there were a lot
of lost young people

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.980
who needed to understand that
there was a more positive path.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.740
So it took me 10 years to
do it, but eventually, I

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.770
wrote and published my book.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.680
And in my book, I speak
to every young person.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.130
While I use my own story,
and I tell my story,

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.080
I use the language
that I used at that age

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.790
because I want other
young people to be

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.710
able to relate to
what I went through,

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.520
and I think that I was
successful with that.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.620
I also co-founded an
organization called

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.890
Life After Hate, and everybody
you see in this picture

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.850
here is a former
extremist, who has been out

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.590
for at least the
last 20 years and has

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.620
dedicated their lives
to helping dismantle

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.720
what they helped build.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.620
For the last 22 years of my
life, mostly for the last 15,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.110
I've been very actively
engaged in helping

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.770
people understand the
movement that I helped build.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.020
I've consulted with
law enforcement

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.150
and done public speaking.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.980
But most of all, what
I'm the most proud of

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:58.439
is helping people disengage
from hate and hate groups.

00:22:58.439 --> 00:22:59.980
And we're able to
be successful doing

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.400
that because we really relate to
the people we're working with.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.270
We were those people at
one point in our lives.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.340
And what we do, when we work
with people, is we listen.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.160
And we listen for
what I call potholes.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.140
Potholes are the
things that appeared

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.320
in your path that happened to
you that eventually deviated

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.366
you onto a different path.

00:23:22.366 --> 00:23:23.740
And when I listen
for potholes, I

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:29.900
hear about trauma and abuse,
poverty, lack of education,

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.270
mental illness.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.600
And my job, then, becomes
to fill those potholes.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.430
I work with partners
all over the country

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:42.210
to bring mental health
support, or job training,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.410
or career guidance,
or education, even

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.100
tattoo removal for people, who
are in these movements, who

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.040
want to get out.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.040
And I tell you that there
are so many people who

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.200
are stuck in these movements,
and even though they

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.780
may be questioning
their ideology,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.900
they don't leave because they've
already abandoned everything

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.220
to go back to.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.310
And they've spent time and
energy building this community

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:09.000
and this identity that starting
over is very, very difficult.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.830
And I know because I was there.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.290
So we try to be this
new community for them.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.440
We've actually built a
network of over 200 people

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.380
that we've helped leave,
that have found us

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.250
after they've left.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:25.340
And we provide a virtual
support system for them.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.370
They can talk to each other
and understand each other.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.850
And some days, in our
virtual community--

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.620
it's cat memes and
joking around--

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.810
and some days, it
gets really heavy,

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.960
where somebody will admit
for the first time to anybody

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.110
that they were sexually
abused at three years old,

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.720
or they'll come
online and tell us

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.290
that their son committed
suicide that morning.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.030
And we rally.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.460
We surround that person with
love and with compassion

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.940
and empathy, and they make it
because sometimes the things

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.070
that they're going through
because of their past--

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.444
it's not something
that they feel

00:25:00.444 --> 00:25:03.000
comfortable talking about
with other people that

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.980
haven't experienced it.

00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:08.830
I just want to talk a little
bit about the movement

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.800
now because it's changed
over the last 30 years.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.960
What we used to think of
when we thought of the far

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.420
right extremist movement--

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.852
we think of skinheads
and Klan and militia.

00:25:22.852 --> 00:25:24.810
And there are still people
out there like that.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.150
We see them on the
news from time to time,

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:29.330
but it's different now.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.050
The internet has changed things.

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.640
And this is an
important topic for me,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.431
and I'm glad I'm speaking
to you about this

00:25:36.431 --> 00:25:40.790
because, obviously, you are at
the fore of this thing called

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.310
the internet and connecting
people and information.

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.280
But what I've seen lately,
because of the internet,

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.100
is that so many vulnerable
young people, who

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.920
may be socially
awkward in real life,

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.810
are finding their identity
in their community

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:59.830
online in not the
greatest of places.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.950
I'm seeing so much
propaganda and fake

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:08.110
news that is directing these
young people to a new narrative

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.050
because, let's face it, young
people, maybe even some of us,

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.710
were pretty disgruntled with
the way society is these days.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.400
We question government.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.095
We question law enforcement
on some of their tactics.

00:26:20.095 --> 00:26:21.720
For young people,
they have a hard time

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.207
getting a job after college.

00:26:23.207 --> 00:26:25.290
If they go to college,
they are saddled with debt.

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:28.014
They're really
looking for answers.

00:26:28.014 --> 00:26:29.430
And unfortunately,
because of some

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:31.830
of the algorithms
that exist online,

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.930
it traps people in these
bubbles and puts them

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.610
down a rabbit hole.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.910
Let's say, for instance,
you click on a story

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.180
or you Google a black-on-white
crime statistics.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.040
Well, that may take you
to a fake news site,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.790
and I know that y'all
are working on that,

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.750
and I'm glad that you guys are.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.620
But this is important
because what happens

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.990
is, when they hit
that news story,

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.890
just like when you go to
Amazon, and you buy a product,

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.420
and it recommends Pampers
if you bought Huggies,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.960
well, unfortunately, social
media also recommends

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.080
the same type of stories.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.190
So you start going down this
rabbit hole of misinformation.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:13.286
So what used to look like
this now looks like this.

00:27:13.286 --> 00:27:15.320
And we might laugh
and say, oh, you know,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.915
they're just teenage
girls being stupid.

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.720
They also look like this.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.310
30 years ago, we
started this concept

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.490
of what's called
the alt-right today.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.650
We recognized 30 years ago that
we were turning people away--

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.800
the average American racist--

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.260
because we had shaved heads
and waved swastika flags

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.100
and got tattoos.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:44.190
So we thought, well, we need to
trade in our boots for suits.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.770
We need to start wearing a tie
and going to college so we can

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:48.960
recruit on college campuses.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.945
We need to get jobs and law
enforcement and run for office.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:03.450
And it's getting
younger and younger,

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.500
and it manifests like this.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.992
This is Dylann Roof, who walked
into a church in South Carolina

00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:11.700
and murdered nine
innocent people because

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.030
of the color of their skin.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.230
One day, he went and he
looked up black-on-white crime

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.100
statistics, and he was
led to a website that

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.590
is a white nationalist
or neo-Nazi website that

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.870
gave false information.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.720
And he continued to go
down that rabbit hole,

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.380
and we all, unfortunately, know
what happened in that tragedy.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:40.030
Alexandre Bissonnette--
Quebec City--

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:44.170
same situation--
murdered six people,

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.730
who were praying in a
mosque because of propaganda

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.490
and online misinformation.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:56.320
James Jackson, just a couple
of weeks ago, in New York City,

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.090
went and murdered a
black man and tried

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.880
to stop interracial
relationships

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.020
because of the things
he was reading online.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:11.530
Really happy that this one
was classified as terrorism,

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.840
and it's only the second
time that white extremism

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:16.140
has been classified as
terrorism in the United States.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:18.220
The first one was the
Oklahoma City bombing

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:24.220
with Timothy McVeigh, who was an
avid attendee at Aryan Nations.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.710
Without the resources of
calling it terrorism, I'm afraid

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.260
and I'm alarmed that we will
not be able to combat it

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.340
the way it needs to.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.020
Since 9/11-- most of
you may not know this--

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.170
but more Americans have
been killed on US soil

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.960
by white extremists than by
any other foreign or domestic

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.410
terrorist group combined
by a factor of two,

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.780
yet we still don't
call it terrorism.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.370
We hardly hear
about it on the news

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.960
unless it's a very
high-profile attack.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.100
So what I decided to do,
because of all the influence

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.860
online for young
people, was that we

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.460
were going to start doing
interventions online.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.930
So we launched an initiative
called ExitUSA.org,

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:13.157
and it's just a simple website.

00:30:13.157 --> 00:30:14.740
It's just a contact
form, where people

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.030
can contact us confidentially
and without judgment

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.160
if they want help
leaving these groups.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.630
As you can imagine,
sometimes it's

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.320
a dangerous thing
to do to leave.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.600
They're also kind of testing
the waters to make sure

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.420
that they can trust
us because they're

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:35.140
afraid that we may be law
enforcement or turning them in.

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.970
And when we establish
that rapport with people,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.050
we've had almost a
100% success rate

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:44.180
of helping people disengage.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.700
I just want to tell
you a little bit--

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.200
actually, I what I
want to do is one

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.991
of the initiatives that
we launched online,

00:30:49.991 --> 00:30:53.720
with the help of YouTube, that
I'm very, very proud of was--

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.487
and thanks, Josh, who
just left for a call.

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:58.820
That's what I want an Emmy
for, so I'm very proud of it.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.296
This is a one-minute
PSA that I'd

00:31:00.296 --> 00:31:01.670
love to show you
that we actually

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:07.070
ran on YouTube in front of hate
videos as a non-clickable ad,

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.757
so you couldn't remove the ad.

00:31:08.757 --> 00:31:09.590
You had to watch it.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.780
So we're essentially
making these people, who

00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:14.840
were in this movement, watch
our video ad before they

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.962
watched the propaganda video.

00:31:16.962 --> 00:31:17.670
Can we play that?

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:18.336
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.310
- I was out there that night--

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:26.840
drunk, stupid, and
looking for a fight.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.270
- When my mom found out I
was gay, I was 13 years old.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.720
She threw me out the front
door, locking it behind her,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.520
and that's the last
time I ever saw my mom.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.210
- Someone yelled,
get the faggot.

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:45.300
I kicked him in the head
and watched it snap back.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.300
- I remember looking
into those eyes.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.970
The moment I saw him
again, I had to think,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.080
can I forgive him?

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.460
- I spent half my life
thinking that I killed him.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.950
I feared what I
didn't understand,

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:04.120
and that fear turned
to hate and violence.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:08.080
Hate is like a cancer
that will eat you alive.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.610
- Until there's nothing
left to forgive.

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.690
- If you or someone you
know is in a dark world

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:16.630
that hate takes you
to, we can help--

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.984
no judgment, just help.

00:32:18.984 --> 00:32:20.812
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:21.892 --> 00:32:24.350
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: We were
very successful with that ad.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.426
We ran it for only three weeks,
and the Wall Street Journal

00:32:27.426 --> 00:32:29.300
actually ended up writing
an article about it

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.950
because, just in
those three weeks,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:33.260
eight people reached out
to us that we've helped

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.307
disengage from these movements.

00:32:36.307 --> 00:32:38.390
I just want to talk to you
a little bit about some

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.848
of the cases that
I'm seeing, and I

00:32:39.848 --> 00:32:42.810
think this is also important.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.000
This is Grace.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.030
Grace is a 17-year-old
girl from Florida.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:50.502
Her parents contacted me
through ExitUSA, and they said,

00:32:50.502 --> 00:32:51.960
we're concerned
about our daughter.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.220
She's making these
neo-Nazi propaganda videos.

00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:00.020
They're horrifying, and she
has this 23-year-old boyfriend,

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.430
who lives in Idaho, who
essentially recruited

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.732
her and is writing the
scripts for these videos.

00:33:07.732 --> 00:33:08.690
So I started to dig in.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:12.740
I got a little information on
both the girl and her boyfriend

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.600
just so I could do some
research about what

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.070
I was getting myself into.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.640
And I had an email and
a name and an address,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.220
and I started to, for
about three weeks,

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.650
go really deep into a rabbit
hole, a really fascinating

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:28.850
rabbit hole.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.700
What I discovered was that
this man was not only doing

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.010
this to her, but he was
doing it to 12 other girls

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:37.250
at the same time, some
as young as 14 years old.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.190
He would become
their boyfriends.

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.730
He would only communicate
with them over the phone

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.260
or through email
or text message.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.640
He would do Skype sessions
without the video,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.130
and if he would
send a video, it was

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.890
obvious to me, when I looked at
it, that it was somebody else's

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.200
video that he had
stripped the audio

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.660
and recorded his own audio on.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.030
I was able to do reverse
image searches on Google--

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.520
thank you very much--

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.700
to actually find out
which original pictures

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.690
he had used and
altered as his own.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:13.100
So when I presented it to
this girl and her family,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.370
what I discovered was that this
man was not a 23-year-old boy

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:17.130
from Idaho.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:22.429
He was actually a 37-year-old
man from Moscow, Russia.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:26.199
And the rest of his
group around him

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.270
that was also working
to spread propaganda

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.770
and a white nationalist
movement had

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:35.300
created over 100,000
social media profiles that

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.659
were using chatbots and
artificial intelligence

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.929
to put out misinformation,
but also to engage

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.150
in conversation with people.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.110
Those accounts were
pro-Trump and also

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.300
very neo-Nazi at the same time.

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.600
They were fake accounts
that were just being--

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.690
technology was kind of
propagating these messages.

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:59.360
But they were also creating fake
Black Lives Matters accounts

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.360
and fake jihadist accounts
all with the purpose

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.950
of trying to put
out misinformation

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.576
against each other to
rile up everybody else.

00:35:07.576 --> 00:35:11.150
I eventually turned over
that information to the FBI,

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:13.582
and when I met with the girl
and her parents, of course,

00:35:13.582 --> 00:35:15.790
she didn't believe me because
this was her boyfriend,

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:18.010
so she leaked the
information to him.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:21.730
And within an hour of me
leaving her house, 75 domain

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.800
names that I own
for my nonprofit,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.140
my business, my mother's
business friends

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.270
were all hacked
by Russian malware

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.570
and pointed to porn
sites in Russia.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.930
So our sites were shut
down for a couple of weeks.

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.570
I'm happy to say that I've
been working with Grace

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.150
for about seven months.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.690
What I've done with her
is I've immersed her

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.560
into situations where she is
connecting with people that she

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.730
thought she hated.

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:52.060
I introduced her to a
96-year-old female Auschwitz

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.871
survivor, who is now her mentor.

00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:57.370
And they're really good friends,
and they talk all the time.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:36:00.370
They bonded over
playing the violin.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:04.870
And it's those situations of
meeting the people that you

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.744
keep outside of
your social circle

00:36:06.744 --> 00:36:09.160
and understanding them and
having a meaningful interaction

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.650
that really changes
people's perspective

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.590
because the ideology
is not a driver.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:15.460
It's community.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.600
It's identity.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.070
It's that sense of purpose.

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:21.490
The ideology is just a tie
that binds them together

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.840
and gives them
license to be angry.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.110
And I can tell you that
there are striking parallels

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:31.020
between why people
join ISIS, why

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.660
they join a white
nationalist movement,

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.100
or even why they join a gang.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.350
And we're starting to
understand those connections,

00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.690
that it really is not
necessarily driven

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.760
by ideology, that
it's actually the need

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.610
to belong to something
that makes them

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:49.190
vulnerable to the ideology.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.200
I also want to tell
you about Darrell.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.050
Darrell is a 31-year-old
man from Buffalo, New York.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.290
He called me after
reading my book,

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.630
and he said I have
some questions.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:03.370
And I said, OK, so I talked
to him for several weeks.

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:05.950
And then one day,
he told me that he

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.960
saw a Muslim man
praying in the park

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.246
when he was walking
with his daughter,

00:37:11.246 --> 00:37:13.120
and all he wanted to do
was go up to that man

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.250
and kick him in the face when
he was on the ground praying.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.029
And I said, OK, Darrell, well,
I'm flying to Buffalo tomorrow.

00:37:19.029 --> 00:37:21.570
I don't know what you're doing,
but you're taking the day off

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.520
because we really need to talk.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.290
And when I got there,
I asked him-- first

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.330
question I asked him
was, have you ever

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.150
met a Muslim person before?

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:32.680
He said, no, why would
I want to do that?

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.540
They're evil.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:37.350
They're the enemy, and I don't
want to be anywhere near them.

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:38.740
I said, OK.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.872
I excused myself.

00:37:39.872 --> 00:37:40.830
I went to the bathroom.

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.620
I got out my phone, and I
googled the local mosque

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.130
in town.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.410
And I was very quiet
in the bathroom,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.510
and I got on my
phone, and I called.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.930
And I said, imam, I have a
man here who is a Christian.

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.410
He would really love to learn
more about your religion.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.655
Can I bring him over?

00:37:56.655 --> 00:37:58.530
And he said, yes,
absolutely, bring him over.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:37:59.410
I'd be happy to talk.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.660
But I've only got 15 minutes.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.910
I'm preparing for
a prayer service.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.530
I said, OK, we'll be right over.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.810
When we got there, we
had 10 minutes left.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.884
And I knocked on the door,
and the imam answered.

00:38:08.884 --> 00:38:10.300
He said, I've only
got 10 minutes,

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:12.900
but please come in and talk.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:17.170
Well, three hours later, we left
the mosque after sitting down

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:20.230
and discussing religion and
talking about all the things

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.530
that were in this man's
head that he didn't--

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.350
it wasn't really connected
to any reality or logic

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:28.450
or rationale.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:31.570
It wasn't long before they
were hugging and crying.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:35.960
And I'm happy to say that now
Darrell goes to the mosque.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.960
He's still a Christian,
but he volunteers there.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.760
He helps set up chairs.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.290
He cooks food for them.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:44.740
And every Friday, he and
the imam go out for falafel.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.620
They're now very,
very good friends,

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.270
and Darrell is
doing great as well.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.440
Anybody can change.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.780
What I'm trying to
say is that it's

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:01.670
the compassion and the empathy
that we give to those people

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.220
that we despise, that
we hate what they say,

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.920
that changes them.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.085
Here's another example.

00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:11.100
I don't know if you know
who Richard Spencer.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:14.010
Is I'm sure you've
heard his name recently.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:16.530
But I was giving a talk last
week in Whitefish, Montana,

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:21.050
in his hometown, and I sent him
a direct message on Twitter.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:22.970
And I said, hey,
I'm in your town.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.000
Let's grab a coffee.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.850
And he happened to come
to my talk that night.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:32.680
We spoke for two hours
afterwards, and we just talked.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.200
We didn't battle ideologically.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.170
I listened, and I listened
for those potholes.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.260
And of course, I didn't
change Richard Spencer.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.910
He still hates people.

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.490
He's still pushing
this alt-right agenda.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.760
But I heard things
that will develop

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.130
into something else over time.

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.940
I heard things about those
voids, those potholes

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.050
in his life, and we've
agreed to meet again.

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.330
And I think a seed
has been planted.

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:05.470
At least, it's a good sign
that he gave the peace sign.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.690
But I'm going to
continue talking to him.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.326
While other people
want to punch him,

00:40:09.326 --> 00:40:11.950
I can tell you that, when I was
18 years old, if somebody would

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.450
have punched me
because of my beliefs,

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.910
I probably would have come back
with something a little bit

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.590
more than a punch.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:19.180
That doesn't change anybody.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.430
I know our initial
reaction is to want

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.340
to eliminate and get rid of
the people who are dissenting

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.009
or say things that
we don't like,

00:40:26.009 --> 00:40:27.550
and I'm here to tell
you that we need

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.560
to listen to them
despite how it makes

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.810
us feel because we
need to establish

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.030
that human connection again.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:36.250
That's what helped
me change, and that's

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.370
what I believe will help
change people who are still

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.750
stuck in this movement.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.120
I have a challenge for
you before we open it up

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.810
for questions.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.470
I want you to leave
today, and when you leave,

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.020
I want you to do something.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.220
And that's find
somebody who you think

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:56.890
doesn't deserve a kind word, and
I want you to give it to them--

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.480
or a kind action.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:02.840
Show them compassion,
and see what happens.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:07.330
See how you change, and
see how it changes them.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.140
So I want you to go out there,
and my motto is kind of similar

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:11.430
to Google's-- the do no evil.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.400
Mine is make good happen.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.500
So I want you to go out
there, and I would love

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.417
for you to make good happen.

00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:20.250
Thank you very much.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:22.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:27.105 --> 00:41:28.480
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
And I think

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.940
there is a microphone there.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.980
I don't know if we can
see the Dory questions on

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.020
here too if there's
any to come up.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.910
But please, if you
have a question,

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:38.055
step up to the microphone.

00:41:38.055 --> 00:41:39.180
And I'm happy to answer it.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.650
And you can ask anything
as personal as you'd like,

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.114
and I promise to answer it
as honestly as possible.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.460
AUDIENCE: Hi, Christian.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.120
Great talk.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.570
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Hi.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:56.450
AUDIENCE: What is your take
on this casual kind of racism

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.740
we're seeing that--

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.900
it's not exactly
punching in the face,

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.360
and it's not exactly dressing
up and going to college

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.800
as a racist or
running for office,

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.970
but it's like this kind
of lame, casual commenting

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.940
that I see even teens--

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.340
people we wouldn't assume to
be like this anymore-- doing?

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.450
What do you think about that,
or how do we change something

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.470
like that?

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.011
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
First of all, I

00:42:20.011 --> 00:42:22.520
think it was likely
always there, right?

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.530
It was probably dormant,
lived in the shadows,

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:29.120
and because of our political
climate, a lot of people

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.800
feel emboldened
saying those things

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.280
because, frankly, a lot
of people at the top

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.540
are saying very, very
similar things, right?

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.850
It's shaped to be a
little bit more palatable.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.430
The messaging is a
little bit different,

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:44.940
but the mission is the same.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.270
And I know because this
is the ball that we

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.060
started to roll 30 years ago.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.700
And as far as the
casual comments,

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.950
I don't engage in them.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:59.840
If I do engage, I engage in
a very compassionate way.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.010
And it's hard for people
to shut down compassion.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:06.062
However, if you
attack back, you're

00:43:06.062 --> 00:43:07.770
going to see it just
go on and on and on,

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.610
and you'll see the
polarization go even wider.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.770
Have honest conversations
with people.

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:16.280
Don't necessarily seriously
challenge their narrative.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.900
Just be the message.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.730
Be the message that
you want them to be.

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.830
So if you want them
to be understanding,

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.500
you have to show understanding.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.920
If you want them to be
compassionate or empathetic,

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.730
that's something you
have to do first.

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.750
So that applies to
strangers, and I

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:33.920
think it applies
to people that they

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.350
might be family members that
we block on social media

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:37.850
sometimes.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.130
But I think that we have to
establish that connection.

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:42.710
We have to start by
finding a middle ground

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:46.187
and then go out and talk about
all the difficult things.

00:43:46.187 --> 00:43:48.020
But we have to have
these difficult and very

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.520
awkward conversations.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.810
That's what's going
to connect us again.

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:55.450
Thank you, Sunni.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.171
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Hi.

00:43:57.171 --> 00:43:58.140
AUDIENCE: Wow, cray.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.480
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
Thank you, I think.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:05.400
AUDIENCE: Two questions--
one is about the five years,

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:08.310
right, that there weren't
a lot of details around.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.309
I'm interested in-- I would
imagine there's relapses that

00:44:11.309 --> 00:44:12.600
happen with this sort of thing.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.080
I mean, so much of this is like
an addiction to substance abuse

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.200
and things of that nature.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.250
So you talked about success
rates with your own people,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.610
so I'm just curious what
happened to you personally

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.130
as well as what you see
with some of the people

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:28.180
that you're counseling.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.596
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: I've
never been asked that question.

00:44:30.596 --> 00:44:31.850
That's really a good question.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:34.600
AUDIENCE: The second question I
have is, within that time frame

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.090
too, and then as you
were coming out of this--

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.700
clearly, you deserve
all the credit

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.740
for getting yourself
out of where you were.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.430
But I would imagine there
was someone that helped you.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.580
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI:
A lot of people.

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.600
AUDIENCE: And you didn't
really talk about that,

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.620
so if there's like one
person in particular-- just

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.795
to kind of understand
the support.

00:44:52.795 --> 00:44:53.920
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Sure.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.220
First of all, those five
years were really dark.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.170
I didn't have a steady job.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:02.350
I didn't date.

00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.200
I was still very adamant about
being there for my children

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.400
that I saw every weekend,
but other than that,

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.180
the rest of those five
days, I was deteriorating.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.990
I got into drugs and
alcohol, and I was just

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:16.660
really not treating myself
with a whole lot of respect.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:20.170
I was really ashamed of
what I had been through,

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.960
and I didn't think that
I deserved happiness.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.940
So I was really
going out of my way

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.670
to be extra kind and extra
compassionate to other people,

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.115
but I was completely
ignoring myself.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.890
The second question--
there were a lot of people.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.277
It wasn't just one instance.

00:45:37.277 --> 00:45:38.860
There were so many--
it was like I was

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.590
a pinball in a pinball machine.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.450
It was like everybody
that I touched somehow

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:46.990
would impart on me
some sort of wisdom.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:49.630
And I would take just like
a nugget from everybody,

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.660
and eventually I was able
to put them all together.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.370
When I stopped the ego, when
I stopped thinking and started

00:45:57.370 --> 00:46:01.690
feeling, that's really when
I connected with who I was

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.480
and with the innocence
that I lost at 14 years old

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.180
because I went from this
13 and 1/2 year old kid

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:10.120
to this 14-year-old
monster, essentially.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.180
I was doing things that, not
only most adults don't do,

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:15.910
but most people wouldn't do.

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.370
So it was a very difficult time.

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:23.500
And leaving that, I didn't
have any relapses because one--

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.340
I couldn't go back.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.385
Once I left, there's
no going back.

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:31.799
And two-- I knew how it made
me feel when I was there.

00:46:31.799 --> 00:46:34.090
And even though I was going
through a miserable period,

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:39.580
and it was a very dark time,
I still felt some peace

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.080
that I wasn't involved in that.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.660
And I knew I didn't want
to stir up those feelings

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:48.160
or go back into that confusion.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.760
I knew, at that time, it was
not something I wanted to do.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.172
And pretty quickly
after those five years,

00:46:54.172 --> 00:46:56.380
I started the ball rolling
and doing some of the work

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.690
that I do now and
writing my book.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.700
And writing my book, I
tell you, for 10 years--

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.640
really, it was pretty cathartic.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:06.370
It was pretty therapeutic for
me to even think about some

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:09.820
of the things that I'd
forgotten about myself.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.450
So it's almost like self-therapy
for me to write the book.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:15.770
It was a tough time.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.340
I'm glad I made it past that.

00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:18.977
Yes?

00:47:18.977 --> 00:47:20.560
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for your talk.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.270
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Thank you.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:22.936
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask two questions.

00:47:22.936 --> 00:47:25.830
One is, when you saw
really bad things happen

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:26.760
within your group--

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.880
for example, that girl that
got attacked and was a member--

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.830
how did you explain that
to yourself, like, OK, this

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.350
is right, and I want to be
the leader of this group,

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.840
or how do other people as well?

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.227
And then two-- I know
you're saying you first

00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:42.810
got into contact with different
types of people in your record

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:48.720
store, but I come from a
very white Catholic country,

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.580
and I still feel like
I was always exposed

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.680
to so many different people.

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.950
And I'm just always
on the edge of--

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.950
some people, who are kind of
promoting these hate speeches,

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.340
at the same time, are hiring
people of different races

00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.420
and stuff like this.

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.467
So I'm kind of confused as
to how that comes about.

00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:08.550
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Well,
it's a self-exclusion.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:09.660
So even though you may--

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.250
I mean, I went to high
school with people

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.249
of all different colors.

00:48:12.249 --> 00:48:15.630
And even though I had
access to these people,

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.700
I isolated myself from them.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:21.990
I didn't want to engage with
them because I was afraid.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:25.020
I never admitted it at that
time, but I was afraid.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:27.960
And because I was 14
years old when I got in,

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.820
when I was younger,
I never really had

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.870
access to that
kind of diversity.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.660
And certainly, when I was
14 to the time I was 22,

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.130
I kept myself out of that.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:43.530
It was a choice that I made not
to engage with people until,

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:45.750
because I wanted to
be a good businessman

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:47.490
or because I was
greedy or whatever,

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:49.480
I was forced to engage
with these people.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:53.490
And then I was like, ah, they
don't fit what's in my head.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:56.200
They don't fit
what's in my heart.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:59.260
My reality is not real.

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.572
And that's what helped
me build that bridge.

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:03.780
I forgot your other question.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.100
What was your other question?

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:07.020
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I
was talking a lot.

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:08.400
But my first
question was around,

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.680
when there was acts
of violence, how

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.839
did you describe that to
yourself that that's OK,

00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:15.880
or like anybody in these
types of groups, really?

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.171
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Yeah,
well, we detached ourselves

00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:19.590
from that too.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:24.000
When we hurt somebody, we
weren't hurting a human

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.440
because we had
been so conditioned

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.190
and we conditioned each
other to think and feel

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:33.210
that the people we were
hurting were almost

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:37.290
like an inanimate object,
like a parasite or a cockroach

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:39.690
or a piece of paper that you
could crumple up and throw

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:40.560
away.

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.380
So that's how we
were able to deal

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:47.000
with what we were doing is we
completely detached ourselves.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.850
It became us against the other,
and the other didn't matter.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:55.320
All that mattered to
us was us because we

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.840
weren't able to humanize
them because we never

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.810
interacted with them.

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:04.130
It was almost like a
psychological cut-off,

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:10.500
like a wall that we had built.
And it wasn't until I had those

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:14.010
connections with people that I
realized I didn't want to hurt

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:19.220
them anymore, that I considered
them equal or, in many cases,

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:21.170
even better--

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:22.604
many cases, better than me.

00:50:22.604 --> 00:50:24.020
AUDIENCE: I read
Christian's book.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.130
I highly recommend reading it
because he does really detail

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.110
out where he was at
that moment in his life.

00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:34.160
And it was one of the
most transformative books

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.215
I've ever read.

00:50:36.215 --> 00:50:38.090
So I just really encourage
everyone to do so.

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:40.580
I had the opportunity to
interview Christian afterwards,

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.790
actually, for a book
that I'm writing.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:44.980
And one thing that--

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:47.240
well, many, many
things stuck with me

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.360
after that conversation,
but one thing really

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:55.250
did in which he talked
about a lot of these people

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.980
within these organizations
and hate groups live

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.340
in a reality that's entirely
separate from our own,

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.490
especially in this world that
we live in here at Google,

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.560
where we're extremely blessed.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.030
Can you speak a little
bit more about that,

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:15.000
especially because it's
likely that all of us

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.655
have an unconscious bias towards
some different even individual.

00:51:20.655 --> 00:51:22.300
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Sure.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.695
Yeah, thank you for that.

00:51:23.695 --> 00:51:24.820
It's good to see you again.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.490
There are two
different realities,

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.010
and I think maybe
November after November,

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:35.380
we started to realize
that, that there

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.160
are these two sometimes very
separate tracks with not

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:43.340
a whole lot of bridges
that cross over,

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.130
and we tend to stay
in our comfort zones,

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:49.400
in our bubbles or
our silos and not

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.760
really cross over because
it makes us uncomfortable.

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:56.430
Know that, when we hear them
and think, it's ridiculous.

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:58.550
How can somebody think that?

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.980
They also think that about us.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.180
Those are the two realities.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.110
They think, how can
somebody want diversity?

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:08.210
That's white genocide.

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:11.829
The more people you allow
in that are not white,

00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:12.870
the white people go away.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.420
I mean, it's ridiculous, right?

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.600
But there are two very
distinct realities,

00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.770
and we really need to--

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.710
if we ever hope to
eliminate some of this

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:25.480
or to change
peoples perspective,

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.230
we have to be willing
to build that bridge

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.290
and have very, very
uncomfortable discussions

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:31.980
with them.

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.860
And sometimes there
people that we love

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:35.960
and we think we
understand, but when

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.810
we hear something like that,
we think, who is that person?

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:40.490
I don't know that person.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:43.100
Well, that person's
the same person.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:47.710
They've just had something
appear in their path

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.305
that changed their direction
at some point-- that pothole.

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.174
Just listen, I think,
more than you speak.

00:52:55.174 --> 00:52:57.090
People don't necessarily
like to be talked to.

00:52:57.090 --> 00:52:58.006
They like to be heard.

00:52:58.006 --> 00:53:03.830
So listen, but also
hold people accountable.

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:05.460
It's important to
do that, right?

00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:11.480
If you hear something that you
know is not right or an action

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.970
that you clearly know is
hurting somebody else, including

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:16.730
that person, hold that
person accountable,

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:19.430
but also listen because that
will give you the clues on how

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:21.646
to build that bridge.

00:53:21.646 --> 00:53:23.032
Yes?

00:53:23.032 --> 00:53:25.360
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
for what you're doing.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:27.700
It's very powerful
and important.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.790
What can we, as a society
and as individuals,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:35.800
do to help those marginalized
teens or even younger?

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:39.340
Is there a way we can
engage with the youth

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.680
from an early age,
even elementary school,

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.454
to help teach them empathy and
tolerance to help prevent this?

00:53:47.454 --> 00:53:49.870
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Yeah,
well, that's a great question.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.150
And I think that you
answered, partly,

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:55.060
your question is we really need
to be there for young people

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:56.950
as early as possible
from the day they're

00:53:56.950 --> 00:54:00.430
born to not only
teach them empathy,

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:02.140
but to provide them
with opportunity

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.450
and to amplify their
passions, right?

00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:07.284
I just said young people
don't like to be talked to.

00:54:07.284 --> 00:54:08.200
They like to be heard.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.109
We need to listen
to young people.

00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:11.650
They have something
important to say.

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:12.820
They're passionate.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.730
Their ideas may not
be completely formed.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:19.090
They may not have the experience
that maybe some of us have,

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:21.262
but we need to be there
to amplify their passions,

00:54:21.262 --> 00:54:23.470
to really listen to them
because I could to tell you,

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.940
if I was 14 years
old, and somebody

00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.390
would have came
up to me and said,

00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:28.780
hey, you're a really
good artist or you're

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:30.199
pretty good baseball player.

00:54:30.199 --> 00:54:31.990
Let's find a way for
you to do those things

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:33.580
that you love to do.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.960
I would have gone that way.

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.610
I mean, I wasn't
aspiring to be a hater.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:41.077
I came from a family that
was the victim of racism when

00:54:41.077 --> 00:54:42.160
they came to this country.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.940
They were the
victims of prejudice.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.790
It wasn't a part
of my upbringing.

00:54:45.790 --> 00:54:47.410
I didn't even know
what racism was.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.440
Let me just use kind of
a theory that I have.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.350
I think that we should feed
young people, from the day

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:58.212
they're born, ethnic food--

00:54:58.212 --> 00:54:59.920
different food instead
of chicken nuggets

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.753
and grilled cheese
sandwiches because maybe,

00:55:01.753 --> 00:55:03.490
if they're not afraid
of diverse foods,

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:07.150
they won't grow up to be
afraid of diverse people.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:11.350
I think fathers are so,
so important to young men

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:14.929
because what I'm seeing is that
so many of these young men that

00:55:14.929 --> 00:55:17.470
are joining these movements are
doing that because they don't

00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.660
have a connection
to their father,

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.130
because they're trying to be
something for their father.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:26.150
There are a lot of
studies about masculinity

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:29.527
and the extremist movements
that make a lot, a lot of sense.

00:55:29.527 --> 00:55:31.110
So there are lots
of things we can do.

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:35.770
We can do something
kind in a small way

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.750
that, if everybody just
does that extra kind

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.480
thing in their life, well,
that's billions of kind things

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.390
that happen every day
that are extra, right?

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:44.080
Hold the door.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:44.980
Say hi to somebody.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:47.050
Instead of looking
at your pixels,

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.570
look at eyes when you're
walking down the street.

00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.280
There's so many
things that we can

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.620
do that really don't take a
lot of effort that I think

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:55.190
would really go a long way.

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:58.090
But opportunity for young
people is so important.

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:01.060
Instead of after
school day care,

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.520
maybe we should set up
after school incubators

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.590
for young people as
young as six years old

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:09.700
to start playing around with
things that may take them

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.853
down a better path.

00:56:11.853 --> 00:56:13.852
SPEAKER 1: Let's have
this as the last question.

00:56:13.852 --> 00:56:14.830
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: OK.

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.900
AUDIENCE: So thank you,
Christian, always a pleasure

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:17.858
to listen to your talk.

00:56:17.858 --> 00:56:20.050
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Thank you.

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:22.000
AUDIENCE: In
speaking with people

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.840
that have very different
beliefs as you,

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.990
you said hold them
accountable, but you

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:27.370
don't want to be combative.

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:30.560
You know that they are
filled with fake facts,

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:32.140
but I know,
personally, I probably

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:33.569
don't know all of
the exact facts

00:56:33.569 --> 00:56:35.110
unless I Google and
try to find three

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:36.520
other resources immediately.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:41.150
So do you have any
techniques in how to listen

00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:43.780
but also hold them accountable
without being confrontational

00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.045
with your own gut
and moral compass?

00:56:46.045 --> 00:56:47.457
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Sure.

00:56:47.457 --> 00:56:49.540
Well, I'll tell you about
my two-hour conversation

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.414
with Richard Spencer.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.340
We hardly talked about ideology.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:01.240
I asked him about his father.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.480
I asked him about the kinds
of things that he likes to do,

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.590
and I listened.

00:57:05.590 --> 00:57:07.810
And when he would drift
into that ideological space

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.160
and say something
that was a no-no,

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.920
I would tell them
that was a no-no,

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.260
and I would hold him
accountable for that by saying,

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:18.030
that's not something
that I believe in,

00:57:18.030 --> 00:57:21.020
and I would appreciate it
if you didn't say that.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:25.935
And you'd see kind of the
way he would talk shift,

00:57:25.935 --> 00:57:27.560
and he would move on
to something else.

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:30.370
And he'd started to
go talk about how

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:33.940
he wanted to be a theater major,
and when we were walking out,

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.930
somebody had come up
to us and said, hey,

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:37.450
can I tell you how weird
it is that you guys are

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:39.366
both standing here, and
right next door, we're

00:57:39.366 --> 00:57:43.060
doing a rehearsal for a
performance of Cabaret?

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.650
And his face lit
up, and we started

00:57:44.650 --> 00:57:46.441
to talk about theater
and all these things.

00:57:46.441 --> 00:57:48.490
And it's just hold
them accountable

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:51.800
in a non-confrontational
way, but still

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.040
keep that dialogue open.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.690
It would be kind of like
talking to your child, right?

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.860
You wouldn't-- well, but you're
not going to go off and scream

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.099
at your kids and be angry
at them and tell them that

00:58:05.099 --> 00:58:07.390
they're stupid and wrong or
whatever because that's not

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.430
the way you would
handle your kids.

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:13.320
It's almost like we have
to have those kid gloves,

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:17.400
but at the same time,
like, no, that's not right,

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:20.184
and then show them what is right
and have that conversation.

00:58:20.184 --> 00:58:22.350
And they may not agree, and
it may take a long time,

00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:23.880
but that's the way we're going
to get through to people.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.820
I guarantee you, but arguing
is not the way to do it.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.300
I don't know that any--

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.684
aside from a
structured debate, I

00:58:32.684 --> 00:58:34.850
don't know that arguing
with anybody or going to war

00:58:34.850 --> 00:58:38.629
or having a fight has ever
changed anybody's mind.

00:58:38.629 --> 00:58:40.170
I just want to say
thank you so much.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:42.220
Thank you to Josh for having me.

00:58:42.220 --> 00:58:43.760
It was a real pleasure.

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.755
I'm happy to stick around and
talk to anybody afterwards.

00:58:47.755 --> 00:58:50.130
It's really good to be here
again, and thank you so much.

00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:50.970
Thank you, Google.

00:58:50.970 --> 00:58:51.720
I appreciate it.

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:54.470
CHRISTIAN PICCIOLINI: Thank you.
