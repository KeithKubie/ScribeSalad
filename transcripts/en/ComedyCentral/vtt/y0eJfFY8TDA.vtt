- I'm Chris Cotton here at
Comic Con 2018, San Diego

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:05.739 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
showing off my super power
which is telling people

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.574
what their super power could be.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.744
This is Plausible
Power Generator.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.545
Do I get any cool effects?

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:14.014 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think I should get some cool
effects comin' off my face.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.384
(upbeat music)

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:18.885 align:start size:81% position:19%
- What super power
would you want?

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.353
- Flight.

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:21.821 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What does your mum always
scream about you doing?

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.890
What do you always
get in trouble for?

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.358
- Not taking out the trash.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.660 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You could hop on a trash
bag and fly wherever you want,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.895
do you like this power?

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:30.163
- Yes.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:31.231
- But you always have
to take out the trash,

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:32.465
that's the only thing.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.133
You have to take
out the trash now.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.367
- Okay then.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.335
- Remember, the juice
from the trash bag

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.603
does drip onto the ground,

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.772
so you will soil the
people underneath you.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:39.906
- That's good.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.611
- If you could have
any super power,

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.179
what would it be?

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.147
- Immortality.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:49.549
- And what is your worst trait?

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.519
- Probably that
I'm cold-hearted.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.720
- You're a little cold, okay.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.488
So what your power be is,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:59.793 align:start size:97% position:3%
whenever you're mean to
somebody, you become mortal.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.929 align:start size:84% position:16%
But as long as you're
nice to people,

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.564
you have immortality.

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.465
- Well I'm dead.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.100
(laughing)

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.268 align:start size:97% position:3%
- If you could have a super
power what would it be?

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:09.502
- That's a tough one.

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.504
Probably to cure
any known disease.

00:01:11.504 --> 00:01:14.140
- Next question, what is
the trait that people say

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.341
is like kinda your worst trait?

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.476
What do you think it will be?

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Humility is obviously
my worst trait.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.046
- Humility is his worst trait.

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:23.850
Okay, you will be able to
cure someone's disease,

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.554
but for the next 24 hours you
have to have that disease.

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:28.788
- I'd take it.

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:29.956
- So what do you think
I should add to my diet?

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.157 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean, I should
just fix some things,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.192 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm doin' some
things wrong here.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.260
- It's not add, it's take away.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.295
- No I wanna add something.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:36.129
I wanna--

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:37.664
So, time,

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.631 align:start size:72% position:28%
fly,
- Fly, yeah.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.233
- Fly and invisibility.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.835
Okay, now next question.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.803
What is your worst trait?

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:45.205
What is your trait
that people say,

00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.475
oh, you could fix this,
you could become better.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:49.309
- Procrastination.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:50.143
- Organizing.

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:51.111
- Too damn hyper man.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.378
- So you need to calm down?

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.314
- Need to slow down,
need to calm it down.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:56.216
- Your super power would be that

00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:00.753
you can only affect time
when you're meditating.

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:01.988
Yes.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:02.922
- I took yoga and
that was a mess.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:03.790
So this is gonna be hard for me.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.624
- Organization?

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.092
- Yes.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:09.295
- You cannot fly until you're
house is completely clean.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.463
- Oh my gosh.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:13.099 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'll be fine a
couple months from now.

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:13.933
I'll see you guys.

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:14.968
- You will go invisible.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:15.802
- Okay.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:16.636
- You will go invisible.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.904
- All right.

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.139
- Eventually, you
gotta wait for it.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:19.939
- Yeah, eventually
I gotta wait for it.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:20.673
- You gotta wait.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.508
Are we doin' it?

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:22.308
Are we selfie?

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.776
Are we in selfie mode?

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.111 align:start size:97% position:3%
I heard you're a vegan,
that's a pretty awful trait.

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.613
Now if I had to
give you a power,

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.248
what your power would be,

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.283
anything that comes in front
of you that enters your mouth

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.519
it automatically becomes vegan.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.821
That's it, you don't have
to ruin dinners anymore.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.824
So you can only time travel,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.159
when you're doing
something good.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.393
- Yes.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:41.628
- Basically if you're
about to win a game,

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:43.596
you never see the
end of the game.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.064
You never get the satisfaction.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.233 align:start size:94% position:6%
You could teleport but
only when you get annoyed.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.434
- So I'm gonna get so upset

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:49.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
that I need to
teleport outta here.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:50.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah and you can't
fake it either.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:51.738 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like you gotta be
really in your heart.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.438
Your powers are awful.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.206
- I guess so.

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:54.807
- But I mean--

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.075 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But at least I got
powers, that's what matters.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.510
- What's the worst trait
that thing that people

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.679
don't really love
about you too much?

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:00.747
- I'm slop-ish.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.182
- You're slavish?

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.449
- Slop-ish.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.384
- You're slop-ish?

00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.919
You're very sloppy?

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.223
Every time you make something
messy another room gets clean.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.325
Only bad thing about this is

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:13.826
when you clean a room
you dirty up a room.

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:16.629 align:start size:97% position:3%
Half of your life is a mess,
the other half is clean.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.997
It's the duality of man.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:18.831
- Wow.

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:19.832
- Deep isn't it?

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:22.168
- That's a--
- It's deep.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.436
I'm outta here.
