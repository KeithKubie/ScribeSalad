00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.750
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Good morning.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.780
I'm Stephanie Marcus from
the Science, Technology,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.190
and Business Division
here at the Library.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.110
Back in the fall of 2015 when we
were looking at topics that a woman

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.840
from NASA who we work with in
outreach gave us we saw a long list

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.510
of things and there were
so many great topics

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.050
that we did choose eight
instead of the normal six.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.960
But among them was
gravitational waves,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.940
and we were going, "What's that?"

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.240
Nobody seemed to know.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.700
And at that time none had been
detected although they had been

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.510
trying to detect them for
at least 15 years or --

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.810
&gt;&gt; Forty years?

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.300
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Well, a hundred years.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.780
Einstein was the one who
theorized that these things existed

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.550
and sometimes he was poo-pooed
and sometimes he was believed.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.820
And, finally, in February of this
year they had the first detection

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.040
in two of the sites in
Washington state and in Louisiana.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.640
And it was just a chirp from the
collision of two black holes.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.950
So this was really phenomenal
and everybody was so excited

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.800
and we were excited that that
was a topic we had chosen,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.340
and we were looking so savvy.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.050
We always like to be with it.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.730
And people were calling
us and saying,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.430
"You going to have a lecture
on gravitational waves?"

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.230
And we said, "Yes, we are."

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.120
It was originally planned
for November

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.930
but there was a new child
coming into the world

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.350
in Dr. Thorpe's family
on that very day, maybe.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.840
And so we moved it up to August.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.700
And we're glad because
we really wanted to get

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.410
into this topic while it was hot
and it will be hot for a long time.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.710
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: [Inaudible]
the next century.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: So a little bit
about Dr. Thorpe before we start.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.670
He's an astrophysicist

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.710
in the Gravitational Astrophysics
Laboratory at NASA Goddard.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.070
He earned degrees in Mechanical
Engineering and Physics at Bucknell

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.240 position:56%
and an MS in Physics from the
University of Maryland College Park.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.650
So he's been local.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:21.150
And after that he got his
PhD -- where is the PhD --

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.090
Florida, the University of Florida.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.590
So he's also a graduate gator.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.890
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Mm-hmm.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.410
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
And he did a post-doc

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.990
at NASA before he began his
employment there in 2009.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.920
He's received both individual
and team awards at Goddard

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.390 position:56%
for his work on gravitational waves.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.510
So please help me in welcoming Dr.
Thorpe to the Library of Congress.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.060
[ Applause ]

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.360
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Well, thank
you very much Stephanie

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.660
for the warm introduction.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.330
Thanks for everyone for coming, and
thank you very much for the Library

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.660
for inviting me to come out
and have this opportunity

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.960
to talk to everybody.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.070
And I'm ecstatic we've
got a packed house.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.500
So let's just get right to it.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.880
So I figured that since I
was coming to the Library

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.390
of Congress I should do something
related with documents, right?

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.710
Now I'm not a historian.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.010
I'm a scientist.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.240
There are a lot of science
historians that do this stuff

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.960
for a living so I'm going
to, you know, basically --

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.210
yeah, take this with
a grain of salt.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.210
But these are 10 papers that
I picked that I think are sort

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.710
of relevant for telling the
story of gravitational waves.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.520
And so they go all the way from,
not surprisingly, Einstein in 1915,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.980
a hundred years ago, to two
papers from this year in 2016.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.540
You notice these guys both
start with the letter A,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.210
and that's because this is like
a thousand people and this is,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.960
you know, about hundred people.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.780
So that shows you also a difference
in how science has been done

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.750
in the last hundred years, the
era of large collaborations.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.310
So starting right away
with Einstein,

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.220
so this is a paper from 1915.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.930
I don't speak German, but
this basically says, you know,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.530
on the theory of relativity

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.200
or general relativity
and general relativity.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.900
So people associate Einstein
with this idea of relativity.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.200
And some people don't realize

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.370
that there's actually two
theories of relativity.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.610
And the special relativity one
is the one that happened first.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.830
And it's the one that told us about
this idea that there's nothing

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.190
that can go faster than
the speed of light.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.110
And that's one of the
sort of postulates

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.590 position:56%
of the theory of special relativity.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.810
And that was a very successful,
successful theory and in made,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.840
you know, Einstein famous in
sort of scientific circles.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.470 position:56%
But he wasn't really famous in the
general public circles at that time.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.970
But one of the things that
was pretty quickly realized is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.880
that Newton's theory or gravity
which, again, was very successful

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.800
because we could use it to
predict the motion of the planets,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.530
didn't match with special
relatively.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.500
And, in particular, if you
had an object, you know,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.480
some piece of mass, and you
moved it, the information

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.030
that that had moved, you know,

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.020
in terms of the gravitational
information,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.170
in Newton's theory
propagated instantly.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.710
So, a way to think about it is
that if you were to take the sun

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.490
and just, you know,
suddenly make it disappear,

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.320
the Earth would instantaneously
know that it was being,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.760
getting that gravitational field.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.060
And that's the way that it's --

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.280
that sort of information
would be propagating faster

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.580
than the speed of light.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.560
And Einstein said, gosh,
that just can't work.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.370 position:56%
That doesn't, you know, that doesn't
jive with special relativity.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.810 position:56%
And this is sort of showing you that
-- the genius that it's Einstein.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.110
You know, he doesn't say, well,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.410
maybe my theory's wrong
and Newton's right.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.020
He goes, well, maybe our whole
idea of gravity is wrong, right?

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.650 position:56%
And it takes him years and years and
years to finally figure out and come

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.000
up with this theory of general
relativity which I'll try

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.160
to explain a little bit
in the following way.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.360
So we know general
relativity's about gravity.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.820
And if you usually ask
people, you say, well,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.120
how do we know about gravity?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.420
And they say, well, that's easy.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.040
I just drop something and
there you go, gravity, right?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.470
However, you know, you can
imagine if you had a skydiver,

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.560
and I'm being -- this
is a physicist skydiver,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.860
so it's perfectly frictionless
which is not good for it's --

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.300
not good for skydiving but
good for this illustration.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.610
If a skydiver releases
the ball, nothing happens.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.910
It just sits there, right?

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.120
Because they're both
accelerating at the same rate.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.450
And so, you know, I think
everyone would agree

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.000
that somehow gravity's involved
in that problem, but, you know,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.160
somehow it doesn't seem to
be apparent to the skydiver

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.090
when he's measuring this, right?

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.940
And so to make a long story short,
one of the things that turns

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.850
out to really understand the
difference between just the effects

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.350
of acceleration, that is,
doing your measurement

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:18.910
in an accelerating
laboratory versus gravitation,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.190
you need to make a
measurement that's not local.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.630
That is, you need to
compare measurements

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.420
that happen at different places.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.270 position:56%
And this is an illustration of that.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.240
So if you have two balls that are
way up high and you drop them,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.220
you notice that they actually don't
drop in exactly parallel lines.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.000
They actually start to get
closer to one another and that's

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.760
because they're each
travelling towards the center

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.610
of the Earth, not directly down.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.370
So down is a different
direction when you're over here

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.210
and when you're over here, right?

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.660 position:56%
And it's only -- so an accelerating
frame wouldn't give you that effect.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.150
But gravitation does
give you that effect.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.450
And that's a way to sort

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.490
of unequivocally determine the
difference between the fact

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.340 position:56%
that you're just doing a measurement
in an accelerating laboratory

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.780
or you're doing a measurement
where there's gravitation.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.350
So this is a really
fundamental idea for any kind

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.650
of gravitational measurement.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.760
You need to make a measurement
over a long distance.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.730
And when you get to
gravitational weight detectors,

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.030
which we'll eventually
get to in this talk,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.420
you'll see that having a separated
distance is really important, okay?

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.850
And the mathematical name for this
thing is called geodesic deviation.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.800
And it's this idea that
trajectories that are

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.950
in freefall are not parallel.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.610
That is, they can converge
or diverge.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.230
So you also hear this
idea of curved spacetime.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.560
So where does this come from?

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.210
Well, this comes from this idea
that geometry and the geometry

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.540
of curvature is a nice
way to describe.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.130
It's a perfect example of places

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.120
where you have straight
lines that converge.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.310
So you imagine if you have a
person over here on the Equator

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:45.980
and a person over here
on the Equator,

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.330
and they both say they're
going to go north, right,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.310
which on a map projection will
look like it was a straight line,

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.700
they actually come
together, and, in fact,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.250
they meet at the North Pole, right?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.680
So that's an example of lines that
are straight, that is, you know,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.210
straight lines on the surface of
a sphere that converge, right.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.190
And the reason they converge
is because the surface

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.000
that they're on is curved, right?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.350
So people can kind of
picture that in their head.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.980
There's a lot of math behind it.

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.530
But that's the basic idea, right,
is that, that this geometry,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.940
this idea of curvature, can
be used to describe how things

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.880
that are straight lines, just
like those freely-falling balls

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.120
that we had in the last scene,
can converge or diverge.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.030
And it has to do with
the underlying curvature

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.150
of the system that they're on.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.950
So Einstein basically extends
that whole idea to space and time.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.870
And so it's really difficult to
visualize because it's curvature

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.750
in four dimensions and so,
you know, it's almost --

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.900
it's effectively impossible
to visualize other than --

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.790 position:56%
let's saying we imagine we sort of
suppress one of the other dimensions

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.170
and measure that curvature in
that some sort of extra dimension.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.470
So here you have this idea

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.950
that spacetime is this
sort of rubber sheet.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.030
You put something massive
like the Earth on it.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.010 position:56%
The Earth deforms that rubber sheet.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.220
And then the other thing
that's interesting about it is

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.630
that if you have, you know,
any kind of object, you know,

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.360
a ball or even a particle of light,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.900
it's going to follow one
of these straight lines.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.870
But these straight lines now have
curvature to them that are produced

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.070
by that mass, you know, produced
by the mass of the Earth.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.550
And so the way we like to say
how general relativity works is

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.380
that matter tells spacetime
how to curve,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.540
so depending upon the distribution
of matter in the universe,

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.400 position:56%
you get a distribution of curvature.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.110
And curvature, that is, spacetime,
tells matter how move, right?

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.950 position:56%
So if things are in freefall orbits,
their freefall orbits are going

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.680
to be affected by the
background curvature of spacetime.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.830
And in equation form this
is Einstein's equation.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.130
So somebody asked me if I was going

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:33.920
to show Einstein's
equations, there you go.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.590
It doesn't look so hard, right?

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:39.010
So this is an object called
the Einstein curvature tensor.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:42.450 position:56%
So this is a mathematical
description of, you know, spacetime.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.340
You can write down a
curvature tensor for a ball.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.420
You can write it down
for all kinds of things.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.500
And then this is just
some constants.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.380
And then this other bit here is
called the stress energy tensor.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.680
It's basically just a way

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.560
to describe how matter is
distributed in the universe.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.860
So that's really it.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.160
That's Einstein equations.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.660
Now the hard part is
that this is a set

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.040
of coupled nonlinear
differential equations

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.890
and there are very few
solutions to these equations

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.190
in terms of closed from solution.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.720
So you kind of have this
very beautiful theory,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.740
but there's very few
beautiful solutions, you know,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.920 position:56%
if that's one way to think about it.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.160
So, you know, this
would just be some sort

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.880
of esoteric interesting thing
for mathematicians if it wasn't

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.600 position:56%
for the fact that it actually works.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.790
And so Einstein himself in 1916,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.650
so a year after their
first publication,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.600
sort of suggested three tests.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.140
These are known as the
three classical tests

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.440
of general relativity.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.460 position:56%
And the first one Einstein basically
did himself in that same paper.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.430
And this was because the
planet Mercury had been known

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.290 position:56%
to have an orbit that wasn't closed.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.920 position:56%
And so, you know, all of our planets
are on a slightly elliptical orbit.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.060
And what you could
watch is that axis

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.950
of the ellipse actually processes
around the sun at a very,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.930
very slow rate -- 40
seconds of arc per century.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.450
So a second of arc.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.250 position:56%
So you have 360 degrees in a circle.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.300
You have 60 minutes in each degree,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.100
and 60 seconds in each
minute, right?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.490
So it's a 36-hundredth of a degree.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.160
And then 40 of those per century.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.490
Now that's an incredibly
tiny amount but astronomers

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.230
in the 19th century were already
able to notice this, right?

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.380
So maybe they measured
it as 38 instead of 40,

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.930
but they were already
able to measure those.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.150
And Einstein found that the GR
immediately just predicted this,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.770
and explained why, if you
do the body problem in GR,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.840
that you actually get
this procession.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.550
And it shows it most in Mercury
because Mercury gets closest

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.720
to the sun, and so the GR effects
are biggest when you get nearby.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.590 position:56%
The other one -- and again, this is,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.190
this made him like
pretty famous, right?

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.890 position:56%
But the one that really kicked him
off was this idea of this deflection

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:41.260
of light by massive bodies.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.870
And so in 1916 he predicts this.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.350
It turns out that there's a
major solar eclipse in 1919.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.830
We have another one
coming up next year.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.240
This shows you sort of how, kind
of how rare these things are.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.360
And this guy, Arthur
Eddington, observed this.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.790
Here's a <i>Washington
Times </i>, you know,

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:58.350
are the stars really
where we see them?

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.360
And basically they could
see this deflection

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.800
of the starlight exactly
as Einstein predicted.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.100
Actually, it was interesting.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.340
It took a couple of years but he
actually had to factor two mistake

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.420
in his prediction which he was able
to correct between his prediction

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.940
and the actual opportunity
to observe the eclipse.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.130
And this is what really
makes Einstein famous, right?

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.260
The third test that he proposed
is this thing called gravitational

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.890
redshift which is the idea
that if you send some light

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.560 position:56%
out of a gravitational field it will
change its color due to the fact

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.910 position:56%
that it has to lose energy when it's
leaving the gravitational field.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.890
It took, whoops, it took
until 1959 before Pound

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:32.790
and Rebka were actually able
to make that measurement.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.860
So this is starting to get
you an idea of how long --

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.010
how far ahead the theory was
of the technology, right.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.390
And that's the theme
for the rest of this.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.700
So I mentioned that in Einstein's
equations there's very few closed

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.000
form solutions.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.670
But there's one solution which
Einstein himself recognized

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.170
which is a wave solution.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.440
So this is what we call
gravitational waves.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.600
And so here's, again,
another paper from Einstein,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.340
again a single-author paper, and
he finds out that these waves --

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.370
so, basically, mathematically,

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.000
the equations will
admit a wave solution.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.910
That solves the equations, right?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.950
And so he says, well, gosh,
what's the speed of these waves?

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.600
And when he works it out he
goes that's the speed of light.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.900
He goes, well, that's
kind of interesting.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.800
Maybe that's the way that
gravity can be compatible

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.240
with special relativity, right?

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.520
It's a way that gravitational
information can be propagated

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.300
across the universe is
in gravitational waves.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.650
And, you know, there was a lot
of debate here because this sort

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.200
of shows you how difficult
that the math is.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.650
Einstein and others, and actually
Einstein himself went back

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.270
and forth about, you
know, is this real,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.570
is this a mathematical
artifact, is it real?

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.190
And Eddington, the very
same guy that had made

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.050
that eclipse measurement,
sort of quipped

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.710
that gravitational waves
propagate at the speed of thought.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.420
So, basically, the idea that
they're not real, right?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.050
There just this sort of
figment of the imagination.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.010
And this debate, you know, again,
is confined to this really sort

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.590
of small circle of theoretical
physicists that are working

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:53.440
on relativity, a very new science.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.740
So what would they look like?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.740
Well, they would be
transverse to their propagation.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.020
So, basically, the waves stretch
and squeeze space and time.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.750
And they stretch and squeeze them
in a direction that's orthogonal

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.510
to the way the wave is propagating.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.220
So imagine a wave is going
into our screen here,

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.670
and you see that they
stretch and they squeeze.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.990 position:56%
And they're actually area preserving
which is kind of interesting.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.540
So they stretch on one axis

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.740
at the same time they're
squeezing on the other one.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.800
And then they do the opposite.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.890
They travel at the speed
of light as I mentioned.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.350
And they have two polarizations.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.270
We call this one plus because it
has axes that are sort of plus.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.210
And then this one is at 45 degrees.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.560
We call this a cross polarization.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.350
Yeah. So this is what
Einstein's theory sort of said.

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.800
But, again, we didn't really know.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.570
Is this something real?

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:44.510
So a little bit later, all back
in -- up in 1959, there was,

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:48.110
after a lot of discussion, included
famous physicist Richard Feynman,

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.940
these guys Bondi, Pirani, and
Robinson published this paper

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.610
that really showed that
you could extract energy

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.640 position:56%
from these gravitational waves and,
therefore, they must be real, right.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.540
And this was basically the
argument that they had.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.280
So their argument was,
imagine you had a rod and on

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.230
that rod you had some beads.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.950
And those beads were
a little sticky.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.710
You know, they basically
were able to slide on the rod

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:11.260
but they rubbed a little bit.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.450
And they showed that if you
have a gravitational wave come

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.400
by it makes these beads
go back and forth.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.700
Those beads rub on the rod.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.000
It heats up the rod.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.300
And the rod's warmed up, right?

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.940
And so the fact that energy has
shown up in that rod shows you

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.470
that that energy came from
these gravitational waves.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.630
It's one of these beautiful thought
experiments that sort of shows.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.620
And I was trying to actually
build something like that.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.050
Took, you know, another
40 years, right?

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.610
But, basically, that's
the fundamental idea

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:37.910
that says, you know what?

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.690
It might actually be possible
to detect these things, okay?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.840
So, so that was a very important,
important breakthrough as well.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.740
And at the same time, people
were starting to trying

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.760
to understand well, okay, where
in nature might we actually find

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.060
gravitational waves?

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.690 position:56%
So, again, there was this idea that,
well, general relativity was sort

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.060
of interesting for these
very small effects of things

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.920
like [inaudible] shift of Mercury
and deflecting light by the sun.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.000
But it wasn't really
important for astrophysics.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.730
Well, these guys, Peters and
Matthews, in '63, were able to sort

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:12.310
of do an approximate solution
of Einstein's equations.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:13.890
And I'll talk about
it a little bit more.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.950
But what they basically
showed is for a binary system,

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.400
and binary star systems
of various kinds are one

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.270
of the most common
types of star systems

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.570
that we have in the universe.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.880
Most stars are in binaries.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.430
And they showed that
they actually lose energy

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.740
because they'll radiate
gravitational waves

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.570
and that will affect
the orbit of the binary.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.920
And they made a quantitative
prediction for how fast

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.650
that energy would change

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.100
and basically how strong the
gravitational waves would be.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.600
So here's the basic idea.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.470
So I've got two stars or two
black holes or two neutron stars

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.750
or a planet and a star, you
know, whatever you like.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.490 position:56%
They're orbiting around one another.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.090
And if you work out
Einstein's equations, as Peters

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.030
and Matthews did, you find out
that they, that those stars

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.890
as they orbit will
release energy and momentum

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.560
in the form of gravitational waves.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.050
Now, that energy has to come from
somewhere, and where it comes

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.490
from is in the orbit
of the two objects.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.970
So, basically, they fall
closer to one another.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.900
So if you look at Newtonian
mechanics, when they fall closer

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.830
to one another they
have to speed up, right?

00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:13.560
So they speed up and now
they're closer to one another.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.860
They're moving faster.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.940
And so the amount of energy
they release is even greater.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.120
And so you can very quickly see
that this is a runaway process.

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.120
You basically, you know,
lose a little bit of energy.

00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.420
You get closer.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.720
You lose more energy.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.020
You get closer.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.320
You lose more energy.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.620
You get closer.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:29.920
And it gets up, up,
up, up, up, up, up.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.220
Until eventually these things
crash into one another.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.700
Now, Peters and Matthews could
sort of predict by extrapolating

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.680
where they would crash
into one another.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.980
But the math that they used

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.170 position:56%
to do this extrapolation didn't work
once you got the things really close

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.470
to one another, right?

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.970
Basically, all these approximations
that they had to use break

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.490
down when they try to get the
stars almost touching, right?

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.570
And so, at least for this
part of it, it's interesting.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.470
For this part you're going
to need something new.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.950
And I'll talk about
that in a little bit.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.820
So then this is what
really kicked off the field.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.360
And this is a gentleman
that was working

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.250
up at the University of Maryland.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:04.100
A very accomplished experimental
physicist named Joseph Weber.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.430
And he starts, basically based on
these ideas from Bondi and others,

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:10.650
to build gravitational
wave antennas.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.970
And he calls them these
bar detectors.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:17.090
And lo and behold, he
actually claims to see a event.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.820
And this just sets off the
whole physics community.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.890
So here's basically how
Weber's system he used.

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.010
So he wasn't looking so much
for a binary star system.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:28.530
But he was looking for pulsars
which had been recently discovered.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.570
So pulsar's a rapidly
spinning neutron star.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.950
And the idea is that the
pulsar has a little bump on it.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.110
If it's anything other than a
perfect sphere, it's also going

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.810
to radiate gravitational
waves because, basically,

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:40.460
that bump is going to go whipping
around the top of the pulsar,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.490
and you're going to get
gravitational waves coming out.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.110
So that's the idea here.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.900
And his detector's very simple.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.170
You basically take
a bar of material,

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.480
and you want to have a
material that's got a high

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.780
mechanical quality.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.400
So something like a
metal or a crystal.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.130
You want it to be big so that
it can couple to these waves.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.560
And you want it to sort of
be isolated, so suspended,

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.780
so that it's sort of
free to ring like a bell.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.420
And if these waves come by and
they happen to have the frequency

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.340
that matches the natural
resonance frequencies

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.420 position:56%
of the bar, the bar's going to ring.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.310
And then you just have to
measure the bar ringing.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.370
Now Weber was a very smart
experimental physicist and he knew

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.350
that there could be other things
that might cause the bar to ring.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.650
And so he said, aha.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.950
What I'm going to do is
I'm going to build two bars

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.250
and I'm going to spread them apart.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.660 position:56%
And I'm going to put one at the
University of Maryland and I'm going

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.610
to put one at Argonne
Lab in Chicago.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.900 position:56%
And if they're spread that far apart
it's unlikely that there's any kind

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.260
of effect that can make both of
them go blip at the same time.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.910
And when he sees both of them
go blip at the same time,

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.210
this is from his paper, he
says, gravitational wave, right?

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:42.610
So this got people going, you
know, really excited in the field.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.550
So it generates this
tremendous interest.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.910
So the astrophysicists all
sort of jump out and say, wait.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.050
You know, how big could a mountain
be on a pulsar and how many

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.490
of them should there be out
there, and that kind of thing.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.220
And the experimenters say, well,
I'm going to build a bar, too.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.830
And there's like a dozen
of these major efforts

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.520
that are built all over the world.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.170
And nobody finds anything.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.490
So, first of all, the
astronomers say, you know,

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.020
the rates are just not really
compatible with what you're seeing.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.320
You shouldn't have seen --

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.320
because he claims two or
three possible detections.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.420
And they say, you know, you
just shouldn't see that many.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.390
And the other people
building the detectors,

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.690
even though they're
actually even starting

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.680
to make little improvements,
they don't see anything.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.430
And so eventually people
sort of start to decide

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.240
that Weber must be wrong
despite the fact that, yeah,

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.030 position:56%
to his death he believed that he had
detected the gravitational waves.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.070 position:56%
So it's kind of a mixed legacy here.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.540
So on the one hand, if
it weren't for Weber,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.340
we never would have
gotten all of the interest

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.300
from the astrophysicists and the
experimental physics community.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.120
And on the other hand, we sort
of got the stigma of, boy,

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.220
we're going to need to have an
absolute gold standard event before

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:42.840
we ever claim a real detection.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.220
And so the communities sort

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:49.230
of really felt the
impact of this gentleman.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:53.710
So shortly after this, a gentleman
by the name of Ray Weiss comes

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.320
up with a different kind of
detector based on lasers.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.620
He's working at MIT.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.450
Actually, interestingly
enough, it came out later

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.320
that two Soviet scientists had come

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.120
up with a very similar
idea a little bit earlier.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.250 position:56%
And actually this happened -- anyone
that's worked in physics has found

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.210
that during the Cold War
this happened all the time.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.270
And now there's actually
a lot of, you know,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.100
former Soviet Bloc physicists that
are working in U.S. institutions.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.880
And whenever you talk to them,
they say, "You know that so

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.610
and so knew this before
the" -- yeah, right.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:23.940
There's always the Russian guy
that knew it before we did.

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.240
But in any case.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.570
So Weiss makes some
contributions here.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.870
He built a prototype.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:29.170
And really what's important.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.360
This 1972 paper which is
actually just a publication,

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.520 position:56%
in internal MIT publication, he lays
out the basic fundamentals for one

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.890
of these gravitational
wave detectors.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.620
And this will become the detector

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.410
that eventually makes
the detection in 2015.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.810
So here's the basic idea.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.500
And this is more modern than
his concept at the time.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.800
So you have a laser.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.840
This idea is called an
interferometer, and it dates back

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:53.920
to this guy named Michaelson
who was working

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.160
in the 19th century
looking at ether drift.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.790
And so I have this laser and I have
this thing called a beam splitter

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.390
which basically divides
a light into two paths.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.380
And one light goes down this path;
one light goes down this path.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.020
The purpose of these
mirrors, you basically --

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.350
the light bounces back and forth
between these several times

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:11.700
or several hundred times.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.480
It basically effectively makes
the arm lights much bigger.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.160
And in any event, when
they come back,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.890
if the arms are exactly
the same length,

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.040
then the light comes
right back to the laser.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.480
If they're off a little bit,
then some of the light comes

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.820
out to the photo-receiver.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.120
And you can see from --

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.150
if you remember that cartoon of
how the gravitational wave worked

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.200
where it stretched in one direction
and compressed in the other

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.080
and goes back and forth -- that
this sort of L-shaped detector

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.380
where you measure the difference
between this arm and this arm,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.590
is sort of perfect kind of antenna
for measuring gravitational wave

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.910
because that's exactly
what it looks for.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.730
It looks for difference in
lengths between these two arms.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.120
And so that's the basic idea.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.420
So what's the problem?

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.620
So when we work with
gravitational waves we work

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.800
with this thing called
strain, all right?

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.120
So strain, if anybody's in
engineering as I was a while ago,

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.900
is the mechanical quality called
a change in length over length.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.190
And the reason we use strain to
describe how big our waves are is

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.950
because it's space itself
that's stretching, right?

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.030
So if I take space and
if I take this cartoon --

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:10.860
you imagine I made
it twice as big --

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.890
well, then the physical
motion would be twice as big

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.300
because there's twice as much
space between the cartoon.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.940 position:56%
Everything sort of scales up, right?

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.910
So I want to make my detector,
you know, change the length

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:21.640
over length is what the strain is.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.220
And this is a rough estimate
for how big the strain would be.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.220
So you want to have -- so M
is the mass of the object,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.030
R is sort of how close the
objects are to one another,

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.270
so you want to have a lot
of mass in a small space.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.880
D is how far away the objects are,
so you want them relatively close.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.470
And then you have this
kind of nasty factor

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.170
of G squared over C to the 4th.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.920
So G is Newton's gravity constant.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:48.440
That's a number that's like 710
to the minus 11 in standard units.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.430
So that's a tiny number,
and it's squared.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.950
And C is the speed of light.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.450
That's 10 to the 8
meters per second,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.750
you know, 10 to the 4th power.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.890
That's a big number to the
4th power in the denominator.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.890
So this factor is a killer.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.120
And so even if you sort of
pick the most optimistic

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.090
after physical values for these,

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.770
you get a number that's
like 10 to the minus 21.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.720
So that's a sextillionth, a
part in a billion trillion.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.450
Small number.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.630
So, another way to look at that
is that's about the diameter

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.790
of a hydrogen atom divided by
the distance to the sun, okay?

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.960
So that's sort of a reasonable
size amplitude to expect

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.260
for a gravitational wave.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.180
And that's the point which most
people say, that was interesting.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.390
I'm going to go back to doing
something else [laughter].

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.780
But, people like Weiss,
you know, from the '70s,

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.980
continued to push this, right?

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.780
And it eventually became this
thing called LIGO, right?

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.470
So LIGO, the LIGO Project grew
out of this and many other efforts

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.830
around -- so their
efforts around the world,

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.150
and the basically objective
is we're going to really try

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.730
to build something where
we think we've got a chance

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.030
of making a detection.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.330
So they built -- it was funded

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.150
by the National Science
Foundation primarily.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.920
They service some major
contributions

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.310
from international partners.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.450
And there's two sites
housing four-kilometer-long

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.750
L-shaped detectors.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.680
So this one is on the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.140
in Washington state.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.550
This one is in Louisiana.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.380
Actually, this very near where all
this flooding is going on recently.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.020
Fortunately, the detector
was designed

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.640
to handle a thousand-year-flood,
and it seems to be okay,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.940
although many of the
employees are obviously

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.800
in great difficulty right now.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.370
But they started it in 1990.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.550
A lot of pre-project work
was going on in the '80s.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:20.410
It took a while to build it.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.640
There is a major civil
engineering infrastructure here.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.350 position:56%
They did their initial science runs.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.730
Didn't find anything.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.210
They didn't upgrade
to Advanced LIGO.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.230
And in 2015 they turned
on Advanced LIGO.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.530
I think most people know the
story there, but if you don't,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.360
you'll get it in a few slides.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.790
So, while LIGO was
sort of getting going,

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:40.260
there was another really
important event.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.190
And, actually, this
could be claimed as sort

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:43.950
of the first detection
of gravitational waves.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.680
Those of us that work in building
the gravitational wave instrument

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.820
call this an indirect detection.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.580
So if you remember
Peters and Matthews,

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.900
this paper from the early '60s,

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.590
had this idea that as you had
two stars orbiting one another,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.930
they would make gravitational
waves and the orbit would shrink.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.290
And what Taylor Weisberg actually
did is they had a pulsar system,

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.620
and it was -- it actually turned
out to be a binary pulsar system,

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.760
I'll explain what that means in
a moment, that Taylor and one

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.020
of his graduate students
had discovered earlier.

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.970
And they noticed that this thing
was actually shrinking, right?

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.520
And it basically was shrinking
at the rate that was predicted

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.530
by general relativity, and
due to gravitational waves.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.300
So that was this really
important paper

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.410
and what we'll show a
little bit more of it here.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.660
So a pulsar is one of
these neutron stars,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.600
the same kind of this
Weber was looking for.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.160
But in this case, a pulsar has a
little radio beam that's pointed

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.270 position:56%
in a direction that's not the same
as the axis of the star spinning it.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.710
And we actually don't
really know why that --

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:43.080
the details of why that happens,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.930
but these are very common
astrophysical objects.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.900
So if you're a radio astronomer,
you just see this blip going by.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.690
So if you just look at a patch
of the sky, you see blip, blip,

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.550
blip, blip, blip, blip, right?

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.970
And actually when people
first discovered these,

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:56.770
they thought they were
seeing alien civilizations

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.600
because it was such a regular tick.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.220
They said, what could
that possibly be?

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:04.470
Well, it turns out it's a
sort of collapse core of star

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.880
with this radio beam coming out of
it, and it's spinning quite fast.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.970
And it's got so much
rotational inertia, so much mass,

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.900
that there's really nothing that
can affect its spin very much.

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.030
And so it's a very good clock.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:19.430
Now binary pulsars -- imagine
this thing is pulsing but happens

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.520
to be orbiting another neutron star
that's, let's say, not pulsing.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.820
And all you can measure
are these pulses.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.530
But just by timing these pulses,
and if you look over enough time,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.330
and you're clever enough,
you can actually figure

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:32.040 position:56%
out all the parameters of the orbit.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.430
So you can figure out
the masses of the stars.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.730
You can figure out the separations.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.540
You know where they are,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.690
Then you can just plug into
Peter and Matthew's formula

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:42.570
and you can say, you know, how
should the orbit evolve over time?

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:45.450
And the answer is that line.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.020
And the dots are the measurements.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.420
Now if you're in -- if
you ever teach in --

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.080
I think someone we had was a
high school teacher, right?

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.580
If someone does lab and they gave
you this, you'd say, you cheated.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.100
You moved your measurements, right?

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.400
But they didn't.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.910
And for this they get
the Nobel Prize.

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.290
The interesting this is that
Weisberg, the guy that did a lot

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:06.360
of the calculations on the paper,
doesn't get the Nobel Prize.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.490
But Holz, the guy that
discovered the pulsar, does.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:13.640
So it's just sort of the vagaries
of the Nobel Prize system.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.960
But, anyways, this is sort of,
you know, really is the last nail

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.850
in the coffin of the gravitational
wave question, are they real?

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:24.580
Because here we're seeing the
effect of gravitational waves

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.540
on a binary star system
in nature, right, so.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.490
But, again, we're not really
measuring the waves themselves.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.650
We're seeing that the waves are
sucking energy out of the system.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:34.760
Okay. So now I'm going to jump

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.860
up into something a
little bit more modern.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.260
And so that is a paper, actually,
by one of my colleagues, John Baker

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.530
and Joan Centrella, and
several others at Goddard.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.330
There were other groups
around the world.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.160
And what they were trying to
do is they were trying to --

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.770
again, going back to
Peters and Matthews.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.220
They had this, this -- equations
worked sort of for the early part

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.590
of these stars spinning
around one another.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.630
But these equations broke down
when you got really close.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:01.100
And that's because
Einstein's equations,

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.210
there is no close form solution
for two stars orbiting one another.

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.510
It's called the two-body problem.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.310
So in Newtonian mechanics
you can work it out.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.610
Keppler worked it out.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.630
And if you try to do it in
Einstein's equations, you know,

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.790
you can do it -- approximate
solutions for certain situations

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.240
like widely separated stars,
but when you get all the way

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.540
down to the stars, you know,

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.070
orbiting one another really
close, it doesn't work.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.410
So the only way you can do this is

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.220
by a thing called numerical
relativity.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.120
So you basically chop
up Einstein's equations

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.660
and you solve them
in a super computer.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.690
And this is a very
technical computing challenge.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.150
It took about 20 years for
people to be able to do this.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.040
And this sort of an
illustration of two black holes,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.510
their gravitational waves, their
trajectories, and if you're sitting

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.510
in the front, you might be
able to see some of these grids

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.770
which are the computational
meshes that are being used

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.840
to compute Einstein's
equations on a grid there.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.140
So what did they see.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.440
So this isn't exactly
from their paper,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.250
but this is a kind of
representative thing.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.570
This is the waveform.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.580
And so you see it goes up and down
and up and down and up and down.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.280
Now this part back here
is basically what Peters

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.580
and Matthews were seeing, right,

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.040
the fact that you have
these things oscillating.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.630
You get this sort of
sinusoidal gravitational wave.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.150
And if you look carefully you
see that both the frequency

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.450
of the wave gets close --

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.980
gets higher, which means basically
the waves get closer together,

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.280
right?

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.580
So you see them getting
scrunched together.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.970 position:56%
And you see that the height of wave,
or the amplitude of the wave goes

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.390
up until it reaches its maximum.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:27.620
Now we call this a chirp because if
you were to try to make this sound,

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.340
or you play this through, it goes
from low frequency/low amplitude

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.650
to a higher frequency amplitude.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.000
So it goes whoooooop, right?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.750
And that's exactly what a
gravitational wave sounds like,

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.050
right?

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.370
And it was -- numerical
relativity was needed

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:40.730
to get this detail, right?

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.520
So this is what we needed
a super computer for.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.720
This you could do,
you know, kind of,

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.200
kind of with that Peters
and Matthews formula.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.500
This starts to get a little harder.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.440
And when you get up to this part,
you need to have a super computer.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.140
And so the other important
about these wave forms is

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.140
that they can encode
astrophysical information.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.680
So the precise rate at which this
thing rises up tells you something

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.140
about the mass of the
system that's involved.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.220 position:56%
And there's other kinds of
information you can figure out from,

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.600
say, those two different
polarizations.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.160
This is just plotting
one polarization.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.040
But if you plot the other
polarization, you can figure

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.620
out the angle of the
system, and the distance,

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.460 position:56%
and all kinds of interesting things.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.060
So this really critical for
being able to do science

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.220
with the gravitational waves as
opposed to just detecting them.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.630
So here's a picture of a chirp.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:21.930
So we're in a library.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.670
This is the library at my alma
mater, at Bucknell University.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:28.510
And you're going to
see it get chirped.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.570
[ Laughter ]

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.760
I didn't have time to do one
at the Library of Congress.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.460
But, right?

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.800
So I did that with my laptop.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.610
So, basically, that's -- you
see, you see -- I'll play it --

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.350
Let me see if I can play it again.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.650
All right.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:46.950
So what you see is that the --

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.310
that wave is increasing in
amplitude and in frequency.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.380
So they get stretched more and
more and more and faster and faster

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.320
and faster, and then it
rings down after the merger.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.610
So that's what a chirp looks like.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.530
Now that's a maximum strain
of about 10% as opposed

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.110
to 10 to the minus 21, right?

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.560
So that's why, if you plot
it with 10 to the minus 21,

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.190
it doesn't look like much.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.240
Okay. So now we'll get to the,
for the rest of the talk here,

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.820
the main events, which is
what happened last year.

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.170 position:56%
And, actually, it was last September
that the detection was made.

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:17.610
And it wasn't until February
that it was announced.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.410
So Advanced LIGO, which is
this major upgrade to LIGO.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.440
Remember LIGO was built -- they did
this several years of science run.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.000
They didn't detect anything.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.470
So then they went and they
did this upgrade and, again,

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.110
it shows the NSF being,
you know, pretty reasonable

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.470
about saying we're going give you
yet more funding to do an upgrade

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.930
when we haven't detected anything.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.230
So they do this upgrade.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:38.470
And they're in just what they
call their final commissioning.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.510
They haven't officially
started their observing run.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:42.810
So everything's on and basically
configured the same way it's going

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.860
to be during their observing run.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.900
But they're not officially
started yet.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.300
And on September 14th
they get a big signal.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.060
And people said, you know,
was that an injection?

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:54.290
Because occasionally they will
put it in injections to check

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:56.970
that their data pipelines
will actually catch it, right?

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:58.800
And people said, no,
there's no injections

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.200
on the, you know, on that day.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.510 position:56%
And eventually, you know, a bunch
of signal analyses, they figure out,

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:06.880
yeah, that this was real,
and this was two black holes

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.510
and two big black holes
pretty far away.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:12.500
And what was astounding is this
thousand-member collaboration was

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.550
able to keep this thing
secret, mostly, for six months.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.720
And it was eventually
announced on February 11th.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.410
And actually the person
that was most responsible

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.030
for leaking this was not a
member of the collaboration

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.310
and he didn't really know.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.160
But they were pretty
annoyed with him.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.460
I won't name any names.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.050
So, you know, this is all stuff

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.720
from February 12th, or
February 11th, right?

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.020
So, basically, the same day.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.350
So you get, you know,
a nice combination

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.650
of old media and new media, right?

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:42.000
So you got front page above
the fold <i>New York Times </i>.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.060
this is inside one of the
vacuum tubes inside LIGO.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.170
So that people that do their
vacuum engineering are like, aha,

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.290
it was us that got to be on the
<i>New York Times </i>, not, you know,

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.760
not you silly scientists.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:55.030
And here you get Obama
tweeting, you know?

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.530
So that's a kind of
measure of success here.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.830
You get another new media.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.590 position:56%
This is Mark Zuckerberg here from
Facebook posting on Facebook saying,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.940
you know, "This is one of
the greatest discoveries

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.640
of modern science, right?

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.590
And Einstein would be proud."

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.660
And then, finally, this
is from the <i>New Yorker </i>.

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:13.420
And the bird's saying to
the other, "Was that you

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.890
or two black holes crashing into
one another [laughter]," right?

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:19.700
So this really comes into
the public consciousness

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.570
which makes me doing by job easier.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.410
You know, for a while, when
I would sit on airplanes,

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:24.710 position:56%
and people would say what do you do?

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.970
You know, ah, I'm going to have
to explain all this what I do.

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:28.480
And now you just say
gravitational waves

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.080
and [finger snap] bank,
they know it, right?

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.380
So this really great.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.940 position:56%
Although I think the news cycle --
we need some more events [laughter].

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.810
So what do they really see?

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:38.080
So this is what came out
of the Hanford detector.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.750
So here's the detector
in Washington.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:43.590
So you see this is strain in a
unit that it doesn't really matter.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.980
But it's basically in those
10 to the minus 21 units.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.760
So it's bouncing back and forth.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.130 position:56%
And then you see this little wiggle.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:50.460
Now I think most could
would say, really?

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.000
You know, that's, that's it?

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.300
That's a wiggle?

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.090
Well, what really makes this
convincing is if you go look

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.330
at what happened in Louisiana.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.240
So you have to shift the
thing in time a little bit

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.470
because it actually takes the light
in a gravitational wave some time

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.480
to travel across the country.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.170
And look, it's exactly
the same, right?

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:11.690
And even more interesting is
if you match it up with one

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.690
of those numerical relativity
templates, you get the red line

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.240
as a numerical relativity
and then the sort

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.450
of grey lines are the measured
wave form out of the detector.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.310
And they match quite exactly.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:25.530
And by matching them, you get to
sort of choose things like the mass

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:26.830
in order to get the maximum mass.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.550
You're actually going
to measure the mass.

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:29.850
So this is really cool.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.460
Thirty-six solar masses, 29
solar masses, add up to being one

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.670
at 62 solar masses, and at a
distance of 410 magaparsecs.

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.290
So, can anybody tell me
what looks wrong with this?

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.320
Any math teachers -- what's that?

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.620
&gt;&gt; The [inaudible].

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:45.920
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah, right.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.750
So 36 plus 29 equals 65 not 62.

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.050
So, okay, there's some error bars.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.350
Maybe that's what's going on.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:52.860
That's not what's going on.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.270
Three solar masses of energy left
the system in gravitational waves

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:59.920
in less than a second, right?

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.200
So that's -- so we've heard
of E equals MC squared.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.820
If there's one formula everybody
knows, it E equals MC squared.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:08.010
So take the mass of the
sun, multiply it by 3,

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:09.700
multiply it by the
speed of light squared.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.350
You get the amount of
energy that left the system.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.160
A tremendous amount of energy.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.450
The fact that peak power is
about 3 times 10 to the 49 watts.

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.740
That's about a thousand times
brighter than a gamma ray burst

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.150
which is generally considered
the brightest astrophysical

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.450
individualized physical event.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:25.230
It's about 10 times brighter
than all of the stars

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.180
in all the visible universe
combined for that second.

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:31.730
And yet, it was all coming
out in gravitational waves.

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:34.020
No light at all, right?

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.430
So people sometimes say
gravitational waves are weak.

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:37.730
They're not weak.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.030
They're very strong.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.330
They're just hard to detect.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:42.630
Now that wasn't it for LIGO.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.430
So they had their first
observing run.

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.170
So there had been this
sort of series of upgrades

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:48.470
to get Advanced LIGO up
to its full sensitivity.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.740
So this is the big
one on September 14th.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.040
There was a confirmed detection.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.360 position:56%
They had another candidate which
they didn't claim to be a detection.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.780
But it's statistically pretty
likely to be a detection.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.250
Something like, you know,
95% to be a detection.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.170
And then they had another very
strong confirmed detection just

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.680
after Christmas they
called the Boxing Day Event.

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.550
It refers to the international
nature of the collaboration.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.180
And this is during their run
that went up until January.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.840
So that's what we've got so far.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.790
And other interesting thing
-- way to look at this,

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.370
is to compare the black
holes that LIGO has seen.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.350
So these are the two merging
into the one, from the one event.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:24.650
This is the second event.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:25.950
And this is the candidate event.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.860
And then this is all the
black holes we've known

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.390
about to date through
x-ray astronomy.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:33.050
And one thing you notice is that
these ones look kind of different.

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:34.890
In fact, they're much bigger.

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:37.100
And this is already
interesting to astronomers.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.110 position:56%
And this is exactly the reason why
we want to go do gravitational waves

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.500
as astronomers is because, aha,
I can look at a new population

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.620
of sources and I can learn
something new about the universe.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.970
And this is why we want to do
gravitational wave astronomy.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.450
Okay. So I'm to the last paper,
but I'm going to spend a little bit

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:57.270
of time on it because this is the
one paper that I'm an author on,

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.350
and this is the thing
that we're working on.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.440
And we'd like to build a
gravitational wave detector

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.730
in space, and I'll explain why
in the next couple of slides.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.890
But what this paper basically shows
is that largely due to the efforts

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:11.840 position:56%
of the European Space Agency and the
European community, also some effort

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.050
from NASA, we're able to
basically fly a mission

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.990
which is flying right
now which we can sort

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:20.340 position:56%
of demonstrate the technologies we'd
need to build a detector in space.

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.650
And I'll explain a little bit
about why we want to do that.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.750
So people might have seen
the electromagnetic spectrum,

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.730
seeing a charge that looks kind of
like this where you have, you know,

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.660
frequency or wave length running
along the horizontal axis.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.580
And you have things going from
radio waves up through, you know,

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:39.010 position:56%
microwave and infrared and optical
and x-ray and, you know, gamma rays,

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:40.310
and all that kind of thing.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.630
You have the same thing
in gravitational waves.

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:42.930
There's an entire spectrum.

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.330
There's not just one kind.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.130
And we can have the spectrum
basically by their frequency

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.160
of the waves or by the
period of the waves,

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.330
how long it takes them
to go up and down.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.410
And so what I plotted on the
bottom here are the different kinds

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.060
of detector -- well, actually
let me start with the top.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:58.300
I put on the top here the
different kinds of sources

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:01.550
that we think produce waves
in those different bands.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.060
So this purple band here sort
of lines up with this area.

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.660
That tells you that these kinds of
sources will produce frequent waves

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.190
with these kinds of frequencies.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:12.370
These kinds of sources will
produce waves with these kinds

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.280
of frequencies, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.300
So on the bottom I had
different kinds of detectors.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.850
So things like LIGO, which I'll
call terrestrial interferometers,

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.910
can see things from maybe down
to hertz up to like a kilohertz.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:25.390
So they work in this band.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.370
If you want to go lower,
you've got to go to space.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:29.900
And it's kind of like the
same reason if you want

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.200
to do infrared astronomy.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.730
You've got to get away from
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.030
In this case what we
have to get away

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.940
from is actually the
motion of the Earth itself.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.930
The Earth is sort of
jiggling around so much

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.210
that we can't do low-frequency
gravitational wave detection

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:41.510
on Earth.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.860
The other advantages --
remember that we have strain.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.430
It's this change in
length over length.

00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.590
If I go to space, four
kilometers is sort of expensive

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:49.930
for building vacuum tubes.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:51.360
And, you know, eventually
you have to deal with things

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.860
like the curvature of the Earth if
you want to make it much longer.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.160
In space, I can make it big.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.200
In fact, I'd like to make this
like a million kilometers, right?

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.130
So let me talk a little
bit about the LISA Concept.

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.560
Now I've drawn it.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.570
Here's this sort of -- this
cartoon is not my drawing,

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:08.110
but this sort of cartoon drawing
-- this thing has actually been --

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:11.250
the original sort of napkin sketch
like this was also in the '70s.

00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:13.790
And people have been working
on this since the '80s.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.440
It's just a little
bit farther behind.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.700
And there was a NASA HISA
project where we fleshed this

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.130
out in quite great detail.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.400
But the basic idea is we
want to build this triangle.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.480
The triangle is kind of like
having two detectors with sort

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.610 position:56%
of sharing one arm, so I think of
it as sort of two v-shaped detectors

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:32.530
that are kind of overlapped
or kind of half overlapped.

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.630
So that helps us get
that triangulation

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.450
and the rejecting of
instrument noise.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:40.750
And make the arms big.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.050
So maybe 5 million kilometers,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:44.150
may 1 million kilometers,
something in that range.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.610
So 5 million kilometers
is 14 times the distance

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:47.910
between the Earth and the moon.

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.540
So this is a big telescope.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.830
The arms are actually basically
laser beams which we're using

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.580
to measure between the two
satellites, measure that distance.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:41:00.940
And inside the satellite there's a
little cube that's actually freely

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.240
floating inside the satellite.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.320
And that's the part we're
testing on Pathfinder.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.810
That represents those little
points in general relativity.

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:11.040
So what can we do with LISA?

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.480
So there's a bunch of
different science areas.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.890
I'm going to go over them
in pretty high detail.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.170
But one is you could do the same
thing LIGO does where they look

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:19.810
at black hole mergers,
but you scale up the mass.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.750
So instead of looking at 10 solar
mass black holes, you're looking

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.930
at million solar mass black
holes like the ones we have

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.360
at the centers of galaxies.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.900
And these things are so loud,
there's such a large amount,

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.740
you can see them to the edge
of the observable universe.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:33.850
So, basically, if there's any of
these things happenings anywhere

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.610
in the universe, we can see them.

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:37.630
And the estimates are
something like 10 per --

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:40.360
or a hundred per year for
an instrument like LISA.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.540
And you'd learn about sort of both
how the black holes form and also

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.590
about how galaxies form
because we thing galaxies form

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.530
by basically merging together
and when they have black holes

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.840
in the center, those
black holes will merge.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.580
And we can tract how
those black holes merge

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.990
and learn how the galaxies merge.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:55.390
So that's what we'd
like to do with that.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.690
There's also a really cool event,

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.210 position:56%
so we know there's big massive black
holes at the centers of galaxies,

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:03.870
and occasionally little black
hole will fall into them.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.740
Now oftentimes we see stars
falling into these things

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.230
and it produces an x-ray event
we call a tidal disruption.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.940
And this is a very
interesting event.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.390
But that's because the
star as it gets close

00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:15.970
to the black hole's
gravity gets shredded apart,

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:18.720
and that's actually
interesting for an astronomer.

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.020
But it's sort of bad
if you're trying

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.320
to understand general
relativity because what you'd

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:24.440 position:56%
like to do is drop a particle into
a black hole and watch how it orbits

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.960
and trace out the orbit and
see is it really the black hole

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.580
that Einstein had predicted.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.290
And with a black hole,
if you drop --

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.590
use that as your test particle,
it can't get torn apart.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.990
It's pure gravity, right?

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:37.390
And so this thing can orbit around
and they do these crazy orbits

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.500
and then eventually
plunge into the black hole.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.470
And you can match those
orbits against the predictions

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.740
of general relativity and
probably make the most extreme test

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.340
of general relativity
that's conceivable.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.690
So if you really want to understand
if gravity's going to break,

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:49.990
it's going to break here, right?

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:51.730
So this is where you want
to understand gravity.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:56.940
You can also do some more sort of
traditional astronomy if you will

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:01.530
where we can get a census of
actually millions of these binaries

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.060 position:56%
in the, what we call close binaries,

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.510
which are things we
know from x-ray studies.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.930
Actually many of those black holes
that were in that chart before,

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.670
these kinds of stars that
are in our own Milky Way.

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.340
But they're all emitting
gravitational waves.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:15.250 position:56%
And this actually kind of makes this
cacophony of millions of sources

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:16.550
that are all on top of one another

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.970
and it's a big data
analysis challenge to try

00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:19.270
to pick the individual ones out.

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.830
But we think we could pick
out maybe 10s of thousands

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.130
and actually do things like --

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.550
they'll tell you, well
how many black hole,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.790
black hole binaries are
there in the Milky Way

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:28.490
versus neutron star
black hole binaries

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.170
versus white dwarf,
white dwarf binaries?

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:32.280
You know, these kind of things
that astronomers are interested in.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.810
And we could maybe even do things
like try to map the milky way

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.340
in white dwarf binaries, you know?

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:39.720
How does that distribution in the
galaxies differ from the stars?

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.480
So this is really -- you know, and
another really interesting thing is

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.000
that there's 14 of these
objects that are know right now.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.780
So that is they're physical
really known objects

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.690
which we could point to in a sky.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.820
And you can calculate, you know,

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.760
how big is a gravitational
wave, and could LISA see them?

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.500
And, in fact, LISA could
see them quite easily.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.870
So their source is like guaranteed.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:00.660
You turn them on and they're
just there because they're

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.510
on all the time, these stars.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:04.690
And then, of course, there's
the unexpected sources.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.190
So maybe really exotic physics,

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:11.220
maybe some exotic astrophysics,
or who knows what?

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.320
So that's why we'd like to do this.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.340
So why are we doing this
thing called LISA Pathfinder?

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.140
And I like to call it, for this
thing I call picophobia, right?

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.650
So this is basically the --
and I made up this definition.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:22.950
You won't find this.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:24.360
But this is the extreme
or irrational fear

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.560
of large negative exponents,
especially when related

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.860
to engineering requirements.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.190
So in a place like LIGO, I mean,
yes, many engineers were involved,

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.170
but it was really driven
by experimental physicists.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.650 position:56%
When you go to do something in space
flight, you really don't want people

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.170
like me, you know, the
physicists, in there,

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:40.470
you know, building the spacecraft.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.090
You want the engineers doing
it because they're going

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.450
to do it right, and it's not
going to blow up on the launch pad

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.050
or not going to break, you
know, halfway up there.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.260
So you need to be able to
communicate these requirements.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.050
And a lot of times, you
know, we go and we say, well,

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:52.680
we need to keep this thing
stable to a picometer.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.990
And they go, what's a picometer?

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:59.230
So, really, there's some sort of
this thought that doing something

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.050
like LISA was just too hard.

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:04.640
So instead of doing
LISA we did this.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.030
We cut out one arm.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.360
We put it in a single spacecraft.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.200
We shrunk it down so it
fit in a single spacecraft.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.280
And we got this thing
called LISA Pathfinder.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:15.320
So LISA Pathfinder is two test
masses with a laser interferometer

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.300
between them it's like
this big, right?

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:19.450
So two test masses,
laser interferometer.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.190
So when you do this,
you actually get rid

00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:23.490
of all your gravitational
wave signal

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.160
and you keep all of your noise.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.680
So if you're an astronomer,
that's a bad deal, right?

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:29.530
We keep all the noise
and lose all the signal.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.920
If you're an instrument scientist,
that's actually a pretty good deal

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.660
because you want to
understand the noise, right?

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.520 position:56%
And so for the instrument scientist
this really lets us understand well,

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.590
how well can we put this
test mass in free fall?

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.150
How well can we measure the
distances between these things?

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:43.910
And is it good enough
so that if we scaled it

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.760 position:56%
up to the full detector we could
make the gravitational reproduction.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.500
So here's this idea
of drag-free control.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.990
So when we get up in space,
we have this little cube.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.240
Actually, I have some little
plastic models I can pull

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:58.570
out in the Question
and Answer period.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.590
So you have this cube and we
let it go inside the spacecraft.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.990
So it's actually in a little cavity

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:04.510
in the spacecraft, and
it's freely falling.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.570
So it's not touching
the spacecraft at all.

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.130
So imagine that something comes
and pushes on the spacecraft

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.260
like let's say the
solar wind is a big one.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.620 position:56%
Well now the spacecraft is no longer
in free fall, and it will start

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.870
to move towards the test mass
and eventually crash into it.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:19.170
But we have a sensor
system that senses that

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.730
and we have a thruster system
that can -- counteracts that.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:24.810
And we fly in balance
around that test mass.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.780
And so I like to think of it as a
flying shield that sort of flies

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:29.620
around the test mass
and shields it from kind

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.830
of any external disturbances.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.620
So that's the idea
of drag-free control.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:35.920
So what does things look like?

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.220
So here are their challenges.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.520
So here's our test masses.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.960
We need to isolate them from forces
and we express our requirement

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.050
in acceleration, so 1G, 10
meters per second squared,

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.020
is acceleration on Earth.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:50.490
We want to do femto-G, 10
to the minus 15 of that.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:53.620 position:56%
We need to have thrusters that can
push this several-hundred-kilograms'

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:54.920
spacecraft around.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:58.380
They thrust with precisions
at sort of sub-micro-Newton.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.820
So their total thrust is
in a micro-Newton range.

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:03.420
That's about the weight
of a mosquito in 1G.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.890
And their fluctuation is
10th of a micro-Newton

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.190
or hundredths of a micro-Newton.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.990
That's the weight of the
mosquito's antennae, right?

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:10.290
So that's the kind of fluctuation.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.980
An inkjet printer has a thrust

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.880
of about a hundred
micro-Newtons, right?

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.690
So these are tiny,
tiny little thrusters.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.070
But they have to be very precise.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:19.200
We have to do this precision
optometricalogy [assumed spelling],

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.400
so here we see during
one of the integration,

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.190
this is that interferometer
picture from back here.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.360
That one. So that's what
it really looks like.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.400
And then, of course,
the spacecraft itself --

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.120
this is really where
that picophobia comes in.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:35.520
You have to keep track of it
thermally and magnetically

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.820
and all those kinds of things.

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.120
And one really interesting
thing is you have

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:39.420 position:56%
to keep track of it gravitationally.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:41.670
And that means we need to know
the mass of every single part

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.360
that we put around
because the own --

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.100
the gravity of the spacecraft
itself actually pulls those test

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.400
masses around.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.700
And we have to keep those balanced,

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.340
otherwise they were going
to fall into the walls.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.290
And, for instance, see
these little blue things?

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.210
These are little zip-ties, little
cable-ties, that are holding cables

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.920
that are going to the
photoreceivers.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.810
Well, we care about the
mass of those things.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:00.910
Not because they're going
to keep the spacecraft from,

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.280
you know, being able to launch.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.510
We care about the mass because
they're going to pull the test mass

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:05.960
around from their own gravity.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:10.360
So what they had to do was
they would weigh each zip-tie,

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.150
put it on there, zip it, clip
the end off, weight the clip,

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.170
write down the difference, and
say that's how much mass I left

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.930
in there, and then add that
to their gravity model.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.370
And I mean, it's just incredible.

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.830
That's the kind of
engineering that we had to do.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.870
So here's some pretty pictures
of -- here's integration.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:27.450
So this shows you the
scale of this thing.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.820
It's actually pretty small.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.520
Here's the whole payload
going to the spacecraft.

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.050
So this is the whole
spacecraft here.

00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:35.750
Here's one of the thrusters
which is provided by NASA.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:40.130
And then here is the rocket
in French Guiana getting ready

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:42.910
to be launched last December.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.940
And there is the launch
on December 3rd,

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:49.180 position:56%
UTC December 2nd in East Coast time.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.690
Well, I didn't get to go down
but I got to watch it online.

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:54.990
And, let's see.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.350
What do we do in LISA Pathfinder?

00:48:57.350 --> 00:49:01.060
So, basically, what we do is we've
been running European payloads

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:04.180
which actually several of us in the
U.S. are actual -- also working on.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.840
I ran from March to June.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.790
The NASA payload's
running right now.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:10.070
And there's a mission
extension that just approved.

00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:13.160
It will run through -- from
October 30 to next May.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.820
And what we basically do is
we do two modes of operation.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.420
In one mode of operation we sort
of sit there and measure the noise.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.840
So we want to see how well did
we place these tests masses

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.390
in free fall, right?

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.990
And on another mode, we do
experiments where we try

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:27.870
to understand, well,
what's causing the noise?

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.710
So we maybe deliberately
make something worse.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.950
So like we change the
temperature and we see,

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.250
does that make the test mass move?

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:34.810
And we sort of make these
deliberate couplings

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:36.140
to understand all the noise.

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.680
And eventually we want to build
this thing we call a noise budget

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.640
where you have all the
different contributions that --

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.200
and this is just, you
know, four of them.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.990
But there's like 50 of them.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.390
And we do experiments to understand
all these different things

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:52.010
so that we basically have a model
that we then checked against a --

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.650
against a flight [inaudible] --
against a real piece of hardware.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.190
And now we have a lot of confidence
that if we go to build LISA --

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.840
and we say well what if we make
the temperature like this instead

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.310
of like that, or make
the magnetic field

00:50:02.310 --> 00:50:03.610
like this instead of like that?

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.320
We understand that this -- we can
use that model that's been checked

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.900
against reality to build
the next instrument

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.200
and have a lot of confidence.

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.500
And this is just sort of cute.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.990
This is the way it
really works, right?

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.640
So you have all this grand science
and you end up with one guy typing

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.640
on a laptop and 10
people standing around him

00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.660
with coffee going, is
that the right thing?

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.960
You know, what's going on here?

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.260
Can you make this hurry?

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.560
And this, this is in the
Operations Room in Germany.

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.650
And this is where we spent
a lot of our time recently.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:29.500
So what's the big result?

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.710
So this is the big result
that came out of that paper.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:34.300
It's a little technical,
but since it is our result,

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.750
I wanted to try to go through it.

00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:39.140
So, basically this is a plot

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.910
where on the vertical axis
here you have the acceleration,

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.210
and it's in these funny units

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:46.100
of meters per second
squared per root hertz,

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.630
so forget about the --
figure out the units.

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.890
But meters per second
squared is acceleration.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.290
And it's basically saying how
much acceleration do you have

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:54.820
from ideal perfect free fall?

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.580
And these numbers are
in a logarithmic scale.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.300
So this is 10 to the
minus 12, so a trillionth.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.600
This is a 10th of a trillionth.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.320 position:56%
This is a hundredth of a trillionth.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:09.210 position:56%
And this is whatever the thousandth
of a trillionth is -- quadrillionth.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:12.190 position:56%
So that's the size of these numbers.

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.490
And then over here is
basically frequency.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:17.860
So this is saying if I have
fluctuations in the acceleration,

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:19.320
how fast are those fluctuations?

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.950
So the main point of this is
that you want things to be low.

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:25.130
So the lower they are
on this, the better.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:27.190
And the -- and going from here

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.850
to here is a factor
of 10 better, right?

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:30.870
And from here to here is
another factor of 10 better.

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.360
That's a logarithmic scale.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.280
So this orange line here
is where we said we wanted

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.580
to go for LISA Pathfinder.

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.880
It was a tech demo.

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.780
We weren't going to try to get
to the full mission performance.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:43.680
The green line here is where
we would need to go for LISA.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.920
And this purpose line
here is where we got.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.700
And this white line is basically
-- explain our noise problem.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.000
This is a couple of months old.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.300
We're actually, actually
a little bit better now,

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:53.950 position:56%
actually below the LISA requirement.

00:51:53.950 --> 00:51:55.250
So it was just incredible

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:57.330
because not only did we meet
our requirements and exceed it

00:51:57.330 --> 00:51:59.870
by quite a bit, but we
basically are ready to do LISA

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:02.800
and that's the main
message out of that paper.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.980
So if we look ahead, there's a lot

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.780
of really interesting
things going on.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:11.300
So on LIGO there's some further
upgrades, so basically to get

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:14.280
to their final advanced LIGO
configuration they wanted to sort

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.310
of make some upgrades,
do some science,

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:17.910 position:56%
make some upgrades, do some science.

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:22.250 position:56%
And so since the end of January,
when they stopped their data-taking,

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:24.680
they've been doing major upgrades,
and actually are about to come

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.050
on again in a period
of weeks to months.

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:29.630
So something in like late September
or early October they'll turn

00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:31.820
on again for another six-month run

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.690
with a little bit better
sensitivity.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.410
And you would expect that they
should get at least another handful

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.850
of these black hole
events, maybe even more.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:40.410
So that's really exciting.

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:43.040
Also really exciting on the ground
is this worldwide network that's

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.340
being developed.

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:46.520
So the Italians have a
three-kilometer detector.

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.060
It's a collaboration with
the French and the Germans

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.510
and some other groups as well.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.150
And they're very close
to turning on.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.690
They're hoping to be able to turn
on in this advanced configuration

00:52:54.690 --> 00:52:57.240
and join LIGO during their
second observing run.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.160
Having three detectors really helps
you do the localization and figure

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:03.140
out where on the sky the
signal's coming from.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.430
Interestingly, there have been
efforts for a long time to try

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:08.490
to get a detector going in India.

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.690
They kind of stalled in
the Indian Parliament.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:13.800
The day after the detection, the
Indian Prime Minister tweeted

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.540 position:56%
that he's going to do LIGO in India.

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:19.880
It's called, you know --
and it happened, right?

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.180 position:56%
So I mean, just to get the detection

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.480
and [singer-snap] bang,
they were on it.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.980
And, you know, the Prime
Minister tweets it and all

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.220
of a sudden it gets
right through Parliament.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.310
So, I mean, it was pretty
amazing to see that going.

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.640
The Japanese are building a
detector inside a mountain.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:31.940
They're going to make it cryogenic.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.860
You know, they're sort of trying to
push the next level of technology.

00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.100
They're working very hard.

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:39.980
And then on the, on the -- in
space, for this laser ferrometer

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:42.640
or LISA concept, we
continue go get these results

00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.940
from Pathfinder for the next year.

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.800
And we'll be analyzing them.

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.200
The European Space Agency and
NASA are working right now to sort

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:53.560 position:56%
of figure out how to partner on a
LISA-scale mission with launch maybe

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.310
in the late 2020's,
maybe early 2030's.

00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:58.740
And so this is really
starting to heat up, again,

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.180
largely due to the interest
generated from LIGO.

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.480
There was just a report that came

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.320
out from the National
Research Council last week

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.500
that said the U.S.
really ought to do this.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.390
And so that's very encouraging.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.230
And then two things I didn't
mention, if you noticed,

00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:12.650
when I did the -- with
the spectrum plot.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:13.950
There was two other
kinds of detectors

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:15.250
that were farther down there.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:17.340
So frequencies below what
we could do with LISA.

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.360
There's a thing called
pulsar timing arrays.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.660
And these are kind of cool.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.960
They use those radio pulsars

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.670
as like a galactic scale
gravitational wave antenna.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:26.980
And so they're coming
along quite nicely.

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:29.650
And then there's something called
cosmic microwave background

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:33.160
polarization which actually made a
bunch of news a couple of years ago

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.840 position:56%
where they thought they detected
this polarization signal which comes

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:38.220
from gravitational waves
produced in the Big Bang.

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.500
It turns out that was
probably due to dust.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.490
But the general principle
is still completely valid

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:46.260
and it's very likely that
eventually, you know,

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:48.700
whether it's a period of
years or maybe 10 years,

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.850
these signals will start
to get detected as well.

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.730
So it's a very bright future
for gravitational waves.

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:57.270
And so my last chart in summary
here is basically that, you know,

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.670
if we kind of look at gravitational
waves over the last hundred years,

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.540
they've moved from being a
mathematical curiosity to sort

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.910
of an astrophysical
reality where we knew

00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:06.660
that they would be
in principal there.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:08.350
We could sort of see
them indirectly.

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:10.390
And now they're a new
tool for doing astronomy

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:12.680
that we can measure
gravitational waves with LIGO,

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:14.880
we can understand new kinds of
black holes, we'll soon be able

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.000
to measure them with things
like LISA and pulsar timing,

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.910
and do totally new
kinds of astronomy.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:20.320
So in the next hundred years,

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.150
we're going to extend our
gravitational wave years or eyes

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.900
from just this one little slice of
the frequency spectrum we can do

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:31.290
on the ground to an entire
array of gravitational waves.

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.670
And we'll have all kinds of new
insights for physics and astronomy.

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:38.510
And I think I'll end the talk
there and take questions.

00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:45.120
[ Applause ]

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.420
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
That was incredible.

00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:48.340
And I'm glad you're young
because maybe you'll be able

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.900
to see some of these crazy --

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.200
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: That's the hope.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.500
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: --
advances in the future.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.790
We could either have
questions and answers

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:56.690
or we could have a quiz [laughter].

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:59.970
I think we'll do the
questions and answers.

00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:01.630
And if you would repeat
the question --

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:02.930
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Absolutely.

00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:04.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: -- so everybody

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.960
and we can also get a
[inaudible] on our webcast.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.260
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Am I picking the --

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.560
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
You get to pick,

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.860
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Okay.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.160
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Yes.

00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.460
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: You, sir.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:13.760
&gt;&gt; How do you determine
where the event occurred?

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:16.780
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yes, it's basically
localizations from time of flight.

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:21.240
So with the LIGO detectors,
you have two very separate --

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:23.510
oh, the question is, how do
you determine the location?

00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:24.810
I forgot to do that part.

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.240
So you have the two detectors.

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.700
And the wave basically
hits one detector first

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.240
and then hits the other detector.

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:34.130
And by knowing the time difference,
you can basically draw an arc

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:36.690
on the sky of where it
could have come from.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:40.010
Now, an arc is not that
good for localization.

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:42.680
You can do a little bit better
because, with a little bit

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:45.720
of subtleties of sort of how loud
the event was and everything,

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.780
you can actually constrain that
arc into a little strip on the sky.

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:51.660
But what you can do with two
detectors is still quite difficult

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.270 position:56%
for, say, someone trying to follow
up with it with a optical telescope.

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.020 position:56%
It's just too big of an area of sky.

00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.420
That's why the detector
in Italy and the detector

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:01.800
in India are really important,
because when you get that --

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.390
with those third detectors
and a fourth detectors you get

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:07.140
to draw different arcs
in different directions,

00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.360
and then they only converge
in small parts in the sky,

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:11.480
and you get a little
patch on the sky.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.940
For LISA, because our
sources are long-lived,

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.350
the satellites actually
move in their orbit.

00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:19.510
They're in an orbit around
the sun and so they move

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.930
in their orbit pretty
significantly during the event.

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:25.760
So the event lasts for months
or years, as opposed to lasting

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.500
for a small fraction of a second.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.120
And there we can use
the fact that both --

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.770
you get a modulation in the
amplitude and the strength

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:34.720
of the wave from the motion,
and you get a Doppler shift,

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.640
basically not modulation
of frequency,

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.430 position:56%
but as the satellites are moving
around you can use that to localize.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:42.970
And just behind you.

00:57:42.970 --> 00:57:47.630
&gt;&gt; What can you say in great length
on the gravitational [inaudible]?

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:48.930
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: If you
tell me the frequency,

00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.230
I can tell you the wavelength.

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.950
And so, basically, it's the
same formula you use for light.

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:55.740
They propagate at the speed of
light, and so it's just a ratio

00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.490
of the frequency and the
wavelength gets you the speed.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.230
So for some -- and
that's one of the reasons.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:04.350 position:56%
So for a millihertz-size
gravitational wave, which is what we

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.730
like to go after for something like
LISA, the wavelengths are scales

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.420
of millions of kilometers which is
why we want to build our detector

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.880
to be a million kilometers.

00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:15.250
So, in general -- there's a general
principle for building antennas.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:17.880 position:56%
You want to build your antenna to be
roughly the size of the wavelength

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.400
of the radiation you're
trying to measure.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.230
And that's saying what you're
building, electromagnetic antennas

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:24.190
or if your building a
gravitational wave antenna.

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:25.490
&gt;&gt; So half-way.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Half-way or
quarter-wave or what -- yeah, right.

00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:29.040
I said roughly.

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.340
I'm being a physicist here, right.

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:31.640
Same order of magnitude.

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:32.940
There's on in the back.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.240
There you go.

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.540
&gt;&gt; You said that the events
last [inaudible] months.

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.460
How are you going to distinguish
between two events colliding?

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:39.760
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah, right.

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.150
So, again, so this is a
problem for LISA, not for LIGO.

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.920
So for LIGO, everything
is smaller masses,

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.220
and so it happens more quickly.

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.520
And you have to remember,
when we say smaller masses,

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.720 position:56%
we're still talking about, you know,
tens of times the mass of our sun,

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.640
and they were revolving
around each other faster

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:54.210
than your kitchen blender
goes around, right?

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:55.860
So that's like pow, right?

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:58.480
But for LISA, we're talking
about millions of solar mass,

00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.910
and they're going around
each other every hour.

00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:01.480
So it's much slower, right?

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:04.040
But still that whole
event lasts for sort

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.840
of months where we can detect it.

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.140
And, yeah, you're right.

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.440
We could have multiple events.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:11.390
And so you basically do it the
same way your radio station --

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:14.200
radio receiver in your car can
pick out different stations.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.380
You have to know something
about the --

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.670
about what the signal is
that's being produced, right?

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:22.320 position:56%
So when I turn on the radio I know
that, okay, the radio station I want

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:23.800
to listen to is at this
particular frequency

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.790
and it has this particular
encoding of the information.

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:28.590
That's what the numerical
relativity gets you.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:32.680
It says, I have this template
for a wave form and basically

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.490
if I have multiple signals
I need multiple templates,

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.180
and I try to do a fit of all
the templates at the same time

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.670
to try to pull out the signals.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:41.220
So that's a data analysis
challenge for sure.

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.300
But it's definitely a
-- it's a tractable one.

00:59:43.300 --> 00:59:45.550
And it's actually something that
we've done a lot of work on.

00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:47.430
And we have these things
called mock data challenges,

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:50.880
where basically we get together,
we agree on the types of signals

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:55.320
that could be in a data
stream, and we have one group

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:57.910
of people produce a data
stream with some signals in it,

00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:59.920
and the other people try
to go find those signals.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.220
And we see, can they
find all of them?

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.670
Did they find the right
ones, you know?

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:04.250
And you don't tell them how
many are in there, right?

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:06.330
And they have, you know, a
few months to go find them,

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.360
and then they use their
algorithms on them, they find them,

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.240
and then that seems
to generally work.

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.530
So that's how we do it.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.830
A question back here.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:17.310
&gt;&gt; You talked about
polarized gravity waves.

01:00:17.310 --> 01:00:18.610
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah.

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.910
&gt;&gt; Are you just talking

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:23.040
about linearly polarized
or circularly polarized.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.090
We've got a right-handed
or left-handed --

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:26.390
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Right.

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:27.690
So, well, okay, so the question's

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.440
about polarization and
gravitational waves.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.360
So the polarization's
a little bit different

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.820
than the polarization
that you get for light.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:37.240
And that's -- it's the same
math, but it basically has to do

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.320
with the fact that there's only
a single charge for gravitation.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.780
So there's only a positive mass.

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.640
There's not positive
mass and negative mass.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.360
And so as a result, we have these
quadrupolar fields as opposed

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.080
to dipole fields, and the
polarizations are in a different --

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.590
so there are polarization states.

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:52.310
Mathematically there's six of them.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.000
And only two of them are predicted
to exist from general relativity.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.300 position:56%
And those are the two that I showed.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.280
So there's the plus polarization,

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.060
which is basically doing the
stretching along this direction,

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:02.360
like this.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.660
And then there's a
cross, which is what a 45.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.520
Trying to do my gravitational
wave dance.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.820
So those are the two polarizations.

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:09.730
&gt;&gt; It sounds like electromagnetic.

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:12.440
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: It's very
similar, but rather than the --

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.140
for instance, the polarizations
aren't rotated by 90 degrees.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.470
They're rotated by 45 degrees.

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:19.180
And it's because of the
symmetry of the field.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.690
So, yeah, the math is
the same, but it's --

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:24.470
the intuition's a little
bit different.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:25.780
A question in the back.

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.910
&gt;&gt; In your next 100
years in space --

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.650
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Not my next
hundred years [inaudible].

01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:31.110
I'm not that young.

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:32.410
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am, yeah.

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.650
What are the [inaudible]
discoveries that you can find

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.490
through gravitational
waves, et cetera?

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:37.790
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Well, right.

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:39.690
So there's the Yogi Berra quote
about hard to predict things,

01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:41.510
especially the future, or whatever.

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:44.010
But, you know, I think,
first of all,

01:01:44.010 --> 01:01:47.110
you can look to what LIGO's done
now and see already we saw a class

01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:49.970
of black holes that we
didn't really expect.

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:53.020
These things of the 30
solar mass, 60 solar mass.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:55.300
We didn't really think, you know,
that it really makes it difficult

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.750
for the astronomers who have
tried to figure out, you know,

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:58.060
where those things came from.

01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.360
So that's one example.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:03.950
You could have other kinds of
astrophysical, you know, surprises.

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:05.250
All right.

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:06.550
So maybe there are a thousand
solar mass black holes.

01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:07.850
We don't know, right?

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:09.220
So we think now that there's
basically two different kinds.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.760
There's sort of a tens
of solar mass black holes

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.130
that come from dying stars.

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.890
And there's a million solar
mass black holes that come

01:02:13.890 --> 01:02:15.190
from we don't know where.

01:02:15.190 --> 01:02:16.580
But we know that they're
there, right?

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:17.880
There's all this thought

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.260
that there's been a mass
gap, but maybe there's not.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.380
And the gravitational waves would
be a good way to look at it.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.070
So that's an example sort
of exotic astrophysics.

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.370
There could also be exotic physics.

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:30.420
So if you come up with these exotic
theories like cosmic strings,

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.480
you know, almost all of them
couple to gravity in some way.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.880
And so there's ideas of like
if you have cosmic strings

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:38.160
that have little kinks in
them and those kinks relax,

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.420
they'll produce a little
burst of gravitational waves.

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:41.730
We could go look for those.

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:45.420
I would try to, you know, build
a whole detector to do that.

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.720
Well, I would.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.220
But I wouldn't be able
to get the money to do it

01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:49.770
because it's kind of speculative.

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:53.480
But, you know, it's hard to
predict what you're going to see.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:56.320
So I think broadly speaking
it's, you know, you know,

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.020
astrophysics surprises
and physics surprises.

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.070
And we've got a good chance of
getting after both of those.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.730
There one's in here.

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:08.370
&gt;&gt; If you happen to be looking at
one of these colliding black holes

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.530
that you're seeing gravitationally
with an optical telescope

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.010
or a radio telescope, would
you have seen anything?

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.310
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Okay.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:15.610
Excellent, excellent,
excellent question.

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:16.910
So the question is,
could you see anything

01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:18.390
with electromagnetic telescope?

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:21.830
So, the answer is, in
principle, in principle, yes.

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:23.420
Okay? So it really has
to do with the sources.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.370
And it's actually something that
we'd really like to go after.

01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:27.400
We call it multi-messenger
astronomy.

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.980
So there's this big idea of
multi-wavelength astronomy

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.010
where I look at the same kind of
object with radio waves and optical

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.860
and UV and all kinds of
things, and I put the sort

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.300
of full-color picture together
to understand the object.

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:40.700
Here is the idea is if we could
look at gravitational waves

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:42.550
and electromagnetic
waves at the same time,

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:45.370
I've got completely different and
kind of complimentary channels

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:48.650
of information that I can
use to understand a system.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:51.590
Now for the system that LIGO
saw, it's two black holes.

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:53.240
And black holes are pure gravity

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.970
and they basically don't emit
electromagnetic radiation, right?

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:59.160
So you wouldn't expect that any
kind of telescope could see one.

01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.910 position:56%
Now that said, black holes in nature
are often surrounded by some kind

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:08.200
of gas of something, and they might
make some sort of something, right,

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.550
some little burst, right?

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:12.160
And there actually are people
that were working to try

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.760
to follow up these events.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:17.590
And there was a sort of tentative
maybe correlation with a,

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:20.460
with some gamma rays that were
detected by the Fermi mission.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:23.340
I think it's probably unlikely
that that was actually correlated,

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:27.350
but it was a very, very, very
interesting, interesting paper.

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:30.390
Now, when LIGO starts detecting
things like neutron stars --

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:31.800
so there's a little
bit less massive.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.310
They're going to need a
little bit more sensitivity

01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:34.940
to have a good chance of
detecting those things.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.790
But that's one of the things
they're really going after.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:38.640
Neutron stars are made
out of matter.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.320
They're very similar to black holes
but they're made out of matter.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.150
And when they crash
into one another --

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.340
we have a very high confidence that
they produce, if they're pointed

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.140
at us, they produce gamma ray
bursts which we can see to the --

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.870
way father than we could detect
the gravitational waves from LIGO.

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:55.030
Or, if we're seeing them
from some other angle,

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.050
they might produce a
sort of small super nova.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.350
I think about a kilanova.

01:04:58.350 --> 01:04:59.880
And people are trying
to go after that, too.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.860
So once LIGO starts
seeing gravitational waves

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:05.920
from neutron stars, there will
be a lot of opportunity for that.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.110
And with LISA, there's
also lots of opportunities.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.290
But that's the long answer, okay?

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:11.590 position:56%
That's exactly what we'd like to do,

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:16.120
is we'd like to do
multi-messenger astronomy.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.290 position:56%
Maybe there's one here in the front.

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:22.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is kind
of a practical question.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:26.650
As a physicist, I definitely think
we should be supporting this kind

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:27.950
of research.

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:30.710
And I know that some of
the news releases said

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:36.150
that the European Space Agency
launched the LISA Pathfinder.

01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:42.240
What percent or amount is the U.S.
contributing to this research --

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.540
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Whew.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.840
Hit the political question.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.140
&gt;&gt; -- compared to other countries?

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.440
Do you have any idea --

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.740
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Anybody from NASA
Headquarters here [laughter]?

01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.040
Well, okay.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.620
So the LISA project -- so
there's interest both in the U.S.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.290
and in Europe to doing this thing.

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.590
And back in 2000, the two agencies
got together and started a project.

01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:59.850
And they started a project
to build the full thing.

01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:01.310
And now as part of
that, they said we want

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:02.940
to go do a technology demonstrator.

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:04.480 position:56%
And both the technology demonstrator

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:07.340
and the full mission were
roughly 50-50 partnerships.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:10.350 position:56%
Now the technology demonstrator sort
of started to drag on a little bit.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:12.500
There were some funding
problems on the NASA side,

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.610
some technical problems
on both sides.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:16.800
And basically, the Europeans
doubled-down on their funding

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.900
and spent like 10 times more
money than they were expecting to.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.640 position:56%
And NASA kind of cut if off and
said we're only going to do so much.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:27.240
So for Pathfinder, it's almost
like an 80-20 kind of expenditure

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.750
in terms of 20% NASA
and 80% European.

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:33.360
Now then, at the same time,

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.980
we were still holding
together this idea we're going

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:38.900
to do an equal partnership with
the Europeans on LISA and --

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.740
but back in 2011, NASA
had to kind of --

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.120
we basically had to pull out
because we didn't have the budget.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.170
And so then the Europeans
said well, we're going to try

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:47.940
to make the detector a
little less capable and see

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.270
if we can do it on our own.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:51.570
They've been pushing that idea
for the last several years.

01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:55.730
And now they're starting to make
it look a little bit more real.

01:06:55.730 --> 01:07:00.190
They've gotten a selection, but
with a nominal launch date in 2034,

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.030
which is kind of long
for a lot of us.

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:05.970
And now with all the interesting
gravitational waves there's renewed

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:09.080
interest in the U.S. The
Europeans certainly could use some

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.380
financial help.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.660
I think we could also
provide some technical help.

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.650
And we're trying to work with
Europeans to figure out what kind

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:17.570
of share the U.S. can play.

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:21.740
And actually this report I just
mentioned in the National Academy

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:25.850
that just came out like last week,
was a review of the decadal survey.

01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:28.990 position:56%
So the decadal surveys are things
that set policies for space science.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.140
And one of their main
recommendations was the U.S. should

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:35.890
get back into LISA at the majority
-- you know, at that sort of,

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:38.770
you know, a significant role.

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:41.220
So that's all playing
out now in the politics.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:45.300
But I think it's pretty likely
that we'll have a significant role.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.820
&gt;&gt; But one follow-up.

01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:50.240
I asked that question
because it almost looks to me

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:54.580
like we're repeating the
history of what happened to CERN.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:56.280
I moved up there from [inaudible].

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.580
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:58.880
&gt;&gt; And we had a big
project down there --

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.180
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.480
&gt;&gt; -- that got cancelled.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.700
And now we have nothing in
the area of super colliders.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.000
And there is one --

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.650
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah, people
are aware of that, for sure.

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:11.980
I think that analogy's not lost
on people and I think, you know,

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.730
both the headquarters folks and
the scientists are working hard

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.600
to make sure that doesn't happen.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.900
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Write to your Congressman.

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:21.580
And there will be a collection
at the door for NASA [laughter].

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.650
They probably want us out of here
but do you want to do one more?

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:25.950
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: I'm happy.

01:08:25.950 --> 01:08:27.250
I'll stay until they kick me out.

01:08:27.250 --> 01:08:28.550
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: People
can come up here afterwards.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:30.500
&gt;&gt; It's a good thing because I
have thousands of questions --

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.800
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Thousands?

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.100
Okay [laughter].

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:34.400
&gt;&gt; Believe me.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.700
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Okay.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.000
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] question.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.300
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: How about just one?

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.600
&gt;&gt; A very special question.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.900
Nineteen-nineteen,
Eddington does the experiment.

01:08:40.900 --> 01:08:45.860
Finds it. I'm trying to understand,
why did the general public react

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:49.270
to this information in
the way that the result is

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:53.790
that Albert becomes this iconic
figure of the 20th century?

01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:56.070
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: So the question
is, why did the public react

01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:57.560
to the prediction of --

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.210
the verification of
Einstein's prediction?

01:09:01.210 --> 01:09:05.980
I mean, I think because it was just
-- it was such a wacky prediction.

01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.410
And to have it actually come
true was just sort of amazing.

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.680
I mean, people have this -- I think
largely due to this Einstein --

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.230
they have this idea that
that's how science works.

01:09:14.230 --> 01:09:16.070
That sort of people
sit and they say, well,

01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:17.370
I'm going to make a
theory and I'm going

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.670
to predict what's going to happen.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.970
And then somebody goes
out and measures it.

01:09:19.970 --> 01:09:21.270
That almost never happens.

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:22.990
It usually is the complete
opposite way.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:24.290
We go and measure something.

01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:25.590
We go, what the heck was that?

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:28.060 position:56%
And then the theorists have to
figure out, you know, what it meant.

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:29.720
And it's only those rare cases

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.280
where people make a prediction
that's very outlandish

01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.590
and then it takes a long time and a
significant effort to go verify it,

01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:39.770
that people really become,
you know, lauded and famous.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:42.170
And Einstein's the
key example of that.

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.470
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:44.770
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: And --

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:46.070
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] here is that
we're discussing special

01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:47.370
and general relativity.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:50.640
I would have figured the
population in 1919 was maybe

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.400
at best 10,000 people on the
Earth understood what those papers

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.700
were about.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.000
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: I think that's
probably on the Earth now.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.150
It's still smaller
than that [laughter].

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.450
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:01.830
So why would the general
public react

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:04.450
so something they had absolutely no
idea what they were talking about?

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.750
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: I guess
you would have

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:07.270 position:56%
to ask the sociologists and -- yeah.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:08.570
&gt;&gt; That's what I keep doing.

01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:09.870
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Okay.

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:11.170
&gt;&gt; That's why I'm here.

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:12.470
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Well,
I'm a physicist.

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.770
So I --

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:15.070
&gt;&gt; Still but you're here.

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:16.370
I get to talk to you.

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.670
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah.

01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:18.970
&gt;&gt; Second question.

01:10:18.970 --> 01:10:20.270
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Ooh, ooh.

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:21.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you accept the existence of --

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:22.870
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: I was just
going to say -- okay?

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:24.170
&gt;&gt; Do you accept the
existence of entanglement?

01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:25.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Quantum entanglement.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:26.770
Yes. But it has nothing
to do with this.

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:28.070
&gt;&gt; Well, I understand.

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:29.370
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Yeah, okay.

01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:30.670
&gt;&gt; But I'm just saying, you
know, because [inaudible].

01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:31.970
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Thank you all.

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:33.270
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: All right.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.570
Thanks.

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:35.870
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:38.470
[ Applause ]

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:39.770
&gt;&gt; Ira Thorpe: Thank you.

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:41.070
