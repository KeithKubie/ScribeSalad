1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.230
As we get ready to graduate from college.

2
00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.990
I would appreciate your input on the following question.

3
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.030
I've always loved to take part in a variety of projects and I have ended up in a

4
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.910
leadership position in multiple organizations,

5
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.520
be be it in the student VC from the student body,
my professional fraternity,

6
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:23.260
et cetera.
In a way,
this is,
this was natural to me.
It's about extreme ownership.

7
00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:27.670
Right.
I love what I was doing.
Shouldn't just slough off that.
That phrase,

8
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.330
an extreme ownership.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
That's how it should have been said.
Okay.

9
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:34.090
Is this a okay,
all this stuff.
It's about extreme ownership,
right?

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.020
Can't be that hard.
Right.
Kind of kind of thing.
Of course,
the motor strip.
Right.

11
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.970
Okay.
I loved what I was doing.

12
00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:42.790
I had a vision where to take things and I was chosen to lead,

13
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:46.300
so I felt that I was doing the right thing.
Recently though,

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.220
I've started to feel overwhelmed and feel that my productivity has diminished by

15
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:52.570
being in a managerial position.

16
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:56.620
It seems harder to see the direct output of my work,
but it's as easy.

17
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.070
It's as easy as always to see what's not working.

18
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.820
I don't want to be let go of any projects because I'll still love to make love

19
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:06.370
to take ownership of them and he says,
I don't want to be liquid,

20
00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:11.260
says I don't want to let go of any projects because I still love to take

21
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.690
ownership of them.
Oh yes,
yes,
yes.
Okay.

22
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.650
Loves take [inaudible] identifying symptoms.

23
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.110
Yeah.
You liked the word ownership.
That's like a,
like a really,

24
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.870
I definitely liked the word ownership and as you also know,

25
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:26.940
I also like another word that's dichotomy.

26
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.130
Dichotomy in order to get seen violations here.
All right,
well either either way,

27
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.070
this guy,
he,

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.620
he doesn't want to let go of any projects because I still love to take ownership

29
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.110
of them and lead these organizations,

30
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:42.320
but I think I'm no longer able to handle this much.

31
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.510
How do you balance those things?
Yeah,

32
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.760
so there is a chapter in the dichotomy of leadership called own it all,

33
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.870
but that's not the title of the chapter.
So the title of chapter continues,

34
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.070
it's the title of the chapter is own it all comma,

35
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.730
but empower others.

36
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560
And it sounds like this individual who's getting after it,
for sure.

37
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.730
Props getting after it leader's position,
multiple organizations going hard,

38
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.190
taking ownership.
Very cool.

39
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.670
But it sounds like he needs to lean more towards decentralized command because

40
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.700
just because you take ownership of things doesn't mean you're supposed to do

41
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.150
everything that you take ownership of.
It doesn't,

42
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.980
it doesn't actually doesn't work.
What this,

43
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:31.981
what you need individual is you need subordinate leaders inside these multiple

44
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.530
organizations that you're in charge of,

45
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.090
that you trust and you've got to let them run with the broad guidance and the

46
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.523
mission,

47
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.570
the broad guidance of the mission and with your Commander's intent that that's

48
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.610
how you're gonna work.
As,
so for instance,

49
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.520
when I was in charge of training on the west coast,

50
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.160
I was responsible for a lot of stuff for land warfare,
for maritime operations,

51
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:01.300
dive operations,
air operations,
close quarters,
urban warfare training,

52
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:04.270
mobility training,
heavy weapons,
defensive tactics,

53
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.970
combat leadership in every other block,

54
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.210
four guys that are getting ready to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Oh,

55
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.860
and on top of those tactical things,
I'm in charge.

56
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.350
I'm actually also in charge of safety.

57
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:21.430
And actually also in charge of maintenance and actually also in charge of the

58
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.630
administration of the command.

59
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.060
That's a lot of stuff to be running,
right?

60
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.010
I know that homes is in charge of,
you know,
the VC firm and the student body.

61
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.440
This,
that stuff too.
This is a lot of stuff.

62
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.470
Could I personally manage and conduct all of those things that I was in charge

63
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:44.160
of?
Not even close,
not even close,

64
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.650
not you.
You talk about feeling overwhelmed.

65
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:51.450
You wouldn't last 15 minutes if you tried to be the person that made every

66
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.680
decision in all those different divisions that were inside of the training

67
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:56.514
command.

68
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.870
So I couldn't manage and run them all myself,

69
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.900
but I had great leaders that I trusted that we're going to make things happen.

70
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.330
And I gave them the broad guidance of what we were trying to do,

71
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.960
what they're part of the mission was the parameters that they were allowed to

72
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:20.490
work within and then go get some,
and it's the same thing.

73
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.490
Task Unit Commander,
Taos tasking.
Your commander got two platoons,

74
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.660
plus you've got a squad of augmentees plus you get seabees and you've got an

75
00:04:27.661 --> 00:04:30.990
intel fuse and sal and you got interrogators and you've got radio communications

76
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.420
crew and you've got the it crew and you've got,

77
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.940
you've got the whole tactical operation center that you're running.

78
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.600
And it's the same thing.
Like I can't run all that.
Nope,

79
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.760
no human can run all that.
So what are you,

80
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:46.380
do you have subordinate leaders that have the broad guidance?

81
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:48.810
They understand what the mission is,
they understand the commander's intent,

82
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.510
they go forward and get after it and they,

83
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.750
they know the parameters and sometimes they have issues and when they have

84
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:58.950
issues,
you step in and you give him a hand or sometimes they get all of our box.

85
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:00.360
You've got to put them back in the box.

86
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.680
But it's the same thing.
Even though right now I've got echelon front,

87
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.930
I've got the podcast,
I've got the,
the store,
got the supplements,
the apparel,

88
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:13.870
the online training,
common out,
we got the t,
the real estate,
the gym,

89
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:18.260
you get the list goes on.
And I can't,
I can't run all those things.

90
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.210
But I caught people bleeding those things and run on those things.

91
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.610
And I could do the same thing.
It's like,
Hey,
here's the guidance,

92
00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:27.230
here's the mission,
here's the commander's intent,

93
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.270
here's the sanity check on something.

94
00:05:29.271 --> 00:05:31.010
Here's the parameters we're trying to move within.

95
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:32.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.760
<v 0>And then go,
go and get some.</v>

97
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.290
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.890
<v 0>So if you do well with decentralized command,</v>

99
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.870
you can handle a lot.
Now,
could you possibly bite off more than you can chew?

100
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:46.230
Yeah,

101
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.230
you could get involved in so many things that you don't even have time to

102
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:55.080
monitor the situations at all.

103
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.030
And you don't have time to tell when people are out of their zone or out of the

104
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.410
parameters that they're allowed to work within.

105
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:04.070
Or you don't have time to help when something goes sideways.
You don't have to.

106
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.300
So,
so you could get there.

107
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
And that will happen especially quickly if you have failed to train and mentor

108
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.100
and give directions and give guidance to the leaders that you have that are

109
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.900
actually on the front lines run and things.

110
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:20.743
<v 2>So</v>

111
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.090
<v 0>that's part of it.</v>

112
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320
Now the other part of it is you can't do any of this if your ego will not allow

113
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.890
you to let things go.
I mean,
you literally said,

114
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.360
I don't want to let go of any projects.
I've said this before.

115
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.360
If you want to be in charge of everything,

116
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.420
you have to be in charge of nothing.

117
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.090
You're goal should be an in charge of nothing.

118
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.450
Only if you're in charge of nothing can you truly be in charge of everything?

119
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.840
Because when you're in charge of every single thing,
guess what?

120
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:57.470
You can handle nothing.
You're task saturated.
It doesn't work.

121
00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.913
<v 2>So</v>

122
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.900
<v 0>that's what you need to do.
Get some good solid leaders,
subordinate leaders,</v>

123
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.040
empower them,
train them,
trust them,

124
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.070
make sure they understand where they're going to make sure they understand what

125
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:15.830
the mission is.
Make sure they understand what the goals are,

126
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.770
make sure they understand what things are outside the box that they need to come

127
00:07:21.771 --> 00:07:22.640
and talk to you about,

128
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.490
and then let them rock and roll.
Boom.
