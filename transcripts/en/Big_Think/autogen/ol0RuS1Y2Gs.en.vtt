experience we can look at the areas of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
experience we can look at the areas of
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.070
experience we can look at the areas of
the brain that help us to determine

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
the brain that help us to determine
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.810
the brain that help us to determine
which things in our lives are

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

intense to us this usually occurs within

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
intense to us this usually occurs within
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.360
intense to us this usually occurs within
an area of our brain called the limbic

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370
an area of our brain called the limbic
 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.700
an area of our brain called the limbic
system which is the emotional areas of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
system which is the emotional areas of
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.250
system which is the emotional areas of
our brain particularly areas such as the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260
our brain particularly areas such as the
 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.040
our brain particularly areas such as the
amygdala and the hippocampus which light

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050
amygdala and the hippocampus which light
 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.110

up they go crazy when something really

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120
up they go crazy when something really
 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.480
up they go crazy when something really
important happens in our life the limbic

important happens in our life the limbic
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.820
important happens in our life the limbic
system also helps to write things into

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830
system also helps to write things into
 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.950
system also helps to write things into
our memory so when something happens in

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
our memory so when something happens in
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.630
our memory so when something happens in
our life you know thousands of things

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
our life you know thousands of things

happen to us every day we don't remember
most of them because they don't trigger

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
most of them because they don't trigger
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.970
most of them because they don't trigger
that kind of a response but if somebody

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980
that kind of a response but if somebody
 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.750
that kind of a response but if somebody
you know we get into a fight with

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760
you know we get into a fight with

you know we get into a fight with
somebody will remember that for a while

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350
somebody will remember that for a while
 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.650
somebody will remember that for a while
because it was very emotional to us so

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660
because it was very emotional to us so
 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.940
because it was very emotional to us so
when people have these intense

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
when people have these intense
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760
when people have these intense
enlightenment kinds of experiences not

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
enlightenment kinds of experiences not
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740
enlightenment kinds of experiences not
only do they feel incredibly real at the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
only do they feel incredibly real at the
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780
only do they feel incredibly real at the
moment but they are remembered almost

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
moment but they are remembered almost
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.270
moment but they are remembered almost
for the entire lifetime of the person

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
for the entire lifetime of the person
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310
for the entire lifetime of the person
that they keep coming back to that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
that they keep coming back to that
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109
that they keep coming back to that
experience and they always remember this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
experience and they always remember this
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.490
experience and they always remember this
experience as being that life-changing

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
experience as being that life-changing
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.890
experience as being that life-changing
moment that from that point forward

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
moment that from that point forward
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.059
moment that from that point forward
everything was different

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069
everything was different
 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.009
everything was different
another core element of these

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019
another core element of these
 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.080
another core element of these
experiences for example is a feeling of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090
experiences for example is a feeling of
 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.750
experiences for example is a feeling of
unity connectedness oneness so with the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760
unity connectedness oneness so with the
 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.699
unity connectedness oneness so with the
person the people will often say I felt

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709
person the people will often say I felt
 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.990
person the people will often say I felt
connected with everything in the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
connected with everything in the
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.330
connected with everything in the
universe I felt at one with God there's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
universe I felt at one with God there's
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.830
universe I felt at one with God there's
an area of our brain a parietal lobe

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840
an area of our brain a parietal lobe
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.210
an area of our brain a parietal lobe
which is in the back of our brain and

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
which is in the back of our brain and
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.160
which is in the back of our brain and
this normally takes all of our sensory

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170
this normally takes all of our sensory
 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.960
this normally takes all of our sensory
information and helps us to reconstruct

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
information and helps us to reconstruct
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.339
information and helps us to reconstruct
a sense of ourselves

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349
a sense of ourselves
 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.229
a sense of ourselves
and how that self relates to the world

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
and how that self relates to the world
 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.360
and how that self relates to the world
in some kind of spatial way well we

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370
in some kind of spatial way well we
 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.979
in some kind of spatial way well we
found that this area of the brain in

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
found that this area of the brain in
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.319
found that this area of the brain in
particular starts to quiet down when

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329
particular starts to quiet down when
 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.119
particular starts to quiet down when
people have these profound experiences

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129
people have these profound experiences
 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.430
people have these profound experiences
of oneness or unity now this makes a lot

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
of oneness or unity now this makes a lot
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.080
of oneness or unity now this makes a lot
of sense if it's trying to create your

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
of sense if it's trying to create your
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.970
of sense if it's trying to create your
sense of self and your sense of space if

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
sense of self and your sense of space if
 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.220
sense of self and your sense of space if
it starts to shut down well you lose

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
it starts to shut down well you lose
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.839
it starts to shut down well you lose
your sense of self you lose your sense

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849
your sense of self you lose your sense
 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.849
your sense of self you lose your sense
of space and and I suppose ultimately

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859
of space and and I suppose ultimately
 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.530
of space and and I suppose ultimately
one of the most important aspects of the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540
one of the most important aspects of the
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.150
one of the most important aspects of the
Enlightenment experience is its

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
Enlightenment experience is its
 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.339
Enlightenment experience is its
permanence is that it rearranges the way

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349
permanence is that it rearranges the way
 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.800
permanence is that it rearranges the way
our brain works for the rest of our

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
our brain works for the rest of our
 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.630
our brain works for the rest of our
lives so when people have that

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640
lives so when people have that
 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.970
lives so when people have that
experience and they suddenly now realize

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980
experience and they suddenly now realize
 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.309
experience and they suddenly now realize
what their beliefs are in spirituality

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319
what their beliefs are in spirituality
 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.140
what their beliefs are in spirituality
or their beliefs are about life or death

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
or their beliefs are about life or death
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.869
or their beliefs are about life or death
or whatever there's some incredible

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879
or whatever there's some incredible
 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.640
or whatever there's some incredible
change that occurs perhaps in many

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650
change that occurs perhaps in many
 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.670
change that occurs perhaps in many
different areas of our brain that really

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680
different areas of our brain that really
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.110
different areas of our brain that really
rearranges the way the person thinks the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
rearranges the way the person thinks the
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.670
rearranges the way the person thinks the
way they feel the way they behave in

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680
way they feel the way they behave in
 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.550
way they feel the way they behave in
life and one of the real key areas one

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560
life and one of the real key areas one
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.050
life and one of the real key areas one
last area I'll mention at the moment is

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060
last area I'll mention at the moment is
 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.330
last area I'll mention at the moment is
one of the key areas that seems to be

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
one of the key areas that seems to be
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.860
one of the key areas that seems to be
involved in that is a very central

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870
involved in that is a very central
 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.750
involved in that is a very central
structure called the thalamus and this

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760
structure called the thalamus and this
 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.569
structure called the thalamus and this
is located deep inside the brain some

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579
is located deep inside the brain some
 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:36.979
is located deep inside the brain some
people think that the fact that the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989
people think that the fact that the
 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.330
people think that the fact that the
thalamus is actually the seed of

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340
thalamus is actually the seed of
 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.759
thalamus is actually the seed of
consciousness and it actually takes a

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769
consciousness and it actually takes a
 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.589
consciousness and it actually takes a
lot of our sensory information and sends

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599
lot of our sensory information and sends
 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.729
lot of our sensory information and sends
it to the different parts of our brain

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739
it to the different parts of our brain
 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.440
it to the different parts of our brain
and it helps different areas of our

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450
and it helps different areas of our
 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.240
and it helps different areas of our
brain communicate with each other well

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
brain communicate with each other well
 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.740
brain communicate with each other well
this is an area that seems to be

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750
this is an area that seems to be
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.020
this is an area that seems to be
dramatically changed by these kinds of

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030
dramatically changed by these kinds of
 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.509
dramatically changed by these kinds of
practices and experiences so if you

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519
practices and experiences so if you
 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.039
practices and experiences so if you
think about it if the thalamus has

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049
think about it if the thalamus has
 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.440
think about it if the thalamus has
changed it's really changing a person's

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
changed it's really changing a person's
 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.539
changed it's really changing a person's
overall perceptions of reality the way

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
overall perceptions of reality the way
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.039
overall perceptions of reality the way
they think about reality the way they

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049
they think about reality the way they
 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.960
they think about reality the way they
sense reality and ultimately the way

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970
sense reality and ultimately the way
 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.789
sense reality and ultimately the way
their brain interacts with that reality

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799
their brain interacts with that reality
 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.650
their brain interacts with that reality
these are not experiences that are

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660
these are not experiences that are

these are experiences that are happening
 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.909
these are experiences that are happening
to everyone these are just regular

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919
to everyone these are just regular

people these are people who go to church
 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.800
people these are people who go to church
they're people who are religious people

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810
they're people who are religious people
 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.120

agnostic people who had a drug-induced
 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.230

people who and my favorite some of them

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
people who and my favorite some of them
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.680
people who and my favorite some of them
were just people basically

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690
were just people basically
 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.240
were just people basically
walking down the street or driving their

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250
walking down the street or driving their
 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.220
walking down the street or driving their
car down the street and the experience

just hit them as a neuroscientist if you

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390
just hit them as a neuroscientist if you
 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.330
just hit them as a neuroscientist if you
look at everybody's brain we all have a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340
look at everybody's brain we all have a
 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.310
look at everybody's brain we all have a
lot of the same basic structures in the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320
lot of the same basic structures in the
 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.780
lot of the same basic structures in the
same basic ways we have our frontal

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790
same basic ways we have our frontal
 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.980
same basic ways we have our frontal
lobes and our temporal lobes in our

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990
lobes and our temporal lobes in our
 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.020
lobes and our temporal lobes in our
limbic system and even when you look at

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030
limbic system and even when you look at
 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.850
limbic system and even when you look at
brain scans usually we're not more than

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860
brain scans usually we're not more than
 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.320
brain scans usually we're not more than
five or ten percent different from each

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330
five or ten percent different from each
 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.390
five or ten percent different from each
other so we all have kind of the same

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400
other so we all have kind of the same
 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.610
other so we all have kind of the same
basic circuitry which makes me think

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620
basic circuitry which makes me think
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.740
basic circuitry which makes me think
that the ability to have these kinds of

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750
that the ability to have these kinds of
 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.200
that the ability to have these kinds of
experiences is within all of us it's

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210
experiences is within all of us it's
 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.150
experiences is within all of us it's
just a matter of how one activates that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160
just a matter of how one activates that
 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.860
just a matter of how one activates that
and whether one activates it through a

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870
and whether one activates it through a
 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.470
and whether one activates it through a
very traditional religious path or some

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480
very traditional religious path or some
 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.720
very traditional religious path or some
other more unusual path when you start

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730
other more unusual path when you start
 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.150
other more unusual path when you start
to think about how to induce these kinds

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160
to think about how to induce these kinds
 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.250
to think about how to induce these kinds
of experiences one of the things that to

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260
of experiences one of the things that to
 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.380
of experiences one of the things that to
me is very interesting is that we we

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390
me is very interesting is that we we
 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.630
me is very interesting is that we we
tend to look at kind of the more modern

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640
tend to look at kind of the more modern
 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.420
tend to look at kind of the more modern
technologies and there there's a device

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430
technologies and there there's a device
 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.100
technologies and there there's a device
called transmit transcranial magnetic

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
called transmit transcranial magnetic
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.020
called transmit transcranial magnetic
stimulation which sends magnetic waves

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030
stimulation which sends magnetic waves
 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.990
stimulation which sends magnetic waves
into different parts of the brain

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000
into different parts of the brain
 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.360
into different parts of the brain
there's been some work by other

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370
there's been some work by other
 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.350
there's been some work by other
investigators who have tried to see if

different electromagnetic waves into
areas like the temporal lobe along the

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960
areas like the temporal lobe along the
 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.900
areas like the temporal lobe along the
side of the brain help to induce these

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910
side of the brain help to induce these
 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.170
side of the brain help to induce these
kinds of experiences but for thousands

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180
kinds of experiences but for thousands
 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.490
kinds of experiences but for thousands
of years people have found ways of

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500
of years people have found ways of
 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.200
of years people have found ways of
inducing these experiences and you go

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210
inducing these experiences and you go
 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.000
inducing these experiences and you go
back you know into the shamanic

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.520
you know you push a button or you know
that this is some sort of artificial

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530
that this is some sort of artificial
 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.159
that this is some sort of artificial
stimulation of these experiences for

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169
stimulation of these experiences for
 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.380
stimulation of these experiences for
example a shaman who takes some

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:18.390
example a shaman who takes some
 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.680
example a shaman who takes some
mushrooms to get into a spiritual state

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690
mushrooms to get into a spiritual state
 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.360
mushrooms to get into a spiritual state
that shaman doesn't look at that whole

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370
that shaman doesn't look at that whole
 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.240
that shaman doesn't look at that whole
process as being artificial the that

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250
process as being artificial the that
 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.670
process as being artificial the that
shaman basically looks at it as this is

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680
shaman basically looks at it as this is
 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.620
shaman basically looks at it as this is
what I need to do to get my brain to

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630
what I need to do to get my brain to
 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.750
what I need to do to get my brain to
another level so that I can interact

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760
another level so that I can interact
 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.030
another level so that I can interact
with the spiritual world and part of the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040
with the spiritual world and part of the
 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.710
with the spiritual world and part of the
way I always think about it as a guy who

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720
way I always think about it as a guy who
 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.870
way I always think about it as a guy who
wears glasses and doesn't see very well

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880
wears glasses and doesn't see very well
 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.129
wears glasses and doesn't see very well
when I wake up in the morning the word

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:40.139
when I wake up in the morning the word
 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:42.320
when I wake up in the morning the word
a very blurry place I put my glasses on

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330
a very blurry place I put my glasses on
 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.959
a very blurry place I put my glasses on
in the world becomes clear so what if it

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:44.969
in the world becomes clear so what if it
 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.459
in the world becomes clear so what if it
is that transcranial magnetic

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:46.469
is that transcranial magnetic
 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:49.459
is that transcranial magnetic
stimulation or drugs or you know what or

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:49.469
stimulation or drugs or you know what or
 

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:51.140
stimulation or drugs or you know what or
meditation one of these are like

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150
meditation one of these are like
 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.119
meditation one of these are like
basically putting on glasses for your

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:53.129
basically putting on glasses for your
 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.670
basically putting on glasses for your
brain to see the world in a clearer way

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680
brain to see the world in a clearer way
 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.640
brain to see the world in a clearer way
in a different way but that really was

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650
in a different way but that really was
 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.379
in a different way but that really was
always there in the first place so

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:00.389
always there in the first place so
 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.059
always there in the first place so
there's some very interesting and

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069
there's some very interesting and
 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:03.890
there's some very interesting and
important epistemological questions

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900
important epistemological questions
 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.489
important epistemological questions
about the realness of these experiences

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:06.499
about the realness of these experiences
 

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.899
about the realness of these experiences
irrespective of how they actually wind

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909
irrespective of how they actually wind
 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.209
irrespective of how they actually wind
up getting started and how they become

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219
up getting started and how they become
 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:13.010
up getting started and how they become
induced in that particular individual

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.020
induced in that particular individual
 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.290
induced in that particular individual
but it also raises another kind of

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300
but it also raises another kind of
 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.570
but it also raises another kind of
larger picture question and I challenge

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580
larger picture question and I challenge
 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.399
larger picture question and I challenge
my my own students a lot about this

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:19.409
my my own students a lot about this
 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:21.980
my my own students a lot about this
which is where do all of our experiences

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990
which is where do all of our experiences
 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.899
which is where do all of our experiences
come from when you think about it from

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:23.909
come from when you think about it from
 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.640
come from when you think about it from
the perspective of the human brain and

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650
the perspective of the human brain and
 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.860
the perspective of the human brain and
what I mean by that is is that if you

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870
what I mean by that is is that if you
 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.749
what I mean by that is is that if you
look at what's really going on and

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759
look at what's really going on and
 

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:31.429
look at what's really going on and
what's going on whether or not I've got

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:31.439
what's going on whether or not I've got
 

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:34.879
what's going on whether or not I've got
a drug in my brain or not for neuron to

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889
a drug in my brain or not for neuron to
 

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.730
a drug in my brain or not for neuron to
fire it all sodium and potassium ions

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740
fire it all sodium and potassium ions
 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.439
fire it all sodium and potassium ions
are crossing back and forth across the

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:39.449
are crossing back and forth across the
 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:41.629
are crossing back and forth across the
membrane and it depolarizes the neuron

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639
membrane and it depolarizes the neuron
 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:42.559
membrane and it depolarizes the neuron
and fires

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:42.569
and fires
 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:45.230
and fires
so there's out there there's these ions

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240
so there's out there there's these ions
 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.269
so there's out there there's these ions
that are moving across a membrane they

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:47.279
that are moving across a membrane they
 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.939
that are moving across a membrane they
cause electrical activity which can be

00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:49.949
cause electrical activity which can be
 

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:53.959
cause electrical activity which can be
measured that causes the neuron to turn

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:53.969
measured that causes the neuron to turn
 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.089
measured that causes the neuron to turn
on its metabolic machinery so we can see

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099
on its metabolic machinery so we can see
 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:58.850
on its metabolic machinery so we can see
increases in metabolic activity and how

00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:58.860
increases in metabolic activity and how
 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.040
increases in metabolic activity and how
it's using energy and then there's the

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050
it's using energy and then there's the
 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.779
it's using energy and then there's the
release of all different kinds of

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:02.789
release of all different kinds of
 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:04.760
release of all different kinds of
neurotransmitters in serotonin and in

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:04.770
neurotransmitters in serotonin and in
 

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.249
neurotransmitters in serotonin and in
dopamine the that move across this

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:07.259
dopamine the that move across this
 

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:09.709
dopamine the that move across this
little synaptic cleft and activate

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:09.719
little synaptic cleft and activate
 

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:12.019
little synaptic cleft and activate
another neuron so we're in all of this

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:12.029
another neuron so we're in all of this
 

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:14.809
another neuron so we're in all of this
does the thought occur you know where is

00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819
does the thought occur you know where is
 

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:16.969
does the thought occur you know where is
our thought where is our experience of

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979
our thought where is our experience of
 

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:18.829
our thought where is our experience of
the world when we say we see something

00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:18.839
the world when we say we see something
 

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.540
the world when we say we see something
we feel something we think something

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:20.550
we feel something we think something
 

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.850
we feel something we think something
where and all of that is that really

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860
where and all of that is that really
 

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.700
where and all of that is that really
happening and so if I give person a drug

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:25.710
happening and so if I give person a drug
 

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.829
happening and so if I give person a drug
or if a person meditates or whatever

00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:27.839
or if a person meditates or whatever
 

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.629
or if a person meditates or whatever
that they're doing you know how do i

00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639
that they're doing you know how do i
 

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:32.120
that they're doing you know how do i
altima back to what's going on in the

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.130
altima back to what's going on in the
 

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.399
altima back to what's going on in the
brain itself how reductionistic can we

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:34.409
brain itself how reductionistic can we
 

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.680
brain itself how reductionistic can we
ultimately be or is it possible that our

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:36.690
ultimately be or is it possible that our
 

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.600
ultimately be or is it possible that our
brain is merely just kind of receiving

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:38.610
brain is merely just kind of receiving
 

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.250
brain is merely just kind of receiving
all of this information and certainly

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.260
all of this information and certainly
 

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.259
all of this information and certainly
you know if you go through a kind of

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:42.269
you know if you go through a kind of
 

00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:44.000
you know if you go through a kind of
Buddhist or Hindu perspective on a lot

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.010
Buddhist or Hindu perspective on a lot
 

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.280
Buddhist or Hindu perspective on a lot
of this consciousness is all around us

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:46.290
of this consciousness is all around us
 

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.689
of this consciousness is all around us
and our brain is more like a radio

00:08:47.689 --> 00:08:47.699
and our brain is more like a radio
 

00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:50.000
and our brain is more like a radio
receiver that taps into this universal

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.010
receiver that taps into this universal
 

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:52.100
receiver that taps into this universal
consciousness for a period of time while

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.110
consciousness for a period of time while
 

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.340
consciousness for a period of time while
we're here on earth

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:53.350
we're here on earth
 

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.930
we're here on earth
then goes back to that Universal

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:54.940
then goes back to that Universal
 

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.030
then goes back to that Universal
consciousness when we go away so we

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040
consciousness when we go away so we
 

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.160
consciousness when we go away so we
don't know and and the bottom line is is

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.170
don't know and and the bottom line is is
 

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.110
don't know and and the bottom line is is
that neuroscience is going to have a lot

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120
that neuroscience is going to have a lot
 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.510
that neuroscience is going to have a lot
of difficulty ultimately being able to

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:03.520
of difficulty ultimately being able to
 

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.820
of difficulty ultimately being able to
isolate exactly where these experiences

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:05.830
isolate exactly where these experiences
 

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:08.370
isolate exactly where these experiences
are and how drugs or whatever it is that

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.380
are and how drugs or whatever it is that
 

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:11.100
are and how drugs or whatever it is that
a person is using or doing to and do

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.110
a person is using or doing to and do
 

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.320
a person is using or doing to and do
some kind of experience how that really

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.330
some kind of experience how that really
 

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.850
some kind of experience how that really
is having an effect and where those

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:14.860
is having an effect and where those
 

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.180
is having an effect and where those
experiences truly come from
