[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.270
SPEAKER: Welcome, Anthony
Myint and Karen Leibowitz,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.660
who are husband and wife
co-founders of the Perennial.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.450
This is an award-winning San
Francisco restaurant and bar

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.000
dedicated to making
food the delicious

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.890
solution to climate change.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.905
And when I say
award-winning, I mean Best

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:25.430
New Restaurants in America,
25 Most Daring Companies

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.290
in America, Best
Bars in America,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.364
Best Cocktails in
Francisco, Most Sustainable.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.780
And they've been awarded from
places like Bon Apetit, Food

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.830
and Wine, San Francisco
Magazine, 20 Most Important

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.790
Restaurants in America,
and a Michelin Star.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.990
Pretty big deal.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.780
So let me tell you a
little bit more about them.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.750
Anthony and Karen coauthored
the memoir cookbook

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.930
Mission Street Food, Recipes
and Ideas from an Improbable

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.180
Restaurant back in 2011.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.530
They often work together, though

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.450
Anthony is primarily
a restaurateur

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.660
whose projects include Mission
Chinese Food, Commonwealth,

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.950
and Mission Cantina.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.020
And Karen is primarily
a food writer

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.390
who has written for Lucky
Peach, Food and Wine,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.210
and The New York Times
among other publications.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.550
She's also, though, co-author
with Dominique Crenn

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.890
of Autelier Crenn of
"Metamorphosis of Taste."

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.390
She's the Director
of Communications

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.014
for the Perennial,
and although Anthony

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:17.619
doesn't have an
official title, he's

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.910
responsible for dreaming up
all the weird environmental

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.600
projects.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.040
I'm going to let
them get started.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.292
Welcome.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:27.268
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.970
KAREN LEIBOWITZ:
Well, thanks so much.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.750
Thanks for having us.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.200
I am Karen Leibowitz.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.400
This is Anthony Myint.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.590
The other title we've
come up with for him

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.930
is Problem Solver,
Problem Creator.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.000
So the Perennial is unusual in
the restaurant world in that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.280
it's very mission-driven.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.060
We see it as an opportunity
to engage people

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.790
in the idea of
transforming the food

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.750
system through a kind
of environmentalism

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.410
without compromise.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.949
So here are some pictures
of the Perennial.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:13.360
The bread, which actually
we brought for you today,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.610
which is made from
a perennial grain.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.980
So we'll talk more about
why that's important,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.690
but basically it's part of our
larger project of combating

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.260
climate change through food.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.380
There's our bar, and
cocktails, and beef tartar.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.620
And we'll talk about
why meat is actually not

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.585
off the menu at the Perennial.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:37.960
ANTHONY MYINT: So
I think quickly

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.942
we'll just do a background.

00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:42.400
Thanks for the
introduction, Julia.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.460
And just to clarify one thing,
because sometimes restaurants

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.130
are touchy about
accolades and things--

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.290
so we helped open a restaurant
called Commonwealth,

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.500
and Commonwealth
has a Michelin Star.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.770
So not the Perennial,
though we're hoping someday.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.870
So we have somewhat
humble origins

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.200
in the restaurant industry,
which as Julia mentioned

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.870
are kind of documented in
this book Mission Street Food.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.350
And so it was in 2008 when we
basically kind of got started,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.920
and if you think
back to that time,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.460
there were not really
gourmet food trucks or pop-up

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.750
restaurants.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.970
It was the recession
and people were

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.200
looking for interesting dining
experience kind of on a budget.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.050
And Twitter had just
opened, or started,

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.810
but we didn't really use
Twitter or understand

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.490
any of that stuff.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.010
And we sublet a Guatemalan
snack cart on a Thursday night,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.230
and then basically tried to
serve gourmet tacos from it.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.660
And we never really thought
that that would be successful.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.610
We just were doing
it kind of for fun.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.779
The internet being as such,
things kind of snowballed

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:04.570
and a friend of ours
wrote a blog about it,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.950
and then a local
food press eater

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.280
dot com wrote a story about it.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.670
I think the headline called
me a high-falutin line cook.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.042
And so I was standing on
the street corner waiting

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.500
for the truck to
show up, and I had

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.010
a cooler with a bunch of mise
en place and different stuff,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.370
and there was another guy
standing on the corner

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.630
also looking at his phone.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.090
And I asked him, hey, are
you here for something?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.820
And he said, yeah, I'm
here for the food truck.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.550
And so we had people
waiting for the truck

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.940
before I had even set foot in
the truck for the first time.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.590
And then Karen was rushing back.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.440
She was a grad student
in Berkeley at the time,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.780
and ran back, and we
were scrambling around

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.249
and didn't really know
what we were doing.

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.290
And so we did that for a
few weeks and then moved

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.140
into basically a crappy
hole-in-the-wall Chinese

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.860
restaurant, which is now the
home of Mission Chinese Food.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.660
And we did pop-up events
once a week at first,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.230
and then eventually
twice a week.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.620
And we invited guest
chefs and line cooks

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.870
from around the city to
come do half the menu,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.280
and we did the other half.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.990
And again, we never
really expected

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.960
it to last for very long
or be leading to anything.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.700
And so we gave all the
profits away to charity,

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.240
and that was a fun way
to be part of a bigger

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.290
San Francisco community.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.400
And so eventually, we kind
of decided, why are we

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.940
making things really hard and
serving Mexi-Chinian food one

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.860
night, and a whole-hog
dinner, and using

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.910
the wok with charcoal in it,
and grilling octopus and stuff.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.010
Why don't we just
use the woks as woks?

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.900
And so we worked with
someone who was a guest chef,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.330
a Korean adoptee
from Oklahoma named

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.739
Danny Bowen, who at the time
I think was a line cook.

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:57.280
KAREN LEIBOWITZ:
Only wearing shorts.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.310
ANTHONY MYINT: Swim
trunks, I think, every day.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.500
And so we started
Mission Chinese,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.740
and we decided at some point--

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.480
or went from the
get-go with that one.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.700
Let's not rotate the
charities all the time.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.680
Let's just give $0.75 from
each entree to the food bank.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.870
It was a kind of
random-seeming project

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.480
that, again, I don't think
that we necessarily thought,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.250
we'll been doing this forever.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.050
And then eventually it
became really successful.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.480
Danny moved to New York
and also opened there.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.640
When he opened in New
York, the restaurant

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.160
won New York Times Restaurant
of the Year in 2012,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.790
despite being located inside
of a Thai takeout counter.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.017
And since then, we've
raised over a million meals

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:45.350
for the San Francisco food bank.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.510
And so I think this
speaks towards kind

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.310
of the possibilities
in the restaurant

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.834
industry of finding a project
that resonates with the public.

00:06:55.834 --> 00:06:56.750
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.390
So the same summer that we
opened Mission Chinese Food--

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.092
2010-- we also worked with some
former coworkers of Anthony's

00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:06.800
to open a restaurant
called Commonwealth,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.500
which was more of the
fine-dining version of this.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.540
But I think in
both cases, we were

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.810
interested in seeing how
food and restaurants can

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.770
be used to convey meaning.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.400
So we were creating a kind
of link with the food bank,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.130
and asking people to think
more about food broadly.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.370
Not just why it was
delicious, though it

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.240
should be delicious, but also
sort of what food means to us.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.110
And as a way to
make connections.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.520
So from there, we wrote the
book, Mission Street Food,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.480
and talked about that journey,
and even gave a Google Talk.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:53.330
And then in 2012 we had
a baby, who is now a kid.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.530
But I feel like that
really focused us

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.200
on issues of the future, and
thinking about especially

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.040
climate change, and we
were dismayed to learn

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.520
that by some accounts
the food system is

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.750
responsible for up to
50% of the greenhouse gas

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.770
emissions in the world.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.640
And as people
working with food, we

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.800
felt like, what
can we do better?

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.210
And so we started trying to
improve operations at Mission

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.380
Chinese and Commonwealth.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.340
But we started to think, what
would happen if you really

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.830
started a restaurant with the
idea of climate change in mind?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.576
And that's where
the Perennial began.

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:34.409
ANTHONY MYINT: Yeah.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:39.000
So as Karen mentioned, I feel
like as we were researching,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.710
it just seemed
completely undeniable

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.290
that food is a really big
part of climate change.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:49.320
And I think something that we
realized also along the way

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.980
is that the restaurant
sector is almost as

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.169
big as the entire
agriculture sector.

00:08:56.169 --> 00:08:57.960
And there was a lot of
potential to, again,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.070
use the restaurant sector to
try to change the food system.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.060
You can kind of see
on this line graph--

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.780
or first, I should
say we don't get

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.270
into any of this kind of
stuff at the Perennial.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:15.670
This is just for
this kind of talk.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.630
So there's a line
chart here that

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.647
shows atmospheric
greenhouse gases,

00:09:19.647 --> 00:09:21.980
and of course there's other
things-- industrialisation--

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.820
going on.

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.790
You can see really
big inflection points

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.320
around the invention
of the plough

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.750
and the advent of
chemical fertilizer.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.320
This is an image
from the Dust Bowl.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.310
I think, even as
food professionals,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.820
we really several
years ago could not

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.220
have told you what
constitutes good farming.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.680
We understood
organic and local--

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.570
these are important things--

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.330
but I don't think we
actually understand farming.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.660
And I think that
kind of makes sense.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.090
A lot of us have grown
up in a generation

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.590
of industrial agriculture and
pretty disconnected from food.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.260
In this era, there
was also fake news.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.930
I guess that's sort of
pertinent these days.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.110
And the railroad
companies had a pitch

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.780
like, the ploughs
follow the rain.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.770
And people rushed out
west to claim land,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.230
dug up perennial
grasses that used

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:25.372
to live in these ecosystems,
and then started crop farming.

00:10:25.372 --> 00:10:27.720
They eventually realized
you can't do that.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.400
The environment is too dry.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.500
If there's no rain six
months of the year,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.120
this doesn't make sense.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.300
This led to what is
called the Dust Bowl.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.110
Dust from Oklahoma is flying
through the air and landing

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.700
in Washington, D.C.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.170
And it kind of
had to go that far

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:50.040
before the government created
an agency to work on soil.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.662
So on the one hand,
that is pretty negative,

00:10:52.662 --> 00:10:54.870
but on the other hand it
speaks towards the potential

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.660
to radically change
the whole food system

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.880
and farming really
quickly in response

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.860
to that kind of problem.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.660
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: So again,
this is not actually

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.730
what we talk about at
the Perennial at all

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.560
because we got into the project
with a kind of, I think,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.265
normal standard orientation
to environmentalism

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:19.140
that it's all
about conservation,

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.520
or doing less bad.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.040
But as we got into it what
we discovered was actually,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.120
agriculture has the
capacity to really repair

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.040
the damage of climate
change because plants

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.180
draw down CO2 and can
store carbon in the soil.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.810
And so we started to really
think about the power,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:43.490
especially of perennial
plants, to restore the soil

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.060
and reverse climate change.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.050
And so we were really
excited because it

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.690
felt like we had this
optimistic message,

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.520
and it's not just do less,
like eat less, do whatever,

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:02.070
but really a message
of positive action.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.670
So that was exciting for us,
and through that research

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.630
we discovered that there
are all these new efforts

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:14.620
to make perennials really part
of the climate change solution.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.200
So here's an example
of a plant that's

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.370
just recently been released and
approved for human consumption.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.990
It's called Kernza.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:30.540
It was developed by the
Land Institute in Kansas,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.000
and you can see on
the top there is wheat

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.950
and on the bottom
there is Kernza.

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.100
And Anthony can't even reach
all the way to the end of it.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.988
This is--

00:12:38.988 --> 00:12:41.029
AUDIENCE: Can you bring
it a little more forward?

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:43.760
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: I think
a little more down, too.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:50.100
So you can see that the roots
are not only longer, but also

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.230
thicker and more complex.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:57.650
And they become the environment
for all sorts of life--

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.960
and microorganisms
and worms that

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.580
also are working on making the
soil more of a carbon sink.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.989
So that's the grain that
we're using in the bread

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:11.780
that you're eating.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:12.855
Let's just drop it.

00:13:12.855 --> 00:13:13.605
ANTHONY MYINT: OK.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.320
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: And that has
been an exciting thing for us.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:24.180
We're the first restaurant to
be making our bread from Kernza.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.020
It's not 100%
Kernza-- it's a mix--

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.861
but it--

00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:30.360
ANTHONY MYINT: So
the Land Institute

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.020
has been naturally breeding
this grain for the last 15 years

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.660
in conjunction with the
University of Minnesota,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.680
and it represents basically a
radical shift in agriculture

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.950
back to perennial polycultures.

00:13:43.950 --> 00:13:46.530
And so, again, with the
Dust Bowl and stuff,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.760
the prairies used to be covered
with plants like Kernza--

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.790
perennial grasses that
evolved in that ecosystem.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.160
We plowed it up to
plants like wheat,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.280
which you can see
on the poster, just

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.050
have much smaller root systems.

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.960
All the root systems
represent themselves--

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.030
you know, carbon in
the atmosphere that

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.500
can be back in the soil.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.960
And as Karen mentioned, also a
whole ecosystem of microbiology

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.900
called the resosphere
that surrounds the roots.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.890
And so the Land Institute
embarked on this journey

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.470
to basically take
agriculture back

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:28.620
to that kind of working
with natural systems,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.720
instead of working
with fertilizer

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.000
and extracting from the soil.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.290
And so Kernza is a hybrid
between perennial wheat grass

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.190
and wheat, and it's basically
in version 1.0. now.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.210
So you can get it at
the Perennial as bread.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.800
It's also available
commercially on the West Coast

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:52.320
at Whole Foods as beer
called Long Route Ale.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.610
And that was pioneered by the
company Patagonia in their food

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:58.500
line Patagonia Provisions.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.660
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: You can
see there's meat there.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.560
I think that there is a
kind of prevailing belief

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.750
that meat is the
worst thing that you

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:07.926
can do for the environment.

00:15:07.926 --> 00:15:09.300
One of the things
that we learned

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.960
is there are ways of
managing animals that

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.430
promote perennial
grasses and can actually

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.050
be climate beneficial.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.920
So I'm going to show
you a little video.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.270
It's very short.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:28.738
We made this for an event
at the Asian Art Museum.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.520
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: So
at the Perennial,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.940
we've been serving
meat from a ranch that

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.970
follows this protocol.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.800
It's called Stemple Creek.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.670
And we've also been purchasing
the animal in large cuts

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:15.109
so that we find a place
for all the parts.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.200
And so we have a
dining room and a bar,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.069
and we can have
different kinds of cuts

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.930
for different applications.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:26.359
And also trying to
think about meat

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:29.810
as not the centerpiece
of the meal.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.700
So all of those together.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.540
And I think one of the
things is that putting

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.570
such a focus on soil,
and the capacity for soil

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:45.110
to be a carbon sink, means that
we also are recognizing that it

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.510
doesn't make sense
to, for example,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.380
grow herbs in soil, which are
never going to really rebuild

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:51.900
the soil.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.590
So we have another
project where we're

00:17:54.590 --> 00:18:00.250
taking food waste from the
Perennial and using it to power

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.010
a greenhouse, which is just
right across the bridge

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.090
in Oakland and kind of
frees up land for more

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.220
perennial kinds of crops.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.230
But just to walk
you through it--

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.270
and I should mention that
the illustration on the left

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:20.190
was by the local artist
Wendy McNaughton,

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.680
and the one on the right
is by John Adams who also

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.540
who worked with
us on that video.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.190
So we take the food scraps--

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.670
I mean, even if you're really
conscientious about food waste,

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:36.050
there's still certain
things like onion peels,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.280
and that goes to
our worm bin, worms

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.670
are fed to fish, the fish
fertilize water, which

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.790
is used partly to
irrigate our raised beds,

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.870
but also in a system,
which is like hydroponics

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:56.300
but instead of using chemical
fertilizer the nutrition is

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.470
coming from
essentially fish poop.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.730
And then so we can grow kind of
specialty herbs and lettuces,

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.130
which are then served
at the Perennial.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.630
ANTHONY MYINT: One
thing that really

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.150
got us excited
about aquaponics was

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.610
learning about a
facility in Minneapolis

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.500
that is in the former
Hamm's Brewing Company.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.200
And so it's a
six-level facility,

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.730
and they're producing
on one level

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.260
kind of using all the
plumbing from the brewery that

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.710
was preexisting and
they're doing aquaponics.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.980
And as demand for the
products increase,

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.190
they project that they
will be able to produce

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:33.830
700,000 pounds of lettuce
and 150,000 pounds of fish

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:34.940
per year.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.510
So that completely
blew my mind, and I

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.530
think that we also
read some stats where

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.360
at the end of World
War II, something

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.550
like 40% of the
produce in America

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:48.050
was grown in people's gardens.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.660
It was called a Victory Garden.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.370
And so, as Karen
mentioned, it just

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:57.050
seems insane to be growing
herbs and lettuces in the field

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.970
and then throwing it in
a clam-shell container

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.304
and shipping it across the
country when you could just

00:20:01.304 --> 00:20:02.720
be growing that
in the city and it

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.900
would be fresher and a way
to use food waste in places

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.640
that don't compost.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.800
I think one thing that
we hadn't completely

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.330
understood before this project
was the ways in which soil

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.510
health interacted
with nutrition,

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.660
and the ways in which there's
a lot of externalities

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.250
in the food system,
and you're kind

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.890
of paying for government
subsidies and different things.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:29.120
This is just a little
snippet from a book that

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.370
shows some of the
nutrient differences

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.850
between a USDA-approved
egg and a pastured egg

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.020
from a well-known farm
called Polyface in Virginia.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.850
And some of the differences
are really surprising,

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.670
and it's an orders of
magnitude difference

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.800
in terms of nutrient intensity.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.980
And the book goes on to kind
of mention that a USDA-approved

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.000
egg doesn't have anything to
do with growing practices,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.230
nutrition--

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.260
literally anything.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.490
The only thing is the
size is the right size

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:03.344
and that it's not broken.

00:21:03.344 --> 00:21:05.510
So it could be covered with
salmonella or whatever--

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.250
the USA doesn't care.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.910
Meanwhile, Polyface Farms can't
even sell at a grocery store

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:16.970
because it's not big enough
to qualify for the USDA stuff.

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.770
So these are some
of the challenges

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.366
to small farmers and things
that, again, we don't really

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:23.990
want to talk about
at the dinner table,

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:28.040
but lead to some of the
problems in the food system.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.200
And in a lot of
ways, climate change

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:37.020
is a good way to rally people
to support good farming.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:40.430
So then really quick,
also about nutrition,

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:45.320
there's a prevailing notion
that the human body is absorbing

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.910
nutrients primarily driven
by how microbiology interacts

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.570
with and breaks down
food in the gut.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.470
And you can't just eat
a bunch of vitamins.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.109
You need to eat food
that has nutrients

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:00.650
and then the
microbiology in your gut

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.020
kind of makes it
bioavailable to you.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.720
And then something
that also completely

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.395
surprised us, although
it makes perfect sense,

00:22:09.395 --> 00:22:11.240
is that plant
roots are basically

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:16.610
like an inverted gut serving as
a home for all the microbiology

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.740
that break down the
nutrients in the soil

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.600
and then provide
that to the plant

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.680
and make the plant healthy.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.400
So you can see there's some
little stats about how there

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.520
is significantly lower nutrient
density in a lot of food

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.700
in the US as a result
of degraded soil.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.520
We're specifically
facing every day and sort

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.285
of dealing with consumers and
talking about these issues,

00:22:40.285 --> 00:22:41.660
but trying to find
a way to do it

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:45.230
that takes two seconds
instead of 30 minutes

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.900
because no one wants to hear
this talk at the dinner table

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:49.480
or anything like that.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.950
And I feel like,
even for us, prior

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.560
to getting into this project--

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.780
there's a picture here of
farmers market tomatoes,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.550
organic tomatoes
at the supermarket,

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.260
and conventional tomatoes.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.920
And it's sort of like, I
really had no idea what

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.150
the difference was.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:07.190
If someone asked me
to articulate it,

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.410
I would have a hard
time articulating it.

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:13.712
And certified organic
can mean the farmer's

00:23:13.712 --> 00:23:15.170
doing really great
stuff, or it can

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:18.140
mean they're just not
using things that are not

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.060
approved on the approved list.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.010
And so in a way
it's sort of like,

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.080
there's actually
a whole lot more

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.140
to farming that is
basically beyond organic,

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.050
but how do we educate
people about this topic

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.420
or even really understand it?

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.420
And so one thing that the
restaurant is embarking on

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.040
as kind of a project
in conjunction

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.010
with a lot of different
sustainable food organizations

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.820
is making a little guide,
kind of the equivalent

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.720
of the Monterey Bay
Seafood Guide, maybe.

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.950
And apparently there's a metric
that farmers measure called

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.370
soil organic matter, and it's
just part of the basic soil

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:59.540
test, like pH, nitrogen,
and phosphorus levels,

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.510
and then they just have a
percent soil organic matter.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.390
And so we're trying to work
with a lot of farmers and chefs

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.560
to make this a bigger movement
to recognize healthy soil,

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.990
using that as a proxy for
a lot of good practices.

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:16.430
And so it's a little bit
of an oversimplification

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.250
because it varies a little
bit from region to region.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.555
You could also be
a great farmer who

00:24:22.555 --> 00:24:24.680
just took over degraded
land and you're bringing it

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.220
up for different things.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:28.340
But in a lot of
ways, those are sort

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.560
of the exceptions to the
rule and in a broader

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.730
way we're hoping that
this can kind of steer

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.490
the conversation in the
right direction of a focus

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:38.430
towards healthy soil.

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:44.100
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: So
just to bring it back,

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.180
we are also running a restaurant
and not generally giving

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.030
a slide show at the restaurant.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:54.240
And what we really
want is for the food

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.780
to be a kind of entry
point to these discussions,

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.510
and the space to be a
place for conversation.

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:05.730
And the way we've
done it is really

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.640
to try to be relatively
low-key about it

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:13.080
and let people's questions
guide the conversation.

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.680
And we also think that if
it's not delicious, then

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.820
no one will follow suit.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:24.040
So that is still a very
serious project as well.

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.290
So all in all, our
life work is really

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.920
to think about food,
which is one of the things

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.100
that every one of
us has in common,

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.160
as a way to connect
with something

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.760
bigger than ourselves.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.040
And even creating a better
world for the future.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.180
So there's a lot of
different projects

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.500
that we're happy to talk
about in the question period.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.400
think These are
some books, also,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.550
that we have found influential
for our thinking about it

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.770
and that we recommend.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:09.070
But that's our spiel.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:16.850
SPEAKER: So I have a couple
of questions for you guys,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.700
and I know these guys will
have some questions as well.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.940
Why a restaurant as
your form of activism?

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.440
Why not run for Congress?

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.320
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Well,
don't put it past us.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.030
SPEAKER: You heard
it here first.

00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:37.160
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: One thing is we
have experience in restaurants,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.290
and we felt like
that was something

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.450
that drew on our expertise.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.184
So once you sort of get the
passion for environmentalism,

00:26:46.184 --> 00:26:48.100
it makes sense to sort
of start where you are.

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:50.730
And I think many different
fields could do that,

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.340
but I think food is
particularly situated

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.290
for that because of
the impact that food

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.270
has on the environment
and the capacity

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.800
to reverse climate change.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:09.390
But then the last piece is,
restaurants are interestingly

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.990
influential in our culture.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.490
If

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:14.010
You think about
when you were kids,

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.590
there was almost certainly
not an organic section

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:17.910
in your supermarket.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.610
And the reason that we
have it can pretty much

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.590
be traced back to Chez Panisse.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.860
That one restaurant
started talking

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.470
about where the food
came from, and it really

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.480
did change the
conversation around food.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.094
And now Wal-Mart is
stocking organic.

00:27:34.094 --> 00:27:34.927
ANTHONY MYINT: Sure.

00:27:34.927 --> 00:27:40.650
I think also the way that
information travels now,

00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:44.040
and trends move in
the food industry--

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.800
the chef of the best restaurant
in the world is foraging

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.295
in 2010, and in 2011 we're
foraging in San Francisco,

00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:54.670
and in 2012 we're
already over-foraging--

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.270
and so I think it
would be really

00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:59.610
exciting to be part of that
movement in the restaurant

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.290
industry, too, and
that it's possible.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.300
SPEAKER: You guys are
trendsetters, for sure.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.800
So follow-up
questions with that.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.307
You said that your activism
is subtle in the restaurant.

00:28:11.307 --> 00:28:13.890
It's not something that you're
beating people over their heads

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:14.040
with.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.790
Can you share a little
bit more about what

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.700
that experience might be like
when you visit the restaurant?

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.820
And also-- double question--

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.570
what kind of clientele
are you attracting?

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.069
Do you feel like you're ever
kind of preaching to the choir?

00:28:27.069 --> 00:28:29.222
Are you hoping to reach
out to more than just

00:28:29.222 --> 00:28:30.180
the people in the know?

00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:34.910
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Well,
second question first.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.290
I think there's a
really wide range.

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.240
So I was talking
with a server who

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.800
said that he often will be
delivering the third course

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.380
and someone will say,
is there a theme here?

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.860
Because he's just sort of
let them have their date

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.720
or whatever, and really tried
not to impose the message.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.940
And other people come
in and they're like,

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.710
I have seven questions.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.710
Should we do them
before I order or after?

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.290
They're really engaged.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:08.340
And so our goal is
to be kind of useful

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.700
and move the conversation
for all of those people.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.360
And actually,
excitingly, lately we've

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:19.200
had an influx of
people who are going

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:22.050
to see Hamilton around the
corner from the restaurant.

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.544
And so they might not
have as much time,

00:29:25.544 --> 00:29:27.210
because they've got
to make the curtain,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.410
but it's a whole range of
people who are not necessarily

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.530
coming for the
environmentalism, but it becomes

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.380
part of the whole experience.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:42.816
It's a night out where all
kinds of synapses are firing.

00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:44.190
ANTHONY MYINT: I
think also we've

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:49.540
started to gain a reputation
in the sustainable food

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:54.270
movement as a gathering place,
and so we have a lot of events.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:58.720
I was talking to people who were
working on a food waste dinner,

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.710
and we were talking, I
was making the rounds,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.540
and then they were
looking behind them

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.790
and they were like, I think
that's our cricket farmer.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.770
It sort of feels a
little bit like the bar

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.970
across from City Hall where the
lawyers go and make the deals.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.410
And so it's kind of
fun to be part of that,

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.540
too, just in a physical way.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.850
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.570
Speaking of the bar,
I think that can

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.720
be one way to engage with it.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.260
The straws that we use
are not made from plastic.

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.330
They're made from straw.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.310
And so people at first
are sort of like,

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.584
this is not what I'm used
to, and will really have

00:30:35.584 --> 00:30:36.750
a lot of questions about it.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:39.030
And the bartenders
are like, yeah,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.700
you can have seven of them if
you want because they're all

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.770
compostable.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:43.950
It's totally natural.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.100
And actually, plastic
straws are incredibly

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.550
wasteful in most bars.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.240
The bartenders use a couple
to stir and test and then

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.299
throw them away.

00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:53.340
And we have none of that.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.250
And so some of that stuff,
you just sort of like--

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.412
it's like chatting with
the bartender, you know?

00:30:59.412 --> 00:31:00.120
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.850
So the salon for sustainability
is the hope, which I like that.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.531
A couple more
questions for you guys.

00:31:08.531 --> 00:31:10.530
I'm sure you're hoping
that the Perennial can be

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.390
a model for other restaurants.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.910
Do you know any
other restaurants

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.130
that are doing similar work?

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.990
How do you partner
with them if so?

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:22.440
ANTHONY MYINT: Well, there
are two really great examples.

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.280
One is a restaurant in
upstate New York called

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.260
Blue Hill at Stone Barns.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.040
And the chef there probably
is, more than anyone,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.120
responsible for kind of
spearheading what you

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.250
might call farm-to-table 2.0.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:39.080
And he's working
with the breeders

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.220
to basically breed heirloom
varieties of wheat,

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:48.470
or breed a cross of squash that
is more flavorful, or whatever.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:53.160
So kind of doing more
than chopping, for sure.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.920
And then the other
is a restaurant

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.820
in Brighton in the
UK called Silo,

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.710
and they're a
no-waste restaurant.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:01.300
Zero waste.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.980
And so they have Big Bertha--

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.710
their composter is
front and center.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.410
And they're growing mushrooms
from the coffee grounds.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.400
If the purveyors bring
produce in plastic bags,

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.770
then there's a local artisan
who melts them down and makes

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:17.720
plates with them,
and different stuff.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.200
And so we really admire
all these efforts

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.977
that everyone's doing.

00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:26.060
We happen to be located
in the middle of the city,

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.440
so I think what
Dan Barber is doing

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.470
at Blue Hill is
not available to us

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.660
because they're
located on a farm.

00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:38.210
And then at Silo, I feel
like zero waste is amazing

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:42.110
and we're trying to just
focus on climate change.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.300
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah, but
in terms of partnering,

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.370
we definitely talk with
them and share ideas.

00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.910
And that is something
that's really fun

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.640
that, when you have a
mission-driven business,

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.860
there's more of a
collaborative orientation.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.740
So we chat with the
folks from Silo.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.160
The people from Blue
Hill at Stone Barns

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.580
had a book party
with us last week.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.604
There's sort of a sense
of a movement, which

00:33:07.604 --> 00:33:09.020
I think we're at
the beginning of,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.027
but it's exciting to kind
of make those connections.

00:33:12.027 --> 00:33:12.860
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.818
Speaking of movements,
I know we're all looking

00:33:14.818 --> 00:33:17.000
for farm-to-table 2.0--

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.440
like, the new name.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.545
Because we might be over
that particular name.

00:33:20.545 --> 00:33:21.920
We might be saying
that too much.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.047
So if you've got a good
idea for us, let us know.

00:33:24.047 --> 00:33:25.422
I have one last
question and then

00:33:25.422 --> 00:33:27.170
I'm going to open
it up to these guys.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:28.880
The parent in me
really wants to know,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.530
do you have a picky eater?

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:33.900
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yes and no.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:39.530
We have an almost
five-year-old who eats

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.510
vegetables that are not leaves.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.511
So broccoli, string beans--

00:33:44.511 --> 00:33:46.010
ANTHONY MYINT: She
eats lettuce now.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.740
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Sometimes.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.239
Yeah.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.790
ANTHONY MYINT: But she
definitely probably

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.620
prefers plain pasta, too.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.674
Pasta with herb sauce.

00:33:56.674 --> 00:33:57.590
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.877
I had a moment with her
in a grocery store where

00:33:59.877 --> 00:34:01.460
she went to the
cheese counter and she

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.350
said, "I'm looking for some
fancy cheese with no flavor."

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.400
And I was like, that
is very accurate.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.064
That is what she wants.

00:34:09.064 --> 00:34:11.480
SPEAKER: Do you feel like your
five-year-old is growing up

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.047
knowing words like
sustainability, and organic,

00:34:14.047 --> 00:34:15.380
and local, and things like that?

00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.000
Is this the new generation?

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.666
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Well,
she just recently

00:34:18.666 --> 00:34:19.977
learned about global warming.

00:34:19.977 --> 00:34:21.310
ANTHONY MYINT: From a kids book.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:24.020
KAREN LEIBOWITZ:
From a kids book.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.790
I had been trying to
protect her from that,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.139
but we talk a lot about
the work that worms do,

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:36.300
and we try to get
her into gardening

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:42.530
and seeing the kind of power
and excitement of making food,

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.040
growing it, cooking it,
serving it-- all of it.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.540
Actually, giving it away.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.480
Going to food pantries
and things like that.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.960
She's definitely
food-oriented, for sure,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:58.160
but she also has ideas
about global warming.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.790
She asked me if she could throw
ice cubes out the back door.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.640
She was like, "I'm
trying to cool it down!"

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.665
So that was hard to explain.

00:35:07.665 --> 00:35:08.540
SPEAKER: I love that.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.910
So you guys are pioneers and
superheroes, which I love.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:14.180
I'm going to open it up to
these guys for questions.

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.432
So in case you can't hear,
are some of the events

00:35:16.432 --> 00:35:17.640
that you talked about public?

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.157
And if so, how do
we get involved?

00:35:19.157 --> 00:35:20.240
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: For sure.

00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.560
Well, we have an Earth
Day celebration coming up.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.950
And we do probably once or
twice a month public events.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.090
You can follow us
on social media,

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:37.010
and we have a newsletter also.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.310
Actually, do want to
explain the Earth Day plan?

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:40.580
ANTHONY MYINT: Sure.

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.860
So we're lucky enough
to have met someone

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.670
who works at the San Francisco
Department of the Environment

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.240
named Donnie Olivera.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:50.150
And so he's going to come and
talk about the city's plans,

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.310
which are completely amazing.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.070
I don't know if I'm allowed
to say the specifics,

00:35:55.070 --> 00:36:01.090
but the city has a goal
of zero waste by 2020.

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:03.440
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: The
clock is ticking!

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.060
ANTHONY MYINT: 50% of trips--

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.940
50% of passenger trips
not made by cars, and then

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.540
100% renewable energy.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.020
So you can hear more
details about those,

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.490
and drink beer made
from Kernza, and I

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.090
think he has promised-- though
I'm waiting for confirmation--

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.690
but he's promised
that he'll be bringing

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.524
his bike-powered
margarita setup.

00:36:30.524 --> 00:36:31.440
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.890
And then we're also doing--

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:37.110
we're sort of starting
a series of events

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:42.750
with winemakers because we have
kind of incredible winemakers

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.520
nearby, who many
of them are really

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.640
engaging with sustainable
agricultural practices.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:52.325
The first wine-tasting that
we're doing with a winemaker

00:36:52.325 --> 00:36:57.990
is on say March 25th, and then
we're doing also a week later,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:00.521
you can just hang out in the
bar and drink wine and chat

00:37:00.521 --> 00:37:01.020
with him.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.770
He'll just be around
to talk about,

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.140
what difference does it make
if your wine cellar is actually

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.880
a cellar, or if
it's above ground?

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.450
There's actually a huge
difference in the energy use.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.840
Things like that.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.190
So sort of at different
levels of dorkiness.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:21.820
Actually, Anthony mentioned
the City of San Francisco guy.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:29.350
But he did not mention the
bike-powered margaritas.

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:34.560
So getting that slushy
margarita with your own bike

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.740
power for Earth Day.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.600
And I think Mother Jones is
having a party on April 12th.

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.800
I will need to
check on that date,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.380
but their food team is going to
have a public event in our bar.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.520
So I'm excited for that.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.160
SPEAKER: Tell us more
about zero food print.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.520
ANTHONY MYINT: Sure.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.770
So zero food print actually
predated the Perennial.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.870
I was part of starting
that with a friend named

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:09.030
Chris Ying and an environmental
expert named Peter Fried.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.390
And Chris Ying used to be the
editor of Lucky Peach Magazine.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.940
And I think the
goal was basically

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:20.800
to learn about how restaurants
are part of climate change.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.730
And I think it started with
an initial question like,

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.950
are restaurants really bad?

00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:28.560
How does it compare
to a home-cooked meal?

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.330
So they did a
life-cycle analysis

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.600
and kind of learned
that it's not that bad.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.310
Pretty comparable to
a home-cooked meal

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.600
for various reasons.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.840
And then from there
sort of realized

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.260
that restaurants can
make small changes that

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.400
make a big difference.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.950
Most people are kind of too
focused on the day-to-day like,

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.220
is my dishwasher going
to show up today?

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.760
Or is my meat order
going to come?

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.566
Or whatever.

00:38:52.566 --> 00:38:53.940
But then over the
course of it, I

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.870
think we learned a
lot of things like,

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.730
the carbon footprint
of feed lot beef

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:04.020
is so high that
serving fried chicken

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:06.750
instead could be an
environmental act.

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.510
Or just different ways
I think a lot of people

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:12.840
understand things like the
amount of calories in butter

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.880
versus celery, but
a lot of people

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.760
don't really understand the
carbon footprint of cheese

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.230
versus tomatoes is also
orders of magnitude different.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.110
And chefs and
restaurateurs, especially.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.514
So I think part of that was
to kind of educate chefs

00:39:26.514 --> 00:39:28.680
and restaurateurs, to let
them make the changes that

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.510
were easy to make
and then give them

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.430
a way to participate in a
food-related carbon offset

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.470
program.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:40.614
So a small share of a methane
digester on a dairy farm

00:39:40.614 --> 00:39:42.030
because a restaurant
is ultimately

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:44.250
going to have some carbon
footprint because they're

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.110
serving food and doing stuff.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:50.580
But then they can kind of
facilitate positive work

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.560
somewhere else in
the food system.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.770
And then basically qualify as
being zero food print or carbon

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.180
neutral.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:59.160
So in a lot of ways,
that's a top-down approach

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.780
that any restaurant can adopt.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:02.280
KAREN LEIBOWITZ:
But just to clarify

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.340
that kind of relationship
among our projects--

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.710
we have the Perennial,
which is a restaurant that's

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.380
really dedicated to the idea
that food can be regenerative,

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:11.880
right?

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:15.150
So one of the terms that we use
instead of farm-to-table 2.0

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:17.160
is regenerative agriculture.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:23.870
But we have the restaurant
that's sort of consumer-facing.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.530
And then we have
a nonprofit called

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:29.250
Zero Food Print, which is
really chef-facing and saying,

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:33.330
here's how to assess
your footprint,

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.780
improve your footprint,
and offset your footprint.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.040
And then we have another
nonprofit as well,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.750
which is farm-facing,
which is about sharing

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:46.416
information about soil
health, and best practices,

00:40:46.416 --> 00:40:47.290
and things like that.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:51.330
And so the whole
suite of activities

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:54.390
is really about
saying, hey, there's

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:56.580
only one thing that
we know right now that

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.950
can draw down greenhouse gases.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:59.850
Let's get on that.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:02.490
And so wherever
you are, wherever

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:07.902
you are within the food system,
here's how you can engage.

00:41:07.902 --> 00:41:09.360
SPEAKER: What kind
of adoption have

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:13.370
you had with Zero Food Print?

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.160
ANTHONY MYINT: So
this past year we

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.970
have started working with
about 20 restaurants.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.210
We would gladly welcome
any sort of larger

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.175
institutional partnerships.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.110
At a larger
institutional level--

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.850
Google, for example,
probably has a Director

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.740
of Sustainability and they could
probably do their own research

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.790
and find their own offsets
or buy a whole digester

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.180
as their own program.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:46.190
They wouldn't necessarily need
a slice of a pie of a project

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.070
that someone else
is funding entirely,

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.650
but we would love to work
with any organizations that

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.180
would want to work with us.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.096
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:41:54.096 --> 00:41:57.980
So Zero Food Print has
been expanding and working

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.230
with restaurant groups,
which is interesting

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.740
because you can sort of compare
and contrast with a group.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:08.500
But we're really interested
also in getting into groceries

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.670
and thinking about
all the different ways

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.350
that people access food.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:13.850
Yeah.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.330
And there is someone
who we've worked with,

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.360
kind of consulting on
food and carbon footprint

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.830
data, this author who wrote
one of the books on the screen,

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.580
"How Bad Are Bananas?"

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.970
And it's basically like
the carbon footprint

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:32.330
of a dozen eggs, or an
email, or your mortgage,

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.800
or driving across town.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.990
And he has done
a whole lifecycle

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:39.980
analysis, or assessment,
for a UK groceries

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.540
chain called Tesco.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.930
And so one of their
stories is carbon neutral.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.430
SPEAKER: Krista's
excellent question

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.270
was, where do we get
more of the good stuff?

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.780
The Kernza.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.940
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:55.310
I think the Land Institute is
rapidly expanding production,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.790
but it is really
early days for Kernza.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.680
AUDIENCE: Is that
where yours comes from?

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.825
From Kansas or--

00:43:01.825 --> 00:43:03.200
ANTHONY MYINT: So
there's farmers

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.370
growing Kernza in Illinois,
Kansas, and Minnesota.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:09.590
Kind of like the
grain belt. And so it

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.350
sort of wants winter
vernalization period

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:14.780
to grow best, and since it's
kind of in the ramping-up up

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.570
stage it makes the most
sense to grow it in the place

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.610
where it grows best.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:23.120
I should also say we don't
100% know all the answers

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.130
because they're
kind of changing,

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:28.100
but our understanding
most recently

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.680
is that the way that it
integrates with machinery

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.060
for processing and milling and
stuff, it is most like spelt.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.440
And they use a spelt dehuller,
but sometimes there's

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.480
a little bit of hull left on it.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.820
And so that is a
little bit labor

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.090
intensive to get it perfect
for bread-making and stuff.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:55.160
So it's going to be commercially
available as flour in 2019,

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.050
and it's available
as beer immediately

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.570
because you can make
beer even if there's

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.160
a little bit of hull.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.950
So that's a widespread
commercial project,

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.110
and they anticipate
based on kind

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.060
of the arc of how the
natural breeding is

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.400
going, that they'll
be ready with flour

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.790
in a couple of years.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:14.600
And so it is pretty early,
but by the same token

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:18.580
a week or two ago General
Mills signed a deal with--

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.910
or I don't know if that's
the right term, but is--

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:21.310
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Committed.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:22.143
ANTHONY MYINT: Yeah.

00:44:22.143 --> 00:44:23.660
Committed to
support the project.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:27.250
And so I don't know
the specifics of that,

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:29.930
but I think it
involves guaranteeing

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.910
farmers contracts to
start incorporating it

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:35.019
into the Cascadian
Farms line or whatever,

00:44:35.019 --> 00:44:36.560
if that is of General
Mills, and then

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.790
also a $500,000 grant to
the University of Minnesota

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:44.060
to continue research on it.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:49.400
So again, this is happening
now, or available now or soon,

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.860
and then 10 or 20
years from now they

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.860
expect to also be
providing perennial wheat.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:57.790
And people in China are
working on perennial rice,

00:44:57.790 --> 00:45:00.530
and so I feel like
it's the very beginning

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:07.500
of the shift of agriculture
back to natural systems.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:09.960
SPEAKER: I guess I would
sum that question up as,

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.750
tell us more about
what you are doing

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:13.860
to get mainstream adoption.

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:17.420
And are you limited by things
like scale in the restaurant?

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:20.050
ANTHONY MYINT: So we are working
with this ranch, Stemple Creek

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.890
Ranch, in part
because they are one

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:24.980
of the pilot ranches with an
organization called the Marine

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.560
Carbon Project.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.110
And so we're really lucky to
have kind of stumbled onto it

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:32.930
because they just are
an hour from here.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:36.560
And we visited the ranch,
and when we got there one

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.370
of the founders was
sitting in a parking lot--

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.500
a windy parking lot
at the top of a hill--

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:46.700
with a white board talking
to inspectors from the United

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:47.900
Nations.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.880
And kind of starting the
process of making carbon

00:45:52.880 --> 00:46:00.050
farming a recognized federal
subsidized type of activity.

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.000
Like, measuring the
amount of carbon

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.070
and then starting
to divert money

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.840
to subsidize that
kind of farming.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.080
And so there's actually many
different ranches in our area

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.720
that are working
on carbon ranching.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:15.200
Tomcat Ranch and their
beef brand, which is called

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.630
Left Coast Grass Fed.

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.040
There's one called
Holistic Ag Beef.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.140
And [INAUDIBLE] Ranch
and True Grass Farm.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.640
So there's a lot
of different people

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.640
who are independently
doing carbon farming.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.120
And there are people in
South Dakota, Montana,

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.360
and all over the US who are kind
of doing it just because it's

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.040
a better yield anyway.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.264
So it just makes sense anyway.

00:46:39.264 --> 00:46:41.180
The breakthrough for the
Marine Carbon Project

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:44.542
is that they apply compost to
the field at the beginning,

00:46:44.542 --> 00:46:46.250
and that sort of
jump-starts the process.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:51.230
And also, contrary to what
scientists would expect,

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.020
actually leads to
durable soil carbon

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:57.140
that will last for
30 to 100 years,

00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:00.500
or continue to be sequestered
for 30 to 100 years

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.330
just from one application and
then properly managed grazing.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:10.370
So in a lot of ways, that
is even more surprising

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:14.600
how fast and optimistic
the message is.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.260
So the Marine Carbon Project
has three pilot branches now,

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.900
and it's going to be 20
within a couple of years.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.360
And their work is basically
to work with ranchers

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.820
and create specific plans
for that ranch that's like,

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:31.100
plant trees here, do this
for this part of the ranch,

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.680
divert the pond here so
you can irrigate whatever.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.280
And the whole thing
has a certain amount

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.310
of scientific rigor and
peer-reviewed carbon

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:44.000
sequestration assigned to
each action for each area.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.470
And then they can take that
carbon farm plan of like,

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:52.100
we're going to sequester 10,000
tons over whatever time period

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.790
to the government and
get money to start

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.380
implementing that plan.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.310
So I think it will
be scaling up.

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:01.160
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: And
you know, California

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:10.360
has been working on how to apply
the carbon tax that we've had.

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.904
So there's the question of
how to reward people who

00:48:14.904 --> 00:48:16.070
are doing this kind of work.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.230
And so we've been a
little bit involved

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:25.940
in lobbying Sacramento for a
healthy soil initiative to say,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.850
people in the city also care
about agricultural issues.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.360
So I think all in all, we
feel that it is very scalable.

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:35.810
And we're sort of coming at it
from the direction of building

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:40.267
consumer demand, talking
to the farmers that we know

00:48:40.267 --> 00:48:42.350
and connecting them with
resources like the Marine

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:44.480
Carbon Project, and
then also working

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.817
on it from a political angle.

00:48:45.817 --> 00:48:47.900
ANTHONY MYINT: But I think
also, if you think back

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:53.300
to 10 years ago, I didn't
spend the extra dollars

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:56.677
on grass-fed beef, and
it wasn't as ubiquitous.

00:48:56.677 --> 00:48:58.760
And now it's kind of all
over the place and people

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.370
are more used to spending
that extra dollar,

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.151
and so in a lot of ways
we're just trying to--

00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:08.800
I hate to keep doing this, but
kind of kickstart grass-fed

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:11.810
2.0 where it's like, cows are
part of the climate change

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:15.500
solution, unless
they're feed-lot cows.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.200
Then that's part of the problem.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.040
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Superbad.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.160
SPEAKER: So I think the
question is, grass-fed beef is

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.480
more expensive.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.060
Do you feel like the Bay
Area can sustain that?

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:30.170
And if not, then are
other restaurants

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:32.600
going to be implementing
the true cost of food

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.184
in the future?

00:49:33.184 --> 00:49:34.099
KAREN LEIBOWITZ: Yeah.

00:49:34.099 --> 00:49:36.320
I think your question
also is beyond the beef

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:41.600
itself but just like,
is sustainable food

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.170
going to work as a
sustainable business model?

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:49.100
And I think that is the
big experiment that we've

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.720
embarked on, and the
Bay Area obviously

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:57.170
is a kind of prime
place to try it out.

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.390
I think the bigger
question is, could people

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:03.740
do that outside of the Bay Area?

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.020
But Anthony and I
were just talking

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.820
this morning about kind of
that perception of value

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.280
in food in America.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:20.180
So I had read that in 1930,
the average American household

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.880
spent 25% of its income on food.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.240
In 1950, that c was 30%.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.470
It had gone up.

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:29.070
And that it's now--

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:31.430
in the thing I read it was
9% and Anthony was like,

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.410
oh, I read 6.4%.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.770
So we now are spending just
a really small fraction

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.640
of our income on food, and
it's much less actually

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.340
than other comparable nations.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.250
And so we have ideas
about what food

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:52.140
costs that are based on
pretty perverse incentives.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:57.710
So the way that our government
subsidizes poor agriculture

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:00.980
has really set us up to
believe that food is cheap

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:02.450
and should always be cheap.

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.810
And the ideas that we have
about how much meat costs,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.900
in particular, is really
based on something

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:14.310
which is not really
defensible on any level--

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:19.500
ethically or environmentally,
or even health.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.990
So I think that there
will be a big shift

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:26.550
and the question is,
will people start

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:30.720
seeing that fast enough for
us to survive as a business?

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:34.560
Because our ideas about
these things change

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.150
kind of generationally, not in
the span of a restaurant lease.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:40.632
So we'll see.

00:51:40.632 --> 00:51:43.090
SPEAKER: That's a really great
question to wrap it up with.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:44.810
Thank you so much for your time.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:45.810
We really appreciate it.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:47.850
I learned a lot.

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:49.050
Thank you, guys.

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:52.100
