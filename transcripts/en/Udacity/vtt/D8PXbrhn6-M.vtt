Great work if you found negative 2 3rds and positive 5. You've really got your

00:00:05.082 --> 00:00:09.665
factoring down. We begin factoring this by finding the factors of negative 30

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:14.940
that sum to negative 13. We use these two factors to rewrite the middle term,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.996
negative 13m. Then, we use factoring by grouping to get 3m plus 2 times m minus

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:27.700
5 equals 0. Then, we set each factor equal to 0 and solve for the values of m.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.262
So m could equal negative 2 3rds or m could equal positive 5.
