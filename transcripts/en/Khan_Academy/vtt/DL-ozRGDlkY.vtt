00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:01.234
- [voiceover] So now that
we've spent some time

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.436
thinking about what a
differential equation is

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:05.666
and even visualizing solutions

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.668
to a differential equations
using things like slope field,

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:10.572
let's start seeing if we can actually

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:12.005
solve differential equations.

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:15.007
As we'll see, different types
of differential equations

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:16.015
might require different techniques

00:00:17.005 --> 00:00:18.166
and some of them we might not be able

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:20.633
to solve at all using analytic techniques.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.173
We'd have to resort to numeric techniques
to estimate the solutions.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.006
But let's go to what I would argue

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:29.373
as the simplest form of
differential equation to solve

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.466
and that's what's called a Separable.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.433
Separable differential equation.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.003
And we will see in a
second why it is called

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.005
a separable differential equation.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:43.838
So let's say that we
have the derivative of Y

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:53.836
with respect to X is equal to negative X
over Y E to the X squared.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:55.140
So we have this differential equation

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.271
and we want to find
the particular solution

00:00:58.271 --> 00:01:03.271
that goes through the point 0,1.

00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:06.010
I encourage you to pause this
and I'll give you a hint.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.866
If you can on one side of
this equation through algebra

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:13.005
separate out the Ys and the DYs

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:17.222
and on the other side
have all the Xs and DXs,

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:18.633
and then integrate.

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:21.366
Perhaps you can find
the particular solution

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:23.133
to this differential equation

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.133
that contains this point.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.138
Now if you can't do it don't worry

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.790
because we're about to work through it.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.006
So like I said, let's use
a little bit of algebra

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.011
to get all the Ys and DYs on one side

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.634
and all the Xs and DXs on the other side.

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.739
So one way, let's say I
want to get all the Ys

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.003
and DYs on the left hand side,

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.969
and all the Xs and DXs
on the right hand side.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.338
Well, I can multiply both sides times Y.

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:49.009
So I can multiply both sides times Y

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.642
that has the effect of putting
the Ys on the left hand side

00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.008
and then I can multiple
both sides times DX.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.256
I can multiple both sides times DX

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:00.366
and we kind of treat,

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:01.372
you can treat these differentials

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.923
as you would treat a variable

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:07.973
when you're manipulating it
to essentially separate out the variables.

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:12.333
And so, this will cancel with that.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:17.333
And so, we are left with Y, DY.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:23.006
Y, DY is equal to negative X.

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:29.772
And actually let me write it this way.
Let me write it as negative X, E.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:31.096
Actually, I might need
a little more space.

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:36.096
So negative X E to the
negative X squared DX.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.771
DX.
Now why is this interesting?

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:47.733
Because we could integrate both sides.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:48.735
And now this also highlights

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.505
why we call it the separable.
You won't be able to do this

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.009
with every differential equation.

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.588
You won't be able to algebraically

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.533
separate the Ys and DYs on one side

00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:02.075
and the Xs and DXs on the other side.
But this one we were able to.

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:04.333
And so that's why this is called

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:07.584
a separable differential equation.

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:12.906
Differential equation.

00:03:13.134 --> 00:03:15.376
And it's usually the first
technique that you should try.

00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:17.992
Hey, can I separate the Ys and the Xs

00:03:17.992 --> 00:03:19.779
and as I said, this is
not going to be true

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.667
of many, if not most
differential equations.

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:23.766
But now that we did this

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:26.094
we can integrate both sides.

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.178
So let's do that.

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:30.733
So, I'll find a nice
color to integrate with.

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:35.701
So, I'm going to integrate both sides.

00:03:35.701 --> 00:03:38.008
Now if you integrate the left hand side
what do you get?

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:39.774
You get and remember, we're integrating

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:41.899
with respect to Y here.

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:47.807
So this is going to be Y squared over two
and we could put some constant there.

00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:50.867
I could call that plus C one.

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:51.892
And if you're integrating that

00:03:51.892 --> 00:03:53.767
that's going to be equal to.

00:03:53.767 --> 00:03:54.841
Now the right hand side we're integrating

00:03:55.507 --> 00:03:59.003
with respect to X.
And let's see, you could do U substitution

00:03:59.003 --> 00:04:00.536
or you could recognize that look,

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:05.274
the derivative of negative X squared
is going to be negative two X.

00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:07.333
So if that was a two there

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:08.899
and if you don't want to change
the value of the integral

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:11.594
you put the 1/2 right over there.
And so now you could either do

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:13.921
U substitution explicitly

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.005
or you could do it in your head

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:19.110
where you said U is equal
to negative X squared

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:22.869
and then DU will be negative to X, DX

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:25.001
or you can kind of do this
in your head at this point.

00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.002
So I have something and it's derivative

00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:30.371
so I really could just
integrate with respect to

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.601
that something too with respect to that U.

00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:37.672
So this is going to be 1/2.

00:04:37.672 --> 00:04:39.433
This 1/2 right over here.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:40.433
The anti-derivative.

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:43.966
This is E to the negative X squared

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:46.966
and then of course, I might
have some other constant.

00:04:46.966 --> 00:04:49.969
I'll just call that C two.

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:51.271
And once again, if this part over here

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:52.994
what I just did seemed strange,

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:53.494
the U substitution,

00:04:53.904 --> 00:04:56.366
you might want to review that piece.

00:04:56.366 --> 00:04:58.267
Now, what can I do here?

00:04:58.267 --> 00:04:59.270
We'll have a constant
on the left hand side.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:00.533
It's an arbitrary constant.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:01.294
We don't know what it is.

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:04.833
I haven't used this initial condition yet

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:05.866
we could call it.

00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:08.871
So, let me just subtract
C one from both sides.

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:12.368
So if I just subtract
C one from both sides

00:05:12.566 --> 00:05:15.000
I have an arbitrary so
this is gonna cancel,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.833
and I have C two, sorry.

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:18.742
Let me.
So, this is C one.

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:21.001
So these are going to cancel

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:22.003
and C two minus C one.

00:05:22.003 --> 00:05:24.337
These are both constants,
arbitrary constants

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:29.336
and we don't know what they are yet.
And so, we could just rewrite this as

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:33.635
on the left hand side we
have Y squared over two

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:35.921
is equal to on the right hand side.

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.676
I'll write 1/2 E.

00:05:38.676 --> 00:05:39.176
Let me write that in blue

00:05:39.486 --> 00:05:41.509
just because I wrote it in blue before.

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:48.628
1/2 E to the negative X squared
and I'll just say C two minus C one.

00:05:49.123 --> 00:05:50.715
Let's just call that C.

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:56.006
So if you take the sum of those two things
let's just call that C.

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:59.009
And so now, this is kind
of a general solution.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.085
We don't know what this constant is

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:04.333
and we haven't explicitly solved for Y yet

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:05.666
but even in this form

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.533
we can now find a particular solution

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.019
using this initial condition.

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.519
Let me separate it out.

00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.008
This was a part of this

00:06:12.008 --> 00:06:13.017
original expression right over here

00:06:14.007 --> 00:06:15.568
but using this initial condition.

00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:20.440
So, it tells us when X is zero,
Y needs to be equal to one.

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:24.566
So we would have one
squared which is just one

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:31.975
over two is equal to 1/2.
E to the negative zero squared.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.332
Well, that's just going to be

00:06:34.332 --> 00:06:37.776
e to the zero is just one.
This is gonna be 1/2 plus C

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:40.201
and just like that
we're able to figure out

00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:42.107
if you subtract 1/2 from both sides

00:06:42.107 --> 00:06:47.017
C is equal to zero.
So the relationship between Y and X

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.016
that goes through this point,

00:06:50.006 --> 00:06:52.011
we could just set C is equal to zero.

00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:55.427
So that's equal to zero.

00:06:55.904 --> 00:07:02.006
That's zero right over there.
And so we are left with Y squared over two

00:07:02.633 --> 00:07:07.633
is equal to E to the
negative X squared over two.

00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:10.139
Now we can multiply both sides by two

00:07:10.733 --> 00:07:13.274
and we're going to get Y squared.

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:14.934
Y squared.

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:16.001
Let me do that.

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.535
So we're gonna get Y squared

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:22.634
is equal to E to the negative X squared.

00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:26.566
Now, we can take the
square root of both sides

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:27.333
and you can say, well look,

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:28.005
you know, Y squared is equal to this

00:07:28.005 --> 00:07:33.005
so Y could be equal to the
plus or minus square root

00:07:34.776 --> 00:07:37.792
of E to the negative X squared.

00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:40.651
Of E to the negative X squared.

00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:45.144
But they gave us an initial condition
where Y is actually positive.

00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:46.990
So we're finding the particular solution

00:07:47.476 --> 00:07:48.633
that goes through this point.

00:07:48.633 --> 00:07:51.366
That means Y is gonna be
the positive square root.

00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:53.370
If this was a point zero negative one

00:07:53.766 --> 00:07:55.008
then we would say Y is
the negative square root

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:56.874
but we know that Y is
the positive square root,

00:07:57.666 --> 00:07:59.799
it's the principal root right over there.

00:07:59.799 --> 00:08:03.240
So let me do that a little bit neater
so we can get rid of, whoops.

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:04.937
I thought I was writing in black.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.634
So we can get rid of this right over here.

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:10.943
We're only going to be dealing with
the positive square root

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:15.233
so we could write Y is equal to E

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:19.952
to the negative X squared to the 1/2 power

00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:23.219
and that of course is equal to

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:28.219
E to the negative X squared over two.

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:31.071
So this right over here is

00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:35.130
or Y equals E to the
negative X squared over two

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:37.020
is a particular solution

00:08:37.047 --> 00:08:39.342
that satisfies the initial conditions

00:08:39.765 --> 00:08:41.772
to this original differential equation.

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:43.232
So just like that.

00:08:43.232 --> 00:08:45.166
Because we were able to just as a review,

00:08:45.166 --> 00:08:48.567
because this differential
equation was setup in a way

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:49.574
or because we could algebraically

00:08:50.267 --> 00:08:53.267
separate the Y, DYs from the Xs, DXs,

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:55.933
we're able to just separate
them out algebraically,

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:57.266
integrate both sides

00:08:57.266 --> 00:08:59.271
and use the information given
in the initial condition

00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:02.933
to find the particular solution.
