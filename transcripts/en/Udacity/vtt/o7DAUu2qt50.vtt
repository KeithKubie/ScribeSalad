00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.750
So, to summarize, I introduced you the concepts of how we

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.689
can detect features for doing things like matching in images.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.210
We came with the simplest form of them by using gradients to compute edges.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.310
And how those edges could be used for doing other types of things will become

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.580
apparent as we actually get in depths of how we can compute edges.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.010
So, in next class, what I'd like to do, or as next session,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.700
I'm going to get into depths of how we can compute edges from gradients.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.860
This was more about learning how we can compute gradients themselves.
