you know this has gone from an
 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.980
you know this has gone from an
experimental idea that was really at the

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990
experimental idea that was really at the
 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.449
experimental idea that was really at the
fringe of the global electricity

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:18.459

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.399
 
yeah so ten years ago roughly I started

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:35.409
yeah so ten years ago roughly I started
 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:38.699
yeah so ten years ago roughly I started
graduate school and I came to Stanford

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:38.709
graduate school and I came to Stanford
 

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:42.360
graduate school and I came to Stanford
and I think one useful thing that

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.370
and I think one useful thing that
 

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.269
and I think one useful thing that
happened was I I did my undergrad at IIT

00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:45.279
happened was I I did my undergrad at IIT
 

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:47.179

which is a place of perfect competition
 

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:50.670
which is a place of perfect competition
and so one amazing thing that happened

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680
and so one amazing thing that happened
 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.139
and so one amazing thing that happened
was most of my friends close friends

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:52.149
was most of my friends close friends
 

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:54.659
was most of my friends close friends
ended up on the East Coast and so I was

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:54.669
ended up on the East Coast and so I was
 

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:55.949
ended up on the East Coast and so I was
sort of the loner there on the west

00:07:55.949 --> 00:07:55.959
sort of the loner there on the west
 

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.989
sort of the loner there on the west
coast and that fundamentally changed my

00:07:57.989 --> 00:07:57.999
coast and that fundamentally changed my
 

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:02.279
coast and that fundamentally changed my
thinking at least in terms of decoupling

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:02.289
thinking at least in terms of decoupling
 

00:08:02.289 --> 00:08:05.279
thinking at least in terms of decoupling
difficulty of problem and importance of

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:05.289
difficulty of problem and importance of
 

00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:08.639
difficulty of problem and importance of
problem and I think that sort of is my

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:08.649
problem and I think that sort of is my
 

00:08:08.649 --> 00:08:10.409
problem and I think that sort of is my
journey into becoming an accidental

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:10.419
journey into becoming an accidental
 

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:13.859
journey into becoming an accidental
electric chemist so I started my

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:13.869
electric chemist so I started my
 

00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:15.119
electric chemist so I started my
graduate school and wanted to work on

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:15.129
graduate school and wanted to work on
 

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:17.879
graduate school and wanted to work on
fluid mechanics which is if you're if

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:17.889
fluid mechanics which is if you're if
 

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:19.829
fluid mechanics which is if you're if
you did mechanical engineering as an

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:19.839
you did mechanical engineering as an
 

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.629
you did mechanical engineering as an
undergrad that's probably one of the

00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639
undergrad that's probably one of the
 

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:24.420
undergrad that's probably one of the
topics that you would think is hard I I

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:24.430
topics that you would think is hard I I
 

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.429
topics that you would think is hard I I
came in to graduate school in the

00:08:26.429 --> 00:08:26.439
came in to graduate school in the
 

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:29.239
came in to graduate school in the
division of computational fluid dynamics

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:29.249
division of computational fluid dynamics
 

00:08:29.249 --> 00:08:31.619
division of computational fluid dynamics
quickly realized there are not many

00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:31.629
quickly realized there are not many
 

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:32.969
quickly realized there are not many
important things to be done in that

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:32.979
important things to be done in that
 

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:35.459
important things to be done in that
field and then the second accident that

00:08:35.459 --> 00:08:35.469
field and then the second accident that
 

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:36.990
field and then the second accident that
happened was I did a summer internship

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000
happened was I did a summer internship
 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.290
happened was I did a summer internship
at Bosch and they defined a problem in

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:40.300
at Bosch and they defined a problem in
 

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.660
at Bosch and they defined a problem in
batteries and I done nothing in

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:41.670
batteries and I done nothing in
 

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.030
batteries and I done nothing in
things up until that point this is just

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:44.040
things up until that point this is just
 

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.380
things up until that point this is just
a message to many of you that may be

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:47.390
a message to many of you that may be
 

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.340
a message to many of you that may be
thinking about getting into batteries

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:49.350
thinking about getting into batteries
 

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.430
thinking about getting into batteries
and I have no background I had no

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440
and I have no background I had no
 

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.040
and I have no background I had no
background eight years ago and I'm here

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.050
background eight years ago and I'm here
 

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.040
background eight years ago and I'm here
so so I think that you know everyone can

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.050
so so I think that you know everyone can
 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.980
so so I think that you know everyone can
get there by spending the right amount

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:00.990
get there by spending the right amount
 

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.360
get there by spending the right amount
of time on it

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:02.370
of time on it
 

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.260
of time on it
so I I switched sort of midway through

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:06.270
so I I switched sort of midway through
 

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.380
so I I switched sort of midway through
my PhD to think on lithium ion and and

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:09.390
my PhD to think on lithium ion and and
 

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.810
my PhD to think on lithium ion and and
next generation chemistry is related to

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820
next generation chemistry is related to
 

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.940
next generation chemistry is related to
lithium air and and i i i interviewed

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:16.950
lithium air and and i i i interviewed
 

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.880
lithium air and and i i i interviewed
here actually as a graduate student j

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:19.890
here actually as a graduate student j
 

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.710
here actually as a graduate student j
was Jay was in the audience and and he

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720
was Jay was in the audience and and he
 

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.330
was Jay was in the audience and and he
asked the sort of meanest toughest

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:26.340
asked the sort of meanest toughest
 

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.570
asked the sort of meanest toughest
questions when I was interviewing the

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:29.580
questions when I was interviewing the
 

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.370
questions when I was interviewing the
seminars up on YouTube so there's like

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380
seminars up on YouTube so there's like
 

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.780
seminars up on YouTube so there's like
proof that that happened and so then I

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:35.790
proof that that happened and so then I
 

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.760
proof that that happened and so then I
started my then I came here after a

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:37.770
started my then I came here after a
 

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.670
started my then I came here after a
brief stint at MIT and I I came here

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680
brief stint at MIT and I I came here
 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.590
brief stint at MIT and I I came here
started a group largely thinking about

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:44.600
started a group largely thinking about
 

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.200
started a group largely thinking about
electrification mostly on vehicles and

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.210
electrification mostly on vehicles and
 

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.520
electrification mostly on vehicles and
the sort of big question that we were

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:49.530
the sort of big question that we were
 

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.530
the sort of big question that we were
trying to answer was was how can we

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540
trying to answer was was how can we
 

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.830
trying to answer was was how can we
design organic electrolytes I think that

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:54.840
design organic electrolytes I think that
 

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.750
design organic electrolytes I think that
was the one piece that I felt there was

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760
was the one piece that I felt there was
 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.020
was the one piece that I felt there was
a lot of art to it and we wanted to try

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:00.030
a lot of art to it and we wanted to try
 

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.620
a lot of art to it and we wanted to try
and change that process of thinking

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:03.630
and change that process of thinking
 

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.500
and change that process of thinking
about electrolytes and so I'm not an

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:06.510
about electrolytes and so I'm not an
 

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.300
about electrolytes and so I'm not an
organic chemist so we thought about Big

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:08.310
organic chemist so we thought about Big
 

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.730
organic chemist so we thought about Big
Data long before Big Data was was sort

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:10.740
Data long before Big Data was was sort
 

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.460
Data long before Big Data was was sort
of a huge buzz word but I think you know

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:13.470
of a huge buzz word but I think you know
 

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.140
of a huge buzz word but I think you know
we've we've made phenomenal progress you

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.150
we've we've made phenomenal progress you
 

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.770
we've we've made phenomenal progress you
know I lead a team of or 20 other

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:17.780
know I lead a team of or 20 other
 

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.150
know I lead a team of or 20 other
accidental electro chemists and I think

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160
accidental electro chemists and I think
 

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.280
accidental electro chemists and I think
they will all like test that but I think

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:22.290
they will all like test that but I think
 

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.710
they will all like test that but I think
that's it has been phenomenal to have a

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720
that's it has been phenomenal to have a
 

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.240
that's it has been phenomenal to have a
group of very interesting mix from you

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.250
group of very interesting mix from you
 

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.090
group of very interesting mix from you
know physics chemical engineering Mackey

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100
know physics chemical engineering Mackey
 

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.150
know physics chemical engineering Mackey
material science and so on so I think

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160
material science and so on so I think
 

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.250
material science and so on so I think
it's been a great journey and and you

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:37.260
it's been a great journey and and you
 

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.620
it's been a great journey and and you
know I look forward to the the next ten

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:39.630
know I look forward to the the next ten
 

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.900
know I look forward to the the next ten
years of my career looking at you know

James alright ten years ago I was also

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:51.960
James alright ten years ago I was also
 

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.380
James alright ten years ago I was also
thinking about grad school just about to

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:54.390
thinking about grad school just about to
 

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.710
thinking about grad school just about to
enter I was actually excited for working

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720
enter I was actually excited for working
 

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.350
enter I was actually excited for working
at a gas turbine engine manufacturer

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360
at a gas turbine engine manufacturer
 

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.370
at a gas turbine engine manufacturer
I've always been interested in energy

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380
I've always been interested in energy
 

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.250
I've always been interested in energy
storage energy conversion energy

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260
storage energy conversion energy
 

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.330
storage energy conversion energy
generation and so I started off gas

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:08.340
generation and so I started off gas
 

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.950
generation and so I started off gas
turbine engines demo barrier coatings

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:09.960
turbine engines demo barrier coatings
 

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.720
turbine engines demo barrier coatings
and I saw this opportunity for fuel

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:11.730
and I saw this opportunity for fuel
 

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.130
and I saw this opportunity for fuel
cells and I ended up doing all my grad

experience there but I wanted to be a
 

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.710

three and a half years ago and in terms
 

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.449
three and a half years ago and in terms
of lithium-ion batteries and I would say

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:07.459
of lithium-ion batteries and I would say
 

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:08.920

it's very difficult to develop a product
and protect your intellectual property

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:37.660
and protect your intellectual property
 

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.509
and protect your intellectual property
but I would say that most of the

00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519
but I would say that most of the
 

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.160
but I would say that most of the
individual pieces of the technology are

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.170
individual pieces of the technology are
 

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.550
individual pieces of the technology are
out there and that it's a matter of

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560
out there and that it's a matter of
 

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.569
out there and that it's a matter of
sharing your information and you would

00:13:46.569 --> 00:13:46.579
sharing your information and you would
 

00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:49.689
sharing your information and you would
actually get there that would be high

00:13:49.689 --> 00:13:49.699
actually get there that would be high
 

00:13:49.699 --> 00:13:51.579

there's one of the other things we try
 

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:32.230
there's one of the other things we try
to do is if there is something that's

you'll start sharing that information
 

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.249
you'll start sharing that information
and that has actually happened in the

and that has actually happened in the
 

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:55.150
and that has actually happened in the
past but yeah for the most part silicon

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160
past but yeah for the most part silicon
 

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.439

personally you know I think the the
 

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.440
personally you know I think the the
biggest the biggest omission at least

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:28.450
biggest the biggest omission at least
 

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.660
biggest the biggest omission at least
from a personal stance standpoint is

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:30.670
from a personal stance standpoint is
 

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.020
from a personal stance standpoint is
flying

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.030
flying
 

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.180

I fly a hundred thousand miles a year

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:33.190
I fly a hundred thousand miles a year
 

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.830

not proud of it

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840
not proud of it
 

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.190
not proud of it
and my body doesn't like it and so we

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:38.200
and my body doesn't like it and so we
 

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.950
and my body doesn't like it and so we
would like to try and Electrify planes I

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960
would like to try and Electrify planes I
 

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960
would like to try and Electrify planes I
think it's not as hard as it might

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:42.970
think it's not as hard as it might
 

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.360
think it's not as hard as it might
imagine so I think that's one piece of

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:45.370
imagine so I think that's one piece of
 

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:48.090
imagine so I think that's one piece of
battery 2.0 at least personally the

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:48.100
battery 2.0 at least personally the
 

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.640

second thing which I think gets to many

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:50.650
second thing which I think gets to many
 

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.600
second thing which I think gets to many
of the things that people have been

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:51.610
of the things that people have been
 

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.430
of the things that people have been
talking about is in the battery business

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440
talking about is in the battery business
 

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.890
talking about is in the battery business
the problem is when people tell you

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:55.900
the problem is when people tell you
 

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.820
the problem is when people tell you
something

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:56.830
something
 

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.790
something
there's people tell you many things all

00:22:59.790 --> 00:22:59.800
there's people tell you many things all
 

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.680
there's people tell you many things all
of which could be true but they're all

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:01.690
of which could be true but they're all
 

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.220
of which could be true but they're all
never simultaneously true and and so as

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.230
never simultaneously true and and so as
 

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.970
never simultaneously true and and so as
a result this sort of a huge mistrust in

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:08.980
a result this sort of a huge mistrust in
 

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:12.150
a result this sort of a huge mistrust in
the battery field and I think part of

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:12.160
the battery field and I think part of
 

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.710
the battery field and I think part of
this is is that it's a hard problem

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720
this is is that it's a hard problem
 

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.080
this is is that it's a hard problem
you know multiphysics multi-dimensional

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:19.090

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.030

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.060

a key layer as we go forward and so I

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:24.070
a key layer as we go forward and so I
 

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.049
a key layer as we go forward and so I
think having data fill the gap

00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:28.059
think having data fill the gap
 

00:23:28.059 --> 00:23:30.029
think having data fill the gap
and and be the sort of driver of

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:32.459

would be a battery 2.0 and I still think

00:24:21.869 --> 00:24:21.879
would be a battery 2.0 and I still think

would be a battery 2.0 and I still think
that battery 1.0 still has a lot of

that battery 1.0 still has a lot of
 

00:24:23.469 --> 00:24:24.930
that battery 1.0 still has a lot of

not necessarily a step change just

value of that learning curve we need to

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.110
value of that learning curve we need to
 

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.790
value of that learning curve we need to
produce the volume and so lithium-ion

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:00.800
produce the volume and so lithium-ion
 

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.640

technologies compete we have to give

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.390
technologies compete we have to give
 

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.420

of more crosstalk between R&amp;D I think

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:42.300
of more crosstalk between R&amp;D I think
 

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.930
of more crosstalk between R&amp;D I think
there's a lot of people that work a lot

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940
there's a lot of people that work a lot
 

00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.330
there's a lot of people that work a lot
on either R or either D and I think

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340
on either R or either D and I think
 

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.580
on either R or either D and I think
there's very little crosstalk in my own

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:49.590
there's very little crosstalk in my own
 

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.810
there's very little crosstalk in my own
experience and I think some of my

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:50.820

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.940

students will attest to this when you

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:52.950
students will attest to this when you
 

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.790

about research how you think about
 

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.770
about research how you think about
framing your question and and you sort

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:06.780
framing your question and and you sort
 

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:10.430
framing your question and and you sort
of know whether what you do will ever

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440
of know whether what you do will ever
 

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.750
of know whether what you do will ever
make a difference and I think that's a

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760
make a difference and I think that's a
 

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.420
make a difference and I think that's a
really important thing that I think some

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:14.430
really important thing that I think some
 

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.050
really important thing that I think some
of the agencies like goe and arpa-e

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:17.060

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.390
of the agencies like goe and arpa-e
encourage of course the challenge with

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:20.400
encourage of course the challenge with
 

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:24.710
encourage of course the challenge with
many of that kind of funding comes sort

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720
many of that kind of funding comes sort
 

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.960
many of that kind of funding comes sort
of challenging milestones and

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:26.970
of challenging milestones and
 

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.770
of challenging milestones and
deliverables that you know this is

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:30.780
deliverables that you know this is
 

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.050
deliverables that you know this is
sometimes hard to predict with such

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:33.060
sometimes hard to predict with such
 

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.860
sometimes hard to predict with such
ambitious projects and and obviously

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:36.870
ambitious projects and and obviously
 

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.090
ambitious projects and and obviously
when you want to try and bring anything

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100
when you want to try and bring anything
 

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.610
when you want to try and bring anything
new you have to also assume that the

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:40.620
new you have to also assume that the
 

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.530
new you have to also assume that the
current technology is going to get so

00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:42.540
current technology is going to get so
 

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.190
current technology is going to get so
much better and so you have to assume

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200
much better and so you have to assume
 

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.450
much better and so you have to assume
that you can beat them five years from

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460
that you can beat them five years from
 

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.450
that you can beat them five years from
now so I think there are some pieces

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:50.460
now so I think there are some pieces
 

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:55.670
now so I think there are some pieces
that are very good with how are PE and

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:55.680
that are very good with how are PE and
 

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:00.140
that are very good with how are PE and
and do e elements that they have in

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:00.150
and do e elements that they have in
 

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.170
and do e elements that they have in
their funding model but they're I think

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:02.180
their funding model but they're I think
 

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.000
their funding model but they're I think
taking a longer-term view is of course

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:05.010
taking a longer-term view is of course
 

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:06.500
taking a longer-term view is of course
challenging but I think would be

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:06.510
challenging but I think would be
 

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.870
challenging but I think would be
something that would greatly benefit

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880
something that would greatly benefit
 

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:14.080
something that would greatly benefit
these sorts of very ambitious projects

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:14.090
 
 

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.580
 
all right I think I'm definitely

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:16.590
all right I think I'm definitely
 

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:18.650
all right I think I'm definitely
agreeing on a particularly the rnd

agreeing on a particularly the rnd
 

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.180
agreeing on a particularly the rnd
separation there that's definitely

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:20.190

problem you could imagine and they're so
satisfied with that result and then they

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980
satisfied with that result and then they
 

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.820
satisfied with that result and then they
try to scale it up and and oftentimes

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:34.830
try to scale it up and and oftentimes
 

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:38.600
try to scale it up and and oftentimes
that coin sale result was fairly

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:38.610
that coin sale result was fairly
 

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.940
that coin sale result was fairly
meaningless so by coin sell just to be

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.130
them on a grant to to facilitate it and
so we've seen a whole lot of different

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140
so we've seen a whole lot of different
 

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.930
so we've seen a whole lot of different
applications and the ones that succeed

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:38.940
applications and the ones that succeed
 

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.880
applications and the ones that succeed
and don't and I would generally I

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:43.890
and don't and I would generally I
 

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.680
and don't and I would generally I
generally think that the better ones do

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:45.690
generally think that the better ones do
 

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:47.720
generally think that the better ones do
tend to succeed although the ones that

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:47.730
tend to succeed although the ones that
 

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.020
tend to succeed although the ones that
promise the most to get the grants the

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.030
promise the most to get the grants the
 

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:53.270
promise the most to get the grants the
most as well which is which is some some

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:53.280
most as well which is which is some some
 

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.620
most as well which is which is some some
of what of a challenge I think but

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:54.630
of what of a challenge I think but
 

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:57.860
of what of a challenge I think but
that's hard to hard to fight against

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:57.870
that's hard to hard to fight against
 

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.510
that's hard to hard to fight against
obviously the person promising the most

00:33:59.510 --> 00:33:59.520
obviously the person promising the most
 

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.660
obviously the person promising the most
is the most enticing or the biggest liar

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:02.670
is the most enticing or the biggest liar
 

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.260
is the most enticing or the biggest liar
yeah

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:04.270
yeah
 

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.110
yeah
well the most optimistic you can just be

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120
well the most optimistic you can just be
 

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.240
well the most optimistic you can just be
I like to be I like to be positive and

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.250
I like to be I like to be positive and
 

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.750
I like to be I like to be positive and
just say they were the most optimistic

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760
just say they were the most optimistic
 

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.470
just say they were the most optimistic
researchers but yes I do think that that

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480
researchers but yes I do think that that
 

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.020
researchers but yes I do think that that
step between early research and later

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:19.030
step between early research and later
 

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.240
step between early research and later
development and scale-up it could be

00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:21.250
development and scale-up it could be
 

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.220
development and scale-up it could be
bridged a lot more and that's really

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:23.230
bridged a lot more and that's really
 

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.810
bridged a lot more and that's really
what the book is all about was was

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:24.820
what the book is all about was was
 

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:29.280
what the book is all about was was
creating that bridge and I think we've

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.290
creating that bridge and I think we've
 

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.730
creating that bridge and I think we've
had some success in that great so I'm

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:32.740
had some success in that great so I'm
 

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.409
had some success in that great so I'm
going to echo a couple of things that

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:34.419
going to echo a couple of things that
 

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:38.310
going to echo a couple of things that
that were said just now which is that I

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320
that were said just now which is that I
 

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.649
that were said just now which is that I
think a major priority going forward for

00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:40.659
think a major priority going forward for
 

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:43.470
think a major priority going forward for
battery R&amp;D is to develop metrics so

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480
battery R&amp;D is to develop metrics so
 

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.350
battery R&amp;D is to develop metrics so
that you can actually compare different

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:46.360
that you can actually compare different
 

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.119
that you can actually compare different
technologies on a level playing field

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:48.129
technologies on a level playing field
 

00:34:48.129 --> 00:34:52.020
technologies on a level playing field
and so broadly speaking you know when

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:52.030
and so broadly speaking you know when
 

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.919
and so broadly speaking you know when
you're developing a new battery

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:52.929
you're developing a new battery
 

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:54.750
you're developing a new battery
technology things are concerned with our

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760
technology things are concerned with our
 

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.730
technology things are concerned with our
how much energy can it hold how much

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:56.740
how much energy can it hold how much
 

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.290
how much energy can it hold how much
power can it deliver how long can you

00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:58.300
power can it deliver how long can you
 

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.880
power can it deliver how long can you
cycle it how many times can you charge

00:34:59.880 --> 00:34:59.890
cycle it how many times can you charge
 

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:01.680
cycle it how many times can you charge
and discharge it how much does it cost

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:01.690
and discharge it how much does it cost
 

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:05.490
and discharge it how much does it cost
and how safe is it and so you know I

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:05.500
and how safe is it and so you know I
 

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.870
and how safe is it and so you know I
think that it would be great if there

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880
think that it would be great if there
 

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.490
think that it would be great if there
were some priority around developing a

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:08.500
were some priority around developing a
 

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.990
were some priority around developing a
standard set of metrics to evaluate

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000
standard set of metrics to evaluate
 

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.060
standard set of metrics to evaluate
every technology along those different

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:12.070
every technology along those different
 

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.680
every technology along those different
axes it would be fairly straightforward

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:13.690
axes it would be fairly straightforward
 

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.410
axes it would be fairly straightforward
to propose you know for different

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:16.420
to propose you know for different
 

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.280
to propose you know for different
applications where there's

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:17.290
applications where there's
 

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.050
applications where there's
transportation for its storage etc which

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:19.060
transportation for its storage etc which
 

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.130
transportation for its storage etc which
ones are more important how they should

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:20.140
ones are more important how they should
 

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.099
ones are more important how they should
be weighted but you know it's sort of I

00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:23.109
be weighted but you know it's sort of I
 

00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:26.580
be weighted but you know it's sort of I
think that there's an issue in that you

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:26.590
think that there's an issue in that you
 

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.560
think that there's an issue in that you
hear so often in the media the sort of

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:28.570
hear so often in the media the sort of
 

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.760
hear so often in the media the sort of
the stories that bubble up to the media

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:29.770
the stories that bubble up to the media
 

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.080
the stories that bubble up to the media
about the newest battery breakthrough

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.090
about the newest battery breakthrough
 

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.000
about the newest battery breakthrough
it's somebody has a technology that can

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:33.010
it's somebody has a technology that can
 

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:34.349
it's somebody has a technology that can
you know we'll be able to charge your

00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359
you know we'll be able to charge your
 

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:35.790
you know we'll be able to charge your
car in 10 seconds your electric vehicle

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800
car in 10 seconds your electric vehicle
 

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.070
car in 10 seconds your electric vehicle
in 10 seconds or what have you but

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.080
in 10 seconds or what have you but
 

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.140
in 10 seconds or what have you but
almost invariably there's some one of

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:40.150
almost invariably there's some one of
 

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:41.580
almost invariably there's some one of
those acts one or more of those axes of

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:41.590
those acts one or more of those axes of
 

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:44.250
those acts one or more of those axes of
performance is sort of being hidden and

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:44.260
performance is sort of being hidden and
 

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.530
performance is sort of being hidden and
not talked about and those are important

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:46.540
not talked about and those are important
 

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:48.210
not talked about and those are important
very relevant and so I think some you

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:48.220
very relevant and so I think some you
 

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:52.560
very relevant and so I think some you
know making it a priority in terms of

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:52.570
know making it a priority in terms of
 

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.599
know making it a priority in terms of
research funding where those resources

00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:54.609
research funding where those resources
 

00:35:54.609 --> 00:35:56.400
research funding where those resources
go being able to evaluate these things

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.410
go being able to evaluate these things
 

00:35:56.410 --> 00:35:57.990
go being able to evaluate these things
so you can separate out sort of the the

00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000
so you can separate out sort of the the
 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.910
so you can separate out sort of the the
science projects or the you know the

00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920
science projects or the you know the
 

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.590

that runs for ten thousand cycles you

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:02.950
that runs for ten thousand cycles you
 

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.070
that runs for ten thousand cycles you
have no idea why

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:05.080
have no idea why

called beta battery right and then they

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:42.940
called beta battery right and then they
 

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.640
called beta battery right and then they
decided they were gonna scale this is a

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:44.650
decided they were gonna scale this is a
 

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.490
decided they were gonna scale this is a
high-temperature what was it a nickel

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:01.390
manufacturing the team the clean rooms
 

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:07.920
manufacturing the team the clean rooms
everything and what happened that's

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:07.930
everything and what happened that's
 

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.960
everything and what happened that's
right and and so I get my question

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:09.970
right and and so I get my question
 

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.180
right and and so I get my question
really is corporate wise the GES of the

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:12.190
really is corporate wise the GES of the
 

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:13.800
really is corporate wise the GES of the
world I mean are they diving back in the

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:13.810
world I mean are they diving back in the
 

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.300
world I mean are they diving back in the
new batteries or not like what's where

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:15.310
new batteries or not like what's where
 

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:17.730
new batteries or not like what's where
do people stand so I don't think so I

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:17.740
do people stand so I don't think so I
 

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:18.930
do people stand so I don't think so I
don't think we're gonna see any

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:18.940
don't think we're gonna see any
 

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.460
don't think we're gonna see any
personally I don't think you're gonna

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:20.470
personally I don't think you're gonna
 

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:23.010
personally I don't think you're gonna
see any big you know fortune 100 company

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:23.020
see any big you know fortune 100 company
 

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.830
see any big you know fortune 100 company
that's gonna go and start research from

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:25.840
that's gonna go and start research from
 

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.540
that's gonna go and start research from
the ground up I think what all those big

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:27.550
the ground up I think what all those big
 

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:29.070
the ground up I think what all those big
companies are doing is hoping that

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.080
companies are doing is hoping that
 

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.470
companies are doing is hoping that
either something gets through like Ted

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480
either something gets through like Ted
 

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.510
either something gets through like Ted
said right the D part of it where they

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520
said right the D part of it where they
 

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.550
said right the D part of it where they
can go out and deploy or they're very

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560
can go out and deploy or they're very
 

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.050

about battery 2.0 I think the story is
 

00:38:44.319 --> 00:38:47.030
about battery 2.0 I think the story is
largely about converting to that like

cobalt is the most challenging I think

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:16.750
cobalt is the most challenging I think
 

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.680
cobalt is the most challenging I think
at least one way I think about it is is

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:19.690
at least one way I think about it is is
 

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:21.980
at least one way I think about it is is
you you you have to sort of think about

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:21.990
you you you have to sort of think about
 

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.049
you you you have to sort of think about
whether the control of production of

00:39:25.049 --> 00:39:25.059
whether the control of production of
 

00:39:25.059 --> 00:39:28.140
whether the control of production of
that particular material is is

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:28.150
that particular material is is
 

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.549
that particular material is is
controlled by one country or many

00:39:29.549 --> 00:39:29.559
controlled by one country or many
 

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:31.770
controlled by one country or many
countries and so for nearly all other

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:31.780
countries and so for nearly all other
 

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.990
countries and so for nearly all other
materials including lithium and and

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000
materials including lithium and and
 

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.549
materials including lithium and and
we're not gonna run sure the lithium the

00:39:35.549 --> 00:39:35.559
we're not gonna run sure the lithium the
 

00:39:35.559 --> 00:39:37.920
we're not gonna run sure the lithium the
simple arithmetic that you can do all

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:37.930
simple arithmetic that you can do all
 

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.440
simple arithmetic that you can do all
you need is one mole of lithium and one

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:40.450
you need is one mole of lithium and one
 

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.390
you need is one mole of lithium and one
mole of transition metal lithium is so

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400
mole of transition metal lithium is so
 

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.650
mole of transition metal lithium is so
light so you you can do a

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:43.660
light so you you can do a
 

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:45.480
light so you you can do a
back-of-the-envelope looking back at

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:45.490
back-of-the-envelope looking back at
 

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.010
back-of-the-envelope looking back at
your periodic table and know that you

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:47.020
your periodic table and know that you
 

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.319
your periodic table and know that you
know you need one tenth of lithium for

00:39:49.319 --> 00:39:49.329
know you need one tenth of lithium for
 

00:39:49.329 --> 00:39:51.990
know you need one tenth of lithium for
transition metals so lithium is likely

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000
transition metals so lithium is likely
 

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.620
transition metals so lithium is likely
not going to be the bottleneck cobalt

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:55.630
not going to be the bottleneck cobalt
 

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.180
not going to be the bottleneck cobalt
may be there there are many options

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:57.190
may be there there are many options
 

00:39:57.190 --> 00:40:01.140
may be there there are many options
related to sort of low cobalt so of

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:01.150
related to sort of low cobalt so of
 

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.059
related to sort of low cobalt so of
course I think this is a challenge but I

00:40:03.059 --> 00:40:03.069
course I think this is a challenge but I
 

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:05.400
course I think this is a challenge but I
don't think this is something that it's

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:05.410
don't think this is something that it's
 

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:10.380
don't think this is something that it's
going to be a huge showstopper yeah and

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:10.390
going to be a huge showstopper yeah and
 

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.900
going to be a huge showstopper yeah and
I could I could add to that I would

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:12.910
I could I could add to that I would
 

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.910
I could I could add to that I would
agree and I think though that where it

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:14.920
agree and I think though that where it
 

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.280
agree and I think though that where it
blends together with where it can be

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.290
blends together with where it can be
 

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:18.990
blends together with where it can be
challenging is the price fluctuation

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000
challenging is the price fluctuation
 

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.120
challenging is the price fluctuation
it's the industry is large enough now

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.130
it's the industry is large enough now

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:12.560
do because that an optimized battery for
 

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.350
do because that an optimized battery for
a car is totally different than a

00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:14.360
a car is totally different than a
 

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.580
a car is totally different than a
battery without device for stationary

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:15.590
battery without device for stationary
 

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:18.280
battery without device for stationary
storage right now and if we could find a

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:18.290
storage right now and if we could find a
 

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.410
storage right now and if we could find a
way to create a Silver Bullet chemistry

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:20.420
way to create a Silver Bullet chemistry
 

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.230
way to create a Silver Bullet chemistry
or cell configuration or something that

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:23.240
or cell configuration or something that
 

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.720
or cell configuration or something that
will allow for both of those markets to

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:25.730
will allow for both of those markets to
 

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.690
will allow for both of those markets to
be served perfectly or well because

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:28.700
be served perfectly or well because
 

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.550
be served perfectly or well because
right now like Tesla solution of putting

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:30.560
right now like Tesla solution of putting
 

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.500
right now like Tesla solution of putting
its battery cells into a package a

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:32.510
its battery cells into a package a
 

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.630
its battery cells into a package a
hanging on a wall is not actually a good

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640
hanging on a wall is not actually a good
 

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.070
hanging on a wall is not actually a good
stationary storage plate it just it's

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:36.080
stationary storage plate it just it's
 

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.630
stationary storage plate it just it's
not I mean it it's great the Tesla's

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640
not I mean it it's great the Tesla's
 

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.040
not I mean it it's great the Tesla's
doing it in their popularizing the idea

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.050
doing it in their popularizing the idea
 

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.080
doing it in their popularizing the idea
but electric chemically it's not the

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:41.090
but electric chemically it's not the
 

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:41.530
but electric chemically it's not the
right answer

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:41.540
right answer
 

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:44.410
right answer
so battery 2.0 in my mind or maybe 3.0

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:44.420
so battery 2.0 in my mind or maybe 3.0
 

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.000
so battery 2.0 in my mind or maybe 3.0
is something that is both that can do

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.010
is something that is both that can do
 

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.220
is something that is both that can do
both things because you'd love to

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:48.230
both things because you'd love to
 

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.230
both things because you'd love to
leverage the two you know the two

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240
leverage the two you know the two
 

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.730
leverage the two you know the two
markets and people talk about doing it

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:51.740
markets and people talk about doing it
 

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:55.170
markets and people talk about doing it
now but it's more difficult so with that

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:55.180
now but it's more difficult so with that
 

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.130
now but it's more difficult so with that
thank our audience

00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140
thank our audience
 

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:06.840
thank our audience
