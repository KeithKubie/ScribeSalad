00:00:02.474 --> 00:00:05.290
You now have everything you need
to make the rest of the test pass.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.939
Remember that this workflow may not seem
the most intuitive or easy at first,

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.340
but it'll make sure your code works.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.570
Now that you have everything that you
need, work through each test one by one

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.756
and until they pass,
refactor your code afterwards.

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:19.451
Best of luck [SOUND]
