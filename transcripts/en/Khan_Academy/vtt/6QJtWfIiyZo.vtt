00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.270
Welcome to the presentation
on simplifying radicals.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.890
So let's get started with
a little terminology

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.490
out of the way.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.310
You're probably just wondering
what a radical is and

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.880
I'll just let you know.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.280
A radical is just that.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.470
Or you're probably more
familiar calling that

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.830
the square root symbol.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.680
So with the terminology out of
the way, let's actually talk

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.800
about what it means to
simplify a radical.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.020
And some people would argue
that what we're going to

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.890
actually be doing is actually
making it more complicated.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.140
But let's see.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.900
So if I were to give you
the square root of 36.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.610
Hey, that's easy.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.790
That's just equal to 6 times
6 or you'd say the square

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.850
root of 36 is just 6.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.390
Now, what if I asked you what
the square root of 72 is?

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.590
Well we know that
72 is 36 times 2.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.680
Let's write that.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.850
Square root of 72 is the
same thing as the square

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.310
root of 36 times 2.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.690
And the square root, if you
remember from level 3

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.520
exponents, square root is
the same thing as something

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.920
to the 1/2 power.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.860
So let's write it that way.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.710
And I'm just writing it this
way just to show you how this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.580
radical simplification works
and that it's really

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.970
not a new concept.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.750
So this is the same thing as
36 times 2 to the 1/2 power.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.210
Because it's just a square root
is the same thing as 1/2 power.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.860
And we learned from the
exponent rules that when you

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.890
multiply two numbers and then
you raise that to the 1/2

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.010
power, that that's the same
thing as raising each of the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.500
numbers to the 1/2 power
and then multiplying.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.330
Well that right there, that's
the same thing as saying the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.480
square root is 36 times
the square root of 2.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.780
And we already figured out what
the square root of 36 is.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.810
It's 6.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.430
So that just equals 6 times
the square root of 2.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.060
And you're probably wondering
why I went through this step

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.340
of changing the radical, the
square root symbol,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.530
into the 1/2 power.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160
And I did that just to show you
that this is just an extension

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.030
of the exponent rules.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.450
It isn't really a new concept,
although, I guess sometimes

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690
it's not so obvious that
they are the same concepts.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.480
I just wanted to
point that out.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.470
So let's do another problem.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.820
I think as we do more and
more problems, these will

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.260
become more obvious.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.820
The square root of 50.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.920
Well, the square root of
50 -- 50 is the same

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.150
thing as 25 times 2.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.790
And we know, based on what we
just did and this is really

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.670
just an exponent rule, square
root of 25 times 2 is the same

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.070
thing as the square root of 25
times the square root of 2.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.580
Well we know what the
square root of 25 is.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.170
That's 5.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.700
So that just equals 5 times
the square root of 2.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.610
Now, you might be saying, "Hey,
Sal, you make it look easy, but

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.210
how did you know to split 50
into 25 and 2?" Why didn't I

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.010
say that 50 is equal to the
square root of 5 and 10 or that

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.800
50 is equal to the square root
-- actually, I think 1 and 50?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.160
I don't know what
other factors is 50.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.570
Well, anyway, I won't go
into that right now.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.590
The reason why I picked 25 and
2 is because I wanted a factor

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.640
of 50 -- I actually wanted the
largest factor of 50 that

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.880
is a perfect square.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.860
And that's 25.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.970
If I had done 5 and 10, there's
really nothing I could have

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.900
done with it because neither 5
nor 10 are perfect squares and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.610
same thing's with 1 and 50.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.270
So the way you should think
about it, think about the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.960
factors of the original number
and figure out if any of those

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.890
factors are perfect squares.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.370
And there's no real
mechanical way.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.280
You really just have to learn
to recognize perfect squares.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.940
And you'll get familiar
with them, of course.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:17.150
They're 1, 4, 9, 25, 16,
25, 36, 49, 64, et cetera.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.980
And maybe by doing this module,
you'll actually learn to

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.290
recognize them more readily.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.930
But if any of these numbers are
a factor of the number under

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.360
the radical sign, then you'll
probably want to

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.020
factor them out.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.130
And then you can take them
out of the radical sign like

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.620
we did up in this problem.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.730
Let's do a couple more.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.470
What is 7 times the
square root of 27?

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.420
And when I write the 7 right
next to it, that just means

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.510
times the square root of 27.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.665
Well, let's think about what
other factors of 27 and

00:04:50.665 --> 00:04:52.050
whether any of them
are a perfect square.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.710
Well, 3 is a factor of 27, but
that's not a perfect square.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.260
9 is.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.800
So, we could say 7 -- that's
equal to 7 times the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.490
square root of 9 times 3.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.860
And now, based on the rules we
just learned, that's the same

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.580
thing as 7 times the square
root of 9 times the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.080
square root of 3.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.230
Well that just equals 7 times 3
because the square root of 9 is

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.270
3 times the square root of 3.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.670
That equals 21 times
the square root of 3.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.830
Done.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.710
Let's do another one.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:46.000
What is 9 times the
square root of 18?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.210
Well once again, what
are the factors of 18?

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.010
Well do we have 6 and 3?

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.280
1 and 18?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.550
None of the numbers I mentioned
so far are perfect squares.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.540
But we also have 2 and 9.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.010
And 9 is a perfect square.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.770
Let's write that.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:07.020
That's equal to 9 times the
square root of 2 times 9.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.560
Which is equal to 9 times the
square root of 2 -- that's a 2

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.580
-- times the square root of 9.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.110
Which equals 9 times the square
root of 2 times 3, right?

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.520
That's the square root of
9 which equals 27 times

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.250
the square root of 2.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.130
There we go.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.160
Hopefully, you're starting to
get the hang of these problems.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.070
Let's do another one.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.830
What is 4 times the
square root of 25?

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.000
Well 25 itself is
a perfect square.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.620
This problem is so easy, it's
a bit of a trick problem.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.130
25 itself is a perfect square.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.150
The square root is 5, so this
is just equal to 4 times

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.910
5, which is equal to 20.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.020
Square root of 25 is 5.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.220
Let's do another one.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.550
What's 3 times the
square root of 29?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.190
Well 29 only has two factors.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.870
It's a prime number.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.450
It only has the
factors 1 and 29.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.750
And neither of those numbers
are perfect squares.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.220
So we really can't simplify
this one anymore.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.340
So this is already in
completely simplified form.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.480
Let's do a couple more.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:32.140
What about 7 times the
square root of 320?

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.700
Let's think about 320.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.320
Well we could actually do
it in steps when we have

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.810
larger numbers like this.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.290
I can look at it and say, well
it does look like 4 -- actually

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.200
it looks like 16 would go into
this because 16 goes into 32.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.380
So let's try that.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:55.280
So that equals 7 times the
square root of 16 times 20.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:04.310
That just equals 7 times the
square root of 16 times

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.960
the square root of 20.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.590
7 times the square root of 16.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.380
The square root of 16 is 4.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:11.630
So 7 times 4 is 28.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:17.110
So that's 28 times the
square root of 20.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:19.100
Now are we done?

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.800
Well actually, I think I can
factor 20 even more because

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.680
20 is equal to 4 times 5.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.650
So I can say this is equal
to 28 times the square

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.570
root of 4 times 5.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:38.270
The square root of 4 is 2 so
that could just take the 2 out

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:43.170
and that becomes 56 times
the square root of 5.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.450
I hope that made sense to you.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.980
And this is actually a
pretty important technique

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.890
I just did here.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:49.060
Immediately when I look at 320.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:52.160
I don't know what the largest
number is that goes into 320.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.150
It actually turns
out that it's 64.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.250
But just looking at the
number, I said, well I

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.610
know that 4 goes into it.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.520
So I could have just pulled out
4 and then said, "Oh, that's

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.090
equal to 4 times 80." And then
I would have had

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.210
to work with 80.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.760
In this case, I saw 32 and I
was like, it looks like 16 goes

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.260
into it and I factored out 16
first and when I took out the

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.890
square root of 16, I multiplied
the outside by 4 and

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.160
that's how I got the 28.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.670
But then I reduced the number
on the inside said, "Oh, well

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.430
that still is divisible
by a perfect square.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.270
It's still divisible by 4." And
then I kept doing it until I

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:25.250
was left with essentially, a
prime number or a number that

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.710
couldn't be reduced anymore
under the radical.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:29.950
And it actually doesn't
have to be prime.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.140
So hopefully, that gives you
a good sense of how to do

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.270
radical simplification.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.020
It's really just an extension
of the exponent rules that

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.180
you've already learned and
hopefully as you do the module,

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.890
you'll get good at it.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:43.420
Have fun.
