00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:04.600
MINZAYAR OO: Some work by day.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.840
Some work by night, jumping
and running along steep slopes,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.910
or moving among the arms and
legs of big mining machines,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.790
and with landslides often
killing hundreds of them

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:16.900
at a time.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.010
INTERVIEWER: This is the world's
epicenter of jade mining--

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.130
in the town of Hpakant
in Northern Myanmar.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.020
It's here where large
mining companies

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.140
use dynamite to turn
mountains into rubble, where

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.120
impoverished
freelance miners then

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.810
rush to scavenge through debris
without any safety measures,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.210
hoping to find the coveted
milky green gemstone.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.000
MINZAYAR OO: For the Chinese,
they love the jade stones.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.350
There's even a saying, gold is
valuable but jade is priceless.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.630
It is a status of wealth.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.490
It is a symbol of charm, good
luck, good health, et cetera.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.540
A handful, a small size
of a good quality stone

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.670
can be worth up to
millions of dollars.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.740
INTERVIEWER: That was Minzayar
Oo, a photojournalist who

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.990
has been documenting the
harsh and complex realities

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.505
surrounding this precious stone.

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.900
MINZAYAR OO: In my
opinion, this dream,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.170
which is to find a
life changing stone,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.050
seems really a rare
chance compared

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.110
to the higher chance of
being killed in an accident

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.545
or to becoming drug
addicts, or maybe worse.

00:01:16.545 --> 00:01:18.480
INTERVIEWER: In
2015, a landslide

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.710
collapsed on a mining camp,
burying 114 sleeping workers.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.530
But despite the risk of
death and backbreaking work,

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.360
the miners are still pouring in.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.230
Myanmar's jade mining industry
is worth up to $31 billion

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.680
per year, nearly half
of the national GDP.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.510
But most of this
wealth gets pocketed

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.930
by large companies, drug
lords, and the military elite.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.560
MINZAYAR OO: The jade mining
here also linked in many ways

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.830
to the longest civil
conflict in the country.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.900
At the same time, it
has also been fueling

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.120
the conflict, the drug trade.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.960
It has played a big role in
countless human rights abuses

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.655
in the region.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.320
INTERVIEWER: However,
this tide could change.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.350
In 2016, Myanmar elected
its first civilian president

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.720
after 50 years of military rule.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.730
And it seems the government
is making strides

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.000
to fight corruption and improve
conditions for jade miners.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.070
In part, it's thanks
to photojournalists

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.110
like Minzayar Oo
whose work shows

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.035
that sometimes luxury comes
with a dark and hidden price.

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:20.100
MINZAYAR OO: I hope that my
work highlights the human costs,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.000
and that it would raise a
question if that cost is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.251
really worth it after all.

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:27.500
