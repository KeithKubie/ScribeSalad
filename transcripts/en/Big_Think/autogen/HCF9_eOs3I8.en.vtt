I'm little bit hesitant to overstate the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
I'm little bit hesitant to overstate the
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.060
I'm little bit hesitant to overstate the
risk because some science is risk in

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
risk because some science is risk in
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.390
risk because some science is risk in
some science is not I do think that

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
some science is not I do think that
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.450
some science is not I do think that
probably biological advances will entail

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
probably biological advances will entail
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.260
probably biological advances will entail
ethical considers and I don't mean that

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
ethical considers and I don't mean that
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.820
ethical considers and I don't mean that
we shouldn't be doing certain types of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
we shouldn't be doing certain types of
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.200
we shouldn't be doing certain types of
research but I mean we should be able to

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210
research but I mean we should be able to
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.320
research but I mean we should be able to
evaluate for example if we do understand

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
evaluate for example if we do understand
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089
evaluate for example if we do understand
genes how much do we want to be able to

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
genes how much do we want to be able to
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.950
genes how much do we want to be able to
engineer I mean there's I don't know

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
engineer I mean there's I don't know
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.299
engineer I mean there's I don't know
that that's a risk but I think it's

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309
that that's a risk but I think it's
 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.860
that that's a risk but I think it's
important to be able that there's a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
important to be able that there's a
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.600
important to be able that there's a
systematic way of asking these questions

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610
systematic way of asking these questions
 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.020
systematic way of asking these questions
and that they're on the table there

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
and that they're on the table there
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.690
and that they're on the table there
probably are risks to the environment

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
probably are risks to the environment
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.060
probably are risks to the environment
there probably are risks to our food

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
there probably are risks to our food
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040
there probably are risks to our food
supply and it's not necessary from

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050
supply and it's not necessary from
 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.250
supply and it's not necessary from
science but sort of how science a it's

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260
science but sort of how science a it's
 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.200
science but sort of how science a it's
implied in sort of more agricultural

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
implied in sort of more agricultural
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.319
implied in sort of more agricultural
industrial context there probably are

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
industrial context there probably are
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.830
industrial context there probably are
risks associated with antibiotic

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
risks associated with antibiotic
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.069
risks associated with antibiotic
resistant bacteria there risks that sort

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
resistant bacteria there risks that sort
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229
resistant bacteria there risks that sort
but a lot of the risks I think have to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
but a lot of the risks I think have to
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.090
but a lot of the risks I think have to
do with saying how things are applied in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
do with saying how things are applied in
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.940
do with saying how things are applied in
general and I think that has I mean it's

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
general and I think that has I mean it's
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.200
general and I think that has I mean it's
not just a science research to be

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
not just a science research to be
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.020
not just a science research to be
controlled but perhaps industries using

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
controlled but perhaps industries using
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.370
controlled but perhaps industries using
scientific advances should be better

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
scientific advances should be better
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.990
scientific advances should be better
controlled for example um you know bio

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
controlled for example um you know bio
 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.370
controlled for example um you know bio
engineered food it's not that it's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
engineered food it's not that it's
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.230
engineered food it's not that it's
necessary bad but there should be some

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
necessary bad but there should be some
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.679
necessary bad but there should be some
way of regulating it to see if it is bad

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
way of regulating it to see if it is bad
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.940
way of regulating it to see if it is bad
or not and right now it's not I mean so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
or not and right now it's not I mean so
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.590
or not and right now it's not I mean so
I think the risks are sort of that

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
I think the risks are sort of that
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260
I think the risks are sort of that
things are changing so fast that sort of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
things are changing so fast that sort of
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.520
things are changing so fast that sort of
regulation doesn't necessarily keep up

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
regulation doesn't necessarily keep up
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.360
regulation doesn't necessarily keep up
with it so that's probably more than
