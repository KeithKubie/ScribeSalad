00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.760
In this lesson,
you learned about key metrics and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.510
how to go about measuring them.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.180
Ultimately, your product and business
goals will form what you measure.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.960
And don't forget that you can use the
heart framework to help you refine your

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.520
thinking and figure out next steps.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.010
&gt;&gt; You heard from Aaron Harris
about vanity metrics and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.640
about actionable metrics.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.280
You also learned from other
startups about what they measure.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.260
You have a great foundation for using
these metrics to improve your product.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.810
Now it's time for
you to go out and do that.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.370
&gt;&gt; We hope you enjoyed this course and

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.740
are eager to learn more
than what we covered here.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.940
Continue to dream up amazing ideas, and

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.230
always push yourself to bring delightful
and useful products to the world.
