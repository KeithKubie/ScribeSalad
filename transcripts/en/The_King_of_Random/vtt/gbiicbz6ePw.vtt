Guys welcome back, and thank you for joining me today on the King of Random

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.000
Guys welcome back, and thank you for joining me today on the King of Random

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.010
Guys welcome back, and thank you for joining me today on the King of Random

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.500
Today I am super excited to show you about this really cool project about a year ago

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.960
Today I am super excited to show you about this really cool project about a year ago

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.980
I was contacted by Devin Supertramp who had this amazing video idea to do Mario Kart in real life

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.460
He wanted my help building Mario Kart shells to the proportionate size, but he didn't just want them as static props.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.320
He wanted them to be able to drive around and run into the karts just like they do in the game

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.180
So here is one of the shells these things were a blast to make this is made of fiberglass and then painted to look like

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.079
The shells in the game as cool as the shell is just for decoration it wasn't enough

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.950
I needed to make it so we could drive around.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.400
The purpose of the video today is to show you how I turn these shells into moving homing shells just like in the game

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.879
and then to show you what they can do

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.020
Now I didn't just want these shells to be able to move I wanted them to

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.140
Haul and so I needed a car that had some good power behind it so I decided to use this car from

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.640
Traxxas this thing is a beast under the right conditions it can drive up to 60 miles an hour check this out.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.920
Alright, We're now out in a parking lot. We've got our car set up

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.020
It's hooked to the remote control, and we're ready to go. I wanted to show you why it is I wanted to use these cars

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.240
Doughnuts

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.860
So fast

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.040
I love it.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.900
Okay now it's time to turn this car into a drivable

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.540
Shell come look at the car body

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.919
And how it's attached and we'll show you how to switch it out for the shell the whole body of the car is just attached

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.920
with these four anchor points

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.989
These four points that were holding the car body on are the same points

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.670
We're gonna use to attach the shell to attach the shell to the car body the first thing I did was mark four little spots

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.070
Of paint one on each of these support posts on the car

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.020
So it left four little spots on the bottom of the shell which I then drilled out

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.420
After you've drilled a hole in the shell comes the tricky part

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.390
You need to line the holes up in the shell with the posts on the car

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.089
And then attach it using these pins from the inside of the shell since a lot of this has to be done by touch

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.020
it's good to memorize ahead of time the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.879
Orientation of the holes and the posts you can see that these two posts in the back

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.410
Have holes running forward and backward these two posts in the front have the holes running left to right

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.160
With the body taken off of the car you can sort of see all of the inner workings

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.359
You can see the drive shaft the motor that controls the car and the slot for the battery

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.279
The cars came with these little rings to help increase the tension of the suspension which is something

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.280
I want to do because of the weight of the shell

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.060
Three

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.479
Sometimes it is a blessing to have very skinny forearms

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.379
There's four

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.679
All right our shell RC car is ready to go. Let's open it up and see what she can do all right?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.010
We're back out in our driving area. Let's see what this thing can do with the shell attached

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.248
So I have my phone now taped on to the back bumper of the car

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:13.919
And it has a GPS based speedometer on it, and so we're gonna track just how fast I can get this card going

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.869
I'm not actually 100% sure how accurate the app is we're gonna see what results we get from it anyway

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.449
All right according to my app the maximum speed this car hit was 30 miles an hour that is 30 miles an hour on

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.489
A remote-controlled car how awesome is that?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.590
All right

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.220
So these things are so fun to drive around you could probably tell that

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.590
Maneuvering at high speeds didn't work very well the car has a tendency to tip over, at slow speeds

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.429
You've got great control and on straightaways you have crazy speed

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.869
I hope it's showing up really well in camera just how fast these things are driving there

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.399
You have it guys these things are a blast to drive around and if you want to see more footage of them in use go

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.320
Check out Devin Supertramp Svidler. He drives them around on a real-life Mario Kart course in the future

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.369
I'm going to show you all of the steps that I took to build these shells so that you can make them yourself

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.649
I really hope that you guys enjoyed seeing these shells in action as much as I enjoyed building them and showing them to you

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.399
Thank you for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.760
Well let's try that again but random happens

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.520
Hey guys back for just a second debts are a few questions. I've seen floating around

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.760
Where did I go and who is Nate well first of all I'm still here

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.599
I'm just not in the videos right now and secondly Nate is my new guy in training

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.709
He's gonna keep all the projects and experiments coming your way, so give him a high five to show your support

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.870
We'll see in the next video
