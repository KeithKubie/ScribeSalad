ZOLTAN ACS: Our flagship project
is our nonprofit [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.080
Accelerator Program,
the mentoring program,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.060
in which we are focusing on the
topics and the sectors which

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.990
can have significant social
impact on the society,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.080
has on sports,
urbanism, and mobility

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.410
and working and learning.

JOZEF VODICKA: Google
Developer's Launchpad

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.740
is mentor-driven event where
mentors have one-on-one session

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.000
with startups.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.910
And they exchange the
ideas, and mainly, they--

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.290
mentors are trying to teach
startups how to think.

HANOCH RABINOVITZ:
The event was really--

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.440
it was fascinating.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.420
I mean, I know Budapest is sort
of waking up with the startup

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.520
scene, startup ecosystem.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.627
So, it was super interesting
to be a guest in this city.

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:26.210
DOROTTYA GAL: Budapest
is a good place

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.040
to launch your startup
because it's really

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.730
booming city, both culturally
and from an economic

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.780
perspective as well.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.390
It's very good value
for money to live here.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.370
There are a lot
of skilled people,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.550
so you can find co-founders,
if you're missing a skill,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.430
very easily.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.670
So, it's worth to come here.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.545
DAVID SARLOS: During
the one-on-one sessions,

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:46.640
I have learned a new
phrase, which is invalidate.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.440
And we've been talking
so much about validation

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.940
that invalidation
seems to be, like,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.940
a huge revelation, the big
relief in understanding

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.095
what phrase are we headed to,
and what is there to challenge?

00:01:56.095 --> 00:01:58.220
DANIEL VATTAY: What I really
liked about this event

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.810
is that the focus
was quite different.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.320
And thus the companies
that came were

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.460
solving real problems, problems
that I could stand behind,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.479
problems that I can
support being solved.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.930
To put it another way,
they are creating value

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.640
that I think is valuable.
