00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:02.517
- May as well start with the shrimp salad

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:04.397
which is right before me.

00:00:04.397 --> 00:00:05.877
Oh, the shrimp are amazing.

00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:09.210
They look like little pieces of lobster.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:13.643
Well that's incredible.

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:19.227
Good morning everyone,

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:21.935
it's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:23.624
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:00:23.624 --> 00:00:25.844
It's another gorgeous morning outside.

00:00:25.844 --> 00:00:27.688
The sun is shining,

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:29.683
clear blue skies.

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:33.318
We are heading over to
Fridhemsplan metro station.

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:35.901
(button beeps)

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.599
Ride for two to Karlaplan.

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:46.150
(upbeat dance music)

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.732
We made it to the station.

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:56.654
I think I was mispronouncing it before.

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.027
It's more like Kar-la-plan.

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:01.370
There's this term in Sweden called fika,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.126
and in English, it would translate

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:04.897
to have a coffee,

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:06.689
but I think it's more than that,

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.751
and it's an important
part of Swedish culture.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:12.922
I think the actual word can mean a noun,

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:15.171
or be used as a noun or a verb.

00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.065
So you can say, "Let's fika,"

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:18.800
and that means let's have a coffee;

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.779
let's have a coffee break.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:21.484
Let's enjoy a pastry.

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:25.033
And so Ying and I are
walking over to a bakery,

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.700
and we are going to try to fika.

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:31.620
(upbeat dance music)

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.363
- [Cashier] So one of
each one, and one coffee?

00:01:39.363 --> 00:01:41.279
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:42.447
- [Cashier] Anything else?

00:01:42.447 --> 00:01:44.947
- [Mark] That's it, thank you.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.313
(upbeat dance music)

00:02:00.362 --> 00:02:03.345
This is a wonderful little
neighborhood bakery,

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:04.738
right across from a park.

00:02:04.738 --> 00:02:06.244
It's a quiet street.

00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:07.698
It's a very relaxing place,

00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:09.331
and you just walk into the bakery

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:10.928
and immediately you can smell the aroma

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:13.540
of cardamom in there and
the fresh baked bread.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.339
They have an assortment
of different baked goods,

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:16.950
and even sandwiches here.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.374
But I had to go for a cinnamon bun,

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:20.702
and also they are,

00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:22.864
this bakery is well known
for their cardamom buns,

00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:24.243
so I got one of each,

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:26.035
and then I got a coffee to go with it.

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.108
I'm gonna start with the cardamom roll,

00:02:28.108 --> 00:02:31.708
and it's really beautifully prepared.

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:33.398
I think it's from one strand,

00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:35.481
which is one long string of dough,

00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.650
which is then wrapped up into

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.733
almost like a bow tie,

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.795
a complex bow tie shape, and then baked.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.152
And you can see some,

00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:46.387
I think some sugar sprinkled on top,

00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:47.969
and you can really smell that aroma

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.739
of the cardamom in there.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.199
I think you could either unravel this

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.614
and eat it piece by piece,

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:57.364
but I think I'll just
go for the bite method.

00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:02.516
Wow.

00:03:04.078 --> 00:03:05.411
That is amazing.

00:03:07.662 --> 00:03:09.563
Oh, the cardamom comes in nicely.

00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:10.971
I think the cardamom is ground,

00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:13.562
so you get like that real pungent,

00:03:13.562 --> 00:03:15.811
fresh ground cardamom taste to it.

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:20.033
And then the bread itself is
crisp on the outside edges,

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.864
but then it's like perfectly
gooey on the inside.

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:27.031
And that has to be followed by coffee.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:32.063
And then for the cinnamon roll.

00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:35.563
I think for this one I will break a piece.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.857
That is equally amazing.

00:03:46.857 --> 00:03:48.859
But instead of cardamom, it's cinnamon.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:51.544
I have not eaten too many
cinnamon rolls in my life,

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:53.968
but this is the best I've had.

00:03:53.968 --> 00:03:55.296
It's awesome.

00:03:55.296 --> 00:03:58.111
It's like perfectly baked,

00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:01.616
the perfect texture, and then
just the wonderful mixture

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:04.823
of not too overly sweet, but sweet.

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:07.073
And then also mixed with that cinnamon.

00:04:07.073 --> 00:04:08.509
And also that cardamom.

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:09.801
I don't know which one I like better.

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:11.913
They're both really, really good

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:13.640
and just have that completely different

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.390
spice flavor to them.

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:20.011
That was an exceptionally
good baked product.

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:22.572
I think that was a very successful fika.

00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.401
What do you think Ying?

00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:25.756
- I like.

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:27.156
- Ying loved it.

00:04:27.156 --> 00:04:29.406
Especially the cinnamon roll.

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:32.112
We are walking towards the Vasa Museum,

00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:33.592
which is actually on the next island,

00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:35.348
so we're about to cross a bridge.

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:38.962
But the museum is home
to a 17th century ship,

00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:42.206
which sunk off the coast of Stockholm,

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:45.768
but the ship has since been
lifted out of the water

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:47.539
and restored and renovated,

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.729
and it's now in a museum.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.791
So that's where we're heading now.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.958
(driving dance music)

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.111
As we're crossing this bridge,

00:05:03.111 --> 00:05:05.636
I just got this incredible
whiff of a sausage.

00:05:05.636 --> 00:05:08.698
I think it might be coming from
that restaurant down there.

00:05:08.698 --> 00:05:10.926
That smells incredible.

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:14.093
(driving dance music)

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.939
There's quite a long line,

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.856
but I think it will go pretty fast.

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:27.693
Two adults please.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.337
That took about 15 minutes in line,

00:05:31.337 --> 00:05:33.522
and immediately upon entering the museum,

00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:36.522
you get a close-up look at the ship.

00:05:41.736 --> 00:05:46.024
And it set sail on the
10th of August, 1628,

00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:49.826
and it sunk right off
the coast of Stockholm.

00:05:49.826 --> 00:05:54.050
Then after sitting at the bottom
of the ocean for 333 years,

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.807
it was salvaged in 1961,

00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.368
and it is, from what the brochure says,

00:05:59.368 --> 00:06:02.017
it is 98% original,

00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:05.350
and it's really an amazing sight to see.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:09.186
The museum is set up with
the ship right in the center,

00:06:09.186 --> 00:06:11.936
and then on the various
levels surrounding it

00:06:11.936 --> 00:06:14.563
are exhibitions explaining
how it was salvaged,

00:06:14.563 --> 00:06:16.312
the different functions of the ship,

00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:19.729
and also some Swedish
cultural exhibitions as well.

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.421
At the very front of the
ship is the figurehead,

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:25.005
which is a three meter long lion,

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:27.711
which is stretched out
across the very front,

00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:29.816
leading the way of the ship.

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:32.130
And it's just amazing
how well it's preserved,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.297
and how giant the ship is.

00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:38.588
It's incredible to be able
to see the entire ship,

00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:41.592
in its entirety, from the 17th century,

00:06:41.592 --> 00:06:42.928
and so well preserved.

00:06:42.928 --> 00:06:46.381
And I especially enjoyed
all of the detailed carvings

00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:47.714
within the ship.

00:06:51.533 --> 00:06:54.305
There are a lot of museums
and parks in this area,

00:06:54.305 --> 00:06:55.517
but going to that museum,

00:06:55.517 --> 00:06:58.796
going to museums, it actually
makes you quite hungry.

00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:02.315
So we are walking over to a restaurant

00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:04.840
which looks like it's within this park,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.489
and it looks very calm and relaxing.

00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:10.656
(driving dance music)

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.017
I think it's cafeteria style.

00:07:18.017 --> 00:07:19.243
So you walk up to the front,

00:07:19.243 --> 00:07:20.295
you choose whatever you,

00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:21.572
you pay for it,

00:07:21.572 --> 00:07:24.497
and then you find a seat
somewhere in the garden.

00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:25.600
Beautiful place.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.683
Baked salmon.

00:07:29.424 --> 00:07:33.591
So you start at the front
of the line and grab a tray.

00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:37.507
They have lots of cakes and pastries

00:07:37.507 --> 00:07:38.820
that you can put on your tray,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.851
but I think I'm gonna

00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:41.411
head straight to the others.

00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:42.978
Crackers as well.

00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:45.303
Take a piece of cracker.

00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:47.220
So do you wanna go sit?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.120
I'm really hoping not to drop anything.

00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.004
This is an incredible restaurant,

00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:10.774
and you just walk inside.

00:08:10.774 --> 00:08:12.958
They have a menu, so you can order

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.337
some different hot dishes.

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:17.254
There are about, maybe
like less than 10 choices,

00:08:17.254 --> 00:08:19.699
and then they also have a bunch of cakes

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.129
and pastries and sandwiches,

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:22.849
some small bites that you can also order

00:08:22.849 --> 00:08:24.278
if you want something smaller.

00:08:24.278 --> 00:08:26.324
Ying and I ordered two
different dishes to share.

00:08:26.324 --> 00:08:28.429
This one is the shrimp salad.

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:29.655
Lots of shrimp in there.

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:31.716
There's lettuce, there's cucumber,

00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:34.161
there are, I don't even
know what these are.

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:35.366
At first I thought they were corn,

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:36.951
but they're definitely not corn.

00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:40.075
They're little morsels of something.

00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:41.584
And the other dish is the lamb meatballs,

00:08:41.584 --> 00:08:44.066
which are not in spherical form,

00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:46.475
but are more in like, lumps,

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:48.833
and then with potatoes and green beans.

00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:50.147
This has to be one of

00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:52.440
the more pretty places I've ever eaten.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.522
I guess I'll start with the shrimp salad

00:08:54.522 --> 00:08:56.380
which is right before me.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.289
Oh, these shrimp are amazing.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:02.622
They look like little pieces of lobster.

00:09:08.396 --> 00:09:09.229
Wow.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.316
That is as amazing,

00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:15.816
and as refreshing as it looks.

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:18.751
Oh that's incredible.

00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.884
The shrimp almost taste like crab.

00:09:20.884 --> 00:09:22.321
They have a real sweetness to them,

00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.772
natural sweetness to them.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.072
And then I can taste some
dill in there as well,

00:09:26.072 --> 00:09:30.273
and also it's like a salty,
creamy dressing all over it.

00:09:30.273 --> 00:09:31.956
That's incredibly good actually.

00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:35.265
It's really, really refreshing.

00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:36.557
What are those little,

00:09:36.557 --> 00:09:38.807
those little yellow things?

00:09:47.318 --> 00:09:49.560
That is an awesome salad.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.962
Really, if I had my eyes closed,

00:09:51.962 --> 00:09:53.805
and I didn't know it was shrimp,

00:09:53.805 --> 00:09:55.778
I would think it's crab.

00:09:55.778 --> 00:09:58.507
Because that shrimp is
almost stringy, like a crab,

00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:00.466
and then it has that
natural sweetness to it.

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:02.403
Next up for the lamb meatballs,

00:10:02.403 --> 00:10:04.573
or the lamb meat lumps.

00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:07.406
I'm going to call them meat lumps.

00:10:10.572 --> 00:10:12.967
Slice off a piece of that.

00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:15.300
Get a close-up look of that.

00:10:16.573 --> 00:10:18.996
Oh, you can see the
little air bubbles in it.

00:10:18.996 --> 00:10:21.579
I predict it to be very spongy.

00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:33.058
Mm, that texture prediction was correct.

00:10:33.058 --> 00:10:35.533
They are light and fluffy.

00:10:35.533 --> 00:10:37.013
And they are incredible tasting.

00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:39.890
I think I can taste a lot of rosemary

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.558
possibly ground up
within these meat lumps,

00:10:43.558 --> 00:10:46.685
and then that texture is spongy,

00:10:46.685 --> 00:10:49.856
but you can taste a little bit
of the lamb flavor in there,

00:10:49.856 --> 00:10:54.023
and this time I'm gonna
soak it in that sauce below.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:03.700
That's really, really good.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.101
I don't know if it's a red wine sauce,

00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:06.601
of it's kind of a,

00:11:07.728 --> 00:11:09.955
I don't know, that sauce is not,

00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:11.269
it's kind of neutral.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:12.836
A little bit of sweetness.

00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:16.377
And those lamb meatballs are awesome.

00:11:16.377 --> 00:11:18.728
Two really extremely good dishes.

00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:21.163
That was an absolutely incredible meal.

00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:24.580
The lamb meat kinda ovals were delicious,

00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:29.076
but that shrimp salad was hard to beat.

00:11:29.076 --> 00:11:32.076
The texture of the shrimp in Sweden,

00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:35.730
they're little and they're muscular,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.914
and they have this amazing kind of chewy,

00:11:37.914 --> 00:11:40.962
slightly chewy almost
crab-like texture to them.

00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:42.295
Fantastic salad.

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.223
Definitely one of the more pretty ambiance

00:11:46.223 --> 00:11:48.095
restaurant atmospheres,

00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:49.836
especially patios that I've been to

00:11:49.836 --> 00:11:51.672
in a long time.

00:11:51.672 --> 00:11:52.782
That was a fantastic meal.

00:11:52.782 --> 00:11:54.226
This is a place you just want to

00:11:54.226 --> 00:11:57.455
lean back in your chair
and relax after you eat.

00:11:57.455 --> 00:12:01.076
And that's exactly what
I'm gonna do right now.

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:03.159
Oh, that was really good.

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.967
Is he real?

00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:09.725
When it comes to relaxing
garden restaurants,

00:12:09.725 --> 00:12:11.372
I don't know if you can
get better than that.

00:12:11.372 --> 00:12:13.411
That was great food,

00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:15.312
an amazing atmosphere,

00:12:15.312 --> 00:12:17.431
and I think it's very popular with locals

00:12:17.431 --> 00:12:20.203
who come to just enjoy,
especially on the weekends

00:12:20.203 --> 00:12:23.134
to relax, to eat, to hang out.

00:12:23.134 --> 00:12:24.404
You could come here for a full meal,

00:12:24.404 --> 00:12:25.972
or you could come here
just to have coffee.

00:12:25.972 --> 00:12:28.228
Fika, you could come here to fika.

00:12:28.228 --> 00:12:29.737
That was a fantastic experience,

00:12:29.737 --> 00:12:31.581
highly recommended in Stockholm.

00:12:31.581 --> 00:12:35.622
The restaurant is literally
right next to the Abba museum.

00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:38.162
And we are walking towards the pier.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:40.829
Gonna try to take the boat back.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.373
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:49.779
We used the same metro card

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:52.424
and got into the dock, the pier,

00:12:52.424 --> 00:12:54.374
and now the boat is just arriving.

00:12:54.374 --> 00:12:57.146
We're gonna go to Slussen.

00:12:57.146 --> 00:13:00.729
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:28.718
Boats are a fantastic way
to get around Stockholm,

00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:30.263
and we could have taken the metro

00:13:30.263 --> 00:13:32.099
back to where we are going,

00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:33.376
but I really wanted to take the boat,

00:13:33.376 --> 00:13:36.431
just to get the views of the waterways,

00:13:36.431 --> 00:13:39.658
and also to see the views
of Stockholm from the water,

00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:40.863
and it's fantastic.

00:13:40.863 --> 00:13:43.533
All of the water life, the boats,

00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:47.283
the scenes of the old
buildings in Stockholm.

00:13:48.866 --> 00:13:50.470
Traveling by boat through a city

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.917
is one of the greatest ways to get around.

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:57.500
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:14:11.419 --> 00:14:14.278
There are also a number of
companies that offer boat tours,

00:14:14.278 --> 00:14:17.666
and I was thinking that would
be a really cool thing to do,

00:14:17.666 --> 00:14:19.422
but then I decided we just didn't have

00:14:19.422 --> 00:14:21.236
the time to do it on this trip.

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:24.741
But there are some pretty
cool canal tours of Stockholm,

00:14:24.741 --> 00:14:27.803
or you can just take a couple
rides for transportation

00:14:27.803 --> 00:14:29.305
like we are gonna do.

00:14:29.305 --> 00:14:30.466
It has started raining.

00:14:30.466 --> 00:14:34.383
I'm gonna put the camera
into this plastic bag.

00:14:35.393 --> 00:14:38.456
(indistinct people talking)

00:14:38.456 --> 00:14:41.050
Vlogging from under a plastic bag.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.020
I'm sure the view is not too good,

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.770
but this kinda works.

00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:50.306
The rain actually feels kinda good.

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.139
We took cover underneath a bridge.

00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:59.001
And we're gonna wait out
the rain for a little while.

00:15:01.815 --> 00:15:03.030
The rain has almost stopped.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.346
It's just very lightly sprinkling,

00:15:05.346 --> 00:15:08.493
and we decided to make a walk for it.

00:15:08.493 --> 00:15:10.206
Okay, it's starting to rain again.

00:15:10.206 --> 00:15:11.372
But my plan, we didn't really have

00:15:11.372 --> 00:15:12.977
anything extra planned right now.

00:15:12.977 --> 00:15:15.923
We just wanted to walk along the canals,

00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:18.208
and we're gonna walk up a little ways

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:21.024
and hopefully take another
boat across the canal,

00:15:21.024 --> 00:15:23.274
the waterway to our island.

00:15:28.752 --> 00:15:31.451
Okay, the rain really picked up again.

00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:33.301
We are underneath a bridge again,

00:15:33.301 --> 00:15:34.716
waiting out the rain.

00:15:34.716 --> 00:15:37.198
Oh now it's down-pouring.

00:15:37.198 --> 00:15:40.948
(rain splashing on pavement)

00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:50.034
That was quite a significant rain,

00:15:50.034 --> 00:15:52.458
but it has just stopped for the most part,

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:54.875
and we are back on track now.

00:15:56.188 --> 00:15:59.771
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:16:02.812 --> 00:16:05.548
There's a bridge up ahead
which we can take to cross over

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:07.565
and get back to our island.

00:16:07.565 --> 00:16:09.691
So we're just going to
take a leisurely stroll.

00:16:09.691 --> 00:16:10.947
It's really nice right now.

00:16:10.947 --> 00:16:12.761
Peaceful after the rain,

00:16:12.761 --> 00:16:15.547
and hoping that it doesn't
start down-pouring again.

00:16:15.547 --> 00:16:16.861
I've already said this a number of times

00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:18.319
since being in Stockholm,

00:16:18.319 --> 00:16:19.923
and I've only been here for two days,

00:16:19.923 --> 00:16:21.700
but it cannot be understated

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.867
how friendly of a walking
and biking city Stockholm is.

00:16:27.368 --> 00:16:29.494
And again it is the summer,

00:16:29.494 --> 00:16:31.417
so the weather is not too cold,

00:16:31.417 --> 00:16:32.534
but it's an amazing,

00:16:32.534 --> 00:16:36.039
they've designed Stockholm so well.

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:39.622
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:49.920
We made it to the bridge,

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.553
and this is a really long bridge.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:54.259
We are crossing over one canal

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:55.565
and then over to an island,

00:16:55.565 --> 00:16:56.712
and then we're gonna cross over

00:16:56.712 --> 00:16:59.339
the main big waterway channel

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:01.573
to get back to the island
that we're staying on

00:17:01.573 --> 00:17:03.156
where the hotel is.

00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:07.841
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:17:36.494 --> 00:17:38.550
We made it back to the hotel.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.070
Over there, that is the
bridge that we just crossed.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.653
(upbeat synthesizer music)

00:17:49.108 --> 00:17:52.112
For dinner tonight, we were
invited by Björk Restaurant,

00:17:52.112 --> 00:17:54.304
which is at the Courtyard Marriott.

00:17:54.304 --> 00:17:56.328
And this is a Scandinavian restaurant

00:17:56.328 --> 00:17:58.251
with a little bit of
everything on the menu,

00:17:58.251 --> 00:17:59.818
and it's a really nice restaurant,

00:17:59.818 --> 00:18:01.299
actually both inside,

00:18:01.299 --> 00:18:03.280
and we got a seat out here on the patio,

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.051
the perfect weather of Stockholm.

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:08.199
Going through the menu now.

00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:10.695
Salmon is always tempting.

00:18:10.695 --> 00:18:14.862
I'm starting off with some
kind of a mint cocktail.

00:18:20.636 --> 00:18:23.636
It almost has a banana flavor to it.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.970
All of the food has just arrived,

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.076
and again Ying and I share
everything we order all the time,

00:18:30.076 --> 00:18:33.174
so we got one plate of smoked salmon with,

00:18:33.174 --> 00:18:34.930
these are dill potatoes,

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.146
and then we also got a flat
bread with cheese on the top,

00:18:39.146 --> 00:18:41.599
and then salmon on top,
and then roe on top,

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:44.581
and then a handful of
herbs on top as well.

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.417
And then this one is toast skagen,

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:50.959
which is becoming one of
my favorite Swedish dishes.

00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:53.281
Shrimp salad over a piece of toast.

00:18:53.281 --> 00:18:55.466
This is an amazing dish
with dill on the top,

00:18:55.466 --> 00:18:58.571
and they included some roe as well.

00:18:58.571 --> 00:19:02.238
I think perhaps I will
just spread this out.

00:19:03.484 --> 00:19:05.385
Should I spread it out
over the toast, Ying?

00:19:05.385 --> 00:19:07.032
- [Ying] I guess so.

00:19:07.032 --> 00:19:09.492
- [Mark] I think I'm gonna
spread this out over the toast.

00:19:09.492 --> 00:19:12.409
Maybe put this on the top there

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:14.659
and just kind of spread it.

00:19:16.334 --> 00:19:20.501
Oh, that ratio of shrimp to
toast is a beautiful thing.

00:19:22.313 --> 00:19:23.813
Put these over it.

00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:27.131
And then I'll squeeze on
that lemon a little bit.

00:19:27.131 --> 00:19:29.467
I may as well start with the toast skagen.

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:32.276
And it's kind of like the same shrimp

00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:34.582
I think as what I ate for lunch.

00:19:34.582 --> 00:19:36.897
Oh, and they just all fell off.

00:19:36.897 --> 00:19:40.814
Okay, I will have to
re-put back on that toast.

00:19:45.111 --> 00:19:45.944
All right.

00:19:54.014 --> 00:19:57.889
That is indeed one of my favorite
Swedish dishes or snacks.

00:19:57.889 --> 00:19:59.369
It's so fantastic though,

00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:02.069
and mainly because the shrimp are fresh

00:20:02.069 --> 00:20:05.044
and they have this
amazing muscular texture,

00:20:05.044 --> 00:20:09.027
and then with that dill
and that creamy sauce,

00:20:09.027 --> 00:20:13.301
and then the toast is kinda
crunchy and a little bit gooey.

00:20:13.301 --> 00:20:16.008
Okay, next up, I think
this is supposed to be

00:20:16.008 --> 00:20:17.425
a hand-held dish.

00:20:18.925 --> 00:20:20.137
Oh yes.

00:20:20.137 --> 00:20:23.787
And salmon is another one of
my favorite things in Sweden.

00:20:23.787 --> 00:20:28.416
Okay, let me try to add
some of those herbs on top.

00:20:28.416 --> 00:20:29.700
Oh they're tangle-y.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.783
It's like a whole salad on top of it.

00:20:43.676 --> 00:20:46.259
Yeah, that's like cheese bread,

00:20:48.124 --> 00:20:50.816
with salty smoked salmon on top,

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:53.385
and then the salty eggs, salmon eggs,

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:56.948
that just erupt with salty juice,

00:20:56.948 --> 00:20:59.204
and then those herbs are
a nice touch as well,

00:20:59.204 --> 00:21:00.808
and that lettuce.

00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:02.644
Yeah, that's a fantastic thing.

00:21:02.644 --> 00:21:04.436
And the last dish, this is a main dish

00:21:04.436 --> 00:21:07.810
with the smoked salmon,
a nice pile of it again

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:08.913
topped with dill,

00:21:08.913 --> 00:21:11.163
and then the dill potatoes.

00:21:13.085 --> 00:21:17.252
The quality of the salmon
in Sweden is just fantastic.

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:24.064
It's so soft and so tender,

00:21:24.064 --> 00:21:26.945
and it just dissolves in your mouth.

00:21:26.945 --> 00:21:29.949
It doesn't, at least the bite I had,

00:21:29.949 --> 00:21:32.362
it doesn't have any of
that grizzly-ness to it.

00:21:32.362 --> 00:21:33.584
The only think I like to do

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:35.417
is to add some pepper.

00:21:36.697 --> 00:21:38.156
It's good to put some on the side

00:21:38.156 --> 00:21:40.518
and then you can dip it

00:21:40.518 --> 00:21:42.081
as it sticks to that salmon,

00:21:42.081 --> 00:21:45.557
and then also some on the potatoes.

00:21:45.557 --> 00:21:46.812
Oh, and while I'm at it,

00:21:46.812 --> 00:21:50.145
I'll add a little bit to the flat bread.

00:21:51.834 --> 00:21:52.893
This is another one of the greatest

00:21:52.893 --> 00:21:54.330
things about Sweden is the pepper.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.752
They have pepper on every table

00:21:55.752 --> 00:21:57.211
at every restaurant we've been to.

00:21:57.211 --> 00:22:01.378
Freshly ground black pepper
is one of the spices of life.

00:22:04.924 --> 00:22:06.666
Oh yeah, it's just fork-tender salmon.

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:09.104
You don't even actually need this knife.

00:22:09.104 --> 00:22:10.937
Then with that pepper.

00:22:14.277 --> 00:22:15.110
Oh yeah.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.158
With that pepper.

00:22:17.158 --> 00:22:19.325
Now for the dill potatoes.

00:22:22.201 --> 00:22:24.034
Mm, very creamy sauce.

00:22:25.017 --> 00:22:27.019
And just a faint taste of dill in there.

00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:29.276
That was a wonderful way to end this day.

00:22:29.276 --> 00:22:32.665
It's been a very relaxing
day in Stockholm.

00:22:32.665 --> 00:22:35.088
Had some delicious food today.

00:22:35.088 --> 00:22:36.750
Just walking around this city,

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:38.774
it gives you energy.

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:40.676
That was a great meal to end the day.

00:22:40.676 --> 00:22:43.418
