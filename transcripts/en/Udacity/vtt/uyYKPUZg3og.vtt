00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.260
Let's look at projective transformation.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.280
In a projective transformation, what we
are interested in is taking an image and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.290
warping it in this manner.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.940
So basically,
a projective transformation is

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.870
a combination of an affine
transformation we've looked at, but

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.680
added to that, a projective warp.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.900
Properties of that form
of transformation is.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.890
The origin does not again
necessarily map to the origin.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.970
You can see that this
could've transformed or

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.590
move translated over to this point.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.800
But the line are still straight lines,
right?

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.060
Lines map to straight lines here.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.060
But now parallel lines do not
necessarily remain parallel.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.310
An example of this you may actually see.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.590
That for example, if t and h,
if they were parallel here,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.240
they're no longer parallel if I was
to draw an h here and a t here.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.450
Let's just do that.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.016
And they would actually
intersect somewhere.

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:59.500
While t and h, unlikely to intersect.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.630
And of course ratios are not
preserved in this one either.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.019
Here, of course, we have.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.190
What do you think?

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.270
Nine parameters?

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.440
Nah.
Remember,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.810
I always said this
will convert back to 1.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.670
So in essence, we have 8 parameters.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.900
Which basically means we
have 8 degree of freedom.
