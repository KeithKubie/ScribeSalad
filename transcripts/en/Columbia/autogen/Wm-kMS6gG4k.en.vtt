the good news is America and probably

Western Europe will play almost no role
in the future of the city so the fact

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:32.650
in the future of the city so the fact
 

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.650
in the future of the city so the fact
that America is an appalling example in

that America is an appalling example in
this moment really doesn't matter

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:36.970
this moment really doesn't matter
 

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.059
this moment really doesn't matter
because America is not facing the

the invention of these new societies and

the invention of these new societies and
new cities so there will be a moment

00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359
new cities so there will be a moment
 

00:38:46.359 --> 00:38:49.050
new cities so there will be a moment
where America will learn lessons from

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:49.060
where America will learn lessons from
 

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.450
where America will learn lessons from

I think first of your diagnosis is
correct the patient is not in very good

correct the patient is not in very good
 

00:39:17.439 --> 00:39:19.319
correct the patient is not in very good
shape but actually that particular

we have to think that in these cities we

we have to think that in these cities we

are looking at transgenerational
