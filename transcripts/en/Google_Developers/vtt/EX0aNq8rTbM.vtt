MANO MARKS: Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.520
I'm Mano Marks.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.060
This is Susannah Raub
and Marcelo Camelo.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.120
We're on the Google
Maps API team.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.370
Marcelo and Susannah have kindly
agreed to join us from

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.115
the Sydney office.

00:00:30.115 --> 00:00:34.090
They're here for Google I/O and
they'll be talking to you

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.490
in just a moment about their
sessions at Google I/O.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.550
Susannah is the Tech Lead for
the Google Maps API, and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.510
Marcelo is the Tech Lead for
the Google Places API.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.200
So we're really excited
to have them here.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.580
I'm a developer advocate on the
Google Maps API developer

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.690
relations team.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.000
Hi, welcome guys.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.240
SUSANNAH RAUB: Thanks, Mano.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.220
MARCELO CAMELO: Thank
you, Mano.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.410
MANO MARKS: Thanks
for joining us.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.050
So the first thing I want to do
is ask each of you to give

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.300
us a little summary of what
you're going to be talking

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.360
about in your sessions.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.140
So let's start with
you, Susannah.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.900
SUSANNAH RAUB: Sure.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.370
My talk next week is called,
Maps API Best Practices, and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.610
along with my teammate, Jez, we
will be talking about, sort

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.520
of, common traps people fall
into in using the Maps API, as

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.760
well as some things you can do
to make your map a little bit

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.280
better and then some things to
make your map really awesome.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.280
So going through some old
features and new features that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.970
will really make a
good map great.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.550
MANO MARKS: Can you give any
hints on things that you're

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.600
going to be talking about
specifically?

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830
SUSANNAH RAUB: I think-- so
we'll be showing some demos

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.920
that use a combination of our
many services and features.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.650
And I think some of those show
some compelling uses of the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.530
Maps API that perhaps some
developers haven't thought of

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.080
to use before.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.392
MANO MARKS: OK, great.

00:01:59.392 --> 00:02:01.440
And Marcelo, do you want to--

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.720
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.070
So the name of our talk is,
Building a Business Around the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.400
Places API.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.330
So we'll be giving an overview
of what Places API is.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.070
We also want to go into some
basic principles that we think

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.580
developers should keep in mind
when building applications

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.050
using the Places API and also
when they're aiming to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.760
actually turn that
into a business.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.490
MANO MARKS: Great, great,
it sounds great.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.890
I'm also going to be giving a
talk on enterprise uses of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.360
Google Maps API, but you're here
to talk to Susannah and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.170
Marcelo today.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.800
So just a reminder, all
the content that is--

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.000
all the sessions that are at
Google I/O will be recorded,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.530
and so you'll get a chance, even
if you don't get to go to

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.440
Google I/O, you'll
get a chance to

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.640
see all that content.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.850
I wanted to ask each of you--

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.630
I ask everybody this, so please
forgive me-- but what

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.370
are your favorite
maps API sites?

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.380
Susannah, let's start
with you.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.600
And I'd asked them previously,
so we have this loaded up.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.580
SUSANNAH RAUB: My favorite
changes from time to time, but

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.180
right now, I thought
this one was pretty

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.890
cool that I just saw.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.550
So this is in time for the
London Olympics, it's a site

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.510
that the BBC has done called
London Calling.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.650
Some things that I--

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.430
MANO MARKS: Let me get
this on Screen Share

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.710
here for the Hangout.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.240
Sorry, I just realized that
I need to do that.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.170
Here we go.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.840
SUSANNAH RAUB: So some of things
I like about this site.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.960
First, fairly simple.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.390
I like that they
have customized

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.490
their use of the controls.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.050
So instead of having all of our
default controls showing

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.060
all the time, they just have the
zoom control and they've

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.590
set the min and max zoom so
that you just are seeing

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.680
London, and it does not
encourage you to go look at

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.770
the rest of the world.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.560
They also are using styled
maps, so that you get the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.330
features of London without
having the map actually be the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.220
main focus here.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.310
The map is sort of the backdrop
for the content that

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.120
they've put on top of it.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.870
So then when you click on these
circles, these areas of

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.800
London, you get some features
within them.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.170
Then if you can close this.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.240
It's sort of up at
the top there.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.810
OK.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.114
And if you click on a marker,
here's where it

00:04:19.114 --> 00:04:19.680
gets kind of cool.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.360
They have this info window that
comes up on top with a

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.210
cutout showing the marker
in the middle.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.051
And you can use the arrows
to click back and forth.

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:31.430
MANO MARKS: Oh, that's
very cool.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.530
SUSANNAH RAUB: It's
pretty cool.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.900
I think this really shows well
creative ways to display data

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.170
on top of the map.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.990
And I love the use of the styled
maps to convey this.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.650
MANO MARKS: Marcelo,
you had a couple?

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.720
MARCELO CAMELO: Oh, yeah.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.000
So one of them is Skyvi, I think
that's how you pronounce

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.320
it, which is an app that
does voice commands.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.790
And you can do, "pizza near me,"
or "closest Starbucks,"

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.720
and it works really well.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.470
Really well.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.660
And it uses the Places API for
all its local results.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.460
MANO MARKS: That's on
Android, right?

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.190
MARCELO CAMELO: That's
on Android.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.990
And then another one
is, WhatsApp.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.510
Which is a really popular
messaging app and it's closed

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.060
platform, and allows you to,
when you're sending a message,

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.290
you can tag the message with
the location and uses the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.630
Places API to allow you
to do a snap-to place.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.880
MANO MARKS: Cool.

00:05:37.732 --> 00:05:41.130
All right, let's turn
off screen share.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.340
Those are some great
applications.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.050
So anything you're excited
about, about Google I/O?

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.130
Anything you're particularly
looking forward to?

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.750
SUSANNAH RAUB: Oh, I always
enjoy just going to Google

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.880
I/O. I think my favorite thing
is actually getting a chance

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.770
to meet developers
face-to-face.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.310
Marcelo and I don't get
to do that very often.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.450
We just read comments
on the web.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.970
So I think that's my favorite
part, usually the fireside

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.700
chat, hearing people's
questions, and compliments,

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.260
and rants, all of them.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.520
MARCELO CAMELO: Yeah
it's definitely the

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.130
highlight of my year.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.770
I've been actually present to
all Google I/Os so far, never

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.130
missed one.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.530
I don't want to miss this one.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.740
I actually went through
the schedule and

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.480
I've signed up for--

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.710
I've chosen 16 sessions
to attend.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.260
So it's going to be pretty
intense, and really looking

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.420
forward to it.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.470
MANO MARKS: Cool.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.980
All right.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.650
Well, I think it might be time
to take some questions.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.460
So why don't we see
if there's any

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.300
questions from the Hangout.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.170
Anybody in the Hangout
have some questions?

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:06.390
If you have a question--

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.770
well, I can't actually see
anybody on the Hangout.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.410
Can you raise your hand if you
want to ask a question.

00:07:18.454 --> 00:07:19.370
I am not seeing anyone.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.820
OK, so it looks like
we don't have any

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.460
questions from the Hangout.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.970
So maybe if we can mute all
those folks, and then I'll

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.860
just take a look at the
moderator where we have a few

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.790
questions here that people
submitted beforehand.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.710
So the first question, "How can
I write tests against my

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.720
web application that uses
the Google Maps API?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.560
Do you have any mocks available
you could share

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.980
similar to your externs?"

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.270
SUSANNAH RAUB: So we don't
currently have any mocks.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:53.090
You can certainly use mocking
frameworks to--

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.330
and use the externs.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.520
First of all, I will definitely
encourage you write

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.690
tests, and I'm glad somebody
has asked this question.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.680
I think this is something we
want to encourage, and so it's

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.790
really nice to see developers
coming to us and asking first

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.160
before we even have to tell
you should be doing this.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.380
So you can use some--

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.510
you can mock classes using
the externs that

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.410
are available today.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:23.860
We don't have any separate
mocks available, but most

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.020
testing frameworks should have
a mocking system, and the

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.585
externs will work to do that.

00:08:33.585 --> 00:08:34.835
MANO MARKS: Cool.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.909
So the next question is, "Will
Google be releasing a native

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:45.100
iOS app now that MapKit in iOS
6 is changing to use Apple's

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.450
maps?"

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.070
We don't tend to talk about
things we're going to be doing

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.490
before we do them, so we can't
really comment on what our

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.310
future plans are.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.860
We're, of course, always
interested in mobile

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.460
platforms, particularly
Android and iOS.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.750
So we can't tell you what
our future plans

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.150
are, at this point.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.730
But thanks for asking that.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.220
So the next question is, "Any
idea when we'll start to see a

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.530
Google Maps API that lets us
build real HTML5 experiences?"

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.450
I think this is getting at
basically, when will we see

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.810
the Maps GL experiment that's
currently running on

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:36.260
maps.google.com available
in the API?

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.210
SUSANNAH RAUB: We can't comment
on exact plans here.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.140
It is something that we're
interested in.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.730
We still see issues around
browsers being able to support

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:52.980
WebGL to the extent that we need
them to in order to run

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.120
the API across the
web using WebGL.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:01.670
Certainly something to watch
for in the future.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.055
No concrete plans for
you to announce.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.000
MANO MARKS: And for those of you
who don't know more about

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.420
this experiment, basically,
maps.google.com is running an

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:20.110
experiment that uses vector
rendering in WebGL, instead of

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.940
map tiles, for all
the Maps data.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.830
And it's a really exciting and
slick experience if you have

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:30.170
Chrome, or Safari, or Firefox,
one of the browsers that

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:35.790
supports WebGL, and a pretty
nice graphics card.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:42.090
You may notice your fan spinning
up really fast.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:47.370
We've also been doing a number
of different tests and demo

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:54.080
apps using WebGL to display
on top of Google Maps.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.880
For instance, some stuff
that Chris and I--

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.640
Chris Broadfoot and I-- talked
about it at Strata.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:04.020
And also Brendan Kenny and I are
going to be doing a code

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.790
lab at Google I/O, talking about
using different aspects

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.720
of HTML5 with your mapping
experience.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:16.350
So have a lookout for
those resources.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:19.660
OK so then the next question
is, "Is there a way to use

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:24.590
WeatherLayer as a Google Maps
service to find nearest

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.100
marker's forecast?

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.400
Something like Get Panorama
By Location in Streetview

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.550
Service."

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:33.080
SUSANNAH RAUB: No, the
WeatherLayer is purely a layer

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.780
on top of the map.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.840
I think what you're asking
for is a weather service.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:41.480
Go ahead and file a feature
request for that.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.770
No promises, but we'd
love to see feature

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.830
requests for such things.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.100
MANO MARKS: And by the way,
we have an issue tracker.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.530
Just search for GMaps API
Issues, and that's where you

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.460
can file feature requests
and bugs, as well.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.620
And next question, "Can a marker
be more than just an

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.140
image without having to write
your own custom overlay?"

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.380
SUSANNAH RAUB: No a marker
is just an image.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.010
There are some libraries
that do this for you.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:19.480
So our developer relations team,
Luke and Chris, wrote a

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.150
few different marker
applications.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.230
One is an HTML marker, so this
does all the wrapping of the

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:29.460
custom overlay for you.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.030
And I believe it is
still dragable.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.350
So you can use that library.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.560
There' s also one-- they have
a label marker-- which puts

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.800
text with markers.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.620
But otherwise, if you want to
have custom DOM elements and a

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.090
custom look, you do need to
write a custom overlay.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.380
MANO MARKS: And those libraries
are in the Google

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.010
Maps API utility library,
which is linked off our

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.330
documentation, or you can
just search for it.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.340
Make sure you're looking
at the v3, not

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.980
the v2, utility library.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.130
Question about how to get in
touch with a Google Maps for

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.920
Business sales rep.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.940
If you're having trouble,
just ping me.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.550
Just share a post with your
contact info with me on

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.802
Google+, and I'll forward that
onto the sales folks.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.880
"What are some best practices
for implementing an existing

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.480
v3 map into a Drupal 7
environment?" I have no idea.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.980
I'm not a Drupal
person at all.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.020
So no clue.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.550
Any?

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:47.240
No Drupal folks on the--
sorry about that.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.450
I'm sure there are Drupal
communities who would be happy

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.940
to help out with this.

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.480
And the last question, I
can't really make out.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.790
It says, "What is the best way
to get volume on a website?"

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.750
And the user name is Evil_troll,
so I'm just going

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.052
to leave it at that.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.690
Wow.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:10.950
OK.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.920
It looks like the Hangout
has some weird screen

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.000
sharing going on.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.430
OK.

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:22.440
So any questions from
the Hangout?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.473
Anybody have a question, just
raise your hand, and we'll see

00:14:27.473 --> 00:14:28.723
if we can answer it.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.650
OK.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:33.740
No questions.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.390
So I think we'll go ahead
and wrap it up then.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.620
Thank you guys for coming in,
and thanks for joining us for

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.080
the office hours everyone.
