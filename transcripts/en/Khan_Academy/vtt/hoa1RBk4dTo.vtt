00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.140
So I have a three-dimensional
solid right over here.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.920
And I want to imagine
what type of a shape

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.180
I would get if I were
to make a vertical cut.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.800
And just to refresh
ourselves, or give us

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.980
a sense of what a
vertical cut is,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.020
imagine if this was made
out of jello or something

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.260
kind of fairly soft.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.540
But it's still a
three-dimensional solid.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.160
And I were to make
a cut-- let's say

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.100
I were to make a
cut right over here.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.550
So let's say I had
this big, sharp metal

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.310
thing-- let me
draw it like that.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.030
So you have this big,
sharp metal thing.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.150
Let me draw it a
little bit neater.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.260
So you have this big,
sharp metal thing

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.060
that I'm going to
cut right over here.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.227
So this is the thing that
I'm going to make the cut.

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:45.643
And I'm going to
go straight down.

00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:47.810
This is a vertical cut
that we're talking about.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.140
So this is the thing that
I'm going to cut with.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.870
Let me make it big
enough so that it

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.300
can capture the shape
that will result.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.719
So this thing right over
here, it's right in front.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.010
And I'm going to cut-- I'm
going to make it go straight

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.300
down and cut through
this jello, or whatever

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.550
you want to call it, this
rectangular pyramid of jello.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.370
And what would be the resulting
shape of the intersection

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.450
between the jello and this
thing that I'm using to cut it?

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.640
And now I encourage
you to pause your video

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.820
and think about what the
resulting shape would be.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.528
And the shape would
be in two dimensions.

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:27.930
Because this purple surface
is a two-dimensional--

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.830
you could view it
as part of a plane.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.570
And so where this
intersects when you cut down

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.880
this rectangular pyramid is
the shape we're looking for.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.290
So I encourage you to pause
the video and think about it

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.590
or try to come up
with it on your own.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.780
So let's think about it.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.190
And let me draw the
rectangular pyramid again.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.602
So that's the same one.

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:52.560
And now let me see what
it would look like once

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.220
I've done my cut, once I've
brought this thing down.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.930
So then this is where I cut.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.590
So I cut it right over here.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.970
And then it'll exit the bottom.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.690
It'll cut along
this side like that,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.860
cut along that side like that.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.870
And then it'll exit the
bottom right over there.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.070
And so let me draw
my whole thing.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.150
And so once I slice it down,
it will look like this.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.470
My best shot at drawing
it-- it will look like this.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.640
This is a vertical cut.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.150
So I've brought this thing down.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.850
And now the intersection between
the thing that I'm cutting with

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.650
and this pyramid is going to
be this shape right over here.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.417
It cut into the top
right over there.

00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:51.750
It would get all the way to
the bottom right over there.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.100
And along this side, it
would cut right there.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.730
And along that side, it
would cut right over there.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.260
So what's the resulting
shape in two dimensions

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.970
of essentially the
intersection between the slicer

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.840
and the jello?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.420
Well, it would be this thing.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.720
It would look like a trapezoid.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.970
Let me do that in a new color.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.100
I'm overusing that one color.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.460
It would look like a trapezoid.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.110
So this would be
the resulting shape.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.050
So the resulting shape
would look like this.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.350
Just like that, if you made
the cut right over there.
