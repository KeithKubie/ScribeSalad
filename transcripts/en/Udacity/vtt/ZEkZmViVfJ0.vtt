00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.250
Okay, the answer to this question which can

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.792
really be tricky is two possible combinations of the

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:08.380
alleles, let's take a look at why that is.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.560
Remember just like before we were going to have our

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.900
first division and were going to separate our pairs of

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.780
chromosome two, so great we separated it them. Well

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.010
the alleles are already all connected here on the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.360
single chromosome split, so, it doesn't matter what happens

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.590
with our chromosome fours in this case. We

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.910
could go to either side, it doesn't matter. They're

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.980
not going to change our allele combination, so let's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.330
just even remove them altogether. Now, let's actually take

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.980
a look. Okay, let's split these, and split

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.635
these. We've got plus-minus combination, plus-minus combination for lactase

00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:46.963
persistence in dwarfism, and then minus-plus of recessive

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.870
dominant combinations over here for lactase persistence in dwarfism.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.090
So, that's two combinations. Okay. Let's go back

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.540
and see if we split them to the other

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.670
side. They went to different sides during the cell

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.060
division. Well, and then we split them again and

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.470
you'll notice that it doesn't matter. These alleles

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.840
are traveling together. In fact, it appears that these

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.610
alleles are physically linked together on the same chromosome.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
This is a real problem for increasing genetic diversity.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.700
Looking at the possible combinations of alleles

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.330
for just two different genes. We've now

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.070
cut the number of combinations we could

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.570
get in half. Because everybody's linked together on

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.970
the same chromosome. The cell actually has a solution to this problem to help

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.140
us maximize allelic variation and combinations. Even

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.940
when genes are linked on the same chromosome.
