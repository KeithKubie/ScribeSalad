00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
So if you're a facilitator or a teacher, what is it you're doing?

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.650
You should understand this is an adapted version of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.100
that is actually for post-Startup Weekend events.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.940
That is, it comes after students actually sit through a Startup Weekend

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.400
and kind of raise their hands and say, "Hey, we'd actually like to learn more."

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.330
"We'd actually like to take this team we've built

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.130
"and actually figure out whether we could put together a startup."

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.820
This is not a full semester class and not the full version of the Lean LaunchPad,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.880
but these teams will learn a tremendous amount

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.890
in the weeks that they will be spending with you.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.520
This helps fill a gap between the Startup Weekend and the next step

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.270
that most entrepreneurs think they should take, which is commonly seen as an accelerator.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.710
So the goal of the class is twofold.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.510
Number 1 is we're going to teach customer development.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.740
We're going to give the attendees an immersive and experiential course

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.570
and a methodology that they will remember for the rest of their lives.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.180
It's a big idea.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.280
We're going to teach them customer development and give them a methodology

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.050
for the rest of their lives.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.990
2 is we're going to teach them team development skills.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.640
Remember kind of graduating from the Startup Weekend to the startup next phase,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.330
this is still a dating phase.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.140
We're going to give them an incredible experience for their team,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.230
but we're also going to stress test them.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.640
This is not just sitting in a class and doing presentations.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.190
Our opinion is if we could blow them up now, if the teams will fail under pressure,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.080
it's better to have them fail now, and it's even better that they learn it's not an optimal team

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.070
and what the dysfunctions were now before they take any money

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.260
versus when they've spent a million dollars and they're 2 years into it.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.300
So those are the 2 goals:

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.820
Teach customer development with an immersive and experiential course

00:01:53.820 --> 99:59:59.000
and enhance and expand on team development skills.
