00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.710
When the United States hosted the Olympics
for the first time in 1904, the games had

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.220
yet to reach the high level of competition
and popularity we know today.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.750
Although athletes from countries around the
world were invited to participate, the games

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.230
were less about the world’s best athletes
competing for medals and more about (actual)

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.770
amateur athletes competing against each other.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.980
The ultimate decision to host the 1904 Olympic
Games in St. Louis, Missouri, created a huge

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.820
obstacle for international athletes in that
travel to the innermost parts of the States

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.420
was difficult and costly.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.320
The only way to travel between continents
was by a long and expensive ocean voyage,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.129
after which the athletes needed to take about
a 1,000-mile train trip.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.360
As a result, many countries decided not to
participate.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.740
Out of the 630 athletes from 12 nations that
competed that year, 523 were American, which

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.550
explains why the United States won so many
medals that year (239, with the closest runner

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.360
up being Germany who won 13).

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.920
Perhaps one of the most surprising athletes
to compete for his country was Félix de la

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.880
Caridad Carvajal y Soto, known as Andarín
Carvajal or Felix Carvajal, from Cuba.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.870
With no formal training and a running technique
that left much to be desired, this mailman

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.549
raised his own money to travel to St. Louis
to represent his country in the Olympic marathon

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.549
race.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.070
Despite his work as a mailman, Felix lived
his life in poverty and was denied financial

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.340
assistance from his local government to cover
expenses he would incur on his journey to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.340
the Olympics.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.850
He spent days running around town square and
begging people for money to help him on his

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.850
pursuit.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.659
His efforts paid off, and he raised enough
money for a trip to New Orleans, then promptly

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.710
lost his remaining funds on a game of dice…

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.749
Not to be deterred, he hitchhiked the remaining
650 or so miles to his destination.

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.119
Due to his jovial nature, he befriended the
men on the American weightlifters team who

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.399
gave him room and board as he prepared for
the marathon.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.920
The 1904 marathon for the Olympics started
around 3:00 pm in the afternoon in August,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.320
with temperatures above 90 degrees.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.230
Anyone who knows about summer weather in St.
Louis knows that the oppressive heat and humidity

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.920
are not friends to anyone, certainly not to
the 32 men representing four different countries

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.090
running a 24.85 mile marathon.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.930
To make the situation worse, the only access
runners had to water on the course was at

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.470
miles six and twelve.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.700
For some, especially those who didn’t have
a support vehicle or support staff to aid

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.519
them, that made for a very long and torturous
race.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.280
Felix_CarvajalCarvajal showed up to the starting
line wearing a long-sleeved shirt, pants,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.340
and boots.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.340
Considering other runners were in shorts and
tank tops, we can only assume these were the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.340
only clothes he had with him.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.330
(Legendary athlete Jim Thorpe once did something
similar at the Olympics, wearing different

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.950
sized shoes, neither of which fit him, that
he’d scrounged out of a garbage bin shortly

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.290
before a race.)

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.140
As for Carvajal, seconds before the start
of the race, an American discus thrower found

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.840
a pair of scissors and made a mock pair of
shorts out of Carvajal’s pants for more

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.900
athletic attire.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.549
The start of the race required runners to
complete five laps around the stadium before

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.520
heading off into St. Louis County.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.690
The course was not shy on delivering obstacles
for the athletes.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.560
Through the streets of St. Louis, in order
to stay on the course, runners had to dodge

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.790
cars, delivery wagons, railroad trains, trolley
cars, and people walking their dogs.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.560
In places, the roads were covered with cracked
stone that the runners had to pick their way

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.560
through.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.299
If all that wasn’t enough, there was the
seven 100-300 foot hills, noxious exhaust

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.370
fumes from the early automobiles (including
support vehicles and others following the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.780
runners along as they went), and the extreme
amounts of dust kicked into the air by these

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.920
vehicles and horses.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.480
marathon-mapoCar fumes and dust, coupled with
the heat and humidity, soon took its toll

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.519
on the runners.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.780
One of the first ones to drop out of the race
was John Lordon of Massachusetts.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.489
In 1903 Lordon won the Boston Marathon, but
he only made it ten miles in this Olympic

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.920
marathon before he started vomiting and pulled
out of the race.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.709
The winner of the 1904 Boston Marathon, Michael
Spring of New York, started out the Olympic

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.920
marathon strong, leading the pack, but when
ascending of one of the steep hills, he collapsed

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.109
from exhaustion and couldn’t continue.

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.319
William Garcia from San Francisco almost became
the first death in the Olympic Games when

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.950
he was found lying unconscious in a ditch
on the course and was raced to the hospital.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.100
Fortunately, despite the extreme amount of
dust he had inhaled doing a major number on

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.100
his esophagus and lungs, he eventually recovered
and was able to race again.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.170
len-taunyane-jan-mashianiAnother notable feature
of this particular marathon was that it saw

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.180
the first two black Africans competing in
the Olympics.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.760
However, neither Len Taunyane nor Jan Mashiani
were seasoned marathon runners, but both had

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.580
served as dispatch runners in the South African
Boer War.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.410
They were in town as part of the Boer War
exhibit at the World’s Fair and decided

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.010
to enter the race on a whim.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.160
Both finished, placing ninth and twelfth respectively.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.540
It was reported that Tau probably would’ve
placed higher if he hadn’t been chased over

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.970
a mile off the course by a wild dog.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.950
American Frederick Lorz was a contender for
one of the top spots early on in the race,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.160
but he suffered from severe cramps and at
nine miles was unable to continue.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.760
He decided to hitch a ride in one of the cars
back to the stadium, but the car broke down

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.910
before arriving at its destination.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.160
Feeling refreshed, Lorz started running again.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.730
When he entered the stadium three hours after
the start of the race, the crowd erupted in

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.530
applause for the “winner.”

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.890
Unable to resist the crowd, Lorz went along
with the facade, racing toward the finish

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.070
line and basking in the limelight.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.940
Perhaps he really was trying to take the credit
for the win, or perhaps he was in it for the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.500
fun and games like he later claimed.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.640
Either way, when it was quickly noted by certain
spectators that Lorz had been seen riding

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.350
in a car during the race, the officials saw
no humor in his prank and banned Lorz for

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.710
life from participating in amateur races.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.220
However, less than a year later, the ban was
lifted after Lorz apologized for his stunt;

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.650
he went on to take first in the 1905 Boston
marathon.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.410
When another leading runner, Thomas Hicks
from the United States learned of Lorz’s

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.410
supposed win, he begged his two assistants
to let him drop out because he was in so much

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:55.410
pain.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.760
They refused to let him quit.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.650
Like many other runners, Hicks’s health
took a plunge early in the race and continuously

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.190
declined as he ran.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.400
For some bizarre reason, his handlers refused
to give him water to drink during the race,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.490
and instead sponged out his mouth using warm
distilled water and then proceeded to feed

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.550
him egg whites and strychnine.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.550
(Yes, strychnine.)

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.810
At the time, strychnine was used in small
doses as a performance enhancing drug.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.250
Anything but small doses would, of course,
kill the athlete via asphyxiation due to paralysis

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.960
of the respiratory muscles.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.930
However, in small doses, strychnine was believed
to provide a performance boost via the muscle

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.930
spasms it relatively quickly induces.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.650
Unfortunately for Hicks, besides refusing
him water to drink, his handlers didn’t

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.050
stop with one dose of the poison.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.730
In total, during the race he was given approximately
2-3 mg of strychnine, plus accompanied raw

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.200
eggs and brandy each dose.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.000
Unsurprisingly, with the extreme heat, humidity,
dust clouds, dehydration, and being fed rat

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.200
poison, Hicks’ condition continually grew
worse and he ultimately became delusional.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.480
Nevertheless, he continued to put one foot
in front of the other and soldiered on.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.170
Thomas-hicks-1904Entering the stadium for
the last stretch of the race, Hicks required

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.950
physical assistance from his handlers who
had to practically carry him over the finish

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.950
line.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.230
Of course, this would result in a disqualification
in today’s Olympics, but in 1904 the act

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.750
was completely legal.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.210
Hicks was unable to initially receive his
gold medal given that he fell unconscious

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.620
at the finish line and it took doctors about
an hour to revive him.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.950
Close to death, fortunately, he eventually
recovered, though retired from competing in

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:23.950
marathons.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:29.270
With a time of 3:28:53, Hicks’s feat is
the slowest time for a men’s Olympic marathon

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.630
in history.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.470
The United States claimed the silver and bronze
medals in the marathon as well when Albert

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:38.590
Corey crossed the finish line six minutes
after Hicks, soon followed by Arthur Newton

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.550
with a time of 3:47:33.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.410
Although both runners struggled with the heat
and dust and slowed to a walk during certain

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.700
parts of the race, neither seemed to have
it worse than Hicks.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.050
Meanwhile, Felix Carvajal ran at a comfortable
pace.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.070
Unable to resist charming the spectators who
lined up along the way, Felix often stopped

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.640
to chat with them in his broken English and
crack jokes.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.830
With his upbeat and good spirited attitude,
he won the hearts of many along the course.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.850
When he begged for peaches from the occupants
of an accompanying car and was refused, he

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.860
teasingly snatched a couple from them anyway
and kept on running, eating the peaches as

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:13.860
he ran.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.510
Most accounts of the marathon say Carvajal
needed a bit more sustenance, so he snuck

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.470
into an apple orchard and plucked two of the
juicy fruits from the boughs.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:25.030
Supposedly the apples didn’t sit well with
him and he suffered from cramps, which forced

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.520
him to rest and purportedly take a cat-nap
before continuing the race.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.333
However, it should be noted that there is
no contemporary evidence that the apple/nap

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:34.800
part of this story ever took place, with the
first account of it popping up in William

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.200
Henry’s 1948, An Approved History of the
Olympics.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.690
Regardless, the contemporary accounts of Carvajal’s
approach to the race seem to describe an individual

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.450
having a blast, while many other racers struggled
to overcome bodily limitations.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.839
Felix Carvajal crossed the line in fourth
place, though what his time was is unknown

00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:51.839
today.

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:55.360
Compared to the other racers, he was described
as seeming to float across the finish line.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.741
Aside from probably being a bit tired and
hungry, the heat and humidity didn’t seem

00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.550
to have too much of an effect on the Cuban.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.360
While it’s not known how far behind third
place he was, accounts of the day indicate

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.300
if it wasn’t for his numerous stops to chat
with people during the race, Carvajal may

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.540
well have won.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.670
Whatever the case, the 1904 Olympics ended
up being the only international competitive

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.589
race Carvajal would compete in.

00:09:14.589 --> 00:09:18.579
In the end, only 14 of the original 32 racers
managed to finish the race.

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:22.661
hicks-goldAs for the victor, although the
“assistance” Hicks received mostly proved

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:26.709
to be detrimental, he was able to finish the
race thanks to being carried along near the

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:30.850
end- a fact that resulted in some feeling
like he should have been disqualified.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:35.170
After the race, a complaint towards this end
was filed by Everett Brown, the chairman for

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.300
the Chicago Athletic Association.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.589
However, the Olympic Games director refused
to consider the matter and Hicks remained

00:09:40.589 --> 00:09:41.720
the winner.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:47.459
In the 1500s most Roman Catholic countries
&amp; Scotland adopted the Gregorian Calendar

00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:52.519
(established by Pope Gregory XIII to compensate
for the errors in time that had built up over

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:58.970
centuries) over the Julian Calendar (introduced
by Julius Caesar in 45 BC).

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.519
A lot of protestant countries, however, ignored
this new calendar for another 200 or so years.

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:08.730
England stuck to the Julian Calendar until
1751 before finally making the switch.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.709
