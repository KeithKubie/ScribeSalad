Let's do some more practice.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.410
Let's say you need to buy two and
a half gallons of milk.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.210
And let's say that the store
only sells gallons and quarts.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.675
How many gallons and
how many quarts should you buy?

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.535
And you want to make sure the buy
exactly two and a half gallons

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:21.485
with no extra milk, and that you don't
buy any more containers than necessary.

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.665
How many containers of
each size should you buy?
