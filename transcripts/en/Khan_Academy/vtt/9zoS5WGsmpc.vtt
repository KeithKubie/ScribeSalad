00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.211
- [Voiceover] So what I
wanna do in this video

00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:06.131
is give ourselves an overview
of cellular respiration.

00:00:06.131 --> 00:00:08.991
It can be a pretty involved
process, and even the way

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.591
I'm gonna do it, as messy as it looks,

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.511
is going to be cleaner
than actually what goes

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:15.111
on inside of your cells,
and other organs themselves,

00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.892
because I'm going to show clearly from

00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:18.782
going from glucose,
and then see how we can

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:22.521
produce ATP through glycolysis,
and the Krebs cycle,

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.261
and oxidative phosphorylation,

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:26.642
but in reality, all sorts
of molecules can jump in

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:28.463
at different parts of the
chain, and then jump out

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:31.323
at different parts of the chain,
to go along other pathways.

00:00:31.323 --> 00:00:35.097
But I'll show, kind of
the traditional narrative.

00:00:35.097 --> 00:00:37.957
So we're gonna start
off, for this narrative,

00:00:37.957 --> 00:00:39.356
we're gonna start off with glucose.

00:00:39.356 --> 00:00:42.336
We have a six-carbon-chain
right over here.

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:45.816
And we have the process of
glycosis, which is occurring

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.736
in the cytosol, the cytosol of our cells.

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.336
So if this is a cell right over here,

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:53.737
you can imagine, well the glycolysis,

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:58.119
the glycolysis could be
occurring right over there.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.972
And that process of glycolysis
is essentially splitting up

00:01:01.972 --> 00:01:04.175
this six-carbon glucose molecule

00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.655
into two three-carbon molecules,

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:07.995
and these three-carbon molecules,

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:11.365
we go into detail in another
video, we call these pyruvate.

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.119
Pyruvate.

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.549
And in the process of
doing so, and this is,

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.289
I guess you could say,
the point of glycolysis,

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:21.026
we're able to, on a net
basis, produce two ATP's.

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:23.366
We actually produce four,
but we have to use two,

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.866
so on a net basis, we produce two ATP's.

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:27.806
I'm gonna keep a little
table here, to keep track.

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:32.283
So we produce two ATP's, and we are also,

00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:34.922
we're also, in the process of that,

00:01:34.922 --> 00:01:39.308
we reduce two NAD molecules to NADH.

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:41.748
Remember, reduction is
gaining of electrons.

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:43.988
And you see over here,
this is positively charged,

00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:46.728
this is neutrally charged, it
essentially gains a hydride.

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.410
So this is reduction.

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:49.476
Reduction.

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.203
And if we go all the
way through the pathway,

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.083
all the way to oxidative phosphorylation,

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:58.343
the electronic transport chain,
these NADH's, the reduced

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:02.619
form of NAD, they can be, then, oxidized,

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.699
and in doing so, more energy
is provided to produce

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.999
even more ATP's, but we'll get to that.

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.549
So you're also gonna get two NADH's.

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:13.756
Two NADH's get produced.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:16.166
Now at that point, you
could kind of think of it

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.846
as a little bit of a decision point.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.966
If there's no oxygen around, or if

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.806
you're the type of organism that doesn't

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:23.326
want to continue, for some reason,

00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:25.226
with cellular respiration,
or doesn't know how,

00:02:25.226 --> 00:02:27.826
this pyruvate can be
used for fermentation.

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:30.006
We have videos on fermentation,

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.935
lactic acid fermentation,
alcohol fermentation,

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:35.695
and fermentation is all
about using the pyruvates

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:40.196
to oxidize your NADH back into NAD,

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:42.682
so it could be re-used
again, for glycolysis.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:45.400
So even though the NADH has energy

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.480
that could eventually
be converted into ATP,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.984
and even though pyruvates have energy

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:51.806
that could eventually
be converted into ATP,

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:54.286
when you do fermentation,
you kinda give up on that,

00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:55.826
and you just view them as waste products,

00:02:55.826 --> 00:02:59.986
and you use the pyruvate to
convert the NADH back into NAD,

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:03.196
And then, glycolysis can occur again.

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:05.436
But let's assume we're not gonna go down

00:03:05.436 --> 00:03:07.816
the fermentation pathway, and we're

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:09.176
gonna continue with traditional

00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:12.217
aerobic cellular
respiration, using oxygen.

00:03:12.787 --> 00:03:14.247
Well, the next thing
that's going to happen,

00:03:14.247 --> 00:03:16.467
is that the carboxyl group, and

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:17.458
and everything I'm going to show now,

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:19.047
it's going to happen for
each of these pyruvates.

00:03:19.047 --> 00:03:21.147
So, you can imagine these
things all happening twice.

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:24.080
So I'm gonna multiply a
bunch of things, times two.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.548
But what happens in the next step,

00:03:25.548 --> 00:03:29.548
is this carboxyl group, this
carboxyl group is stripped

00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:33.168
off of the pyruvate, and it, essentially,

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.351
is going to be released as carbon dioxide.

00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.135
So this is our carbon
dioxide being released here,

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:40.735
and then the rest of our
pyruvate, which is, essentially,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:45.260
an acetyl group, that
latches onto coenzyme A.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.150
And you'll hear a lot about coenzyme A.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.810
Sometimes I'll write just CoA, like this.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.470
Sometimes I'll do CoA, and then

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.825
the sulfur, bonded to the hyrdrogen.

00:03:53.825 --> 00:03:55.485
And the reason why they'll
draw the sulfur part,

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.885
is because the sulfur is what bonds

00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:00.695
with the acetyl group, right over here.

00:04:01.702 --> 00:04:04.600
So, you have the carbon
dioxide being released, and

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.020
then the acetyl group,
bonding with that sulfur,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.078
and by doing that, you form acetyl-CoA.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.825
And acetyl-CoA, just so
you know, you only see

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:15.801
three letters here, but this is

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:17.431
actually a fairly involved molecule.

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:19.361
This is actually a picture of acetyl-CoA,

00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:20.961
I know it's really small, but hopefully

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.201
you'll appreciate that it's
a more involved molecule.

00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:25.241
That, the acetyl group
that we're talking about

00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:29.292
is just this part, right over
here, and it's a coenzyme.

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.292
It's really acting to
transfer that acetyl group,

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:33.692
and we'll see that in a second.

00:04:33.692 --> 00:04:35.552
But it's also fun to
look at these molecules,

00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:37.112
because once again, we see these patterns

00:04:37.112 --> 00:04:40.252
over and over again in
biology or biochemistry.

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:43.032
Acetyl-CoA, you have an
adenine right over here.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:45.329
It's hard to see, but you have a ribose,

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:47.909
and you also have two phosphate groups.

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.841
So this end of the
acetyl-CoA is essentially,

00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:53.471
is essentially an ADP.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:54.797
But it's used as a coenzyme.

00:04:54.797 --> 00:04:56.157
Everything that I'm talking about,

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.657
this is all going to be facilitated

00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.837
by enzymes, and the enzymes will have

00:05:00.227 --> 00:05:03.830
cofactors, coenzymes, if
we're talking about organic

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.375
cofactors, that are gonna
help facilitate things along.

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.675
And as we see, the acetyl group joins on

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.722
to the coenzyme A, forming acetyl-CoA,

00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:13.852
but that's just a temporary attachment.

00:05:13.852 --> 00:05:16.432
The acetyl-CoA is,
essentially, gonna transfer

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.252
the acetyl group over to,
and now we're going to

00:05:19.252 --> 00:05:22.633
enter into the citric acid cycle.

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:24.492
It's gonna transfer these two carbons

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:28.552
over to oxaloacetic acid,
to form citric acid.

00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:30.472
So it's gonna transfer these two carbons

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:33.832
to this one, two, three,
four carbon molecule,

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:38.382
to form a one, two, three,
four, five, six carbon molecule.

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:39.947
But before we go into the depths

00:05:39.947 --> 00:05:41.907
of the citric acid cycle,
I wanna make sure that

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:43.827
I don't lose track of my accounting,

00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:46.968
because, even that step right over here,

00:05:46.968 --> 00:05:49.588
where we decarboxylated the pyruvate,

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:53.088
we went from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA,

00:05:53.088 --> 00:05:56.370
that also reduced some NAD to NADH.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.910
Now, this is gonna happen
once for each pyruvate,

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.701
but we're gonna-

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:00.605
all the accounting we're gonna

00:06:00.605 --> 00:06:02.483
say, is for one glucose molecule.

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:03.883
So for one glucose molecule, it's

00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:05.623
gonna happen for each of the pyruvates.

00:06:05.623 --> 00:06:07.223
So this is going to be times-

00:06:07.223 --> 00:06:09.682
This is going to be times two.

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:10.844
So we're gonna produce two,

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:15.215
two NADH's in this step, going

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.425
from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:20.055
Now, the bulk of, I guess you could say,

00:06:20.055 --> 00:06:23.397
the catabolism, of the
carbons, or the things that

00:06:23.397 --> 00:06:26.355
are eventually going to produce our ATP's,

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:27.815
are going to happen in what we call

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:29.862
the citric acid, or the Kreb cycle.

00:06:29.862 --> 00:06:32.122
It's called the citric
acid cycle because, when we

00:06:32.122 --> 00:06:35.200
transferred the acetyl
group from the coenzyme A

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.621
to the oxaloacetic acid,
we formed citric acid.

00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:40.281
And citric acid, this is the thing

00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.921
that you have in lemons, or orange juice.

00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:45.581
It is this molecule right over here.

00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:49.181
And the citric acid cycle, it's
also called the Kreb cycle,

00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:51.722
when you first learn it,
seems very, very complex,

00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:54.262
and some could argue
that it is quite complex.

00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:57.782
But I'm just gonna give you an
overview of what's going on.

00:06:57.782 --> 00:07:00.382
The citric acid, once again, six-carboned,

00:07:00.382 --> 00:07:03.322
it keeps getting broken
down, through multiple steps,

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.302
and I'm really not showing
all of the detail here,

00:07:06.302 --> 00:07:08.742
all the way back to oxaloacetic acid,

00:07:08.742 --> 00:07:12.042
where, then, it can accept
the two carbons again.

00:07:12.042 --> 00:07:14.121
And just to be clear, once the two carbons

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:16.516
are released by the coenzyme A,

00:07:16.516 --> 00:07:18.835
then that coenzyme A can be used

00:07:18.835 --> 00:07:21.816
again, to decarboxylate some pyruvates.

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:23.555
So there's a bunch of cycles going on.

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:26.119
But the important take-away,
is as we go through the citric

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:29.029
acid cycle, as we go from
one intermediary to the next,

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:33.083
we keep reducing NAD to NADH,

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:37.538
in fact, we do this three
times for each cycle

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:39.318
of the citric acid cycle, but remember,

00:07:39.318 --> 00:07:42.438
we're gonna do this for each acetyl-CoA.

00:07:42.438 --> 00:07:43.798
For each pyruvate.

00:07:43.798 --> 00:07:46.158
So all of this stuff is
going to happen twice.

00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:47.917
So we're going to go through it twice

00:07:47.917 --> 00:07:50.126
for each original glucose molecule.

00:07:50.312 --> 00:07:55.032
So, here we have one, two,
three NADH's being produced,

00:07:55.032 --> 00:07:57.250
but since we're going
to go through it twice,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.231
and we're gonna be accounting for

00:07:58.231 --> 00:07:59.911
the original glucose
molecule, we could say

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.494
that we have six

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:06.065
six NADH's,

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:10.584
or you could say, six
NAD's get reduced to NADH.

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:12.434
Now, you also, in the process,

00:08:12.434 --> 00:08:14.901
as you're breaking down, going from

00:08:14.901 --> 00:08:17.221
the six-carbon molecule
to four-carbon molecule,

00:08:17.221 --> 00:08:20.420
you're releasing carbon,
as carbon dioxide,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.100
and you also have, traditionally
GDP being converted

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.599
into GTP, or sometimes
ADP converted into ATP,

00:08:28.599 --> 00:08:32.166
but functionally, it's
equivalent to ATP, either way.

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:34.466
So, we could also say
that we're gonna directly-

00:08:34.466 --> 00:08:36.329
Remember, we're gonna do
all of this stuff twice.

00:08:36.329 --> 00:08:40.133
So, we could say that two,

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:41.733
I'll just say two ATP's,
to make it simple.

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:44.833
We could say GTP, but I'll say two ATP's.

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.672
Because once again, this
happens once in each cycle,

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:50.410
but we're gonna do two
cycles, for each glucose.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.849
And then, we have this other
coenzyme right over here,

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:56.715
FAD, that gets reduced to FADH2,

00:08:56.715 --> 00:08:59.147
but that stays covalently
attached to the enzymes

00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:01.779
that are facilitating it, so eventually,

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:05.099
that's being used to reduce .

00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:08.802
coenzyme Q to QH2.

00:09:08.802 --> 00:09:10.682
So I'm just gonna write the QH2 here, but

00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:12.482
once again, you're gonna get two of these.

00:09:16.332 --> 00:09:21.102
So two QH2's.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:22.854
Now let's think about what the

00:09:22.854 --> 00:09:25.314
net product, over here, is going to be.

00:09:25.314 --> 00:09:28.254
And to think about it, we
should just, we'll just-

00:09:28.254 --> 00:09:30.914
I'll do a little bit of a shorthand.

00:09:30.914 --> 00:09:32.734
We'll go into more
detail in future videos.

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:36.539
These coenzymes, the NADH,

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:40.619
the QH2, these are going to be oxidized,

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.979
during oxidative phosphorylation,

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:44.999
and the electron transport chain,

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.319
to create a proton gradient across

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:50.638
the inner membrane of mitochondria.

00:09:50.638 --> 00:09:52.098
We're gonna go into much
more detail in the future,

00:09:52.098 --> 00:09:53.516
but that proton gradient is going

00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:56.434
to be used to produce more ATP.

00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:58.901
And one way to think about it, is

00:09:58.901 --> 00:10:03.221
each NADH is going to produce,

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.421
and I've seen accounts, it
depends on the efficiency,

00:10:06.421 --> 00:10:08.623
and where the NADH is actually going

00:10:08.623 --> 00:10:11.081
to be produced, but it's going to produce

00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:15.641
anywhere between two and three ATP's.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:21.414
Each of the reduced coenzyme Q's,

00:10:21.414 --> 00:10:23.874
so QH2,

00:10:23.874 --> 00:10:27.311
that's going to each produce
about one and a half ATP's.

00:10:27.311 --> 00:10:28.830
And people are still getting a good handle

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.230
on exactly how this is happening.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.610
It depends on the efficiency of the cell,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.914
and what the cell is
actually trying to do.

00:10:34.637 --> 00:10:37.277
So, using these ranges, actually I'll say

00:10:37.277 --> 00:10:41.267
one and a half to two ATP's.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:43.743
And these are approximate numbers.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:46.366
So let's think about what
our total accounting is.

00:10:46.366 --> 00:10:49.226
So if we just count up
the ATP or the GTP's,

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:52.906
we're gonna get two there, two there.

00:10:52.906 --> 00:10:55.067
So we're gonna have four direct,

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:58.997
or very close to direct,
ATP's net, being created.

00:10:59.147 --> 00:11:00.827
And then how many NADH's?

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:04.117
We have two, four, and then we add six.

00:11:04.117 --> 00:11:05.433
We have ten NADH's.

00:11:05.923 --> 00:11:09.159
Ten NADH's.

00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:13.677
And then, we have two of the coenzyme Q's.

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.323
Two QH2's.

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:18.453
So that's gonna be four ATP's,

00:11:18.453 --> 00:11:20.037
this is going to be between-

00:11:20.037 --> 00:11:24.257
this is going to be
between 20 and 30 NADH's.

00:11:24.257 --> 00:11:25.937
Sorry, 20 and 30 ATP's.

00:11:25.937 --> 00:11:28.687
20 to 30 ATP's.

00:11:29.837 --> 00:11:32.327
And then, this is going
to be three to four.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.810
Three to four ATP's.

00:11:35.259 --> 00:11:36.120
So if you add them all together,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.940
if you add the low ends
of the range, you get,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.780
let's see, 20 plus three, plus four.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.982
That's 27 ATP's.

00:11:42.982 --> 00:11:46.282
27 ATP's.

00:11:46.282 --> 00:11:48.305
And the high end of the range, let's see.

00:11:48.305 --> 00:11:51.055
You have four plus 30 plus four.

00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:52.531
You have 38.

00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:55.161
38 ATP's.

00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:57.531
And 38 ATP's is currently
considered to become

00:11:57.531 --> 00:11:59.791
the theoretical maximum,
but when we actually

00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:01.414
observe things in cells, it looks like

00:12:01.414 --> 00:12:05.217
it comes right at around 29 to 30 ATP's.

00:12:05.217 --> 00:12:06.837
And once again, it depends what the cell's

00:12:06.837 --> 00:12:10.097
trying to do, the type of cells,
and the type of efficiency.

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:13.458
But all of this is happening
through cellular respiration.

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:14.878
And just to get a better sense

00:12:14.878 --> 00:12:16.958
of where all of this is occurring.

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:17.746
Where all of this is occuring,

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:20.006
we said glycolosis is
occurring in the cytosol.

00:12:20.006 --> 00:12:23.726
The citric acid cycle,
this is occurring in

00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:28.311
the matrix of the mytochondria.

00:12:28.311 --> 00:12:30.771
So this space right over here,

00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:32.414
that is the citric acid cycle,

00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:34.994
in that little magenta
space that I've drawn.

00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:36.334
So that's the matrix.

00:12:36.334 --> 00:12:37.614
In the video on mitochondria, we go

00:12:37.614 --> 00:12:39.214
into much more detail on that.

00:12:39.214 --> 00:12:41.834
And then, the actual conversion of

00:12:41.834 --> 00:12:44.674
the coenzymes, of the
electron transport chain,

00:12:44.674 --> 00:12:47.734
that's occurring across
the membrane of the crista.

00:12:47.734 --> 00:12:51.314
And the crista are these
folds, these kind of,

00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:53.554
inner membrane folds, of our mitochondria.

00:12:53.554 --> 00:12:57.354
So, it's occurring across the membranes

00:12:57.354 --> 00:13:01.634
of those, actually the plural is cristae.

00:13:01.634 --> 00:13:05.697
Crista is the singular of the cristae.

00:13:05.697 --> 00:13:08.527
And we'll go into more detail
into that, in other videos.
