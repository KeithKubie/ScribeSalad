00:00:00.298 --> 00:00:02.024
- [Voiceover] So we have a
quadratic expression here.

00:00:02.024 --> 00:00:04.402
X squared minus three x minus 10.

00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.946
And what I'd like to do in this video

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:10.070
is I'd like to factor it as
the product of two binomials.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.939
Or to put it another way,

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:16.409
I want to write it as
the product x plus a,

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.009
that's one binomial, times x plus b,

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.012
where we need to figure out
what a and b are going to be.

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:24.190
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.526
and see if you can figure
out what a and b need to be.

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.456
Can we rewrite this
expression as the product

00:00:28.456 --> 00:00:32.032
of two binomials where
we know what a and b are?

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.592
So let's work through this together now.

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:37.456
I'll highlight a and
b in different colors.

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:41.885
I'll put a in yellow and
I'll put b in magenta.

00:00:41.885 --> 00:00:44.384
So one way to think about
it is let's just multiply

00:00:44.384 --> 00:00:47.594
these two binomials using a and b,

00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:49.423
and we've done this in previous videos.

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:51.373
You might want to review
multiplying binomials

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.730
if any of this looks strange to you.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.274
But if you were to multiply what we have

00:00:55.274 --> 00:00:59.378
on the right-hand side
out it would be equal to,

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:01.247
you're going to have the x times the x

00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:03.137
which is going to be x squared.

00:01:03.137 --> 00:01:06.591
Then you're going to
have the a times the x,

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:07.891
which is ax.

00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:09.679
And then you're going to
have the b times the x,

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:10.553
which is bx.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:12.056
Actually just let me, I'm
not gonna skip any steps

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:13.539
here just to see it this time.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.287
This is all review, or should be review.

00:01:15.287 --> 00:01:18.395
So then we have, so we did
x times x to get x squared.

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:23.395
Then we have a times x
to get ax, to get a x.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.298
And then we're gonna have x times b,

00:01:26.298 --> 00:01:28.513
so we're multiplying each
term times every other term.

00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:31.418
So then we have x times b to get bx.

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:36.418
So plus bx. b x.

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:41.455
And then finally we have
plus the a times the b,

00:01:41.455 --> 00:01:46.455
which is of course going to be ab.

00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:48.058
And now we can simplify this,

00:01:48.058 --> 00:01:49.724
and you might have been
able to go straight to this

00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:52.203
if you are familiar with
multiplying binomials.

00:01:52.203 --> 00:01:54.194
This would be x squared plus,

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:55.799
we can add these two coefficients

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.261
because they're both on
the first degree terms,

00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.420
they're both multiplied by x.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.122
If I have ax's and I add bx's to that

00:02:01.122 --> 00:02:04.941
I'm going to have a plus b x's.

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:06.363
So let me write that down.

00:02:06.363 --> 00:02:11.363
a plus b x's, and then
finally I have the plus,

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:17.192
I'll do that blue color,
finally I have it.

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:22.089
I have plus ab. Plus ab.

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.908
And now we can use this to think about

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:27.534
what a and b need to be.

00:02:27.534 --> 00:02:29.667
If we do a little bit of pattern matching,

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.333
we see we have an x squared there,

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.162
we have an x squared there.

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:36.798
We have something times x,

00:02:36.798 --> 00:02:38.830
in this case it's a
negative three times x.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.654
And here we have something times x.

00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:42.853
So one way to think about it is

00:02:42.853 --> 00:02:46.273
that a plus b needs to be
equal to negative three.

00:02:46.273 --> 00:02:49.993
They need to add up to
be this coefficient.

00:02:49.993 --> 00:02:51.923
So let me write that down.

00:02:51.923 --> 00:02:56.923
So we have a plus b needs to
be equal to negative three.

00:03:02.874 --> 00:03:04.337
And we're not done yet.

00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:06.836
We finally look at this last
term, we have a times b.

00:03:06.836 --> 00:03:10.006
Well a times b needs to
be equal to negative 10.

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.287
So let's write that down.

00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:17.423
So we have a times b needs
to be equal to negative 10.

00:03:20.388 --> 00:03:22.480
And in general, whenever
you're factoring something,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.295
a quadratic expression that has
a one on second degree term,

00:03:27.295 --> 00:03:29.104
so it has a one coefficient
on the x squared,

00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:30.648
you don't even see it but
it's implicitly there.

00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:32.496
You could write this as one x squared.

00:03:32.496 --> 00:03:34.447
A way to factor it is to
come up with two numbers

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:37.941
that add up to the coefficient
on the first degree term,

00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:40.298
so two numbers that add
up to negative three.

00:03:40.298 --> 00:03:42.574
And if I multiply those same two numbers,

00:03:42.574 --> 00:03:44.910
I'm going to get negative 10.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.617
So two numbers that add
up to negative three,

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.019
to add up to the coefficient here.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.477
And now when I multiply it,
I get the constant term.

00:03:50.477 --> 00:03:52.529
I get this right over here.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:54.683
Two numbers when I
multiply I get negative 10.

00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:57.100
Well what could those numbers be?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.270
Well since when you multiply
them we get a negative number,

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.033
we know that they're going
to have different signs.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.573
And so let's see how we
could think about it.

00:04:05.573 --> 00:04:07.503
And since when we add them
we get a negative number,

00:04:07.503 --> 00:04:10.835
we know that the negative
number must be the larger one.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:13.781
So if I were to just factor 10,

00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:18.781
10 you could do that as one times ten,

00:04:22.314 --> 00:04:24.874
or two times five.

00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:26.479
And two and five are interesting

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.226
because if one of them are negative,

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:29.364
their difference is three.

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:30.908
So if one is negative...

00:04:30.908 --> 00:04:32.960
So let's see if we're
talking about negative 10,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.384
you could say negative two times five.

00:04:38.384 --> 00:04:40.274
And when you multiply them
you do get negative 10.

00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:41.289
But if you add these two,

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.773
you're going to get positive three.

00:04:42.773 --> 00:04:46.552
But what if you went positive
two times negative five.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:48.665
Now this is interesting because still

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:51.042
when you multiply them
you get negative 10.

00:04:51.042 --> 00:04:54.800
And when you add them,
two plus negative five

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.487
is going to be negative three.

00:04:56.487 --> 00:05:00.834
So we have just figured
out our two numbers.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:04.857
We could say that a is two or
we could say that b is two,

00:05:04.857 --> 00:05:08.616
but I'll just say that a is equal to two

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:13.616
and b is equal to negative five.

00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:15.483
And so our original expression,

00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:16.763
we can rewrite as,

00:05:16.763 --> 00:05:20.603
so we can rewrite x squared
minus three x minus 10.

00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:22.878
We can say that that
is going to be equal to

00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:27.878
x plus two times x, instead
of saying plus negative five

00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:38.543
which we could say, we could just say,

00:05:38.543 --> 00:05:39.315
actually let me write that down.

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:42.545
I could write just plus
negative five right over there

00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:43.399
because that's our b.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:48.399
I could just write x minus
five, and we're done.

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.383
We've just factored it as
a product of two binomials.

00:05:51.383 --> 00:05:53.151
Now, I did it fairly involved mainly

00:05:53.151 --> 00:05:54.918
so you see where all this came from.

00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:57.011
But in the future whenever you
see a quadratic expression,

00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.649
and you have a one coefficient

00:05:59.649 --> 00:06:01.803
on the second degree term right over here,

00:06:01.803 --> 00:06:03.936
you could say alright well I
need to figure out two numbers

00:06:03.936 --> 00:06:06.435
that add up to the coefficient
on the first degree term,

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:08.508
on the x term, and those same two numbers

00:06:08.508 --> 00:06:11.271
when I multiply them need to
be equal to this constant term,

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:12.571
need to be equal to negative 10.

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:14.257
You say okay well let's see,

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:15.618
they're gonna be different signs

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:17.731
because when I multiply them
I get a negative number.

00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:19.621
The negative one is
gonna be the larger one,

00:06:19.621 --> 00:06:21.917
since when I add them I
got a negative number.

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:24.700
So let's see, let's say five
and two seem interesting.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.833
Well negative five and positive two,

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:28.865
when you add them you're
gonna get negative three,

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:31.208
when you multiply them
you get negative 10.
