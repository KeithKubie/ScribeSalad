00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.820
SPEAKER: People were asking me
what to expect today, and I

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.050
was like, he's a vocalist,
he's a

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.230
performer, he's an artist.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.660
Just come.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.390
You won't regret it.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.020
So if had to introduce yourself
to people who don't

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.610
know you as a musician,
and also as a person,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.800
what would you say?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.050
How would you do that?

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.190
BILAL: I would do it just
as you said it.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.440
I'm a musician.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.990
Pretty much it.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.630
Musician, singer.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.820
SPEAKER: How about as an
aside for music, how

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.180
would introduce yourself?

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.430
BILAL: Bilal.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.420
SPEAKER: I notice you have
a lot of nicknames.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.280
BILAL: Oh yeah.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.750
Airtight Willie.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.480
Pillow.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.520
In the studio I come out with a
lot of different names just

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.020
to get me out of a
certain mindset.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.560
SPEAKER: Mr. Wonderful?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.570
BILAL: Mr. Wonderful.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.910
I bring a lot of people in
to help me with ideas.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.205
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:07.230
And how did Mr. Wonderful
come about?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.870
BILAL: Mr. Wonderful, that's
a nickname of my pop's.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.880
That was his old nickname.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.850
So I'm actually Mr.
Wonderful Junior.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.280
SPEAKER: I have a similar
nickname.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.530
Mr. Slightly-Above-Average.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.830
OK, so, tell me about
high school.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.090
You went to the performing arts
high school coming up.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.450
Was that a rigorous, or was it
just something that was right

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.520
in tune with what you needed
and wanted at the time?

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.400
BILAL: It was cool.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.620
I wanted to go there.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.170
I grew up singing in the
church on a choir.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.260
Since I was four years
old I'm into music.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.875
So when I found out that there
was a performing art school, I

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.560
just went there and tried out.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.900
It was cool, I liked it.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.210
It was almost like fame.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.910
We had a dance department, art
department, drama department,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.100
music department.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.820
SPEAKER: Was there anything you
did in high school that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.860
was rebellious?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.110
BILAL: Everything.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.600
They voted me the weirdest
cat in the school.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.870
I didn't understand that shit.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.630
SPEAKER: There's a category--

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.590
BILAL: What the hell?

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.850
But I guess in school
you're weird.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.700
But I used to go to school
with my pajamas on.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.940
With the buttons.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.950
The awesome button-up
ones with the pants?

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.850
SPEAKER: The onesie?

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.450
BILAL: Not the onesie.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.700
It's a twosie.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.060
It's like grandad pajamas.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.900
It's got the pants, it's got the
awesome prints, and then

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.910
the shirt with the
big buttons.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.940
I thought that was cool.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.500
SPEAKER: That's really cool.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.940
Cool.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.030
So then after high school
you went to The New

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270
School, in New York.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.480
Can you talk about how that
changed or modified or

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.420
whatever your career trajectory,
and how that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.775
supported you going forward?

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.820
BILAL: It helped me
a great deal.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.550
Like I got to see other people
my age that could play on a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.580
really high level.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.480
You know what I'm saying?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.890
So it was inspiring.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.650
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.800
And who do you meet during those
years that you still

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.440
work with or are in
touch with today?

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.480
BILAL: Well, there is
Robert Glasper.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.060
Robert--

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.310
I met him--

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.990
we came in school at
the same time.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.030
He pretty much at the
same kind of musical

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.920
upbringing is me.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.730
Like, he started out playing
in church, his mom's a

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.030
musician, and she had him
playing at a young age.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.850
I had the same concept.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.580
So our musical understandings
kind of meshed.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.020
SPEAKER: This is just a
personal story, but my

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.110
favorite live show I think
I've ever seen was you,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.370
Robert, Chris Dave, and Tone
at Yoshi's Oakland.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.120
BILAL: Oh, awesome.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.579
SPEAKER: That's a good set.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.730
Did you plan to work together?

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.290
Or were you all just available
during the same time?

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.700
And then is there plans that--

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.690
do you guys all want to
come back together

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.760
at a certain point?

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.300
BILAL: That was just--
it was--

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.130
everybody is like--

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.640
has their own thing going.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.230
That was a time, a cool
period, where--

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.010
Robert actually played
on all my records.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.690
I played on all his records.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.700
But he helped me write some
of my early tunes.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.230
Like When Will You Call?

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.880
We wrote that at school
in a practice room.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880
SPEAKER: Really?

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.820
So that was--

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.910
you were real young when
that happened.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.750
That's a deep song for--
when I was 19--

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.500
BILAL: Actually it wasn't, I was
like a hopeless romantic,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.850
so at that period I was writing
a lot from high

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.100
school, and I got played
a lot in high school.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.320
SPEAKER: Speaking of
that-- me too.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.640
How do you deal with
heartbreak?

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.730
That's a deep question, but I
tend to crawl into some hole

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.226
or something.

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:34.470
It seems like you're able to
write your way out of it.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.640
BILAL: Yeah, that's been my
therapy through the years.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.330
SPEAKER: That's cool.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.360
So let's talk about D'Angelo.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.160
I didn't know that Bilal
sang background for

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.480
D'Angelo for a period.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.980
Can you tell me about
that experience?

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.270
BILAL: It only lasted one gig.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.480
It only lasted one gig,
but I used to hang

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.020
out at Ahmir's house.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.560
He used to have jam sessions
in his living room.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:12.870
And through hanging out with
Ahmir, I got a gig to sing

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.890
background for D. And we only
did one gig, but he rehearses

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.790
so vigorously that the
rehearsals were like two

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.620
months long.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.240
So I felt like I was in a
band for a long time.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.490
But actually I only
did one gig.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.810
And by then I had gotten signed
so I started to work

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.540
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.710
SPEAKER: Another relationship I
wanted to talk about was you

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:39.260
and J Dilla.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.510
How did that come about?

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.350
When did you all meet, and how
quickly did you guys start

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.770
working together
after you met?

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.650
BILAL: I met Dilla when I was
working on 1st Born Second.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:07:00.590
And at that time Dilla, Common,
Ahmir, The Roots,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.440
everybody, they kind of was
hitting at the same time,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.270
jamming with each other.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.260
Roots used to do a little jam
session at this place,

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.980
Wetlands, I think, and
everybody used

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.890
to come down there.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.040
Working with Dilla--

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.530
he was part of that
whole situation.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.170
Working with him is amazing.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:27.786
Cause he was just such a
naturally talented cat.

00:07:27.786 --> 00:07:31.230
The stuff he did, it was a lot
of it was self-taught.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.170
So he had a certain
understanding that was crazy,

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.110
but at the same time, he knew
the intricacies of the music

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.940
because his pops was
a jazz musician.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.110
His pops actually played on
a lot of jazz records.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.785
I didn't even know that.

00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:46.610
But his understanding was so
deep, because he was around it

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.210
at such a young age.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:49.630
SPEAKER: That's cool.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.370
I didn't know that
about is dad.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.770
So did you--

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.880
when he passed, that was
a loss for music.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:58.910
But as a friend, I'm sure
that was just very

00:07:58.910 --> 00:07:59.550
hard to cope with?

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.010
How did you cope through that
period when a good friend of

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.620
yours and--

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.870
BILAL: It was shocking.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:14.660
It was like one of the only
friends of mine that I knew,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.210
and then they passed away so.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.460
It was kind of--

00:08:24.995 --> 00:08:27.175
it was weird.

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:28.260
SPEAKER: Yeah, that's
definitely--

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.100
BILAL: I still think about it.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.780
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.020
I mean it's not natural
when it's that young.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.669
But I mean it's just incredible,
the amount that

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.799
he's been able to--

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.000
in such a short time--

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.200
contribute to music,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.159
BILAL: Yeah, it was like
he was on a mission.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:48.430
Dilla could do 50 beats
a day if he wanted to.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.250
He did Reminisce, my song,
in 10 minutes.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.580
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.730
OK.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.950
BILAL: From scratch.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.070
From sampling the record, to
finding what record he wanted

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.360
to use, to chopping up the
drum sounds, all of that.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.070
10 minutes.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:05.880
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.940
That's incredible.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:12.170
I've never done anything
in 10 minutes.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.250
Cool, so let's talk about--
you've collaborated-- one of

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.300
the things I like, you
collaborated with J Dilla, you

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.970
collaborated with
a lot of people.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.940
From really independent
folks to people

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.280
that everybody knows.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.040
Can you tell me about one
of your most memorable

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.570
collaborations that you
remember, like, whoa, that

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.435
happened just there?

00:09:27.435 --> 00:09:31.220
Or like just a weird kind
of story around a

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.580
collaboration you did.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.410
BILAL: I have so many,
you know, so

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.620
many memorable moments.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.570
I've worked with so many
awesome people.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.540
Like Dilla.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.615
Watching him put together
a beat was just amazing.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:53.720
But first time I met
Dr. Dre was crazy.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.020
Because of the way he records,
he records just so loud, he

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.200
likes it be so loud
in the studio.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.030
And this was before he
had the headphones.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.640
Oh my goodness.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.610
The first time I walked into the
studio to work with Dre,

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.298
he wasn't in the room yet.

00:10:17.298 --> 00:10:21.060
And I noticed that--

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.060
normal studios, they have two
gigantic speakers that you

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:27.680
could turn up and listen
to music [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.590
This cat had six of those.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.200
Three big ones at the
top and then three

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.680
sub-woofers at the bottom.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.760
And when I saw that, I noticed
everybody in the studio had on

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.480
earplugs in their ear.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.190
Then Dre walks in place,
like, yeah, hell yeah.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.700
Want to play you this track.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:01.160
Sits down and turns
it all the way up.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.820
I couldn't even--

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.040
First off, I thought that the
thing was going to explode.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.020
But nothing fed back, nothing
went crunchy.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.510
Nothing.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.730
It was just a wall of pain.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.550
I'll never forget that.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.255
Crazy.

00:11:21.255 --> 00:11:22.505
SPEAKER: That's cool.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.290
I did not expect that
to come out.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.540
That's cool.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.680
So you've worked with a
wide range of people.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.270
You're also one of the most
creative people that

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.820
I've seen and heard.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.600
Creativity--

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.370
I'm going to do the Google
tie-in right now.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.670
So creativity is really
important at Google and

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.300
innovation.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.220
How do you write, and is
that process the same?

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.300
Do you create conditions that
you can be creative in, or

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.680
does it just pop up, or--

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.750
BILAL: I try to be as open
and optimistic as I

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.550
can when I'm creating.

00:12:04.334 --> 00:12:07.590
I write different shapes
and then I just

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.040
wait until the moment--

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.390
the moment of actually putting
it down to really bring

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.670
everything and allow myself
to think of it

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.500
is a complete thought.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.520
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.205
So for non-musicians,
does that transfer?

00:12:22.205 --> 00:12:25.080
Do you think that would be the
advice you'd give people?

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.560
Be open?

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.870
What other advice would you
give to people about

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:33.470
creativity and that
whole area?

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.750
BILAL: I don't really
have a set way.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:41.132
I try not to put so much on
myself, like I have to do

00:12:41.132 --> 00:12:43.681
this, this is going to save my
life and make me feel a whole

00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:45.890
lot better about myself.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:53.530
I just try to remain as natural
and inquisitive as I

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.270
can, like when I first started,
when I was a kid.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.710
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.620
That's really cool.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.870
We talk about that
here, actually.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.460
We have these classes and we
talk about how sometimes you

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.420
lose that kid as you grow up.

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.770
So I think that's cool you're
able to hold on to that.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.710
So let's talk about technology
a little bit.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.930
Do you use any Google
products?

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.057
BILAL: I Google a lot.

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:19.920
SPEAKER: Yeah?

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.850
That's our main one.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.860
So I think we're doing well.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.280
And how do you discover
new music?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.760
Do you just have word of mouth
from friends, or do you use

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.560
any of the stuff that's
out there on the net?

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.480
BILAL: Yeah, I mean, I got
a Twitter page, Facebook,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.620
[INAUDIBLE], Instagram
thing, I guess.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.130
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:41.980
BILAL: You have to be.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.150
SPEAKER: Has it changed the way
you think about creating

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.080
records, or is it just kind of
once things are done, that's

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.580
going to happen?

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.730
BILAL: No, it's just something
that's happening while we're

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.640
doing what we do.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.090
Because a lot of is just like
a little comment or--

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:00.970
I don't leave that many
comments, though.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.960
But I try to take pictures
and stuff.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.880
SPEAKER: OK, cool.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.296
We're going to do--

00:14:06.296 --> 00:14:08.290
I know a lot of people ask you
what's your favorite this or

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.010
that, or the most--

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:11.240
I was not going to
do that, but I'm

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.220
actually going to do that.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.900
What's one of your most
favorite jazz

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.640
spots in New York?

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.190
BILAL: In New York?

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.335
Fat Cat.

00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:21.790
SPEAKER: OK.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.400
Is that--

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.920
what part of town?

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.080
BILAL: That's on 7th Avenue.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.830
It's actually like a ping-pong
pool house, but on the side

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.450
they play jazz and
it's real funky.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.860
A lot is just real cool.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.080
It's like a jazz cat spot.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.050
Most of the cats in the audience
are musicians too.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.450
So cats go there to burn out.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.460
They go there to like,
out-play each other.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.430
It's nice.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:03.360
SPEAKER: How about one of your
most favorite vocalist that

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.770
you've heard over the
course of your life?

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.620
BILAL: My most favorite
vocalist?

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:14.300
Is, I'd say, Betty Carter.

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.360
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.420
And what distinguishes
her, in your mind?

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.880
Or what distinguishes a good
vocalist, or a great vocalist

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.120
from just a good vocalist?

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.835
BILAL: Well I like a
person's approach.

00:15:28.928 --> 00:15:38.680
It was very open ended, but at
the same time, high level.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.410
SPEAKER: And you scat
and things as well.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.400
Is that--

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.640
BILAL: Yeah, definitely.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.430
That got me into her, too.

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.650
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:51.800
BILAL: She really had an
understanding of the music,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.410
other than the surface things.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:16:00.480
She really understood the chord
changes, the rhythm.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.410
So she was like a hardcore
bandleader just as much as

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.790
like Miles Davis or anybody.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:13.332
She really was known for finding
killer musicians and

00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:15.050
putting all those [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.540
things together.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.570
SPEAKER: For those of you
who haven't heard

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.380
her, check her out.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:18.850
BILAL: She's ill.

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:20.260
SPEAKER: She's incredible.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.880
So what-- let's switch
gears a little bit.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.130
What's one of the most--

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.330
one thing you're most proud
that's non-musical?

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.020
BILAL: Oh man.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.510
I have to say my kids.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.480
SPEAKER: Your kids.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.530
BILAL: Yeah.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:33.890
SPEAKER: You have two kids?

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.750
BILAL: I got three kids.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.490
SPEAKER: Three kids.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.520
BILAL: Three boys.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.840
SPEAKER: Oh wow.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.404
And how old?

00:16:39.404 --> 00:16:44.860
BILAL: I got a one-year-old,
a 12-year-old, and a

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.090
seven-year-old.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.710
SPEAKER: What's one of the
things you learned most about

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:48.960
yourself, being a father?

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.780
BILAL: Patience and
having fun.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.410
I've learned to laugh
with my kids.

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.490
SPEAKER: I think that's
really important.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.859
We have a lot of people becoming
fathers at Google.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.890
When you start at a young
company, you get to kind to

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.010
see people grow and
have babies.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.099
OK, cool, so--

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:11.810
BILAL: Kids are cool.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:13.520
Kids are cool.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.430
I love kids.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.490
SPEAKER: Let's talk
about the album.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.700
The new album, A Love Surreal,
comes out February 26th?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.700
BILAL: Yeah.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.069
SPEAKER: Tell me how it's
different from other work

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:26.210
you've done, or what went into
it as something you haven't

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.160
done before?

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:38.900
BILAL: Well, this album was,
for me, was a part of like

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.310
every creative section of it.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.920
When before I would
just really do the

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.390
music and be done.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:51.620
But this time I thought about
the visual side and how it

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.120
would relate to the musical.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.410
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.800
So how did you get involved
with the visual aspect?

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.330
BILAL: Well with the visual
aspect, I just thought about

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.680
Salvador Dali.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.650
While we were putting one of
the songs together in the

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:12.490
studio, I was like man, this is
almost like an art piece.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:18.390
And then that kind of got me
in a mindset of well, what

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.180
would I do visually?

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:25.660
And so what we winded up doing
is using Salvador Dali as kind

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.610
of the muse for the project.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:35.960
In trying to make the sound
feel visual when

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.090
you listen to it.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.510
Like almost 3D.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:39.880
SPEAKER: OK, cool.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.820
Is it--

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.700
the last album was, you
talked about a lot

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.340
of different stuff.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.050
Is that the case here, is
it more about love?

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.780
I'm just basing that
off the title.

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.260
BILAL: Yeah.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.030
This is a more sensual record.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.530
I always say as opposed
to my last record.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:05.120
My last record was, I would say,
for me and for a mellow

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.850
experience in this world.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:13.230
And this one is more for
the females, and for a

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.130
relationship, and the journey
through that.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:17.540
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:19.790
Well I'm looking forward
to hearing that.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:24.360
So any goals going forward
that are--

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.120
you do albums, you do music,
you do live shows.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.730
Do you have any other goals that
you want to accomplish?

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.600
BILAL: I'd like to do film.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.630
SPEAKER: Oh, cool.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.160
BILAL: Landscaping in
music in the films.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.090
I would love to do that.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.200
Making this record really
got my mind to

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.680
thinking about it more.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.510
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.030
Yeah, I think the way that you
seem to think that would be a

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.570
really good fit, just based on
the performances and the music

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.230
that I've heard.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.710
Cool.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.250
All right, well, thanks
a lot for being here.

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.970
I'm really excited, Bilal's
about the play some tunes.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.760
Thanks for being here, thanks
for what you do for music, as

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.730
an independent music fan then
a music fan in general.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.760
We'll be all passing that onto
our kids for a long time to

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.380
come, I'm sure.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.930
So you ready?

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.610
BILAL: Yes.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:18.907
SPEAKER: Everybody
welcome Bilal.
