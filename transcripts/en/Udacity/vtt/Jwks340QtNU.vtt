00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is the 4th choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If she can find 2 keys where either the encryption of 0 with key 0

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is equal to the encryption of 1 with key 1 or the opposite,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
then at least half the time she has an advantage.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So in this case, if she sends this as the message, if Bob guesses 0, she can win

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
by revealing K1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
If Bob guesses 1, she can win by revealing K0, so she's guaranteed to win.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If she finds a key pair like this, well, then she can do the same thing.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
She can reveal this is the message and then based on Bob's guess,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
reveal wither K1 or K0.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Either of these would also allow her to cheat if she could find a key that has this property--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that for whatever key she happened to pick, encrypt 0 to the same thing that key encrypted 1 to,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
well, that would allow her to cheat just as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But this is a harder thing to do than finding 2 keys that have this property.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We might not know enough yet to be able to be sure that this is harder than that,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but we know it certainly is no more difficult and this could be easier,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we'll see that, in fact, it is easier.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The second one would also be enough, but this is the much stronger property

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to find a key pair that has both of those properties.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
How hard this is depends on lots of things.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The first thing we have to answer a little more is what encryption means here.
