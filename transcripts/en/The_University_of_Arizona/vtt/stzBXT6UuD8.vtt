00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.400
The aging process is
plastic, it's malleable.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.029
It's not fixed and
it is not something

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.940
that must occur invariably
in the same sequence

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.360
and with the same level of
disability going forward.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.510
We can impact it a lot.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.530
And so this is one
part of where we're

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.390
trying to contribute from
the side of the immune system

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.670
to this extension of
what we call health span.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.620
Which is good health
in which you're

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.900
going to spend as many years
as possible in your life.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.310
You think about people who
have lived into their 70s,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.050
into their 80s, into their 90s.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.230
And thinking about what they
can return to the society

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.300
is really remarkable.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.180
I mean, they are some of the
wisest people that you have.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.320
We, on the other
hand, figure out OK,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.059
well if you have retired or
even if you haven't retired,

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:55.850
you know, whatever.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.860
It's like you know, you're like
on the margin of the society.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.370
And that's really wrong.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.340
Human potential is really not
determined by those years.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.860
You know, we don't really
have an expiration date

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.970
until which we're
useful to the society.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.410
So that is the
other part that has

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.410
crystallized for me
as an important issue

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.560
and an important goal.
