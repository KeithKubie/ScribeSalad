00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.299
- [Voiceover] So, I have three
different functions here.

00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:03.204
I know they're all called f,

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:06.035
but we're gonna just assume
they are different functions.

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:10.472
And, for each of these, I
want to do three things.

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:12.770
I want to find the zeros.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.860
And so, the zeros are the input values

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.927
that make the value of the
function equal to zero.

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:21.099
So, here it'd be the t values
that make f of t equal zero.

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.231
Here, it'd be the x values

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:23.736
that make the function equal zero.

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:25.447
So, I want to find the zeros.

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:29.386
I also want to find the
coordinates of the vertex.

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:31.126
And finally, I want to find the equation

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:33.348
of the line of symmetry.

00:00:33.348 --> 00:00:35.368
Line of symmetry.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.681
And in particular, to make it
a little bit more specific,

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.733
the vertical line of symmetry,
which will actually be

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.448
the only line of symmetry for these three.

00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:44.098
So, pause the video and
see if you can figure out

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:46.898
the zeros, the vertex,
and the line of symmetry.

00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:48.649
And I'm assuming you just did that

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.973
and now I am going to attempt to do it.

00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:52.451
And if, at any point, you get inspired

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:54.554
pause the video again and
keep on working on it.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.165
The best way to learn this
stuff is to do it yourself.

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.220
So, let's see, so let's
first find the zeros.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.334
So, to find the zeros, we can set

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:05.505
t minus five squared,
minus nine, equal to zero.

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:08.970
So, we could say t ... for what t's does

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.909
t minus five squared,
minus nine, equal zero?

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.955
Let's see, to solve this, we
could add nine to both sides.

00:01:15.955 --> 00:01:18.927
And so we could say, if
we add nine to both sides

00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:22.503
the lefthand side's just
t minus five squared.

00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:24.641
The righthand side is going to be nine.

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:27.532
And so, if t minus five squared
is nine, that means that

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:30.163
t minus five could be equal to

00:01:30.163 --> 00:01:31.883
the positive square root of nine

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.902
or t minus five could equal

00:01:34.902 --> 00:01:38.280
the negative square root of nine.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.246
And to solve for t, we could
add five to both sides,

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:44.830
so we get t is equal to
eight or t is equal to,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.528
if we add five to both sides here,

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:48.638
t is equal to two.

00:01:48.638 --> 00:01:51.068
And just like that, we
have found the zeros

00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:54.200
for this function because if
t is equal to eight or two,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.831
the function is going to be zero.

00:01:55.831 --> 00:02:00.831
F of eight is zero and f
of two is going to be zero.

00:02:01.046 --> 00:02:05.708
Now, let's find the vertex,
the coordinates of the vertex.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:08.484
The coordinates of the vertex.

00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:10.118
So, the x coordinate of the vertex,

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:12.642
or sorry, I should say the
t coordinate of the vertex

00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:15.241
since the input variable here is t,

00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.752
the t coordinate of the
vertex is going to be

00:02:17.752 --> 00:02:20.682
halfway in between the zeros.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.505
It's going to be halfway in between where

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:26.595
the parabola, in this case,

00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:28.573
is going to intersect the x axis,

00:02:28.573 --> 00:02:30.358
or the t axis, I keep saying x axis,

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.937
the t axis for this case.

00:02:31.937 --> 00:02:33.725
So, halfway between eight and two.

00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:35.466
Well, it's gonna be the average of them.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:37.219
Eight plus two, over two.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.844
That's ten over two, that's five.

00:02:41.534 --> 00:02:43.593
The t coordinate is five and five is

00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:46.492
three away from eight
and three away from two.

00:02:46.492 --> 00:02:49.612
And, when t is equal to
five, what is f of t?

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:50.930
What is f of five?

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.207
Well, when t is equal to five,

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:54.825
five minus five squared is just zero.

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:59.416
And then, f of five is just
going to be negative nine.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:02.811
And this form of a function,
this is actually called

00:03:02.811 --> 00:03:06.066
vertex form because it's very
easy to pick out the vertex.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.140
It's very easy to
realize, like, okay look,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.824
for this particular one, we're
going to hit a minimum point

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:14.428
when this part of the
expression is equal to zero

00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:17.539
because this thing, the
lowest value it can take on

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.443
is zero cause you're squaring it,

00:03:19.443 --> 00:03:21.301
it can never take on a negative value.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.971
And it takes on zero
when t is equal to five.

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:25.902
And when that's, if this part is zero,

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:29.015
then the f of five is
going to be negative nine.

00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:31.903
So, just like that, we have
established the vertex.

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:33.682
Now, we actually have a lot of information

00:03:33.682 --> 00:03:35.534
if we wanted to draw it.

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:38.260
So, if we want to draw this function.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.270
I'll just do a very quick sketch of it.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.546
Whoops.

00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:44.473
So, a very quick sketch of it.

00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:47.933
So, that is our t axis, not our x axis,

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:50.198
I have to keep reminding myself.

00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:53.970
And that is my,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.740
let's call that my y axis.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.960
And we're going to graph
y is equal to f of t.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.213
Well, we know the vertex is at the point

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:04.019
five comma negative nine.

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.530
So, this is, t is equal to five

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.732
and y is equal to negative nine,

00:04:11.732 --> 00:04:14.704
so that's the vertex right over there.

00:04:14.704 --> 00:04:15.760
And then, we know we have zeros

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.001
at t equals eight and t equals two.

00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:22.413
So, t equals eight and t equals two.

00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:25.594
Let me make that a little
bit in, t equals two.

00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:27.139
Those are the two zeros.

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.240
So, eight and two.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.211
And so, just like that,
we can graph f of t,

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:35.183
or we can graph y is equal to f of t.

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:40.183
So, y is equal to f of t is
going to look something like

00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:45.754
let me draw it a little
... something like that

00:04:45.754 --> 00:04:49.020
That's the graph of y is equal to f of t.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.837
Now, the last thing that I
said is the line of symmetry.

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:55.262
Well, the line of symmetry is going to be

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:58.526
the vertical line that
goes through the vertex.

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:00.897
So, the equation of that line of symmetry

00:05:00.897 --> 00:05:04.354
is going to be t is equal to five.

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:07.309
That's really just the t
coordinate of the vertex.

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.834
That defines the line of symmetry.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.206
Let's do the other two right over here.

00:05:12.206 --> 00:05:14.228
So, what are the zeros?

00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:18.666
Well, if you set this equal
to zero, if we say x plus two

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:21.843
times x plus four is equal to zero,

00:05:21.843 --> 00:05:26.296
well that's going to happen
if x plus two is equal to zero

00:05:26.296 --> 00:05:29.825
or x plus four is equal to zero.

00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:32.193
This is going to happen if we
subtract two from both sides,

00:05:32.193 --> 00:05:34.903
when x is negative two,
and if we subtract four

00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:38.555
from both sides, or when x
is equal to negative four.

00:05:38.555 --> 00:05:42.682
As we said, the vertex, the
x coordinate of the vertex,

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:44.831
is going to be halfway in between these.

00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:47.953
So, it's going to be negative
two plus negative four,

00:05:47.953 --> 00:05:51.618
over two, so that would
be negative six, over two,

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:54.135
which is just negative three.

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:55.832
Negative three.

00:05:55.832 --> 00:05:59.365
And when x is negative
three, f of x is going to be,

00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:02.338
let's see, it's going to be negative one

00:06:02.338 --> 00:06:05.368
times one, right?

00:06:05.368 --> 00:06:10.257
Negative three plus two is
negative one, and so times one.

00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:12.970
So, it's just going to be negative one.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.003
There you have it.

00:06:14.003 --> 00:06:16.857
And the line of symmetry is
going to be the vertical line

00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:19.197
x is equal to negative three.

00:06:19.197 --> 00:06:23.121
And once again, we can
graph that really fast.

00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.486
So, let me,

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:28.866
this is my y axis.

00:06:28.866 --> 00:06:31.780
See everything is
happening for negative x's,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.216
so I'll draw it a little
bit more skewed this way.

00:06:36.216 --> 00:06:38.615
This is my x axis.

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:42.160
And we see that we have zeros
at x equals negative two

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.388
and x is equal to negative four.

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:49.605
So, negative one, two, three, four.

00:06:49.605 --> 00:06:54.142
So, we have zeros

00:06:54.142 --> 00:06:56.912
there, negative two, be careful.

00:06:56.912 --> 00:06:59.682
Negative two and negative four.

00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:03.382
And the vertex is at negative
three comma negaitve one.

00:07:03.382 --> 00:07:06.531
So, negative three comma negative one.

00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:08.049
Make sure we see that, so this is

00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:10.708
negative one right over
here, negative one.

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:13.978
This is negative two,
this is negative four.

00:07:13.978 --> 00:07:18.212
And so we can sketch out what the graph of

00:07:18.212 --> 00:07:20.704
y is equal to f of x
is going to look like.

00:07:20.704 --> 00:07:24.226
It's gonna look something like that.

00:07:24.226 --> 00:07:27.295
That is y is equal to f of x.

00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:28.456
Let's do one more.

00:07:28.456 --> 00:07:30.621
Hopefully, we're getting the hang of this.

00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:34.817
So, here, to solve x squared,
plus six x, plus eight

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:38.239
is equal to zero, it will
be useful to factor this.

00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:40.221
And so, this can be written as, and if you

00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:41.831
have trouble doing this,
I encourage you to watch

00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:43.618
videos on factoring polynomials,

00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:45.830
What adds up to six and when you

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.492
take their product is eight?

00:07:47.492 --> 00:07:48.889
Well, four and two.

00:07:48.889 --> 00:07:53.679
Four plus two is six and
four times two is eight.

00:07:53.679 --> 00:07:56.817
So, is equal to zero.

00:07:56.817 --> 00:07:58.664
And then, this is actually
the exact same thing

00:07:58.664 --> 00:08:00.591
as what we have in blue right over here.

00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:03.456
These are actually the
exact same function.

00:08:03.456 --> 00:08:05.628
They're just written in different forms.

00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:08.321
And so, the solutions are
gonna be the exact solutions

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.568
that we just saw right
over here and the graph

00:08:11.568 --> 00:08:14.610
is going to be the same thing
that we have right over there.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.982
So, same vertex, same line
of symmetry, same zeros.

00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:21.815
These functions were just
written in different ways.
