00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.730
In the last video, we started
to explore the payments that

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.030
could flow into a country
or out of a country.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.900
And now I want to
continue it more.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.790
In particular, we focused on
the current account last time.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.940
And that focused on things like
trade, exports and imports,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.430
income earned from assets in
another country, or income

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.120
that someone from
outside of the country

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.670
earns from assets in the
country that we're studying,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.890
or just transfers
that are happening.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.910
Now when we look at
the capital account,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.890
in this video right over here--
and I wrote capital accounts,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.960
there shouldn't be
an s right there,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.460
when we look at the
capital account,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.770
we look at other
ways or other reasons

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.130
why we might have inflows
or outflows of payments.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.450
And in particular,
the capital account

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.660
is focused on that
the change in assets

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.840
that either foreigners own
of, in this case, the US,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.062
or that US nationals own of
assets that are someplace else.

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:53.770
And this little triangle
right over here,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.460
that is the Greek letter delta,
just shorthand for change in.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.560
So once again, let's focus
first on the inflows.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.540
And when you're talking
about change in assets,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.050
these would essentially be
someone outside the US buying

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.520
assets inside the US from
someone that was not foreign.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.820
So for example, if
I am a home builder,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.680
I'm an American citizen,
I'm a home builder,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550
I build a home in the US.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.650
And then I sell it,
for a million dollars

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.860
to a Mexican national, maybe
for their vacation home.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.050
That means that for
just that transaction

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.180
there has been an increase
in foreign ownership of US

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.320
assets, that
million dollar home.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.270
And so this number would be
increased by a million dollars.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.770
And so that's why
it's an inflow,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.228
because when they
bought that house

00:01:50.228 --> 00:01:52.690
they would have had to
make a payment to me.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.642
And this right over
here-- I have a bunch

00:01:54.642 --> 00:01:56.100
of stuff written
over here-- change

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.789
in foreign owned assets in US.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.830
And it also includes
financial derivatives there,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.663
you don't have to worry
too much about that.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.600
And it also has change
in foreign reserves.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.230
The one way to think about
the difference between that

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.410
and that right
over there, this is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.553
you could view this as privately
owned changes in ownership.

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:16.210
And this is by essentially
official changes in ownership

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.680
by either the government
or the Central

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.894
Banks of foreign countries.

00:02:19.894 --> 00:02:21.310
And for a lot of
countries they're

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.768
essentially one
and the same thing.

00:02:22.768 --> 00:02:26.000
In the US, they kind of maintain
this pseudo-independence.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.150
But this is official,
you could kind of

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.850
view this as official
government ownership.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.370
And this right over here
is, for the most part,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.940
private ownership.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.090
And once again, if
someone in England

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240
were to come into
the US and buy,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.120
let's say buy a share
of IBM from an American,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.720
then that would increase
this number right over here.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.160
But if the Central Bank of China
decided to buy a US government

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.120
bond from an American
then this right over here,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.830
would increase.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.350
But they're both
the general idea.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.030
Someone buys an asset.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.030
We're not talking about
the income on the asset.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.580
We're talking about
the asset itself.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.736
Someone buys an asset
from, or changes hands from

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:12.460
and American national
to a foreign national,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.080
then these numbers
would increase

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.454
and those foreign
nationals would

00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:17.530
have to make a
payment into the US.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.750
So once again, these are
inflows right over here.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.860
Now we take the other
side of that coin.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.370
If I were to go out and buy
a vacation home in Italy,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.810
and let's say I buy
it from an Italian,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.860
then I would have to
make a payment to them.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.930
So that would be an
outflow from the US.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.650
And I would get
an asset in Italy,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.450
in exchange for it,
my vacation home.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.709
And so this number right
over here would increase.

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.500
But once again, I wrote
over here in orange

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.560
because it is an outflow.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.630
I'm making a payment
to a foreign national.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.410
And this once again,
this is a breakdown

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.290
between-- this is really the
private sector for the most

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.900
part.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.100
And this over here is
the US Federal Reserve.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.480
So if the US
Federal Reserve were

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.770
to go and buy an asset
from a foreign government

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.580
bank or individual,
let's say a foreign bond,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.760
than this number right
over here would increase.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.010
And actually, the way I've
classified right over here,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.480
government purchases, not
the US Federal Reserve,

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.260
but the US government
actually still falls

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.680
into this category, just the
way I set up the numbers.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.224
This right over here is
the Federal Reserve alone.

00:04:23.224 --> 00:04:24.890
Now with that of the
way, let's actually

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.440
figure out whether we're
running a capital account

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.570
deficit or a surplus.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.456
So let's get our
calculator back.

00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:33.330
Let me get it and I'll
put it right over here

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.501
so we can see our numbers.

00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:36.000
And so let's think
about the inflow.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.700
So this is how much
more foreigners

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.910
are buying of US stuff.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.710
So they're buying 625--
and when I say stuff,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.780
I'm talking about assets.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.540
I'm not talking about
goods and services.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.800
I'm talking about stocks
and bonds and real estate.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.410
So $625 billion.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.880
And then plus
another $165 billion

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.520
if we talk about the official
purchases of governments

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.870
and central banks.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.050
So this is how much
increased asset--

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.690
this is the change
in assets purchased

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:04.880
from foreigners in the US.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.500
So they have to put in
$790 billion into 2011

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.140
to make those purchases.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.480
Well on the other side
of that, Americans

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.870
went out and bought
$380 billion.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.350
And when I write- that's
just a previous answer.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.594
So we have $790 billion,
which is what's inflowing.

00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:21.010
And now this is
what's outflowing.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.140
$380 billion to buy
assets in other countries

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.010
that the non-Federal
Reserve actors do.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.571
And then these are the assets
that the Federal Reserve also

00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:30.070
buys.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.930
But those are also
outflows of payments.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.830
And we are left
with $394 billion--

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.050
a positive $394 billion.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.090
This is $394 billion larger
than this right over here.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.630
So we're running a
capital account surplus.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.650
Let me write that.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:06:00.180
So we end up with a
capital account surplus,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.200
and it shows you how good--
what was it? $394 billion.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.504
And so you see that these
numbers are pretty close.

00:06:09.504 --> 00:06:11.170
And now I'm going to
tell you something,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.720
and hopefully in
future videos you'll

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.410
understand why this is happening
in a little bit more depth.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.785
But these numbers
actually should

00:06:16.785 --> 00:06:18.484
have been the exact same thing.

00:06:18.484 --> 00:06:19.900
These numbers
should have actually

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.310
been the exact
same thing, but we

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.480
see that they're off
by about, what is it?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.410
They're off by
about $80 billion.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.520
So let me write this down.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.550
We have and $80
billion discrepancy.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.330
And for most people, that's
a fairly large discrepancy.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.020
But if we're talking
about an economy

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.724
the size of the
United States, that's

00:06:35.724 --> 00:06:37.140
on the order of
$15 trillion, it's

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.307
not that huge of a discrepancy.

00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:42.890
And you have to think about how
all of this stuff is measured.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.890
They have to do surveys.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.295
They sample things.

00:06:45.295 --> 00:06:46.670
They're getting
all these numbers

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.020
from all different sources.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.686
And so it's actually
reasonable that you

00:06:49.686 --> 00:06:52.439
would have some form of
statistical discrepancy.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.480
And that's actually what
this is right over here.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.390
This is a statistical
discrepancy.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.820
In theory, these numbers
should be the exact amount.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.440
If you're running a current
account deficit then

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.530
you should have that exact same
amount in the capital account

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.860
surplus, and vice versa.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.090
If you have a capital
account deficit then

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.929
you would have to be running
a current account surplus.

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:15.720
We'll talk more about
why that makes sense,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.950
although I encourage
you to think about it.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.366
Think about it
right now, why that

00:07:18.366 --> 00:07:20.870
makes sense, and the difference
between these numbers.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.730
This is just a
statistical discrepancy

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.532
by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis.
