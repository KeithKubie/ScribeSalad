00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.270
 
let's do a couple of problems where we

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
let's do a couple of problems where we
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.420
let's do a couple of problems where we
estimate or predict answers to questions

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
estimate or predict answers to questions
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.520
estimate or predict answers to questions
using linear models linear models and it

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530
using linear models linear models and it
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.770
using linear models linear models and it
sounds very fancy but what a linear

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780
sounds very fancy but what a linear
 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.829
sounds very fancy but what a linear
model is is just using a line to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839
model is is just using a line to
 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.429
model is is just using a line to
describe some trend in data and with our

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
describe some trend in data and with our
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.380
describe some trend in data and with our
linear models we will do a little bit of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
linear models we will do a little bit of
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.519
linear models we will do a little bit of
interpolation interpolation and a little

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
interpolation interpolation and a little
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769
interpolation interpolation and a little
bit of extrapolation you might have

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
bit of extrapolation you might have
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.330
bit of extrapolation you might have
already heard these words before in your

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340
already heard these words before in your
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.250
already heard these words before in your
everyday life

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260
everyday life
 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.280
everyday life
extrapolation extrapolation and these

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
extrapolation extrapolation and these
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.950
extrapolation extrapolation and these
interpolation means trying to estimate

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960
interpolation means trying to estimate
 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650
interpolation means trying to estimate
what happened between two data points

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
what happened between two data points
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389
what happened between two data points
we're going to do a couple of examples

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
we're going to do a couple of examples
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639
we're going to do a couple of examples
of that in this video an extrapolation

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
of that in this video an extrapolation
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.369
of that in this video an extrapolation
means well see what the last few data

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
means well see what the last few data
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.619
means well see what the last few data
points were and see what that trend look

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
points were and see what that trend look
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.080
points were and see what that trend look
like and then keep on continuing that

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
like and then keep on continuing that
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.180
like and then keep on continuing that
trend and see what might happen if we

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
trend and see what might happen if we
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100
trend and see what might happen if we
were if that trend were to continue and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
were if that trend were to continue and
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.110
were if that trend were to continue and
I'll show you some examples of that so

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120
I'll show you some examples of that so
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.170
I'll show you some examples of that so
let's do some example questions here so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180
let's do some example questions here so
 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.840
let's do some example questions here so
I have this chart here median age

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
I have this chart here median age
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.030
I have this chart here median age
remember median is the middle so if I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
remember median is the middle so if I
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850
remember median is the middle so if I
have you know if I have the numbers 3 7

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
have you know if I have the numbers 3 7
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.270
have you know if I have the numbers 3 7
&amp; 9 the median is the median is the 7

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
&amp; 9 the median is the median is the 7
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.780
&amp; 9 the median is the median is the 7
it's the middle the middle age so this

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
it's the middle the middle age so this
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.660
it's the middle the middle age so this
is the median age of males and females

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
is the median age of males and females
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.320
is the median age of males and females
at first marriage by year so if we just

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
at first marriage by year so if we just
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300
at first marriage by year so if we just
look at this data right here if we look

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
look at this data right here if we look
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.569
look at this data right here if we look
at like 1900 the average man was getting

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
at like 1900 the average man was getting
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.330
at like 1900 the average man was getting
married or not the average the median

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340
married or not the average the median
 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.429
married or not the average the median
male so the middle man was getting

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
male so the middle man was getting
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.140
male so the middle man was getting
married at around the age looks like at

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
married at around the age looks like at
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240
married at around the age looks like at
around the age a little over 25 almost

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
around the age a little over 25 almost
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.460
around the age a little over 25 almost
26 while the median woman the median

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
26 while the median woman the median
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.950
26 while the median woman the median
woman was getting married looks at

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
woman was getting married looks at
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.310
woman was getting married looks at
around 22 or 23 years old and as we went

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
around 22 or 23 years old and as we went
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109
around 22 or 23 years old and as we went
through the century those ages got lower

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
through the century those ages got lower
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.880
through the century those ages got lower
and lower and lower until we got to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
and lower and lower until we got to
 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830
and lower and lower until we got to
about 1960 this problem is interesting

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
about 1960 this problem is interesting
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200
about 1960 this problem is interesting
irrespective of the actual problems it's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210
irrespective of the actual problems it's
 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.090
irrespective of the actual problems it's
just interesting to see this trend that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
just interesting to see this trend that
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730
just interesting to see this trend that
at the beginning of the century people

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
at the beginning of the century people
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.399
at the beginning of the century people
got married you know reasonably similar

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
got married you know reasonably similar
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.630
got married you know reasonably similar
to when they're getting married right

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
to when they're getting married right
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.249
to when they're getting married right
now but there was kind of a minimum

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
now but there was kind of a minimum
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.050
now but there was kind of a minimum
point there was an around the 1960s

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
point there was an around the 1960s
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180
point there was an around the 1960s
people got married at a younger age and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
people got married at a younger age and
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920
people got married at a younger age and
this was true for male and females and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
this was true for male and females and
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.290
this was true for male and females and
you can all

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
you can all
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.230
you can all
so see back here the age difference

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
so see back here the age difference
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.780
so see back here the age difference
between the median male and the median

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
between the median male and the median
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.420
between the median male and the median
female that's just gotten smaller and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
female that's just gotten smaller and
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.490
female that's just gotten smaller and
smaller over time now it's really small

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
smaller over time now it's really small
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.930
smaller over time now it's really small
so these are just solved interesting

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
so these are just solved interesting
 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.100
so these are just solved interesting
things from this chart this is the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
things from this chart this is the
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.040
things from this chart this is the
actual data from that chart so actually

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
actual data from that chart so actually
 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.350
actual data from that chart so actually
I didn't even have to estimated here in

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360
I didn't even have to estimated here in
 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.950
I didn't even have to estimated here in
1900 in 1900 the median male a the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960
1900 in 1900 the median male a the
 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.660
1900 in 1900 the median male a the
median age of males getting married was

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670
median age of males getting married was
 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.790
median age of males getting married was
twenty five point nine that's that right

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
twenty five point nine that's that right
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.490
twenty five point nine that's that right
there and the median age of women

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
there and the median age of women
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.930
there and the median age of women
getting married was twenty one point

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940
getting married was twenty one point
 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.970
getting married was twenty one point
nine that's that over there so this is

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980
nine that's that over there so this is
 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.220
nine that's that over there so this is
just a scatter plot of this data we've

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230
just a scatter plot of this data we've
 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.900
just a scatter plot of this data we've
just plotted each of these points over

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910
just plotted each of these points over
 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.740
just plotted each of these points over
here these in blue these in red now

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750
here these in blue these in red now
 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.310
here these in blue these in red now
let's do the questions use the data from

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320
let's do the questions use the data from
 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.310
let's do the questions use the data from
example one this is example one up here

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320
example one this is example one up here
 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.370
example one this is example one up here
to estimate the age at marriage for

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380
to estimate the age at marriage for
 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.680
to estimate the age at marriage for
females in 1946 fit a line by hand to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690
females in 1946 fit a line by hand to
 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.310
females in 1946 fit a line by hand to
the data before 1970 so what they want

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
the data before 1970 so what they want
 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.570
the data before 1970 so what they want
to do is they want me to look at all of

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580
to do is they want me to look at all of
 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.910
to do is they want me to look at all of
the data before 1970 so let's see this

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920
the data before 1970 so let's see this
 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.490
the data before 1970 so let's see this
is 1970 right here

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500
is 1970 right here
 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.850
is 1970 right here
that's 1970 right there and they want to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860
that's 1970 right there and they want to
 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.280
that's 1970 right there and they want to
fit a line by hand to the data before

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
fit a line by hand to the data before
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.570
fit a line by hand to the data before
1970 you know what they mean is that I'm

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580
1970 you know what they mean is that I'm
 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.010
1970 you know what they mean is that I'm
going to do it I'm just going to eyeball

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020
going to do it I'm just going to eyeball
 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.800
going to do it I'm just going to eyeball
it but they want me to do is fit is to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810
it but they want me to do is fit is to
 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.860
it but they want me to do is fit is to
draw a line that gets as close to all of

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870
draw a line that gets as close to all of
 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.790
draw a line that gets as close to all of
this data before 1970 as possible so it

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800
this data before 1970 as possible so it
 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.229
this data before 1970 as possible so it
can't go through all of these points

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239
can't go through all of these points
 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.640
can't go through all of these points
because all of these points don't sit

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
because all of these points don't sit
 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.370
because all of these points don't sit
exactly on one line but let me try to

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380
exactly on one line but let me try to
 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.760
exactly on one line but let me try to
draw a line or a linear model for the

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770
draw a line or a linear model for the
 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.930
draw a line or a linear model for the
data from what is this 1890 all the way

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940
data from what is this 1890 all the way
 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.930
data from what is this 1890 all the way
to 1970 so I'm going to try my best to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
to 1970 so I'm going to try my best to
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.050
to 1970 so I'm going to try my best to
draw a line here that gets close to all

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
draw a line here that gets close to all
 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.940
draw a line here that gets close to all
of these points it won't be able to go

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950
of these points it won't be able to go
 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.490
of these points it won't be able to go
through all of them all the way to 1970

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500
through all of them all the way to 1970
 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.280
through all of them all the way to 1970
maybe a line would look something like

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290
maybe a line would look something like
 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.280
maybe a line would look something like
that let's let me draw a better one than

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290
that let's let me draw a better one than
 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.460
that let's let me draw a better one than
that let me draw it in red because we're

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470
that let me draw it in red because we're
 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.259
that let me draw it in red because we're
dealing with the red data so I want to

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269
dealing with the red data so I want to
 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.990
dealing with the red data so I want to
go all the way to 1970 it would have

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
go all the way to 1970 it would have
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.490
go all the way to 1970 it would have
been nice to have a line drawing tool

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500
been nice to have a line drawing tool
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.680
been nice to have a line drawing tool
maybe the line might look something like

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690
maybe the line might look something like
 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.719
maybe the line might look something like
that there are actual mathematical ways

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729
that there are actual mathematical ways
 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.779
that there are actual mathematical ways
to figure out the the best fit line on

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789
to figure out the the best fit line on
 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.490
to figure out the the best fit line on
this we won't go into that right now

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500
this we won't go into that right now
 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.300
this we won't go into that right now
that's called

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310
that's called
 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.310
that's called
regression but I just eyeballed it that

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320
regression but I just eyeballed it that
 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.110
regression but I just eyeballed it that
line looks like a pretty good fit for

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120
line looks like a pretty good fit for
 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.850
line looks like a pretty good fit for
all of that data none of the data is too

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860
all of that data none of the data is too
 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.250
all of that data none of the data is too
far away from that line so that's what

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260
far away from that line so that's what
 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.710
far away from that line so that's what
they mean by fit a line by hand to the

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720
they mean by fit a line by hand to the
 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.190
they mean by fit a line by hand to the
data before 1970 this is the data before

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200
data before 1970 this is the data before
 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.650
data before 1970 this is the data before
1970 and then this if we assume that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660
1970 and then this if we assume that
 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.080
1970 and then this if we assume that
this is a good linear model for that

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090
this is a good linear model for that
 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.409
this is a good linear model for that
data we can use it to estimate we can

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419
data we can use it to estimate we can
 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.159
data we can use it to estimate we can
use it to estimate the age at marriage

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
use it to estimate the age at marriage
 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.920
use it to estimate the age at marriage
for females in 1946 1946 is C this is

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930
for females in 1946 1946 is C this is
 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.270
for females in 1946 1946 is C this is
1950 this would be 1945 1945 would be

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
1950 this would be 1945 1945 would be
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.629
1950 this would be 1945 1945 would be
right over here so 1946 would be right

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639
right over here so 1946 would be right
 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.530
right over here so 1946 would be right
right over there

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540
right over there
 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.230
right over there
so if we wanted to estimate that if I

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240
so if we wanted to estimate that if I
 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.850
so if we wanted to estimate that if I
were to draw a I were to figure out

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860
were to draw a I were to figure out
 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.430
were to draw a I were to figure out
where that hits the vertical axis that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440
where that hits the vertical axis that
 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.030
where that hits the vertical axis that
seems to hit the vertical axis that

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040
seems to hit the vertical axis that
 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.370
seems to hit the vertical axis that
seems to hit the vertical axis at around

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380
seems to hit the vertical axis at around
 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.090
seems to hit the vertical axis at around
I don't know my best guess is let's see

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100
I don't know my best guess is let's see
 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.040
I don't know my best guess is let's see
I should have sumed in more hits it

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050
I should have sumed in more hits it
 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.330
I should have sumed in more hits it
right about there

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340
right about there
 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.700
right about there
this is 22 and 1/2 so this looks like

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
this is 22 and 1/2 so this looks like
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.190
this is 22 and 1/2 so this looks like
maybe 20 and a half because this would

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200
maybe 20 and a half because this would
 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.700
maybe 20 and a half because this would
be maybe 20 and a half years maybe so

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710
be maybe 20 and a half years maybe so
 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.190
be maybe 20 and a half years maybe so
I'll call it twenty point five years

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200
I'll call it twenty point five years
 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.050
I'll call it twenty point five years
obviously I can't do it exact but you

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060
obviously I can't do it exact but you
 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.630
obviously I can't do it exact but you
get the idea I am interpolating I am I

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640
get the idea I am interpolating I am I
 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.730
get the idea I am interpolating I am I
am looking at well I'm here I'm using

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740
am looking at well I'm here I'm using
 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.980
am looking at well I'm here I'm using
the model to do it I won't use

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990
the model to do it I won't use
 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.630
the model to do it I won't use
necessarily the word interpolation yet

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640
necessarily the word interpolation yet
 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.279
necessarily the word interpolation yet
we're going to do it a much more direct

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289
we're going to do it a much more direct
 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.980
we're going to do it a much more direct
form of interpolation and then later on

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990
form of interpolation and then later on
 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.260
form of interpolation and then later on
in this video but here I fit a line and

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270
in this video but here I fit a line and
 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.600
in this video but here I fit a line and
then I just used that line as a model to

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610
then I just used that line as a model to
 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.930
then I just used that line as a model to
estimate when what was the median age of

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940
estimate when what was the median age of
 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.550
estimate when what was the median age of
women in 1946 let's do Part two use the

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560
women in 1946 let's do Part two use the
 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.230
women in 1946 let's do Part two use the
data from example one to estimate the

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240
data from example one to estimate the
 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.529
data from example one to estimate the
age at marriage for females in 1984 fit

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:13.539
age at marriage for females in 1984 fit
 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.170
age at marriage for females in 1984 fit
a line by hand to the data from 1970 on

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180
a line by hand to the data from 1970 on
 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.300
a line by hand to the data from 1970 on
in order to fit estimate this accurately

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
in order to fit estimate this accurately
 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.070
in order to fit estimate this accurately
so now they want us to fit a line from

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080
so now they want us to fit a line from
 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.440
so now they want us to fit a line from
this data on so let me make a line so

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450
this data on so let me make a line so
 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.490
this data on so let me make a line so
fit a line by hand from the data 1970 on

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500
fit a line by hand from the data 1970 on
 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.290
fit a line by hand from the data 1970 on
so let me try to draw a line that gets

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300
so let me try to draw a line that gets
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.629
so let me try to draw a line that gets
close to all of these points it gets

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639
close to all of these points it gets
 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.340
close to all of these points it gets
close to describing all of these points

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350
close to describing all of these points
 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.070
close to describing all of these points
maybe it looks like something like that

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080
maybe it looks like something like that
 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.110
maybe it looks like something like that
not all of them sit exactly on the line

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120
not all of them sit exactly on the line
 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.750
not all of them sit exactly on the line
but they're all pretty close and if we

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760
but they're all pretty close and if we
 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.670
but they're all pretty close and if we
assume that the

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680
assume that the
 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.439
assume that the
is a good linear model I haven't done it

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449
is a good linear model I haven't done it
 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.360
is a good linear model I haven't done it
mathematically I'm just doing I'm

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370
mathematically I'm just doing I'm
 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.400
mathematically I'm just doing I'm
eyeballing it let's see what it would be

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410
eyeballing it let's see what it would be
 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:52.550
eyeballing it let's see what it would be
in 1984 this is 1990 so 1984 is going to

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560
in 1984 this is 1990 so 1984 is going to
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.210
in 1984 this is 1990 so 1984 is going to
be right around right around there so

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220
be right around right around there so
 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.969
be right around right around there so
that looks it looks actually it looks

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979
that looks it looks actually it looks
 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:02.090
that looks it looks actually it looks
amazingly similar to the median age of

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100
amazingly similar to the median age of
 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.420
amazingly similar to the median age of
men in 1970 so we can actually get the

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430
men in 1970 so we can actually get the
 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.210
men in 1970 so we can actually get the
exact number it's about 23 point two so

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220
exact number it's about 23 point two so
 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.279
exact number it's about 23 point two so
this looks to be about twenty three

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289
this looks to be about twenty three
 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:13.850
this looks to be about twenty three
point two twenty three point two years

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860
point two twenty three point two years
 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.370
point two twenty three point two years
now part three use the data from example

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380
now part three use the data from example
 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.640
now part three use the data from example
one to estimate the age at marriage for

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.650
one to estimate the age at marriage for
 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.219
one to estimate the age at marriage for
males and nineteen ninety five use

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:22.229
males and nineteen ninety five use
 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:23.749
males and nineteen ninety five use
linear interpolation now we're going to

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759
linear interpolation now we're going to
 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.550
linear interpolation now we're going to
do a more direct form of interpolation

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560
do a more direct form of interpolation
 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.110
do a more direct form of interpolation
we're not going to use a linear model or

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120
we're not going to use a linear model or
 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.670
we're not going to use a linear model or
we're not going to fit a line we're use

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680
we're not going to fit a line we're use
 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.499
we're not going to fit a line we're use
linear interpolation between 1990 and

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:33.509
linear interpolation between 1990 and
 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:35.990
linear interpolation between 1990 and
2000 data points so we're looking at men

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000
2000 data points so we're looking at men
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.350
2000 data points so we're looking at men
now so I'll do it in blue between 1990

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360
now so I'll do it in blue between 1990
 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.249
now so I'll do it in blue between 1990
that is 1990 and that is 2000 for men so

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259
that is 1990 and that is 2000 for men so
 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.370
that is 1990 and that is 2000 for men so
if I were to draw just a line there we

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380
if I were to draw just a line there we
 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.570
if I were to draw just a line there we
could assume that the trend would have

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580
could assume that the trend would have
 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.879
could assume that the trend would have
looked something like that between 1990

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:49.889
looked something like that between 1990
 

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:52.430
looked something like that between 1990
and 2000 and they want us to interpolate

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440
and 2000 and they want us to interpolate
 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.029
and 2000 and they want us to interpolate
what happened in 1995 so 1995 is that

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039
what happened in 1995 so 1995 is that
 

00:07:56.039 --> 00:07:58.250
what happened in 1995 so 1995 is that
point right there so this is pure

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.260
point right there so this is pure
 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.680
point right there so this is pure
interpolation we're using the data point

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:00.690
interpolation we're using the data point
 

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.350
interpolation we're using the data point
in 1990 and the data point in 2000

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360
in 1990 and the data point in 2000
 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.960
in 1990 and the data point in 2000
drawing a line between them and assuming

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:05.970
drawing a line between them and assuming
 

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.330
drawing a line between them and assuming
that 1995 would have been right in

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:08.340
that 1995 would have been right in
 

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.310
that 1995 would have been right in
between them we are interpolating

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.320
between them we are interpolating
 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.790
between them we are interpolating
between the 1990 data and the 2000 data

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800
between the 1990 data and the 2000 data
 

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.570
between the 1990 data and the 2000 data
so if you were to if you were to try to

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580
so if you were to if you were to try to
 

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.430
so if you were to if you were to try to
estimate where that is it looks like

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440
estimate where that is it looks like
 

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.060
estimate where that is it looks like
it's a little bit over 26 and actually

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:23.070
it's a little bit over 26 and actually
 

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.560
it's a little bit over 26 and actually
if we say that it's right in between

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.570
if we say that it's right in between
 

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.230
if we say that it's right in between
these two values right there it'll be

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
these two values right there it'll be
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.270
these two values right there it'll be
twenty six point four or five years

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280
twenty six point four or five years
 

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.600
twenty six point four or five years
twenty six point four five years if it's

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610
twenty six point four five years if it's
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.600
twenty six point four five years if it's
exactly in between 1995 is exactly 5

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:35.610
exactly in between 1995 is exactly 5
 

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.940
exactly in between 1995 is exactly 5
years from each so twenty six point four

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:37.950
years from each so twenty six point four
 

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.459
years from each so twenty six point four
five looks pretty good now let's do

00:08:40.459 --> 00:08:40.469
five looks pretty good now let's do
 

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:43.100
five looks pretty good now let's do
another example so here's a percentage

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.110
another example so here's a percentage
 

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.380
another example so here's a percentage
of women smokers by year and yeah I have

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:45.390
of women smokers by year and yeah I have
 

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.210
of women smokers by year and yeah I have
to say these charts are interesting in

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220
to say these charts are interesting in
 

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.340
to say these charts are interesting in
and of themselves you know notice in

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:49.350
and of themselves you know notice in
 

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.220
and of themselves you know notice in
1990 there were a good number of women

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:52.230
1990 there were a good number of women
 

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.230
1990 there were a good number of women
who are pregnant who smoked

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240
who are pregnant who smoked
 

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.840
who are pregnant who smoked
now almost what 18 or 19 percent of

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:56.850
now almost what 18 or 19 percent of
 

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.410
now almost what 18 or 19 percent of
pregnant women smoked in 1990 and now

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:00.420
pregnant women smoked in 1990 and now
 

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.509
pregnant women smoked in 1990 and now
that's down well this is 2004 so

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519
that's down well this is 2004 so
 

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:04.309
that's down well this is 2004 so
hopefully that trend this trend is

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:04.319
hopefully that trend this trend is
 

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:06.259
hopefully that trend this trend is
continuing to go down of entry to zero

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:06.269
continuing to go down of entry to zero
 

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:07.850
continuing to go down of entry to zero
percent but it went down to 10 percent

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860
percent but it went down to 10 percent
 

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.069
percent but it went down to 10 percent
so there still are a percentage of

00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079
so there still are a percentage of
 

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:12.530
so there still are a percentage of
pregnant women who for unfortunately

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:12.540
pregnant women who for unfortunately
 

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.319
pregnant women who for unfortunately
smoked so let's use let's do these

00:09:15.319 --> 00:09:15.329
smoked so let's use let's do these
 

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:17.269
smoked so let's use let's do these
problems use the data from example two

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279
problems use the data from example two
 

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:19.100
problems use the data from example two
that's this right here to estimate the

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.110
that's this right here to estimate the
 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.809
that's this right here to estimate the
percentage of pregnant smokers

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:20.819
percentage of pregnant smokers
 

00:09:20.819 --> 00:09:23.449
percentage of pregnant smokers
in 1997 use linear interpolation between

00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:23.459
in 1997 use linear interpolation between
 

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:29.150
in 1997 use linear interpolation between
the 1996 and 2000 data so 1996 and 2000

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160
the 1996 and 2000 data so 1996 and 2000
 

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.319
the 1996 and 2000 data so 1996 and 2000
data we're going to use linear

00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:30.329
data we're going to use linear
 

00:09:30.329 --> 00:09:33.799
data we're going to use linear
interpolation so let me draw a line now

00:09:33.799 --> 00:09:33.809
interpolation so let me draw a line now
 

00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:35.480
interpolation so let me draw a line now
and you could always do this much more

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:35.490
and you could always do this much more
 

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.400
and you could always do this much more
exact if you have better tools or a

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.410
exact if you have better tools or a
 

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.809
exact if you have better tools or a
spreadsheet but I'm going to draw a line

00:09:38.809 --> 00:09:38.819
spreadsheet but I'm going to draw a line
 

00:09:38.819 --> 00:09:46.220
spreadsheet but I'm going to draw a line
and I want to get 1997 so 1997 1997 1997

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:46.230
and I want to get 1997 so 1997 1997 1997
 

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.710
and I want to get 1997 so 1997 1997 1997
it's going to be right this is 1997 it's

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720
it's going to be right this is 1997 it's
 

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.619
it's going to be right this is 1997 it's
going to be right over there if we use

00:09:51.619 --> 00:09:51.629
going to be right over there if we use
 

00:09:51.629 --> 00:09:53.239
going to be right over there if we use
linear interpolation we are

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:53.249
linear interpolation we are
 

00:09:53.249 --> 00:09:54.619
linear interpolation we are
interpretating between that data point

00:09:54.619 --> 00:09:54.629
interpretating between that data point
 

00:09:54.629 --> 00:09:55.939
interpretating between that data point
and that data point it's a linear

00:09:55.939 --> 00:09:55.949
and that data point it's a linear
 

00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:57.590
and that data point it's a linear
interpolation we assume it's a linear

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600
interpolation we assume it's a linear
 

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.379
interpolation we assume it's a linear
trend between the two and so this looks

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:00.389
trend between the two and so this looks
 

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:03.109
trend between the two and so this looks
like it's let me go all the way over

00:10:03.109 --> 00:10:03.119
like it's let me go all the way over
 

00:10:03.119 --> 00:10:06.619
like it's let me go all the way over
here looks a little bit more than 12 and

00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:06.629
here looks a little bit more than 12 and
 

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:10.639
here looks a little bit more than 12 and
maybe 13 maybe 13 percent is my best

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:10.649
maybe 13 maybe 13 percent is my best
 

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:14.090
maybe 13 maybe 13 percent is my best
estimate now part 5 use the data from

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100
estimate now part 5 use the data from
 

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.100
estimate now part 5 use the data from
example 2 same example right here to

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:16.110
example 2 same example right here to
 

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:17.480
example 2 same example right here to
estimate the percentage of pregnant

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.490
estimate the percentage of pregnant
 

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.460
estimate the percentage of pregnant
smokers in 2006 there isn't any 2006

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:22.470
smokers in 2006 there isn't any 2006
 

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.069
smokers in 2006 there isn't any 2006
this chart ends at 2004 so we have to

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079
this chart ends at 2004 so we have to
 

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:28.489
this chart ends at 2004 so we have to
use linear extrapolation with the final

00:10:28.489 --> 00:10:28.499
use linear extrapolation with the final
 

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:29.749
use linear extrapolation with the final
two data points so this here you're

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:29.759
two data points so this here you're
 

00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:30.559
two data points so this here you're
going to see the difference we

00:10:30.559 --> 00:10:30.569
going to see the difference we
 

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:32.350
going to see the difference we
interpolate and an extrapolation

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360
interpolate and an extrapolation
 

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.160
interpolate and an extrapolation
interpolation you are estimating between

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.170
interpolation you are estimating between
 

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.369
interpolation you are estimating between
two data points that you are new

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:36.379
two data points that you are new
 

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:38.539
two data points that you are new
extrapolation we're going to take the

00:10:38.539 --> 00:10:38.549
extrapolation we're going to take the
 

00:10:38.549 --> 00:10:40.819
extrapolation we're going to take the
final two data points and we're going to

00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:40.829
final two data points and we're going to
 

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:42.109
final two data points and we're going to
continue that line we're going to

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:42.119
continue that line we're going to
 

00:10:42.119 --> 00:10:44.150
continue that line we're going to
extrapolate that line so if you were to

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160
extrapolate that line so if you were to
 

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.039
extrapolate that line so if you were to
just continue this line between the

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:46.049
just continue this line between the
 

00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:47.389
just continue this line between the
final two data points it might look

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399
final two data points it might look
 

00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.230
final two data points it might look
something like that

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240
something like that
 

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.530
something like that
so if you had 2006 out here these are

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540
so if you had 2006 out here these are
 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:57.049
so if you had 2006 out here these are
going up by two so 2004 2006 we

00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:57.059
going up by two so 2004 2006 we
 

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:00.590
going up by two so 2004 2006 we
extrapolate this line the percentage of

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600
extrapolate this line the percentage of
 

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.439
extrapolate this line the percentage of
women smoking might be well it looks a

00:11:03.439 --> 00:11:03.449
women smoking might be well it looks a
 

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:05.840
women smoking might be well it looks a
little bit it looks a little bit under

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:05.850
little bit it looks a little bit under
 

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.329
little bit it looks a little bit under
10% so maybe

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339
10% so maybe
 

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:10.639
10% so maybe
nine and a half percent once again it's

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:10.649
nine and a half percent once again it's
 

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:11.949
nine and a half percent once again it's
just an estimate but we're just

00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:11.959
just an estimate but we're just
 

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:13.670
just an estimate but we're just
extrapolating the trend we're assuming

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680
extrapolating the trend we're assuming
 

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.679
extrapolating the trend we're assuming
the trend of the last two data points

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:15.689
the trend of the last two data points
 

00:11:15.689 --> 00:11:17.749
the trend of the last two data points
continues and then using that it would

00:11:17.749 --> 00:11:17.759
continues and then using that it would
 

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:19.100
continues and then using that it would
be around nine and a half percent in

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:19.110
be around nine and a half percent in
 

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.949
be around nine and a half percent in
2006 now maybe you know that's not

00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959
2006 now maybe you know that's not
 

00:11:21.959 --> 00:11:24.350
2006 now maybe you know that's not
definite a definite the only prediction

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360
definite a definite the only prediction
 

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.999
definite a definite the only prediction
you could make you could do a Lin you

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:26.009
you could make you could do a Lin you
 

00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:27.650
you could make you could do a Lin you
could extrapolate based on all of the

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660
could extrapolate based on all of the
 

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.090
could extrapolate based on all of the
data and get a line that looks something

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100
data and get a line that looks something
 

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.220
data and get a line that looks something
let me try to do it a little bit better

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.230
let me try to do it a little bit better
 

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.670
let me try to do it a little bit better
than that that looks something like that

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680
than that that looks something like that
 

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.739
than that that looks something like that
and then this line would predict a lower

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:36.749
and then this line would predict a lower
 

00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:38.660
and then this line would predict a lower
smoking rate so it depends on what data

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:38.670
smoking rate so it depends on what data
 

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.069
smoking rate so it depends on what data
you use what you're using to do your

00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079
you use what you're using to do your
 

00:11:40.079 --> 00:11:41.989
you use what you're using to do your
linear model with and how you're

00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:41.999
linear model with and how you're
 

00:11:41.999 --> 00:11:43.340
linear model with and how you're
extrapolating it but anyway hopefully

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:43.350
extrapolating it but anyway hopefully
 

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.129
extrapolating it but anyway hopefully
you found this useful
