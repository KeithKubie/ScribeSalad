Hey, guys!

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.780
Welcome back thanks for joining us today on the king of random we've often done some chemistry experiments that are hard to do at home

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.960
Because it's hard to get your hands on the right chemicals or it's a little too dangerous

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.340
Well today we've got some experiments that are easy, and safe to do at home with

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.100
Chemicals that are very readily available all of the experiments, we'll do today will involve milk as a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.990
Main ingredient the first experiment we're

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.510
gonna
Try, involves milk and a bottle of cola all the milk is almost ph neutral some of the components in it react

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.079
Interestingly with the acids and bases found in other chemicals we're

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.000
Gonna, try pouring, some milk into one of these cola

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.919
Bottles and watch what happens as it reacts with the acid in the soda alright, we want to let?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.570
A little bit of the gas escape otherwise it's gonna overflow. And spill over also probably just pour out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.610
A little bit of the soda before we add our milk just to make more space and i have also shaken it up and slowly

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.829
Opened it to try and take out, some of the extra bubbles

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.308
Now i'll pour in the milk and we'll let it sit for a, while to watch what happens

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.620
It's gonna react and hopefully not overflow

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.800
That's one of the, main reasons i tried to get rid of some of the extra bubbles cuz

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.680
If i'd done that when it was new it probably would have just exploded everywhere

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.489
Wow that can be cool it's not what we're, going for today, oh?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.989
This is dangerous because if i don't hold it tight enough it's just gonna explode everywhere i think it's going to explode everywhere

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.910
oh

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.799
All right almost unscathed just got a little bit in there and mix this up a little bit

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.930
You can, already, see what's starting to happen

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.930
There's little flecks and bits visible floating around in the soda so now, we're just, gonna take this and we're gonna let

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.440
It sit for about 45 minutes and watch what happens to it

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.040
All right our bottle of coke, and milk has now been sitting for a little over an hour and you can

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.650
See how much it's weirdly separated out to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.639
Be honest i'm not sure what exactly the different components here are we've got some sort of

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.720
Bubbly, foam up at the top

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.720
And we've got this darker brown

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.010
Disgusting whatever it is down at the bottom and a clear liquid i mean it's clear

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.300
It's murky looks kind of like, swamp water but you can, see through it that's for sure

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.479
Alright let's open it up see what we've got inside

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.760
Well that's pretty interesting all the bubbles escaping our lifting some of the mix with it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.630
It still smells like cola

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.980
That looks really gross but i am gonna try a little bit of this should just be cola and milk but

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay, weirdly enough that actually just, still tastes like cola

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.030
Right this clear gross liquid it tastes like cola, still weird

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.849
Now we're gonna do an experiment that i learned way?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.459
Back in elementary school and i've always thought it looks really cool it involves using milk food coloring and a little bit of dish soap

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.950
The setup is very simple find a nice shallow. Pan or plate and fill it with, about half an inch of milk

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.190
After you filled your container with a shallow

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.329
Layer of milk take, your pick of food coloring and drop a few drops around

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.720
your

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.209
Milk now i have my container of dish soap and you can either drip it in just with single drops or if you have a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.599
Long bamboo skewer or something similar you can touch that into the soap and then touch it into the milk near the food coloring

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
boom

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.749
The, soap starts reacting with the milk and makes it spread out in these, weird smoke like patterns

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.819
And when it runs into the food coloring it spreads that out in its, own smoke, like patterns that run

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.819
across the surface of the milk

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.919
It's a really cool, swirling patterns doing this

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.750
Alright it's already kind of swirled up but i am gonna

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.529
Try, just dripping in a drop of soap and see if that does anything at. This point

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.079
Yes it does look at that it just flies, away

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.450
That's pretty fun let's try a couple different colors and do this again

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:22.229
so

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:28.049
What's happening here the soap lands on the milk but it doesn't mix into it it starts dissolving over the surface of the milk and

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.200
As it dissolves it spreads out into incredibly thin layers

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.399
the food coloring is less dense than the milk and so it tends to sit on the surface of it

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.220
So as the soap is moving around spreading out it pulls and pushes the food coloring, along with it the soap

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.229
Begins to bind to the fat in the milk, which

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.919
Is what makes it keep moving and swirling around even after it's been in the milk for a, while

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.830
Our next experiment

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.609
Is somewhat inspired by those videos you've probably seen of making elephant toothpaste

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.149
That's a combination of chemicals that sort of combines quickly and explodes out in this really thick dense foam what

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.079
We'll do isn't quite as explosive or rigid but it is impressively similar how

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.270
Thick, and fast it foams up the first step is to just pour about half cup. Of milk in each plastic

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:21.419
Cup, now, we have here some baking, soda, and some citric acid one is a fairly strong base and the other as its

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.250
Name implies is an acid if you

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.350
Want to buy citric acid it's usually sold with canning supplies in your grocery store this is a powdered

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.379
Crystalline acid this is the same stuff that makes lemons and limes sour you, may have experienced some point

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.339
Your life candy that's coated with, this stuff it's just a, white powder but it's extremely tart

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.020
Mmm yep

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920
If you, ever had warheads

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.759
This, is what's on the outside of them i'm going to add one tablespoon of baking?

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.999
Soda - 1 cup and 1 tablespoon of citric acid to the other

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.060
Citric acid into the milk

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.159
Stir up both of those and you can, see that i'm doing this on a cookie sheet because

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.619
when i add one of these milks to the other one

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.400
It's just gonna immediately turn into a foam that sprays up out of the cup, so here goes

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.050
Boom it erupts all over

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.979
and it's like a really thick foam -

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.909
It holds its shape pretty, well doesn't just collapse

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.270
Do that there you go

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.050
Nice thick milk foam i'm gonna taste it

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.030
mmm

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.710
Yeah, that's, gross it's like, a little bit sour because of the citric acid

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.550
But it also has like the baking, soda taste which is sort of oh i?

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.910
Know salty but?

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:04.369
If something can taste powdery then baking, soda tastes powdery i want to try that, again, but i'm gonna

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.970
Add food coloring to the milk before i combine them and see if we can get like a colored elephant toothpaste coming out of their

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.690
Home for a bright green sort of booze so i'm gonna, add some green to one side it's some yellow to the other

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.249
Baking, soda in one citric acid in the other

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.899
those together and

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.129
Colored milk foam eruption

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.929
Right and milk volcano in three two one hopefully ah

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.450
There you go!

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.330
That's a way better volcano than baking, soda and vinegar

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.349
Yeah, it slowly oozed off everything

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.320
Got like this nice red color down here

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.530
Milk lava

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.859
And now for one final experiment we'll show

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.170
You, how to take milk and vinegar and turn them into a form of plastic the first step is we want to take

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.839
About one cup of milk and heat it up on the stove you

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.930
Want to heat the milk up to a point

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.780
Where it's just barely too hot to touch don't let it boil

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.790
Once your milk is hot remove it from the heat and add four teaspoons of white vinegar

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.520
You, should be able to see the vinegar reacting with, the milk pretty much immediately as you

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.089
Stir the vinegar, it will very quickly start clumping into a disgusting mess

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.819
You can, see it separating out into clear liquid, and some white stringy stuff

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.679
Once it's mixed in and really separated pour your whole mixture through a strainer

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.849
This will separate out the clear liquid and the white goop

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:02.099
What you should be left with is a soft white substance that kind of looks like you squished up a marshmallow

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.599
You can, rinse this off with cool, water to make it easier to handle

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.060
Now this white mush is mostly made up of what's called milk casein one of the components in your milk

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:16.409
I'm just gonna squish it between a couple of paper towels to try and help and dry it off a little more

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.629
There you have it now this substance which right now is behaving sort of like a slightly crumbly

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:26.280
Clay, will eventually dry to become a fairly hard plastic it's

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:32.609
Also interesting when i first mixed this up i thought that it would smell terrible because it's basically made of vinegar and curdled

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.400
Milk but it really doesn't have much smell at all i'm, also, gonna taste it even though i think it might be gross

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:44.209
hmm

00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:46.209
kind of a gross texture

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.089
Like if you chewed up string cheese, and then spat it out it's

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:54.609
About like that texture but it really, doesn't taste like anything it doesn't taste like, milk it definitely doesn't taste like

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.610
Vinegar, it's just kind of

00:09:56.839 --> 00:10:01.089
There and try and form this into a triangle like the king of random symbol

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.750
to

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.909
Be honest i worked as a sculptor for a few years?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.469
This is not the nicest f to sculpt with but it is pretty neat that it's just made of milk and vinegar

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:12.188
I'm just gonna take this triangle i'm gonna put it up on the stealth shelf for a few

00:10:12.189 --> 00:10:14.589
Days, and we're just, gonna see what happens to it we've now

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:20.499
Let our vinegar and milk composite sit for several weeks and really let it dry out and holy cow

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.989
This, thing is just hard plastic at. This point you see if i can, use pliers and break it

00:10:29.689 --> 00:10:31.689
Yep, with pliers i can, break it

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.810
There we go?

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.959
Interesting it does have a little bit of variance of texture running through it looks like there's sort of an

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:50.469
Outside and then an inner core probably just where it dried faster and slower just see if you can, sand it with sandpaper

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:55.509
And sand it quite, well with the sandpaper in fact

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.480
It's surprisingly smooth

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.899
There's the rough side and then here's the side that we've sanded down

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.839
All right i was so curious, about, what i could

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:09.128
Do with this that i just grabbed the sandpaper and i carved it down into something of an arrowhead shape

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:13.209
It's not really, sharp it's it's angled but

00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:15.578
You'd never be worried, about cutting yourself with something like

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:18.128
this it holds its shape i suppose if that were on a

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:23.259
Stick and it were traveling fast enough it could, stab through something it is fairly lightweight, so i'm not sure how

00:11:23.259 --> 00:11:31.209
Much weight it would be offering to your arrow to really guide it but you know it does shape pretty, well surprisingly, well actually

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:37.120
There you have it a few simple chemistry experiments that you can, do at home that use milk as the primary ingredient

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.129
we mix milk with, some cola in a

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:45.849
Soda bottle and watched it separated into this murky clear liquid, and then this brown muddy looking sludge down at the bottom

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.959
some food coloring

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:51.578
And dish soap dripped onto the surface of the milk gives us some amazing. Swirling patterns as the

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.780
dissolves onto the surface of the milk and pushes the food color and all around it when we mix citric acid and baking soda in

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.760
Cups of milk and then combine the two, we get a?

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.229
Quick rising thick, dense milk foam which sort of erupts out looks a lot

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.930
Like elephant toothpaste that effect is even cooler when you?

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:12.719
Add some food coloring to it might be a good experiment if you ever need to make yourself a science fair volcano when

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.940
We combine warm milk with, white vinegar some of the components of the milk separate, and we're able to strain out the milk casein

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.900
Which is sort of like a?

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.190
Gummy, clay, that we can

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.830
Form into different shapes and then it dries out into a hard plastic if you've got any ideas of things you

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.520
Want to see us try with the milk and vinegar plastic let us know maybe, we'll try it out

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.209
Thanks, guys, for joining us for these experiments. Today and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.690
You're, not gonna put in a vacuum chamber

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.890
Nothing will happen it's solid plastic this is why you're not supposed to blow. Bubbles in your

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.890
Milk this is where your parents were afraid of?

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.499
Kind of reminds me of intestines you got like this

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.090
Hey, guys if you, want to catch up with some of the things i'm doing in my personal life, come follow

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.280
Me on instagram and twitter at the king of random i post stories and updates as often as i can and it's really the best

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.280
Way to connect with, me directly i'll see you there
