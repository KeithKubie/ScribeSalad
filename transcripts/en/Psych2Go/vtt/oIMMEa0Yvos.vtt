00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.080
Maintaining a long distance relationship
can be very challenging.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.780
Some people might not have the confidence to go for it

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.440
because they worry that it might not work out.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.000
However, if you and your partner are determined to overcome the struggles together,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.480
then your relationship can go stronger than ever.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.760
Are you wondering if you should commit to one?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.840
Here are five signs you are ready for a long distance relationship.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.100
One, you are not afraid of the future.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.600
Being in a long distance relationship
is often scary to couples,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.635
because they are afraid of 
what will happen in the future.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:39.895
Do you think being a part is only temporary?

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:42.865
That nothing will change
because that both of you value commitment?

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:45.065
Are you very sure about each other?

00:00:45.065 --> 00:00:48.000
If you answer "yes" to all the above, then it is very likely

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.200
that you will get a long distance relationship
with your partner.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.720
Felling confident and secure about what the future has to offer for the both of you,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.900
is what will help the two of you stay closed,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.000
despite the difference in miles or time zones.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.400
Two, you trust each other.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.795
There is no doubt that trust is very important
in a successful relationship.

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:11.000
But sometimes, it can be hard to trust someone due to anxiety, insecurity,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.600
and past of relationships
that ended because of infidelity.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.500
It's important to work these issues out first
before committing to someone again.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Honestly, open communication and understanding
one another are all key factors

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.400
that build strong trust between couples.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400
If you and your partner put time and effort
to fulfill all these needs,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.900
then there's a good chance that the two of you will succeed in a long distance relationship.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.815
Three, you have similar goals.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.940
For a long distance relationship to work out,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.540
both you and your partner have to be certain about
what you want in a relationship,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.300
as well as your goals in life.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.600
Often, relationships fall apart
because two people want different things in life.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.500
For example,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.800
one partner may want to start a family
and live in the suburbs,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.100
while the other dreams of living in the big city,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.660
and desires travelling over having kids.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.085
To make sure you and your partner
are on the same page,

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.980
it's important
to have this discussion with them regularly,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.120
to see if your outlook on kids, marriage, jobs,
and location preference

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.300
match up as the two of you go together.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.080
Four, you and your partner
are committed to one another.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.360
Do you and your partner
value commitment in a relationship?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.975
Are you attentive in invest
a lot of time and effort into the relationship?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.340
And do you take action
to express your commitment for one another?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.100
Commitment is what separate
serious relationships from casual dating,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.860
and long distance relationships require more of it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.320
because both partners
don't see each other as frequently.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.820
It's important to make sure you and your partner
build a solid relationship first

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
where compromise is frequently met

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.720
before going a long distance ground.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.980
Five, your relationship with your partner is a priority.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.900
Ask yourself honestly,
how important is your partner to you?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.400
The more you value your partner and vice versa,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.060
the more likely your relationship
will survive when it goes long distance.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.800
Here are some questions that can help both of you figure out if your relationship is a top priority.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.860
Do you respect and value
your partner's beliefs and opinions?

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.640
Do you remember the details they share with you?

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.180
And do you nurture your relationship consistently ?

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.340
Remember, a relationship is always a two-way street.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.160
In order for your relationship to survive,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.960
your partner has to be just as invested in it as you.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.540
Do you agree with these points?

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.860
