this is from 1860 to 1870 we zoom in
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.000
this is from 1860 to 1870 we zoom in
there and if we really zoom in on the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010

at least based on this timeline to start
catalyzing a whole chain reaction of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
catalyzing a whole chain reaction of
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549
catalyzing a whole chain reaction of

secession winter seven states in the
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.250
secession winter seven states in the
south secede and at this point did they

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
south secede and at this point did they
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.190
south secede and at this point did they
think that this is an act of war by

months that especially South Carolina he
 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.540
months that especially South Carolina he
he knew that I mean it was going to be

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550
he knew that I mean it was going to be
 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.610
he knew that I mean it was going to be

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610
their territory right from their point
 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.949
their territory right from their point
of view I mean you could also have just

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959
of view I mean you could also have just
 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.390
of view I mean you could also have just
said you know here are some hungry men

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400
said you know here are some hungry men
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
