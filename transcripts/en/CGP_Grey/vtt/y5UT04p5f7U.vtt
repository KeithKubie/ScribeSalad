00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.950
The story of the penny starts in the first
US Mint founded in 1792 which produced these

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.820
one-cent pieces along with other coins including
the Quarter, Dime, Half Dime and a mystery

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.600
coin that we'll get back to later.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.910
These pennies of the new republic were born
of 100% pure copper.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.230
But, two forces conspired to ensure this wouldn't
remain the case for long. The value of copper

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.890
went up and, because of inflation, the buying
power of the penny went down.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.010
This caused The Mint to reduce the amount
of copper in pennies, first from 100% to 95%,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.019
and then to only 5% copper and 95% zinc.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.190
Despite this debasement, in 2006 the value
of the metal in older pennies rose over 1

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.570
cent and suddenly they were worth more dead
than alive so people melted them to sell the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.780
raw copper for profit.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.280
In a rational, efficient world, the story
of the penny would have ended here with the

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.679
Government realizing that they weren't worth
Minting and happy that its citizens were removing

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:46.679
them from circulation.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.909
But, instead the Government made melting U.
S. coins illegal and continues to manufacture

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.390
4 million pennies each year.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.110
Which is idiotic as it costs the US Mint about
1.8 cents to make a each 1 cent penny.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.940
But, even if pennies were minted from something
more representative of their true value -- like

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.130
plastic or lint -- it wouldn't fix the fundamental
problem that pennies are bad for people and

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.130
the economy.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.130
Here's why:

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.450
The purpose of physical, cash money is to
make it easy to transact the everyday business

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.450
of buying stuff.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.729
A shopkeeper has stuff and you want that stuff.
Rather than bartering like savages for it,

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.680
you use cash as a medium of exchange.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.920
To get the price just right the cash must
be divisible into pieces so that you don't

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.920
overpay.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.219
But it isn't divided forever, because at some
point the value it represents is too small

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.260
to buy anything or bother with. Which brings
us back to the penny.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.409
In the olden days, pennies could actually
buy stuff, no more. Now, if you want to spend

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.560
pennies, you're going to have to put in some
effort.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.909
For example, try to pay for 20 bucks worth
of groceries with 2,000 pennies weighing 11

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.600
pounds and see how that works out.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.210
So you have to get rid of them by using exact
change.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.119
But, because the United States doesn't include
sales tax in prices -- unlike more civilized

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.090
countries -- and you can't multiply by 8.875%
in your head, you can't get your change ready

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.880
before you reach the register like a good
Samaritan would.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.390
The pennies you inevitably fiddle with after
discovering the true cost of your goods add

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.340
two seconds to each cash transaction on average
which is less than the value of your time,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.040
and the time of everyone behind you, which
is why most normal people don't bother messing

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.950
with change and the usual penny-counting culprits
are those with nothing better to occupy their

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
day.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.040
If you want to spend pennies without being
an inconsiderate jerk who wastes other peoples'

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.849
time perhaps you can find a machine that will
accept them.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.750
Good luck with that. Vending machines won't
take pennies, neither laundry machines or

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.459
toll booths or parking meters or anything
else -- because pennies aren't worth the time

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.690
and effort to count, store and transport them.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.849
In fact there is only one machine that takes
pennies: Coinstar -- a leach on the economy

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.319
that eats 10% of your money while providing
nothing in return except the ability to spend

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.890
cash that was already yours.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.180
The difficulty of spending pennies is why
they end up in jars, dead to the economy after

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.120
a short, useless life where they failed at
their only job, to facilitate exchange and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.799
instead did the exact opposite by being a
literal dead weight on every cash transaction.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:50.940
They must be eliminated.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.879
But, you might think, won't prices rise and
charities lose money without the penny?

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:55.879
No.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.380
New Zealand got rid of their 1 cent coin,
as did Oz. Finland and the Netherlands ditched

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.890
the 1 euro cent coin as well. Though that
might have been because of how absurdly small

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.250
and frustrating 1 euro cent is.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.640
These countries round to the nearest 5 cents
for cash transactions and none of them saw

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.090
prices rise or charitable donations drop.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.340
And anyway, the United States has already
gone through this process before without trouble.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.160
Remember the mystery coin from the beginning?
That was the half-cent. Seen one lately? Of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.590
course you haven't. It was discontinued in
1857 for being worth too little.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.299
But when the half-cent met its fate, it had
more buying power than today's dime so perhaps

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.409
the list of modern coins to kill could even
be larger.

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.580
There is one last, irrational problem with
getting rid of the penny.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.810
Everybody loves Lincoln -- well almost everyone.
After booting off Lady Liberty and the Chief,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.300
the US sure has Lincoln-ified the penny within
an inch of its life.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.260
But ditching the penny won't erase him from
history.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.900
Lincoln, and his monument, are still on the
5 dollar bill which isn't going away.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.269
And, even if you think it's unpatriotic or
disrespectful to retire Presidential coinage,

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.900
allow me to direct you to a little organization
known as the United States Military.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.780
Where, in overseas bases, they've already
abolished the penny by automatically rounding

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.360
to the nearest five cents.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.280
Sooner or later even the most ardent Lincoln
lovers will have to give up the penny: they

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.030
cost more to make than they're worth, they
waste peoples' time, they don't work as money,

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.920
and because of inflation they're less valuable
every year making all the other problems worse.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.250
Sorry Abe, but it's time to kill the penny.
