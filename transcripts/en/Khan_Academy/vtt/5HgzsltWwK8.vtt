00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's think about what type of
reaction we might be able to

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.080
get going if we had
some methane and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.060
some molecular chlorine.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.270
So if we just let this be and we
didn't heat it up or put in

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.300
any UV light into this reaction,
pretty much nothing

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.860
will happen.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.260
Both of these molecules are
reasonably happy being

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.100
the way they are.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.680
But if we were to add heat into
it, if we were to start

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.200
making all the atoms and
molecules vibrate more and

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.090
bump into each other more, or
we were to add energy in the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.710
form of UV light, what we could
start doing is breaking

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.140
some of these chlorine-chlorine
bonds.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.650
Out of all of the bonds here,
those are the weakest. That

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.460
would be the most susceptible
to breakage.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.780
So let's say we were to add some
heat, what would happen?

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.230
So let's see.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.620
Let me draw the valence
electrons of

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.830
each of these chlorines.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.390
This chlorine has one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.040
valence electrons, and this
chlorine over here has one,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.720
two, three, four, five, six,
seven valence electrons.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.520
Now, when you add heat to this
reaction, enough for these

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.050
guys to vibrant away from each
other, for this bond to break,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.740
what's going to happen, and we
haven't drawn an arrow like

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.430
this just yet, but what's going
to happen is that each

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.590
of these chlorines, this
bond is going to break.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.730
Each of these chlorines are just
going to take their part

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.510
of the bond.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.530
So this guy on the
left, he's just

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.645
going to take his electron.

00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:28.900
And notice, I draw it with
this half arrow.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.895
It looks like a fish hook.

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:31.410
It's just half an arrowhead.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.650
This means that this electron
is just going to go back to

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.480
this chlorine, and this other
magenta electron is going to

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.720
go back to the right chlorine,
so we can draw it like that.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.630
If it was up to me, I would have
drawn it more like this.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.610
I would have drawn it more like
this to show that that

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.600
electron just goes back to the
chlorine, but the convention

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.010
shows that you can show that
half of the bond is going back

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.560
to the entire atom.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.530
Now, after this happens, what
will everything look like?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.610
Well, we're still going to
have our methane here.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.460
It hasn't really reacted.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.800
So we still have our methane.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.580
Let me draw it a little bit.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.670
So we still have our
methane here.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.090
And all that's happened is,
because we've put energy into

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.190
the system, we've been able
to break this bond.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.390
The molecular chlorine has
broken up into two chlorine

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.750
atoms. So we have the one on the
left over here, and then

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.670
we have the one on the right.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.940
And let me draw the left's
valence electrons.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.510
It has one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.130
I just flipped it over so that
the lone electron is on the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.810
left-hand side right here.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.860
And then you have the
guy on the right.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.290
He has one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.820
seven valence electrons.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.890
Now that each of these guys
have an unpaired electron,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.820
they're actually very,
very, very reactive.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.610
And we actually call any
molecule that has an unpaired

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.470
electron and is very reactive
a free radical.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.810
So both of these guys now
are free radicals.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.550
And actually, the whole
topic of this video is

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.410
free radical reactions.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.920
Both of these guys are
free radicals.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.860
And you've probably heard the
word free radical before.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.240
In the context of nutrition,
that you don't want free

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.590
radicals running around.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.140
And it's the exact same idea.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.460
It's not necessarily chlorine
that they're talking about,

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.980
but they're talking about
molecules that

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.470
have unpaired electrons.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.150
They'll react with some of your
cell's machinery, maybe

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.320
even with your DNA, maybe cause
mutations that might

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.730
lead to things like cancer.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.930
So that's why people think you
shouldn't have free radicals

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.770
in your body.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.470
But as soon as we form these
free radicals, in this step

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.700
right here, where we put energy
in the system to break

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.520
this bond, we call this
the initiation step.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.110
Let me put this.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.510
We used energy here.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.000
This was endothermic.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.790
We use energy.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.200
This right here is the
initiation step.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.350
And what we're going to see in
general with free radical

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.460
reactions is you need some
energy to get it started.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.250
But once it gets started,
it kind of

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.490
starts this chain reaction.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.140
And as one free radical reacts
with something else, it

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.470
creates another free radical,
and that keeps propagating

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.240
until really everything
has reacted.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.420
And that's why these can be
so dangerous or so bad for

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.860
biological systems.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.329
So I've told you that
they react a lot.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.089
So how will they react now?

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.080
Well, this guy wants to form
a pair with someone else.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.370
And maybe if he swipes by this
methane in just the right way,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.430
with just enough energy, what
will happen is he could take

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.220
the hydrogen off of the carbon,
and not just the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.710
proton, the entire hydrogen.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.660
He will form a bond with the
hydrogen using the hydrogen's

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.840
electrons, so they'll
get together and

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.790
they'll form a bond.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.900
The hydrogen will contribute
one electron.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.610
Notice, I'm drawing the
half-arrow again, so the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.160
hydrogen isn't giving away the
electron to someone else.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.240
That would be a full arrow.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.790
The hydrogen is just
contributing its electron to

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.050
half of a bond.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.270
And then the carbon, the carbon
would do the same.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.070
I'll do that in blue.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.960
So the carbon, this valence
electron right here, could be

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.900
contributed to half of a bond,
and then they will bond, and

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.190
this bond over here
will break.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.140
And so the carbon over here on
the left, this carbon over

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.050
here will take back
its electron.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.960
So what does it look like?

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.990
What does everything look
like after that's done?

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.780
So our methane now, it's
no longer methane.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.240
It is now, if you think
about it-- so

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.520
we have three hydrogens.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.460
It took its electron back.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.060
It is now a free radical.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.270
It now has an unpaired
reactive electron.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.506
The hydrogen and this chlorine
have bonded.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.700
So let me draw the chlorine.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.000
It has this electron
right over here.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.375
It has the other six valence
electrons: one, two, three,

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.030
four, five, six.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.630
And we have the hydrogen with
its pink electron that it's

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.930
contributing to the bond.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.540
And so we have them
bonded now.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.470
This chlorine is no longer a
free radical, although this

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.820
one out here is still
a free radical.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.020
Let me copy and paste it.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.450
So it's hanging around.

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.950
Copy and paste.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.940
And now, notice we had one free
radical react, but it

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.410
formed another free radical.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.450
That's why we call this
a propagation step.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.920
So this right here is
a propagation step.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.980
When one free radical
reacts, it created

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.440
another free radical.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.620
Now, what's that free radical
likely to do?

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.310
You might be tempted to say,
hey, it's going to just react

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.570
with that other chlorine,
but think about it.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.720
These molecules, there's a
gazillion of them in this

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.900
solution, so the odds that
this guy's going to react

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.430
exactly with that other free
radical is actually very low,

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.330
especially early on in the
reaction where most of the

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.720
molecules are still either
methane or molecular chlorine.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.690
So this guy is much more likely
to bump into another

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.740
molecular chlorine than he is
to bump into one of these

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.290
original free radicals
that formed.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.170
So if he bumps into another
molecular chlorine in just the

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.750
right way-- so let me draw
another molecular chlorine.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.760
So that's another molecular
chlorine.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.140
And each of these one, two,
three, four, five six, seven;

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.290
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.760
There is a bond here.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.715
If they bump in just the right
way, this chlorine electron

00:07:28.715 --> 00:07:33.220
might get contributed, and this
free unpaired electron

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:39.760
will be contributed and then
this CH3, I guess we could

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.650
call it, this free radical, this
carbon free radical, or

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.700
this methyl free radical,
will then form a

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.070
bond with this chlorine.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.800
What's everything going to
look like after that?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.080
Well, after that happens this
is now bonded to a chlorine.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.870
It's now chloromethane.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.530
Let me draw it.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.540
So it's carbon, hydrogen,
hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.040
Now, it's bonded
to a chlorine.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.050
Let me draw the electrons
so we can keep track of

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.840
everything.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.950
We have that magenta electron
right over there.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.190
And then we have the chlorine
with its one, two, three,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.470
four, five, six, seven
valence electrons.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.080
They are now bonded.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.570
This is chloromethane.

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.520
And now you have another free
radical because this guy-- and

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.810
I should have drawn it there.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.270
This guy, that bond
was broken, so he

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.870
gets back his electrons.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.340
So he's sitting over here.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.900
He is now a free radical.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.510
So this is another
propagation step.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.190
And we still have that original
free radical guy

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.150
sitting out over here.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.880
So we keep forming more
and more free

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.840
radicals as this happens.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.870
Now, eventually we're going to
start running out of methanes

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.120
and we're going to start
running out of

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.650
the molecular chlorines.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.900
So they're going to be less
likely to react and you're

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.840
actually going to have more
free radicals around.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.470
So once the concentration of
free radicals gets high

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.460
enough, then you might
start to see them

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.930
reacting with each other.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.040
So when the concentration of
free radicals get high enough,

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.480
you might see, instead of this
step happening-- this will

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.410
happen a long time until most
of the free radicals or most

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.010
of the non-free radicals
disappear.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.980
But once we have a soup of
mainly free radicals, you'll

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.310
see things like this.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:31.160
You'll see the methyl
free radical.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.490
So let me draw it like this.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.190
You'll see him maybe reacting
with another methyl free

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:46.830
radical, where they
both contribute an

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.340
electron to form a bond.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.250
And then, once the bond forms,
you have ethane.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.800
I could just write
as CH3, H3C.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.200
So you might have something
like this.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.260
And so this type of a step where
two free radicals kind

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.750
of cancel each other out, this
is a termination step because

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.870
it's starting to lower the
concentration of free radicals

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.160
in the solution, but this is
only once the concentration of

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.610
free radicals becomes
really high.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.090
You might also see some of the
chlorines cancel out with each

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.810
other again, so a chlorine
free radical and another

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.840
chlorine free radical.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.030
I'll only draw the unpaired
electron.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.000
They can bond with each
other and form

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.440
molecular chlorine again.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.510
That again is a termination
step.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.480
Or you could see something like
the methyl free radical.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.400
Just for shorthand, I'll write
it like this: H3C.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.030
The methyl free radical and a
chlorine free radical might

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.050
also just straight-up react and
form chloromethane, And

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.200
form H3C-Cl.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.780
So this will all happen once
the concentration of free

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.510
radicals gets really high.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.590
Now, another thing that might
happen once this reaction

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.520
proceeds, and we have a lot of
the propagation steps, is that

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.880
you might have a situation
where you already have a

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.730
chloromethane, so it
looks like this.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.600
You already have a
chloromethane.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.830
And once you have enough of
these, it then becomes more

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:21.510
likely that some free radical
chlorine might be able to

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.130
react with this thing, so it
might actually add another

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.030
chlorine to this molecule.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.440
And the way it would do it, this
chlorine over here-- I'm

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.300
just drawing the free
electron pairs.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.760
It would form a bond with this
hydrogen right over there.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.920
They would both contribute
their electrons.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.770
And then the carbon would
take back its electron.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.960
Notice, all of the
half-arrows.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.830
You'd be left with-- the
hydrogen and the chlorine

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.000
would have bonded.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.250
And now, this guy's going to
be a free radical, but he's

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.300
going to be a chlorinated
free radical.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.560
So it's going to
look like this.

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:07.150
He has a free electron over
there: hydrogen, hydrogen.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.180
And then he might be
able to react with

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.720
another chlorine molecule.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.200
He contributes an electron.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.510
Maybe this guy contributes
an electron.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.550
This guy-- I don't want to
draw a full arrow-- he

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.170
contributes an electron to a
bond, and then this guy takes

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.880
his electron back and becomes
a free radical.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.040
And then we're left with what?

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:37.950
We're left with a doubly
chlorinated methane.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.750
So then we have Cl,
Cl, and then a

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.510
hydrogen and a hydrogen.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.570
And this could actually
keep happening.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.670
As the concentration of these
get higher, then it becomes

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.810
more likely that this can react
with another chlorine.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.890
Of course, this chlorine
over here becomes

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.630
another free radical.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.600
But the general idea here that
I wanted to show you is that

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.590
once a free radical reaction
starts-- the first step

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.520
requires some energy to break
this chlorine-chlorine bond,

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.570
but once it happens, these guys
are highly reactive, will

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.170
start reacting with other
things, and as they react with

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.630
other things, it causes more and
more free radicals, so it

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.290
starts this chain reaction.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.940
And actually, all in all, this
required energy to occur.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.520
This step right here, this
propagation step, it requires

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.640
a little bit of energy, but
it's almost neutral.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:24.150
It requires energy to break
this bond, but it creates

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.870
energy when this
bond is formed.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.130
It still requires a
little net energy.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.810
And then things like this start
to become exothermic.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.990
And especially once you start
getting to the termination

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.760
steps, you start releasing
a lot of energy.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.060
So actually, all in all, this
reaction is actually going to

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.100
release energy, but it needed
some energy to get started.
