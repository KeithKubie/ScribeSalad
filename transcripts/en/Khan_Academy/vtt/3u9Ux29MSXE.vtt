00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
There is a half
an apple pie left.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.240
You want to eat twice what
your little brother eats,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.290
but you also need to save
a slice for your mom.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.630
You can cut her a slice
that is 30 degrees.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.630
What is the measure of your
piece of the pie in degrees?

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.030
So to tackle this, we just
have to remember a few things.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.580
We have to remember that
the degrees in a circle--

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.000
so if we were to go all
the way around a circle

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.070
that that would be 360 degrees.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.300
But we only have
half a pie here.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.870
And actually, let me draw
a little bit differently.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.050
So if we had a whole pie--
so if we started here,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.890
and we had a whole pie, we
went all the way around,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.000
that would be 360 degrees.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.780
But we only have a half pie.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.670
So we only have 180 degrees
and let me do that in a color

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.020
you're more likely to see.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.290
That's hard to see as well.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.461
We only have 180
degrees of pie left,

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:56.210
but let's just keep
that in mind and think

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
about how we're going to
split it between ourselves,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.790
our brother, and our mom.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.129
So let's define some variables.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.990
Let's let x be equal to the
degree measure of my brother's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.280
pie or your little
brother's pie.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.270
So this is degree
measure of brother's pie.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.390
And then what would the
amount of pie you eat be?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.340
Well, it says you eat twice
what your little brother eats.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.850
So 2x would be equal what
you eat, and it's really

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.130
the degree measure
of what you eat.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.760
And then how much
does your mom eat?

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.895
Well, it says you cut her
slice that is 30 degrees.

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:44.020
So your mom's going to get
a 30 degree slice, going

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.050
to get a slice of
something like that.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.260
So the amount that
your brother eats,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.750
x, plus the amount that you eat,
plus the amount that your mom

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.510
gets, plus 30 degrees, is going
to be equal to this half pie.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.840
And remember, all of
these are degree measures.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.600
So it's going to be
equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.290
And just to visualize
it over here,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.150
let me draw it down here
where it's easier to see it.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.980
We have half a pie that
we're dealing with.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.930
We're going to save 30
degrees for our mom.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.877
So that's 30 degrees
right over there.

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:21.585
Your brother is going
to eat some amount.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.152
So that is x.

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:28.110
And then you're going to
eat twice that amount.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.520
So that is 2x. x is the
measure of this angle,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.900
and then 2x is a
measure of that angle.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.560
So you see that 30
degrees plus x plus 2x,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.190
or x plus 2x plus
30 degrees, is going

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.970
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.080
Now, we can simplify this.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.890
If we have one of something and
then have another two of it,

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.590
how much do we have now?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.310
Well, I now have three x's.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.150
So 1x plus 2x is going to be 3x.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.390
So I have 3x plus 30 degrees
is going to be equal to,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.730
of course, 180 degrees.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.990
Now, to solve for x, we
can subtract 30 degrees

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.540
from both sides.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.530
So minus 30 degrees,
minus 30 degrees.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.980
And I could have just written--
I could have all assumed

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.790
that I'm doing it in degrees and
then just done it at the end.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.290
I keep writing it so I'll
just keep going with that.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.330
And then we are left
with 3x equaling

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.475
180 degrees minus 30 degrees
is equal to 150 degrees.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.270
And now we can just
divide both sides by 3,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.370
and we're left with x equaling
150 divided by 3 is 50 degrees.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.070
x is equal to 50 degrees.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.360
Now, we have to be careful.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.260
x is not what
they're asking for.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.980
They're asking for the
measure of your piece of pie

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.060
in degrees.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.350
x is the degree measure of
your brother's piece of pie.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.770
What you eat is 2 times that.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.600
So if x is 50
degrees, 2 times that

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.150
is going to be 100 degrees.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.580
So what is the measure of your
piece of the pie in degrees?

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.310
It is going to be 100 degrees.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.769
So if we draw our pie again,
if we draw our half pie,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.570
you have 30 degrees
for your mom.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.770
So that's 30 degrees
for your mom.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.690
You have 50 degrees
for your brother.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.350
And then you have twice that
for yourself, 100 degrees.
