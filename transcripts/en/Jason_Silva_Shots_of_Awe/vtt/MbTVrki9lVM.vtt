00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.300
SPEAKER: So, it used to be
that a sign of prosperity

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.290
was being given more choices.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.350
Freedom meant the
freedom to choose.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.840
But what happens when we become
victims of our own success?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.040
Nowadays, there's
so many signals

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.270
competing for our attention
that it's been said,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.430
if you don't have ADD today,
you're not paying attention.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.570
We're all kind of suffering
through this paralysis

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.720
of choice, this
bandwidth anxiety,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.370
this fractured attention
span, because we

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.480
go to the supermarket, and there
is just too much to pick from.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.130
There's too many options.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.810
We lack the RAM to process
all these possibilities.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.290
We experience, instead, the
angst of FOMO, the angst

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.870
that no matter what we
choose, we are missing out

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.120
on something else.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.400
And so the exhilaration,
the prosperity

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.580
of choice, the prosperity of
freedom has become oppressive.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.690
It's become the
paralysis of choice.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.450
And so what, then, is
the future of design?

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.550
What kind of new software
platforms and new interfaces

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.265
between self and the
world and what we consume

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.740
are we going to create
that don't overwhelm us,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.800
but that instead induce
flow, that reduce friction?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.120
The best technology
reduces friction,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.490
lets you achieve something,
and then gets out of the way.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.690
So I read an article
recently in "Fast Company"

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.300
that said that the future of
design is anticipatory choice.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.225
It's this notion that we're
going to offload decisions

00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:49.500
to algorithms that
are going to know us

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.790
better than we know ourselves.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.620
So that when we
walk upon the world,

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.400
options will be afforded to us
and offered to us only when it

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.150
intuitively makes sense.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.590
We will never be
bombarded by too much.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.290
Things will just open up
a garden of forking paths.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.050
Everything will be engaging
and delivered to us at a dosage

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.400
that we can process.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.757
It'll be like being in the
flow, where you're not really

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.620
lacking anything,
and the right thing

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.160
is served up to your frontal
lobe when useful and needed.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.180
But it'll never be running
around a crowded city,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.940
overwhelmed by FOMO
and dying from inside

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.000
because of the anxiety.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.040
So, I actually think that this
is going to kind of awesome.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.645
I mean, some people are scared
it's going to create idiocracy,

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:33.724
and we're all going to
be numbed into stupors.

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:35.100
But I don't think so.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.260
I think we're all going to be
hand delivered universes that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.540
extend our imaginations
to spaces and places

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.370
and virtualities we
cannot even imagine.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.547
I think the games are
going to get better.

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:48.380
And I think we're going
to offload ourselves

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.065
into the games.

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:51.510
We're going to live inside
of our imaginations,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.290
and things will be served up
to us as needed, when needed.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.310
And it'll be amazing.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.640
We're all going to be on
this amazing hero's journey,

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.970
and it's going to be great.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.690
We won't be weighed down
by RAM or stupid decisions.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.390
No stupid options
to choose from.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.840
