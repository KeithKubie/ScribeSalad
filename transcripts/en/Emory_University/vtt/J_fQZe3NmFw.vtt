00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.260
So essentially what we're seeing in this
report is the CDC documenting the back end

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.600
of a crisis that started many years ago.
So despite all of the new efforts in place,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.980
so many folks were exposed to
opioid therapy and entered into this

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.860
cycle of addiction and overdose, that
this report is essentially providing for us

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.680
statistics on the outcome of a
long-standing crisis.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.720
Going forward, we can interrupt the exposure of patients to opioids on the front end

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.300
by providing procedural alternatives -- for example -- and other ways to manage pain

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.700
so that folks don't have to take pills.
The other way to interrupt the inflow is

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.400
through something we call here at Emory the Emory Opioid Stewardship Council,

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.120
which tracks and educates physicians about using opioids only in particular conditions,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.480
in order to decrease the number of folks.
And then on the other side,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.480
we're working to rehabilitate people who have already been exposed to opioids

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.340
and entering into this cycle, 
using procedural options again,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.940
as well as psychological counseling.
