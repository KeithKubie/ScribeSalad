00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:07.840
JOHN BUTMAN: I've
always been fascinated

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.010
with the founding of America.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.210
I'm a New Englander.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.000
I live in Maine right now
but I lived in Massachusetts

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.540
for a long time.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.390
So maybe when you
live in New England,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.181
the founding of America
is something you're

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:23.040
supposed to be interested in.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.290
New England is where
it all began, right?

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.680
This is the home of the iconic
founders of America-- none

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.660
other than the famous Pilgrims.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.850
But even though
I've been fascinated

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.000
with the founding of America,
I have been less fascinated

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640
with the Pilgrim's story.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.800
I've actually always been
a little bit put off by it.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.980
There's something about it that
is not quite believable to me.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.660
A little too perfect, maybe
a little too sanctimonious

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.980
or something.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.896
Well, it turns out that I
was right about that story.

00:00:57.896 --> 00:00:59.270
There is something
wrong with it.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.164
In fact, virtually everything
is wrong with this story.

00:01:02.164 --> 00:01:04.330
The Pilgrims of course,
were not the first Europeans

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.100
to settle in America.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.150
They did not come here
for religious freedom,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.000
as we often-think.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.120
They came here, primarily,
for economic reasons--

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.930
for jobs.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.210
They were not
totally independent.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.909
They were funded by a
joint stock company.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.950
So they had investors,
they had to turn a profit,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.720
and they had a lot of debt.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.050
So I think this
particular founding myth

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.580
is due for a little rethink.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.080
And that's the
subject of our book

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.950
that I wrote with my
co-author, Simon Target.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.850
The reason for that is, I think
the real reason the accurate

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.870
version is more interesting.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.730
And I also think that it can
give us a useful perspective

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.570
on where we are right now.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.750
So let me give you the
thesis in a nutshell.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.870
The European founding of
America began some 70 years

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.280
before the Pilgrims
arrived on Cape Cod.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.760
It was driven, not
by the Pilgrims,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.090
but by an amazing group of
English businesspeople-- three

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.740
generations of them.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.550
Many of them knew each other.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.000
Many of them were related
over generations--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.370
father, son, grandson.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.620
And they teamed up with an
amazing bunch of people,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.520
including politicians,
intellectuals, writers,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.660
navigators, mariners, and
assorted other kinds of people.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.140
The purpose was primarily
profit, finding America.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.820
There was, of course, a
bit of idealism, glory,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.950
self-promotion, social purpose,
and national pride thrown

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.892
in but profit was number one.

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:30.850
So I like to put it this
way-- the simplest way

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.550
to think about it, to me,
is America was perhaps

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.280
the biggest, longest,
most complicated

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.710
business startup of all time.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.710
But the story's never
really been told that way.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.800
So that's the story I
want to tell you today.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.010
So it begins in
1515, not in 1620.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.300
Begins in England.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.250
At that time, England
was a very small player

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.110
on the margin of Europe.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.360
And we have to go back
to 1492 to understand

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.740
that after Columbus discovered
there was a lot of territory

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.890
that they didn't know about,
the Spain and Portugal were

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.810
the dominant powers and they
both wanted the New World.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.350
So to avoid conflict,
Pope Alexander VI

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.570
divided the world in half.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.410
The Treaty of Tordesillas, which
is this line that you see--

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.200
Where's my little button?

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.100
Here we go.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.790
--right there.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.850
So this line.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.380
Everything to the east was
given to Portugal to develop

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.590
and everything to
the west Spain got.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.690
Why the pope felt he
had authority to divide

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.170
the world is
another whole topic.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.290
So Spain quickly pushed into
the West Indies, Mexico,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.910
and South America.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.250
They plundered, they
extracted precious metals

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.380
at a ferocious rate.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.220
Portugal pioneered the largest
and richest market on Earth

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.690
at the time, which
was of course China.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.940
You see it right there,
it says Cathay, which

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.150
is how they talked about China.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.630
But England was in crisis mode.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.130
It was a time of great
political turmoil.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.929
They had a weak, 14-year-old
monarch named Edward VI.

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.470
And he was surrounded by lots
of counselors who were jostling

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.840
for position and power.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.850
There was tremendous
wealth disparity

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.790
which led to rioting in the
streets and in the fields.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.060
And business was terrible.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.120
England had one major
product, which was wool--

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.245
raw wool and woolen cloth.

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:30.860
And their major market
was continental Europe.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.920
But for many reasons
I can't go in to,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.360
the bottom fell out of the
cloth market in the 1550s.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.590
Demand fell, prices dropped,
business was terrible,

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.090
profits went down.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.610
The crown tried many
solutions none of them worked.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.580
England was in a really dire
economic situation, almost

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.040
an existential crisis.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.560
They needed a big solution
and the private sector

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.770
stepped up because the
crown could not do it.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.170
A group of merchants
started thinking very big.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.030
Their goal was to
boost the economy

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.950
and they hoped to
save the country.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.802
One of the key movers was
this fellow named John Dudley.

00:05:03.802 --> 00:05:05.260
And he assembled
a group of what he

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.140
called grave citizens, the
serious citizens as they

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.280
called themselves.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.421
And devised an audacious
solution to England's woes--

00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.170
they were going to
look beyond continental

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.010
Europe for a new market.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.220
A new place to sell their cloth.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.890
The first target
was the Far East.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.270
And that meant India.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.940
This is Calicut, which on
the West Coast, the Malabar

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.330
Coast of India, and it's
kind of the gateway to China.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.811
And then on to China.

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.560
There in China, they
were going to do what

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.600
the Portuguese had long done--

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.770
they would trade their cloth for
the fantastic and endless goods

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.210
that China offered.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.230
Mostly spices, which they used
for cooking and for medicine

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.140
and specialty cloth such as
silk, which England did not

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.930
make.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.055
They would bring them home
and they would sell them

00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:51.250
in to continental markets.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.470
This is my favorite
shot of Antwerp

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.700
at the time, which
was the biggest,

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.859
most bustling city in Europe
and a great marketplace.

00:05:58.859 --> 00:06:00.400
And they would
gradually, the English

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.850
would develop a Far East trade.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.430
But this was really
moonshot territory.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.820
They had no experience, the
English in trade on this level.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.890
They'd never been this far away.

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.750
They'd basically be
trudging back and forth

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.310
to the continent
with their cloth.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.430
The farthest away they traveled
was to Iceland and Ireland

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.540
to fish.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.410
And those were just
short haul voyages.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.400
And here we see fish
stuffed into fish.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.470
But they faced this
serious barrier

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.880
to entry-- the Tordesillas line
and the trade routes dominated

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.320
by the Portuguese
and the Spanish.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.950
So to pull off this
moonshot venture

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.910
they had to come up
with a new approach.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.090
They needed capital,
they needed organization,

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.510
they needed
knowledge, technology,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.820
they had to develop everything.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.700
So first, they invented a
new organizational form--

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.670
the joint-stock company.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.740
And it was perhaps the first in
the world, certainly the first

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.050
of its kind in England.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.070
And they gave it a
very handy name--

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.320
the Mysterie, Company,
and Fellowship

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.090
of Merchant Adventurers
for the Discovery

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.420
of Regions, Dominion's,
Islands, and Places Unknown.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.454
Fits easily on a business card.

00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:08.620
They called it the Mysterie.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.790
The Mysterie is
not quite as cool

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.123
a name as it sounds because
it actually means mastery as

00:07:12.123 --> 00:07:14.590
opposed to something secretive.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.390
They raised capital.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.700
Because the venture is
so risky and the return

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.920
was so uncertain,
no single investor

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.660
or even a group
of angel investors

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.060
could really come up with
the kind of cash they needed.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.830
And no insurance company
wanted to underwrite this.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.580
There were insurance
companies at the time

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.350
but no one was going
to underwrite this.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.190
So the Mysterie offered
shares at 25 pounds each,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.710
promoting the voyage as
a national enterprise.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.010
And 240 investors bought
in to this completely

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.590
high-risk, crazy idea raising
a total of 6,000 pounds.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.570
So then to figure
out how to get around

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.520
this problem of the trade
routes and the Portuguese

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.070
and the dividing
line, they brought

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.810
in the most famous
navigator of the day--

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.450
Sebastian Cabot.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.530
They essentially
poached him from Spain.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.600
He'd been working in
Spain for many years

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.460
as the head of the government
office that oversaw

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.850
all Spanish overseas activity.

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.250
Now, Cabot had a secret map.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.880
He was very proud of this.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.630
And it revealed an
improbable solution

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.390
to the problem of the
route to the Far East.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.450
Cabot told John Dudley and
his other Mysterie merchants

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.420
that they could
sail north and there

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.550
they would find
an open waterway.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.710
A passage that would take
them to China and they

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.440
could avoid encroaching on
the Spanish or the Portuguese.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.940
So they're all down here.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.130
They can either go east
or they could go west

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.740
and they would end up in China.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.030
Well, the merchants
bought this idea.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.960
No one had ever been
through the passage.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.370
They had no assurance
that it could be done.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.220
The problem was that the
English ships of the day

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.970
had no capacity to sail
that long that far north

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.565
in those difficult conditions.

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:02.140
It was very cold of course.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.790
This is actually a
little later ship--

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.880
that's Queen Elizabeth
sitting on the poop there.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.810
The poop deck.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.830
So they invested the capital,
the 6,000 pounds in building

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.396
three brand new ships.

00:09:13.396 --> 00:09:14.770
They had all the
latest features.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.320
They had all the latest
navigational instruments.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.050
And they had larger
capacity in the holds

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.450
to bring back all those
great Chinese goods.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.720
But they had very little
idea what they needed--

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.114
how to go about managing and
leading a venture like this.

00:09:29.114 --> 00:09:31.030
Because their leadership
models were basically

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.344
from the military
and from the court.

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:34.510
And this was very different.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.490
So they didn't know
what to choose.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:41.320
They chose one Hugh Willoughby
to lead this expedition.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.620
He had absolutely no
experience on the sea.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.690
And he was just
from a good family

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.480
and they thought he would be OK.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.010
The management was from
fishing expeditions,

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.604
which were again, short haul.

00:09:53.604 --> 00:09:55.270
But none of these
methods really applied

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:57.887
to this sort of blue sky,
blue ocean crazy adventure.

00:09:57.887 --> 00:10:00.220
So they engaged another fellow
named Richard Chancellor,

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.670
there's no picture of him.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.730
Who was just a
regular person but he

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.530
had experience as a navigator.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.460
So with Sebastian
Cabot's council

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.070
they put together a kind of
business plan, an employee

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.230
handbook, and
performance guidelines

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.310
and they called them ordinances.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.840
And this is the beginning
of the ordinances.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.142
So these were basically rules
for running this crazy venture.

00:10:26.142 --> 00:10:27.850
The first one I think
is really touching.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:31.320
It says that all ventures
should be quote, "Knit

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.470
and according in unity, love,
conformity and obedience."

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.205
Essentially teamwork.

00:10:37.205 --> 00:10:38.830
Another ordinance
directed them to keep

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.121
careful records of the voyage--

00:10:40.121 --> 00:10:42.460
write everything down.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.380
The beginning of the
learning organization.

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.080
The men were instructed
not to laugh or deride

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.470
any foreign people they might
meet, not to abuse women,

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:52.720
and not to resort to violence.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.640
So again, this is
sort of beginning

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.636
of respect for diversity,
which they were not used to.

00:10:57.636 --> 00:10:59.260
And then, perhaps
most important, Cabot

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.750
urged them never to give up.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:05.770
Never to give up until their
mission shall be accomplished

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.260
so far forth as
possibility and life of men

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.240
may serve or extend.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.090
So commitment perseverance
was important.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.550
Willingness to push
through failure.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.610
Now, I said profit
was not the only goal.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.730
It was a big one but you
know, it never really

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.220
is in any kind of
venture like this.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.250
The English merchants
had some idealism.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.960
They had a higher purpose, a
kind of vision, if you will.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.170
And given the mess of
English society at the time,

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:34.000
and the government
and the economy,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.220
the vision was pretty
big and idealistic-- it

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:38.590
was of a more perfect society.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:43.110
And it largely came
from a book, "Utopia."

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.630
So "Utopia" was published
originally in 1516 in Latin.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.130
But it came out-- was
published, especially again,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.240
this time in English
just as The Mysterie was

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.560
organizing this trip to China.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.040
Now, if you've read it recently
it's a pretty interesting book.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.270
I've read it a few times.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.370
It describes this
more perfect society

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.460
with quite a lot of detail.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.130
And in this society, men and
women are completely equal.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.490
Women could serve as soldiers,
they can serve as priests.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:16.480
No one is ever overworked,
six hours tops per day.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.400
That's all that's allowed.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.370
1/7 of all income
goes to the poor.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.377
Everyone has a voice in society.

00:12:23.377 --> 00:12:24.460
There's relative equality.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.310
There are no lawyers at all.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.330
War is frowned upon.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.810
And my favorite one is
before you get married,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.570
the partners are required
to get a good look at one

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.840
another naked.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.870
So the English kind of
translated the idea of "Utopia"

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.390
into a simpler idea, which
they called Commonwealth.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.820
So the fleet of three ships
set sail in 1553, May 20.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.680
And everybody
turned out to watch.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.080
This was a national occasion.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.020
But things did
not go as planned.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.210
The northern passage
could not be found.

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.305
The ships got separated.

00:13:04.305 --> 00:13:06.630
Two of the ships were lost.

00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:12.240
But one of the ships led by the
navigator, Richard Chancellor,

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.114
did get as far as the White Sea.

00:13:15.114 --> 00:13:17.280
So it's a little hard to
see because that map is not

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.060
very accurate.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:20.550
But basically they looped
over and got as far as that.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:24.080
They wanted to go there
but they couldn't.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.182
However, they left
the ship there.

00:13:26.182 --> 00:13:28.140
They negotiated with the
Russians on the ground

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.210
and they traveled to Moscow.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.760
This is how Moscow
looked at the time.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.880
And there they talked
their way into court.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.640
They had a letter from the
King and they got an audience

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:42.420
with Ivan VI, later known
as Ivan the Terrible.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.450
And basically they
negotiated terms with Ivan

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.420
and said, let's
open trade relations

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.550
between Russia and England.

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.230
And they did.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:55.360
And there had been no trade
between England and Russia

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.460
for 500 years.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.470
So it was not a big and
lucrative market, Russia,

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.370
but it gave the English
a lot of confidence

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.460
that we can get outside
continental Europe,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.610
and to help them be
flexible, to see failure

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.480
as learning not as
shame, and to pivot.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.800
So we can't get to China,
we'll go to Russia, that'll do.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:21.450
So now we skip ahead a
couple decades to 1575.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.310
There's a lot of stuff going on
that I can't obviously cover.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.851
Just going to give
you the highlights

00:14:25.851 --> 00:14:27.750
of the move towards America.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.060
Knowledge of the world was
improving at this time.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.280
Mapping was getting better.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.090
More was known about America.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:36.880
England was still struggling
with its business problems.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.390
So in that year another
company was set up

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.300
to try again for China,
called the Cathay Company.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:43.970
China.

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.470
It too was led by businessmen
and funded by them.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.570
Four merchants put
in seed funding.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.360
They got another 18
investors to put in money

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.440
and they engaged this fellow,
Martin Frobisher, as commander.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.920
He had a lot of
experience at sea

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.920
so they sort of learned
you need to put somebody

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.740
who knows what they're
doing, that has the skills

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.910
to run the voyage.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.720
Again, the plan was to
sail north for China

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.080
but this time they're
going to go Northwest.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.180
You can see, this
is America here.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.550
And these are all the islands.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.990
Here's Greenland
and here's Iceland.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:19.220
And there's Ireland and England.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.000
And they're going
to go through here

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.060
and find their way west
and then on to China.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.670
Plus, there was a new
wrinkle, which they added.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.260
And that was that
they thought let's

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.920
set up a little trading
post somewhere in America.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.140
And their idea
was that they knew

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:41.510
there were lots of Indians
in America and it was cold.

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.040
And they thought, we could
sell our nice woolen cloth

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.910
to Indians.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.340
They will need blankets.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.340
They will need clothing.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.010
They're probably cold.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:54.210
They also felt that
a post here could

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.920
be a good sort of stopping point
for ships going on to China

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.000
and they could service them.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.390
So after much
hardship, Frobisher

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.352
got as far as a little island.

00:16:05.352 --> 00:16:06.810
We're not exactly
sure where it was

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.060
but you can see right
there, Frobisher's Straits.

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.900
That's where he intended to
go, somewhere around here.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.510
And he was pretty certain
he'd identify the opening

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.180
to the Northwest Passage.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.890
But the crew was not happy.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:22.130
At this time, crews
are very badly paid.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.187
They did not invest
so they had no share.

00:16:25.187 --> 00:16:26.520
They had no stake in the action.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.957
Conditions on-board
ship were terrible.

00:16:28.957 --> 00:16:30.540
They had no decision
making authority.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:31.562
It was all top down.

00:16:31.562 --> 00:16:33.270
So all they could do
was threaten mutiny,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.100
which is exactly what they did.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:38.100
Frobisher though said,
I'm not returning home

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.410
without proof of how
far we've gotten.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.320
Because when you get back
home, you have to demonstrate.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.180
There's no photographs.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.980
So they had had a
number of engagements

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.750
with Indians, the Inuit.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:53.910
And they did what English began
to do with some regularity--

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.881
they captured one Inuit.

00:16:56.881 --> 00:16:58.380
This is one they
actually took later

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.088
but you can see this
is a woman and she's

00:17:00.088 --> 00:17:03.480
got her baby with her.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.210
They also picked up some rock.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.060
Now, why exactly
they picked up rock--

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.140
it's hard to say but they did.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.250
And this rock ended up
changing everything.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.040
The story goes that the
wife of one of the investors

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.960
threw some rock into the fire,
it started to glisten and glow.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.020
And they said, oh, my
god, we found gold.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.589
So word got out.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.960
Suddenly, there's a national
furor that we have found gold.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.930
Even Queen Elizabeth who was
naturally quite skeptical

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.690
about this kind of
venture got involved.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:39.450
She invested money
in a second voyage.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:42.280
And the English were
so excited about gold

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.550
because it was precious
metal that had helped

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.130
Spain transform themselves.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.860
They've been bringing back
mountains of gold and silver

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.140
from the New World since--

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.750
well, since 1545
was their big find.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.110
So if England could find
a gold mine in America,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.090
perhaps they could
really challenge Spain.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.140
And this is the gold mine that
Spain got most of their silver

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:07.220
from in Peru.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.540
They basically abandoned
the Northwest Passage idea

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.180
and the whole idea of setting
up a trading operation.

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:20.920
And merchants and
investors started

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.510
to put money into
a second voyage

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.540
to go bring back more rock.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.920
Two more voyages went out.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.910
Tons of rock were brought back.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.280
They brought in
specialist metallurgists.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.630
Metallurgy and assaying
was quite true to the time.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.170
And in the end, tons
of rock turned out

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.580
to be totally worthless.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:41.050
It was Fool's Gold.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.577
Investor's lost all their money.

00:18:43.577 --> 00:18:44.910
It was a national embarrassment.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.740
Spain was watching
and laughing at them.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.190
The rock ended up being used to
pave roads and to build walls.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.320
But the business community,
again based in London,

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.630
learned some valuable lessons.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:01.090
First, do not chase
the success of others.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.340
And they almost
completely abandoned

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.640
the idea of matching Spain
and finding precious metals

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.110
in America.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.450
They also realized that the
China plan was not working,

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.220
they wanted to get rid of that.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.880
And they had evidence that
America was very large

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.450
and had great resources.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.830
And one of the greatest
resource of all was land.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.200
So we leap ahead to 1583.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.170
And now the English
ventures to America

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.330
start to come a little faster.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.180
Sir Humphrey Gilbert is our
next featured character.

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.440
He had a particularly
audacious plan,

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.270
even more so than
sailing to China.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.170
He imagined a vast
American colony.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.680
Not just a trading post but
a sustainable, long-term

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.370
investment in infrastructure
and a business operation.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.230
He realized that
America probably

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.690
had millions of acres of land.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.240
Because they knew the position
of the East Coast and the West

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:55.510
Coast.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.885
They didn't know
exactly what was

00:19:56.885 --> 00:19:59.410
in between but they knew there
was a long way in between.

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:01.300
So Gilbert was
granted the rights

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.000
from Queen Elizabeth I
to discover and claim

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.250
new territories in
America and develop them

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.470
as he saw fit basically.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.450
He attracted many
investors by offering them

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:11.650
large parcels of land.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.380
In fact, he offered them as
many as three million acres

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.150
to invest.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.940
All of England only
contains 30 million acres.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.560
So three million acres sounds
like a pretty good deal.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.690
He formed another new company.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:27.580
Put together a
syndicate of investors

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.830
and he called it The
Merchant Adventures

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:34.240
With Humphrey Gilbert, which has
a little Las Vegas sound to me.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.890
He was something of
a dreamer though.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.780
And he had very
little experience

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.620
as a leader and no
skills as a commander.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.390
Indeed, Elizabeth, who
knew him very well,

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:44.890
begged him not to
go on this trip.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.530
She said, you are not
of good hap by sea.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.300
You're not good on the ocean.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.300
But he set sail anyway
with five ships.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.420
In 1533 he hit very bad
weather and he ended up

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.870
in Newfoundland, which is
not where he planned to go.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.100
So he goes here and
he ends up over here.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.140
But he said, fine.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.910
It's an international
fishing ground.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.640
He claimed Newfoundland
for England.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.300
You can imagine he's
going ashore and saying

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.580
this is our land now.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.730
And there are fishermen
from all around the world.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.390
He also declared to them that
anybody fishing in Newfoundland

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.470
would have to pay England a duty
on all the fish that they took.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:26.740
The fishermen all agreed
knowing that this was completely

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.450
unenforceable, which it was.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.950
Gilbert then sailed south
heading for America.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.930
Hit another storm and
he sank and he drowned.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.900
And that was the end
of that adventure.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.130
However, although he
failed almost completely,

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.590
he fundamentally changed
the English approach

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.270
to New World commerce.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:50.590
So in 1585, after
Gilbert's death,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.080
Elizabeth transferred the
American development rights

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:56.130
to Sir Walter Raleigh, the
well-known Sir Walter Raleigh.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.660
And he carried on
with Gilbert's idea.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.230
He realized that to create a
sustainable, long-term, on-site

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.350
business venture they needed
the full range of human skills.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:06.850
They needed all the crafts.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:07.730
They needed women.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.604
They needed families.

00:22:08.604 --> 00:22:11.170
They needed the community--
diversity of talent.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:12.836
This is the first
time they've really

00:22:12.836 --> 00:22:13.960
started to think this way--

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.356
Commonwealth.

00:22:15.356 --> 00:22:17.230
He also realized that
the settlers would have

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.780
to own property themselves.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.500
They had to have a
stake in the action.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.717
They had to have skin
in the game themselves.

00:22:22.717 --> 00:22:23.800
So the plan was very good.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.680
The execution was not so good.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.260
They chose a very poor site--
a swampy island called Roanoke

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.350
just off the coast
of North Carolina.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.930
Although they struggled
on for five years

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.870
with three resupplies,
it never took off.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.960
And finally in 1580, the
colonists disappeared.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.220
We still don't know
what happened to them.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.350
Now, while the English ventures
were learning all this stuff

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.410
about leadership
and management they

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:54.350
were also learning about
one other business activity.

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.847
And that is marketing.

00:22:55.847 --> 00:22:57.430
They realized they
needed to reach out

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.530
beyond the group
of just investors.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.520
They wanted a broad
base of support

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.960
and they needed a
really great story.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.880
So they began with
their own adventure.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.330
They actually took a water
colorist, named John White,

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.090
with them and he
made a whole series

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.840
of beautiful paintings of Indian
life and of the territory.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.860
This is an Indian village.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.810
They brought them back
and published them.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:26.770
And English people thought,
this looks pretty nice.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.174
America could be OK.

00:23:28.174 --> 00:23:30.340
And there are many images
of the Indians themselves.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.660
And they thought, oh, it's
just a family having dinner?

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.030
That looks edible to me.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.180
They felt, OK, these
people can be friendly.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.690
And then, in 1589, a writer,
named Richard Hakluyt,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.700
published an
enormous book called

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.120
"The Principle Navigations and
Voyages of the English Nation,"

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.360
which was the first
book that really told

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.060
the story of English discovery.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.440
And it was a huge hit.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.830
And it gave the English a
whole new idea of themselves.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.280
They said oh, we can do this.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:01.240
We can be like Spain.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.190
We can go out there and succeed.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:07.810
And from then on every venture
had pamphlets and marketing

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.210
materials.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:15.190
So you can see these development
efforts basically all

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.990
failing for 50 years.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.050
And it sometimes
takes a moment when

00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:25.300
conditions change when suddenly
something can take off.

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.280
So this is the case with
American development.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.530
So after 1600, a
number things changed.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.030
First of all, there
was a great deal

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.070
of knowledge about the
New World by this time,

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.840
and America in particular.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.970
Maps were much more detailed.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.060
So you can see that America
is really starting to fill in.

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.990
You get a real sense
of what it looks like.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:49.090
And along the East Coast in
particular, it's quite detailed

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.800
and along the West
Coast as well.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.300
That's because there
a lot of ships,

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.160
a lot of people
gathering information--

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.640
basically crowdsourcing
information about the coast.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.710
And they understood the
routes to go back and forth.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.150
And then the major
thing that happened

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:09.250
was that Queen Elizabeth died
and King James took over.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:13.690
And Elizabeth had never been
big on American development

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.550
but James was interested.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.030
And he immediately brokered
a peace with Spain.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:20.920
This, you see, is the
peace negotiations

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.590
going on between the
English and the Spanish.

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.270
Suddenly, the American
market opened up

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.960
because the treaty said
it's OK, we can share.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.760
We can go into
each other's ports

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.670
and so there was no
longer this restriction

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.629
against the Americans
sailing to America.

00:25:37.629 --> 00:25:39.670
So another new company
was quickly formed, called

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:40.694
the Virginia Company.

00:25:40.694 --> 00:25:42.610
At that time, the entire
East Coast of America

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.260
was known as Virginia.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.844
And the company
formed two groups

00:25:46.844 --> 00:25:48.760
each one putting together
an American mission.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.640
This is 1606.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.570
They were very different
and the differences

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.790
make it really
clear which one had

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:59.080
learned the lessons of the past
50 years and which one had not.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.300
So the first one, led by
Raleigh Gilbert, sailed north.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.920
They sailed to Maine and
established a settlement

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.180
on the Sagadahoc River,
now known as the Kennebec.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.830
But it was very
military in character.

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.180
The plan was to build a fort.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.070
Here's the plan for the fort.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:19.000
So they were thinking about
military and about armaments.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.020
It was underfunded.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.940
The leadership was
again, not skilled.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.150
The participants had no voice.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:27.640
They had no share in the action.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.260
There was no clear
business plan.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.649
This settlement, known as
the Sagadahoc Settlement,

00:26:31.649 --> 00:26:33.190
just made it through
the first winter

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.090
and then they all went home.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.840
The second group,
led by Thomas Smith,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.420
organized a venture to
the Southern Coast, which

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.340
became known as Jamestown.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.900
And it was very well-funded.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.709
It had good organization.

00:26:45.709 --> 00:26:46.750
It had strong leadership.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.550
There was a business plan.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.560
They developed a code
of law, the first code

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.080
of law developed in America.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.025
They established
a governing body

00:26:55.025 --> 00:26:56.650
called the House of
Burgesses, which is

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.020
self-representive government.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.300
Private ownership
of land was possible

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.500
and there was kind of a
sense of shared purpose.

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.145
It was hardly a utopia but it
was much closer to Commonwealth

00:27:07.145 --> 00:27:08.770
than what they were
used to in England.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:16.450
So that brings us
back to our Pilgrims.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.580
Pilgrims arrive on
Cape Cod in 1620.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:24.350
This is 14 years
after Jamestown.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.240
And that was a
social experiment.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.550
They are to be admired.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.510
But as a business
venture, not so much.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:33.610
They struggled along
for many years.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.560
Other settlements
came in and started

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.772
to succeed, especially the
Massachusetts Bay Company.

00:27:40.772 --> 00:27:42.730
The Pilgrims were never
particularly profitable

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.380
for themselves or
for their investors.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.960
In fact, they did not
earn out, or pay back,

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.680
their loan until 1647.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.190
27 years after they sailed,
which I don't think most VCs

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.560
would be too happy with today.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.350
But the Pilgrims still
get all the attention.

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.046
So why is that?

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:03.170
If you look at this, the
Oxford English Dictionary,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.500
this is today--

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.270
defines the Pilgrim
Fathers as the group

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.350
of English Puritans,
which is not correct,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.350
who set up the colony of
Plymouth, Massachusetts

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.680
and are regarded as the
founders of the United States.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.720
Not just America, but
the United States.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.940
So the OED has it
completely wrong.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.260
So why is this?

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.720
Why did the Pilgrims
become the myth

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.140
and why did Jamestown
not or some other group?

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.712
And the answer is it
was no accident at all.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.170
The Pilgrims actually
only attained

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.890
this kind of status as a myth
until the mid 19th century

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.290
during the pre Civil War days.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:45.400
And they became the symbol
of America's good values

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.670
of inclusion and
tolerance and the south

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:50.850
became the symbol,
Jamestown in particular,

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.820
as America's bad values,
intolerance, and particularly

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:56.690
slavery.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:02.470
So a whole group of Northeastern
intellectuals and others

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.840
mythified the Pilgrims.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.290
This is Daniel Webster.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:15.640
And he mythisized Pilgrims as
the quintessential Americans.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.535
Then we had some
foreigners come along--

00:29:17.535 --> 00:29:19.660
this is Alexis de Tocqueville,
the famous Frenchman

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:22.270
who toured America.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.740
And he wrote about the Pilgrims.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.650
And I'll just read
you what he wrote.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.830
He said, the pilgrims did
not travel to the New World

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.690
in hope of improving
this situation

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.760
or enhancing their wealth.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.680
They tore themselves
away from the pleasures

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.300
of home in obedience to a
purely intellectual need.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.860
Again, completely wrong.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.980
Then, we had songs written--

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.660
"My Country 'Tis of Thee," every
third grade student knows this.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:54.010
Land where my fathers died,
land of the Pilgrims pride.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:55.840
There were big best sellers.

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:59.650
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
wrote a poem to Miles Standish.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:01.885
And he laid on the adjectives.

00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:04.090
The Pilgrims were patient,
they were courageous,

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.560
they were simple,
they were modest,

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.990
they were tender, trusting,
noble, and generous, et cetera.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:11.100
And then came the big clincher.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:15.400
Now this woman is Sarah Hale,
she was a magazine editor.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.370
And she strongly believed
that Thanksgiving,

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.490
which the pilgrims had held in
1621, the first Thanksgiving,

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.860
should become a
national holiday.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:28.060
She saw it as a symbol of
unity and coming together

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.620
of all people in America.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.230
She wrote a succession of
presidents-- five presidents.

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:34.750
She wrote finally to
President Lincoln.

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.150
And this is the letter
that she wrote to Lincoln.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:42.220
And begging him and entreating
him to declare Thanksgiving

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.470
as a national holiday.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.320
And Lincoln finally
in 1863, in the middle

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.570
of the Civil War with a country
torn apart, did exactly that.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.320
He proclaimed it a
national holiday hoping

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.020
to bring Americans together.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.020
And really since
then, Thanksgiving Day

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:03.520
has been seen as a day of unity,
of family, of American values.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.790
And is fittingly surrounded
by commerce of course.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.100
There have been plenty of
dissenters to Thanksgiving.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.214
Of course, you've
got Indians who

00:31:11.214 --> 00:31:12.880
did not see it that
way who described it

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.586
as a day of mourning.

00:31:14.586 --> 00:31:15.960
Catholics were
not happy with it,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.500
they saw it as a
Protestant holiday.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.300
And the South was
not too thrilled

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.599
to be seen as the part of the
country with the bad values.

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:24.640
But the Pilgrims have
really been riding the wave

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:27.010
of Thanksgiving ever since.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:28.810
And in a sense, I
think, of the Pilgrims

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:33.460
as America's first and
most enduring brand.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:39.970
So if you are willing to
entertain the idea of America

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.630
as a big business
startup, then perhaps we

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.690
can take the metaphor
one step further

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.410
and think about what that
means of what we are today.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:52.360
And you could say
that we are a sort

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.660
of the equivalent of a big,
established company in a very

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.820
mature market.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.290
And if you accept that, then we
know the risks of big companies

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.360
in established mature markets.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.940
They can very easily
forget their roots

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.280
as risk takers and innovators.

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.620
They can become risk averse.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.890
They can focus on
maximizing profit above all.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.900
They sometimes lack vision.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.980
They sometimes-- their processes
become cumbersome and slow.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.130
And they can ignore the
importance of social purpose.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:27.730
These are all things that
this group of merchants

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.870
learned over this
70 year period.

00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:32.940
And that's when things
become ripe for disruption.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.600
And that's when
you start to think

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.650
about how appealing it
would be to find and develop

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.610
a New World.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.538
Thank you.

00:32:43.538 --> 00:32:46.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:49.322 --> 00:32:53.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah, from
reading the book,

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.720
this took generations to happen.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.420
And arguably, the more sort
of narrowly business focus

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.990
get rich quick ventures
failed one after the other

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.999
for various reasons.

00:33:05.999 --> 00:33:06.790
JOHN BUTMAN: Right.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:11.770
AUDIENCE: And finally, it took
groups with more cohesion--

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:13.540
a bigger purpose,
more social cohesion

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:16.730
and whatnot to finally succeed.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:23.410
A lot of them with a
strong religious flavor--

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.962
eventually Massachusetts Bay
and others in New England.

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:32.690
So I got kind of a sense
that sort of just business,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.202
or at least a narrow
focus was not sufficient.

00:33:35.202 --> 00:33:36.410
What do you think about that?

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.535
JOHN BUTMAN: I think that's
absolutely right, yeah.

00:33:38.535 --> 00:33:40.780
In fact, that's what I'm
saying about Jamestown

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.830
is that it took them a long time
to realize that you could not

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:50.620
send a group of soldiers
and sailors out who had no--

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.410
could not participate
in profit making

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:57.490
and had no say in what was
going on and expected to work.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.800
It was just too top down.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.667
It was too focused on these
profit making ventures.

00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:05.500
And that's what happened
with the Frobisher,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.150
the sort of gold rush.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.100
So yeah, they
gradually said OK, we

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:13.300
have to allow people to
benefit from these ventures.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.020
They have to have a
voice in the action.

00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.980
So yeah, this idea of shared
purpose, social purpose

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.940
was really important and
totally essential to making

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.620
these business ventures work.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.699
And when I say to people,
think about America

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.159
as a business startup.

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.610
This is very
disturbing to people

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.389
because it goes against this
whole idea of the Pilgrims

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:37.239
and tolerance and
our social purpose.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:39.580
But the only point
is you need both.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:44.020
And that's what they
learned in this period.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.348
But yeah, that's a key point.

00:34:47.348 --> 00:34:47.889
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.366
JOHN BUTMAN: Hi.

00:34:49.366 --> 00:34:51.699
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a
little more about the Pilgrims?

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.000
Like you said they were not
there for religious freedom

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.160
and it's all a myth.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.740
What was the story
of the Pilgrims?

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.450
JOHN BUTMAN: Well,
so the Pilgrims,

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.780
they lived in
Holland for 10 years

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.620
and they had religious
freedom in Holland.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.230
In fact, that was
not their problem.

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.080
They were very free to worship
in any way they wanted.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.320
The issue was that they
were basically ex-pats,

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.200
they were strangers
in this society.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.850
And they saw that
they could never

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:24.790
really climb the social scale.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:26.410
So they worked in
menial jobs-- they

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:29.620
worked in the cloth industry,
there were some in publishing.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.840
But they felt that they
weren't getting anywhere.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.298
They also felt that they were
losing their cultural values.

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:36.560
So their kids, you know they
were there for 10 years.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.890
And their kids started
to become very Dutch

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.690
and this was upsetting to them.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.290
So they said, we're kind
of losing our identity.

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.129
They couldn't go
back to England.

00:35:46.129 --> 00:35:47.420
They actually had other offers.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.840
They got an offer from
the Dutch to settled

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.870
in New York, which sounded
like a pretty good deal.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:55.870
But they rejected that when they
thought about moving elsewhere

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:56.770
in Europe.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.740
But they finally made
this pretty bold decision

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.540
to come to America.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:06.580
But the key point there is
that it wasn't a wilderness.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:09.040
It wasn't like there
was nobody here.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.750
There was a lot of
trade back and forth.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:12.280
Jamestown was established.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.230
They felt they could
easily get to Jamestown.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.271
They actually wanted to--

00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:18.100
they talked about settling
closer to Jamestown originally.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.690
So that they-- for
the very reason,

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:23.680
they would have other people
to connect with, you know?

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.450
So it is a bold move,
there's no question.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:30.520
But it wasn't about
religious freedom.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:32.920
Plus, they didn't
have the cash to fund

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.650
themselves to hire a ship.

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.540
And that's why they had
a joint-stock company

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.710
behind them.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.980
They made a very,
very bad deal that

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:44.380
required them to work seven
days a week until they paid back

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.340
the debt.

00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.795
Does that answer your question?

00:36:48.795 --> 00:36:50.070
Yeah.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.180
AUDIENCE: Like with any
sort of business venture,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.880
I'm curious whether after
the initial sort of success

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.890
of settling in the
Americas, was that sort

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:01.260
of like a huge bubble--

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.480
you know, an America bubble
which eventually burst?

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.570
And how did sort of the
ongoing investment dynamic

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:10.022
work after the initial
settlement and you know,

00:37:10.022 --> 00:37:12.230
leading I guess, all the
way to the Revolutionary War

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:14.025
where I guess things
were disrupted?

00:37:14.025 --> 00:37:15.774
JOHN BUTMAN: Yeah, so
two things happened.

00:37:15.774 --> 00:37:19.920
One is that after the pilgrims
and after Jamestown found

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.490
tobacco, which was
their big product,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.050
there was a bubble
of colonial activity

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.650
and not just from the English,
but also from the French

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.940
and from the Dutch.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.640
So you see the Dutch in New
York and you see the French

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:33.732
in Canada.

00:37:33.732 --> 00:37:35.190
And suddenly, all
these settlements

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:36.450
are coming in to New England.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:37.860
So there's a lot of activity.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:41.310
And the Pilgrims figured
out how to do fur trade.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.630
So they were sustainable.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.570
They didn't make a lot of money
but they were sustainable.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.020
So yeah, suddenly
it was possible.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:50.170
They knew how to do it.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:51.253
They knew what you needed.

00:37:51.253 --> 00:37:53.760
They knew how many people
you needed, how much money.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.075
They figured out the
sort of fur trade

00:37:56.075 --> 00:37:57.450
and they had a
lot of other ideas

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:01.344
for commerce that didn't work
out but fur was the basic one.

00:38:01.344 --> 00:38:02.760
And they also went
back to fishing

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.260
because fishing was
a very reliable.

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:07.300
Fishing was great in New
England, especially in Maine.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.280
So that's one thing.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.090
But they also eventually
made it to the Far East.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.590
So you see the English
starting to trade

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.660
to get to the Far East.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.490
So now you've got
another source of income.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:22.140
So the investors put together
basically a portfolio

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.730
of investment.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.206
So they've got some
investments in America,

00:38:25.206 --> 00:38:27.330
they've got some investments
in the Far East trade.

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:33.140
They're still selling in
to the continental markets

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.860
and they probably
own some fishing.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.210
So they put together a
series of investments.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:39.330
Some are high risk and
some are not so high risk.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:41.070
So yeah, they start
to make money.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.370
But the early ones really did
not make any money at all.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.150
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
they'll ever sort of rewrite

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:52.390
the story of the Pilgrims so
that we can get it correct

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.715
and teach it correctly?

00:38:53.715 --> 00:38:55.090
JOHN BUTMAN: Teach
our children--

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:55.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.940
JOHN BUTMAN: --well?

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.290
Well, that's our plan for
that our next book actually.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.185
It's funny because the
literature about the Pilgrims

00:39:05.185 --> 00:39:06.060
is quite interesting.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.820
So the most recent one
is Nathaniel Philbrick

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.770
wrote a book called "Mayflower."

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:14.910
And he takes the
Pilgrims from 1620 up

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:18.540
through the King Philip's
War, which is 1675.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.840
But he basically retells
the story as they told it.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.670
Just saying this part of
it isn't so well known.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:30.350
He doesn't really sort of
reframe it the way we have.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:34.810
So it's interesting
because over the years,

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.914
especially in this
19th century period,

00:39:36.914 --> 00:39:39.330
Pilgrims have become the vessel
to be filled with whatever

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:41.570
story you want to tell.

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:43.980
But I think it's really
important to retell it now

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:46.560
in this way because, to
me, it says a lot about how

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.130
we got to where we are.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.130
So that's what we're
going to try to do, yeah.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:51.630
AUDIENCE: There's
another thing that

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.620
struck me reading the book
is that this took generations

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:01.070
and it could have happened
almost 100 years earlier

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.122
with the right people and so on.

00:40:03.122 --> 00:40:04.830
Do you think that's
true or did it really

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.485
need to take that long?

00:40:07.485 --> 00:40:10.110
JOHN BUTMAN: Well, it certainly
could of because of the Spanish

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:13.290
were in the West Indies from
the beginning of you know,

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.600
1512 they go in to Mexico.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.100
So it certainly
could have happened.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.850
But the Spanish are
much better sea-goers.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:22.860
They had better ships and they
had a very different attitude.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.850
So it's the whole
big discussion here

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:31.950
is the relationship of Europeans
to local indigenous cultures.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:36.240
And the Spanish basically just
went in and marauded and killed

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.470
and subjugated and took over
in the West Indies and Mexico

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.910
and South America.

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.160
And the English very,
very consciously

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.350
said, we don't want
to do it that way.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.670
We want to behave differently.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.460
And in fact, in his
early years, they did.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.860
And although they did
kidnap Inuits and Indians

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.770
and bring them back
to England, they also

00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:59.760
returned them to America.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.720
And the relationship
was very different.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.620
And they didn't really
have this religious purpose

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.500
that the Spanish had.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.080
So yeah, it could
have been done.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:13.410
But England was just-- they
were just really far behind.

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:15.690
Something about
England just hadn't

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:20.402
gotten there yet whereas the
Portuguese and the Spanish had.

00:41:20.402 --> 00:41:21.360
But there's no reason--

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.390
I mean, America yeah, there's
no reason they couldn't have.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:24.510
AUDIENCE: Of course
one could also

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.280
argue that the Spanish
and the Portuguese

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.040
did have one of those rare
get rich quick successes.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.981
There was gold lying around.

00:41:30.981 --> 00:41:31.730
JOHN BUTMAN: Yeah.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:32.460
AUDIENCE: It might have--

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.418
JOHN BUTMAN: What's
intriguing though is if you

00:41:34.418 --> 00:41:37.090
read about how it turned out--

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:40.830
in fact, having this enormous
stream of gold and silver

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:44.670
coming into Spain
ruined them basically.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:50.070
Because King Philip said I
can prosecute any war I want.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.870
I can do anything I want to.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.380
Spent lots and lots of money--

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.250
they actually declared
bankruptcy at one point.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:59.010
And it didn't do them
any good in the long run.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.110
And the English--
it was good in a way

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:04.800
that they saw this example
and that they once sort of

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.240
said, let's go get this
gold mine didn't work.

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.827
And then they sort of
focused on other things.

00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:10.660
Thank you very much.

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:11.410
Thanks for coming.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:14.450
[APPLAUSE]
