00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.002
NARRATOR: Sirpur, India.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.589
The Surang Tila temple.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.428
This structure, which dates
back to the seventh century AD,

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.263
was recently
unearthed after being

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.598
buried by a powerful
earthquake that

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:19.394
occurred in the 11th century.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:22.397
Although the rest of the
area was completely leveled,

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:27.569
the structure itself
remained largely intact.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.821
Archaeologists
suggest that this is

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.490
due to the advanced
construction techniques,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.994
known as Ayurvedic or
Vedic architecture,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.581
utilized by its builders.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.958
The principles they
used are derived

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.462
from the ancient science of
design that can be traced back

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:46.838
to the ancient Indian texts.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:54.596
In March 2017, researcher and
ancient astronaut theorist,

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:57.724
Giorgio Tsoukalos,
traveled to India

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.226
to meet with
archaeologist, Dr. Arun

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.896
Sharma, who headed the dig.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.522
This is beautiful.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.251
Really?

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.296
Now is this considered Ayurvedic
architecture right here?

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.478
That's amazing.
Huh.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.984
OK.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.319
NARRATOR: Although
much of the site

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.405
has been renovated
using modern concrete,

00:01:54.405 --> 00:01:57.367
blocks held together
by the Ayurvedic paste

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:58.368
can still be found.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.087
It seems to be almost
like some type of glue.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.605
NARRATOR: The
glue-like substance

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.733
is said to form a bond
that is at least 20

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:33.236
times stronger than concrete.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:36.072
But modern builders have
been unwilling to entertain

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:39.200
the notion that such
an ancient concoction

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.203
could be superior to
today's building materials.

00:02:42.203 --> 00:02:44.205
Wow, look at this.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:45.456
Beautiful.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.167
NARRATOR: The
detailed instructions

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.753
for making this paste can be
found in an ancient Indian text

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:54.757
known as the "Mayamatam,"
a manuscript dedicated

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:57.176
to construction techniques.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.221
The information contained
within the document

00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.308
is understood to have
been passed down to humans

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:07.937
from Mayasura, the ancient king
of the demi-gods, who was said

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:11.816
to oversee various
construction projects on Earth,

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:15.778
including cities in the sky.

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:19.198
Curiously, there is a more
astounding earthquake-proof

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.576
feature at the site,
which indicates

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:26.414
that advanced knowledge was
used in its construction.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:30.501
Located at key points within
the Surang Tila temple

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.796
are several 80-foot
long shafts, designed

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:36.424
to form air pockets
that can dissipate

00:03:36.424 --> 00:03:38.134
the impact of seismic events.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.893
Yes please.

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:48.853
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: All right.

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:51.230
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Wow.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.774
Oh wow, this is big.

00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.192
It's a huge book.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:04:04.661
And this text has been
around for 4,500 years.

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.497
In your opinion, where did
this knowledge come from?

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:22.845
And you think
that this knowledge

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:23.930
originated from the stars?

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.728
It's amazing.

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.772
NARRATOR: According
to the Hindu faithful,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:36.693
the construction techniques
used at the Surang Tila temple

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:40.363
are just one example of
advanced technology detailed

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:43.241
in the ancient Sanskrit texts.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.327
Other works are said
to contain information

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:51.165
far beyond the scope
of early man, perhaps

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:55.878
even providing concrete proof
of extraterrestrial activity

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:56.879
on earth.
